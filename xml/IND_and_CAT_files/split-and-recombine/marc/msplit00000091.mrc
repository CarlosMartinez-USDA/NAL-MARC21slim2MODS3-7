In this study, we used a stable cell line that expresses a luciferase reporter gene driven by an SRE-containing fatty acid synthase promoter to identify allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), one of the major isothiocyanates in cruciferous vegetables, as a novel SREBP inactivator. We found that AITC downregulated the proteolytic processing of SREBPs and the expression of their target genes in human hepatoma Huh-7 cells. Furthermore, AITC reduced the de novo synthesis of both fatty acids and cholesterol. Our results indicate a novel physiological function of AITC in lipid metabolism regulation.  aPublisher supplied data  a15H05781a24580175a25126703cJSPS KAKENHI 3aBrassicaceae 3aallyl isothiocyanate 3abiotechnology 3acell lines 3acholesterol 3afatty acids 3afatty-acid synthase 3ahepatoma 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3alipid metabolism 3aluciferase 3aproteolysis 3areporter genes 0afatty acid 0aSREBP1 aInoue, Jun1 aShimizu, Makoto1 aSatō, Ryūichirō,0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2016 May 3, v. 80, no. 5 p.1006-1011dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2015.11321543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002200136245009600158300001600254520165300270592002801923653002301951653002401974653002201998653002002020700002002040700001502060773015502075856007002230852000902300655001202309IND60131652420221119082605.0151127e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013165242DNAL7 a10.1638/03-1072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCain, Danielle K.10aPlasma biochemistry reference values of wild-caught southern stingrays (dasyatis americana)  ap. 471-476.  aStingrays are prominent marine animals; however, there are few published reference values for their blood chemistry and hematology. Twenty-eight southern stingrays (Dasyatis americana) were caught using the bottom trawl nets of fishery-independent boats operated by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources during June and July 2002 from Winyah Bay, South Carolina, to St. Augustine, Florida. Median values of blood and plasma obtained from live animals promptly after capture are as follows: packed cell volume == 0.22 L/L (22%%), total solids (TS) == 56.5 g/L (5.65 g/dl), total protein (TP) == 26 g/L (2.6 g/dl), sodium == 315 mmol/L, potassium == 4.95 mmol/L, chloride == 342 mmol/L, calcium == 4.12 mmol/L (16.5 mg/dl), phosphorus == 1.5 mmol/L (4.7 mg/dl), urea nitrogen == 444 mmol/L (1,243 mg/dl), glucose == 1.69 mmol/L (30 mg/dl), aspartate aminotransferase == 14.5 U/L, creatine phosphokinase == 80.5 U/L, osmolality == 1065 mOsm/kg, and lactate == 3.1 mmol/L. Bicarbonate was less than the low end of the instrument range (5 mmol/L) in all but three samples. Anion gap was negative in all samples. Albumin was less than the low end of the instrument range (1 g/dl) in all except one sample. Osmolality was significantly higher in the rays caught in the southern region. TS and TP values were linearly related to each other, and the equation for the fitted line is TS == (11.61 ×× TP) ++ 25.4 (in g/L) [[or TS == (1.161 ×× TP) ++ 2.54 (in g/dl)]]. The reference ranges reported in this study can be used to aid in the management of aquarium stingrays and to create a baseline for health monitoring of the wild Dasyatis spp.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDasyatis americana 0aplasma biochemistry 0asouthern stingray 0areference range1 aHarms, Craig A.1 aSegars, Al0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2004 Dec., v. 35, no. 4 p.471-476dAmerican Association of Zoo VeterinarianswJournal:jnl43569x1937-28257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638/03-1073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008100169300001600250520179200266592002802058650001402086650001302100650002702113650001702140650001702157650001602174650002702190650001402217650002102231650001802252650000902270650000702279650001602286650001602302650002502318700002502343773009602368856008602464852000902550655001202559IND60577523320221118012137.0170809e20160202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057752332DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b035562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiao-Yan10aChitosan-Based Conventional and Pickering Emulsions with Long-Term Stability  ap. 929-936.  aChitosan-based conventional and Pickering oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions with very fine droplet size (volume average diameter, dᵥ, as low as 1.7 μm) and long-term stability (up to 5 months) were ultrasonically generated at different pH values without the addition of any surfactant or cross-linking agent. The ultrasonication treatment was found to break and disperse chitosan agglomerates effectively (particularly at pH ≥ 4.5) and also reduce the chitosan molecular weight, benefiting its emulsification properties. The emulsion stability and emulsion type could be controlled by chitosan solution pH. Increasing pH from 3.5 to 5.5 led to the formation of conventional emulsions with decreasing droplet size (dᵥ from 14 to 2.1 μm) and increasing emulsion stability (from a few days to 2 months). These results can be explained by the increase of dynamic interfacial pressure, which results from the conformation transition of chitosan molecules from an extended state to a more flexible structure as pH increases. At pH = 6.5 (the acid dissociation constant (pKₐ) of chitosan), the chitosan molecules self-assembled into well-dispersed nanoparticles (dᵥ = 82.1 nm) with the assistance of ultrasonication, which resulted in a Pickering emulsion with the smallest droplet size (dᵥ = 1.7 μm) and highest long-term stability (up to 5 months) because of the presence of chitosan solid nanoparticles at the oil/water interface. The key originality of this study is the elucidation of the role of pH in the formation of conventional and Pickering chitosan-based O/W emulsions with the assistance of ultrasonication. Our results suggest that chitosan possesses great potential to be used as an effective pH-controlled emulsifier and stabilizer without the need of other additives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3achitosan 3across-linking reagents 3adissociation 3adroplet size 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsifying properties 3aemulsions 3amolecular weight 3ananoparticles 3aoils 3apH 3astabilizers 3asurfactants 3aultrasonic treatment1 aHeuzey, Marie-Claude0 tLangmuir.g2016 Feb. 02, v. 32, no. 4 p.929-936dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.5b035563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245009000177500001400267520092900281592002801210650003001238650001301268650002501281650002501306650002801331650002901359650001201388650001501400650001601415650001501431650001801446651001101464653002201475653001901497653002901516653003001545653003001575653002601605653002001631653000801651653000801659653000801667700002401675700002001699773010201719856008701821852000901908655001201917IND60700788720221121084602.0200808e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070078872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2020.1067222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelindi-Ghidi, Paolo10aUsing environmental knowledge brokers to promote deep green agri-environment measures  aNAL-light  aIntermediary organisations have increasingly played a role in payments for agri-environment services across Europe over the last two decades. However, the economics literature has so far not examined the impact of this new governance mechanism on environmental protection and on individuals' behaviour. We develop a new theoretical economic framework to compare an incentive mechanism using intermediaries, such as environmental knowledge brokers and information providers, with a standard central governance mechanism, in terms of environmental impact. We show that the emergence of knowledge intermediaries is particularly effective where farmers initially have low environmental awareness, or when the public institution organising the scheme is insufficiently aware of individuals' characteristics. Our findings provide theoretical support for previous empirical results on payment schemes for agri-environment measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagri-environmental policy 3abehavior 3aecological economics 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental knowledge 3aenvironmental protection 3afarmers 3agovernance 3ainformation 3aliterature 3aorganizations 3aEurope 0aKnowledge brokers 0aIntermediaries 0aNon-profit organisations 0aPro-environmental culture 0aAgri-environment measures 0aCultural transmission 0aPrincipal-agent 0aQ51 0aQ58 0aZ191 aDedeurwaerdere, Tom1 aFabbri, Giorgio0 tEcological economics.g2020 Oct., v. 176 p.106722-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2020.1067223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006100152245009100213500001900304520137600323592002801699650001501727650001501742650002301757650002101780650001401801650001301815650003101828650001801859650001901877650001601896650001301912650001401925650002301939650001301962653003201975653001102007653002102018653002102039700002102060773010602081856008702187852000902274655001202283IND60713985120221119053402.0210408e20210120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071398512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1256572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZambare, Rahul S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1024-325210aIonic liquid-modified graphene oxide sponge for hexavalent chromium removal from water  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aChromium pollution in groundwater is a major cause of concern due to significant health risks of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) ions. Graphene oxide (GO) covalently modified with 1-aminopropyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (mimNH₂) and freeze-dried to give 1-aminopropyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide functionalized graphene oxide sponge (mimGO sponge). mimGO sponge effectively adsorbed hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI), toxic) by electrostatic interactions and reduced Cr(VI) to trivalent chromium (Cr(III), less toxic) by an indirect mechanism with the contribution of delocalized π-electrons on the six-membered aromatic ring of mimGO sponge. The change in contact time, adsorbent loading, initial Cr(VI) solution concentration, and different types of adsorbents were investigated. The experimental data were fitted to the pseudo-second order kinetic model, which showed hydro-chromate adsorption on mimGO sponge was surface adsorption with chemical interaction. The adsorption process was well-defined by the Langmuir isotherm model, and equilibrium adsorption capacity was 208.3 mg/g at 23 ℃ in an acidic environment. The electrostatic interaction between the chromate ions and mimGO sponge also caused a reduction of Cr(VI) to less benign Cr(III) on the adsorbent surface. Thus, mimGO sponge has a green adsorbent that showed the potential for Cr(VI) removal from water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaromatic compounds 3achemical bonding 3achromates 3achromium 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afreeze drying 3agraphene oxide 3agroundwater 3akinetics 3apollution 3asorption isotherms 3atoxicity 0aIonic liquid-graphene oxide 0asponge 0achromium removal 0aCr(VI) reduction1 aNemade, Parag R.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Jan. 20, v. 609 p.125657-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1256573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014700166300001800313520145300331592002801784650001201812650001101824650001501835650000901850650001201859650000901871650003301880650001301913650001001926650001101936650001401947650001401961650000901975650001301984650002001997650001502017651001302032700002202045700002402067773011602091856008102207852000902288655001202297IND60440609320221122230916.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044060932DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4283-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFedotov, A.

The increase in the δ¹⁸O values, a high content of Br, and a low percentage of clay particles were found to positively correspond with high lake bio-productivity and “warm” marine isotope stages (MIS-3, 5, 7, and 9) and visa versa during “cold” MIS-stages. Positive δ¹³C values have been linked with high inflowing dissolved inorganic carbonates, and forest-steppe vegetation seems to be evidenced during “cold” MIS stages (MIS-2, 4, 6, and 8). Sharp depletions in the δ¹⁸O values on 1.5–2.5 ‰ occurring during the ends of MIS-6 and MIS-4 could be induced by glacier meltwater discharge into Lake Khubsugul. However, shifts in the δ¹⁸O values were not significant in MIS-2 and MIS-8, based on our assumption that the inflow rates of glacier meltwater were low due to the relatively small sizes of glaciers in the NM during these stages. During MIS-2, Northern Mongolian glaciers were the smallest in sizes due to high regional aridity. The climate condition in MIS-3 was not typically favorable for a “warm” MIS-stage, while glaciers or snow patches formed in MIS-4 most likely were still in the NM. As a result, isotopically depleted δ¹⁸O meltwater was supplied into Lake Khubsugul at the period.  aPublisher supplied data 3abromine 3acarbon 3acarbonates 3aclay 3aclimate 3acold 3adry environmental conditions 3aglaciers 3alakes 3aoxygen 3aparticles 3asediments 3asnow 3asnowmelt 3astable isotopes 3avegetation 3aMongolia1 aIgnat’ev, A.

However, coastal wetlands are usually located in largely modified and densely populated landscapes. Hence their restoration may conflict with cultural values. Therefore, considering the cultural dimension of ER is a way of increasing public acceptance of restoration projects. In this study, we assessed the public acceptance of a restoration project in a coastal wetland of Costa Brava (Spain). We combined the ES framework with a cultural approach, which is capable of considering interdisciplinarity, introducing barely assessed services like tranquility and facilitating further integration of the human dimension in the ES framework. We administered an open‐ended questionnaire to 232 visitors and the answers were submitted to a content analysis to get a post hoc classification of services and values. Our results show that visitors undervalue environmental values, while tranquility is the most commonly stated value. Moreover, place attachment is found to be the main driver to influence the perception of the ER. The study concluded that the project enjoys a high public acceptance. However, some disengagement exists between the goals of restoration and visitors’ perceptions, and this needs to be addressed. Sharing the decision‐making power with stakeholders and informing visitors about ES that are not easily perceived could be appropriate steps to take.  aPublisher supplied data  aFPU13/00663cMinisterio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte  aCSO2010‐17488cSecretaría de Estado de Investigación, Desarrollo e Innovación 3acultural values 3adecision making 3aecological restoration 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3alandscapes 3aquestionnaires 3astakeholders 3awetlands 3aSpain1 aRibas, Anna1 aFraguell, Rosa M.0 tRestoration ecology.g2019 May, v. 27, no. 3 p.626-637dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867104x1061-29717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.128963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02081naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245007500175300001600250520085400266592002801120650004401148650002201192650001501214650002001229650001301249650001901262650001801281650002201299650002401321650003301345650001901378650001701397650001301414700001501427700002001442773012301462856008901585852000901674655001201683IND60543409320221119093734.0190410e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054340932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2015.03.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKariminezhad, H.10aNanosized ZSM-5 will improve photodynamic therapy using Methylene blue  ap. 107-112.  aNowadays, nanotechnology is growing to improve Photodynamic Therapy and reduce its side effects.

Conservation efforts are currently directed at reintroducing these marsupials into predator-proof enclosures and habitats in historical distribution ranges on the mainland in the southwest of Western Australia and in South Australia. In September 2000, 19 western barred bandicoots were captured on Bernier Island for translocation, and 11 of these had evidence of at least one of the following eye conditions: corneal opacity, conjunctivitis, ocular discharge, and blepharitis. Five bandicoots were examined, and conjunctival and cloacal swabs were collected. Polymerase chain reaction for Chlamydiales was positive in four bandicoots. Four Chlamydiales types were identified by gene sequencing, including a strain of Chlamydia pecorum different from strains previously found in koalas and several new Chlamydiales genotypes. The bandicoots responded excellently to treatment with oxytetracyline weekly for 6 wk, and topical oxytetracycline and neomycin were administered topically to both eyes s.i.d. for 4 mo.  aPublisher supplied data 0aOcular chlamydiosis 0aChlamydiales 0awestern barred bandicoot 0aPerameles bougainville1 aSwan, Ralph1 aBodetti, Tracey1 aFriend, J.

We combine an extensive soil profile database with the Harmonized World Soil Database, a 30arcsecond raster database of soil information worldwide, and describe a statistical process to identify representative soil profiles for each of its 188 distinct soil types at different spatial resolutions. We then outline a method to cluster the soils in the Harmonized World Soil Database to produce soil maps at coarser resolution, and we describe derived global soil maps at spatial resolutions of 5 and 10arcmin, which may be more practical for some large-scale modelling studies. The derived data files allow a user to select any point or area on land and then to access the set of soil profiles pertaining to the mapping unit selected, which are available in a format suitable for use in modelling applications. In situations where the user has little or no other information about the soils in the region of study, the methods described can be used to produce plausible soil profile information based on the most up-to-date global soil map currently available.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3amodels 3asoil map 3asoil profiles 3asoil types 0aWISE 3.1 0aSoil profile 0aDSSAT 0aCluster 0aMarkSimGCM 0aCMIP51 aThornton, Philip K.0 tAgricultural systems.g2015 Oct., v. 139 p.93-99dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2015.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010000165300001600265500001900281520179400300592002802094650001702122650001502139650001702154650001302171650001502184650002302199650002602222650001802248650002302266650001702289650000802306653002902314653001702343653002102360700001602381773011902397856008302516852000902599655001202608IND60700789020221121063231.0201024e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070078902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2020.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Xiaohui10aRecent developments in vibrational spectroscopic techniques for tea quality and safety analyses  ap. 163-176.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTea is one of the most popular beverages around the world for its health benefit. The availability of rapid and reliable techniques for evaluating tea quality and safety is important for the tea industry. However, tea components and pesticide residues detection, sensory analysis, grading, and pricing are carried out by laborious, time-consuming, and destructive methods. Therefore, vibrational spectroscopy has emerged as an increasingly popular technology in tea quality and safety evaluation owing to its simple, nondestructive and rapid detection procedures.The current review compares the employment of different vibrational spectroscopic techniques including near-infrared (NIR), mid-infrared (MIR), Raman, Terahertz (THz) spectroscopies and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in tandem with regression and classification models in the quantitative and qualitative analyses of tea quality and safety. Furthermore, band assignments of tea components based on these spectroscopies are summarized.NIR spectroscopy dominates the applications of vibrational spectroscopy in the evaluation of tea quality, while only one study is related to THz spectroscopy. Raman technology is mainly applied to detect pesticide residues. HSI providing both spectral and spatial information has a potential in the optimization of the tea production process. Additionally, regression models find widespread use in the quantitative analysis of tea, such as phenolics, flavonoids, pigments, sensory evaluation, and pesticide residues, while classification models are useful for discriminating geographical origins, varieties, and fermentation degrees. The online detection of tea quality and safety by vibrational spectroscopy on the industrial scale is still an important and challenging task for future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3afermentation 3aflavonoids 3afood science 3aindustry 3apesticides 3aphenolic compounds 3aquantitative analysis 3arapid methods 3asensory evaluation 3aspatial data 3atea 0aVibrational spectroscopy 0aChemometrics 0aBand assignments1 aSun, Da-Wen0 tTrends in food science & technology.g2020 Oct., v. 104 p.163-176dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2020.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01651naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002100136245007900157300001600236520068200252592002800934653003200962653002800994653001501022653002401037700001601061700001501077700002301092773015501115856007001270852000901340655001201349IND60131653020221119082630.0151127e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013165302DNAL7 a10.1638/03-0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKik, Maria J.

Adjustments of the photosynthetic apparatus to changes in light environment involve biophysical, biochemical, and structural adjustments. We used electron micrographs to assess overall thylakoid grana structure in evergreen species that exhibit much stronger maximal levels of thermal energy dissipation than the more commonly studied annual species. Our findings indicate an association between partial or complete unstacking of thylakoid grana structure and strong reversible thermal energy dissipation that, in contrast to what has been reported for annual species with much lower maximal levels of energy dissipation, is similar to what is seen under photoinhibitory conditions. For a tropical evergreen with tall grana stacks, a loosening, or vertical unstacking, of grana was seen in sun-grown plants exhibiting pronounced pH-dependent, rapidly reversible thermal energy dissipation as well as for sudden low-to-high-light transfer of shade-grown plants that responded with photoinhibition, characterized by strong dark-sustained, pH-independent thermal energy dissipation and photosystem II (PSII) inactivation. On the other hand, full-sun exposed subalpine confers with rather short grana stacks transitioned from autumn to winter via conversion of most thylakoids from granal to stromal lamellae concomitant with photoinhibitory photosynthetic inactivation and sustained thermal energy dissipation. We propose that these two types of changes (partial or complete unstacking of grana) in thylakoid arrangement are both associated with the strong non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of chlorophyll fluorescence (a measure of photoprotective thermal energy dissipation) unique to evergreen species rather than with PSII inactivation per se.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aautotrophs 3aautumn 3achlorophyll 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3agrana 3aleaves 3alight intensity 3apH 3aphotoinhibition 3aphotosystem II 3athylakoids1 aMuller, Onno1 aStewart, Jared J.1 aCohu, Christopher M.1 aAdams, William W.0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2015 Nov., v. 152 p.357-366dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2015.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245012700172300001600299520162500315592002801940650001101968650002101979650000802000650002502008650001502033650001602048650001302064650002002077650002202097650002202119650001302141650002002154650001202174650001302186650001402199650001202213653001502225653001602240653002502256653002502281653002102306653004102327653002302368700001602391700001602407700001502423700001702438700001302455700001302468773008902481856008602570852000902656655001202665IND60600253920221119070522.0180703e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060025392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2013.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Xian-Chun10aGenome-wide search and comparative genomic analysis of the trypsin inhibitor-like cysteine-rich domain-containing peptides  ap. 106-114.  aIt was shown that peptides containing trypsin inhibitor-like cysteine-rich (TIL) domain are able to inhibit proteinase activities, and thus play important roles in various biological processes, such as immune response and anticoagulation. However, only a limited number of the TIL peptides have been identified and characterized so far; and little has been known about the evolutionary relationships of the genes encoding the TIL peptides. BmKAPi is a TIL domain-containing peptide that was identified from Mesobuthus martensii Karsch. Here, we conducted genome-wide searches for new peptides that are homologous to BmKAPi or possess a cysteine pattern similar to that of BmKAPi. As a result, we identified a total of 80 different TIL peptides from 34 species of arthropods. We found that these peptides can be classified into seven evolutionarily distinct groups. Furthermore, we cloned the genomic sequence of BmKAPi; the genomic sequences of the majority of other TIL peptides were also identified from the GenBank database using bioinformatical approaches. Through phylogenetic and comparative genomic analysis, we found 26 cases of intron gain events occurred in the genes of the TIL peptides; however, no instances of intron loss were observed. Moreover, we found that alternative splicing contributes to the diversification of the TIL peptides. It is interesting to see that four genes of the TIL domain-containing peptides overlap in a DNA region located on the chromosome LG B15 of Bombus terretris. These data suggest that the evolution of the TIL peptide genes are dynamic, which was dominated by intron gain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombus 3aButhus martensii 3aDNA 3aalternative splicing 3aarthropods 3achromosomes 3acysteine 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3agenetic databases 3agenomics 3aimmune response 3aintrons 3apeptides 3aphylogeny 3atrypsin 0aTIL domain 0aIntron gain 0aGenomic organization 0aAlternative splicing 0aOverlapping gene 0aScorpion Mesobuthus martensii Karsch 0aProtease inhibitor1 aLiu, Yichen1 aShi, Wanxia1 aZhang, Lei1 aLuo, Xuesong1 aNie, Yao1 aYang, Ye0 tPeptides.g2014 Mar., v. 53 p.106-114dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11832x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2013.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03805naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245016800169300002000337520193900357592002802296650002102324650002702345650002502372650002602397650002502423650001802448650001602466650002402482650002302506650001302529650001502542650001402557650002302571650001802594650001402612650001902626650002002645650002102665650001702686650001802703650001502721650001202736650001002748650002102758650001402779650001302793650001302806650001102819650002502830650001402855700002702869700002302896700002502919773015502944856008303099852000903182655001203191IND60777731020221121021507.0220520e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077773102DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-18358-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarouk, Sameh M.10aComparative immunomodulatory efficacy of rosemary and fenugreek against Escherichia coli infection via suppression of inflammation and oxidative stress in broilers  ap. 40053-40067.  aBroiler chickens are frequently infected with Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria, which often leads to the emergence of many diseases and high economic losses. Hence, the current study was conducted to assess the relative efficacy of dietary rosemary and fenugreek, under E. coli infection in broilers and their ability to replace antimicrobials without any loss of productivity or negative influence on broiler health, via evaluation of growth performance, biochemical indices, immune response and histo-morphological changes. Eighty Cobb broilers were allotted to four equal groups (n = 20 chicks/group): control non-infected (CN), control infected (CI), rosemary infected (RI) and fenugreek infected (FI) groups. The RI and FI groups revealed a significant elevation in their body weight and body weight gain compared with the CI group. However, both groups showed a significant decline in serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase activities, as well as uric acid and creatinine levels. A significant decrease in total antioxidant capacity, catalase and superoxide dismutase activities was noted among CI chicks. Moreover, distinctly higher activities were evident in both RI and FI groups. Assessment of immunomodulatory markers showed a significant increase in immunoglobulin G along with a significant decline in interleukin-6 level in both RI and FI groups, with the lowest IL-6 value within FI group. Histopathological evaluations focused on the deleterious effect associated with E. coli infection of broilers’ liver, kidney, intestine, spleen, bursa of Fabricius and thymus. Partial histological improvement was noticed among RI group, and nearly normal tissues were recorded in FI group. Overall, the obtained findings suggest the ability of fenugreek to mitigate the adverse effects of E. coli infection on broiler performance and tissue profiles, by improving the general health status of the broiler chickens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aEscherichia infections 3aalanine transaminase 3aanti-infective agents 3aantioxidant activity 3aaspartic acid 3ablood serum 3abody weight changes 3abursa of Fabricius 3acatalase 3acreatinine 3afenugreek 3agrowth performance 3ahealth status 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3aintestines 3akidneys 3aliver 3aoxidative stress 3apollution 3aresearch 3arosemary 3aspleen 3asuperoxide dismutase 3auric acid1 aAbdel-Rahman, Haidy G.1 aAbdallah, Osama A.1 aEL-Behidy, Nashwa G.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 June, v. 29, no. 26 p.40053-40067dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-18358-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02106naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245006600171300001800237520094600255592002801201650001401229650001501243650001101258650001601269650001501285650001501300650000901315650001701324650001501341650002201356650002401378650001601402700002401418700002401442700002301466700002301489700002101512773009401533856004801627852000901675655001201684IND50059814020221119055310.0121102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005981402DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-012-9216-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlberici, Rosana M.10aUsed Frying Oil: A Proper Feedstock for Biodiesel Production?  ap. 1002-1008.  aUsed frying oil seems to be an economically viable and environmentally attractive alternative for biodiesel production, but the acceptance and successful use of this and other biodiesels obtained from waste materials require careful evaluation of its fuel properties and impurities. Herein, we show that biodiesel made from used frying soybean oil display overall quality comparable to those obtained from the fresh oil as measured by standard parameters of fuel quality such as induction period, acid number, heat of combustion, and iodine value as well as at the molecular level via profiles of intact and oxidized fatty acid methyl esters. These profiles were obtained directly from the biodiesel samples by easy ambient sonic spray ionization mass spectrometry. An artificial antioxidant, N,N′-di-sec-butyl-p-phenylenediamine, was shown to significantly increase the oxidative stability of the used frying oil biodiesel at trace level.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3acombustion 3aesters 3afatty acids 3afeedstocks 3afrying oil 3aheat 3aiodine value 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3aoxidative stability 3asoybean oil1 ade Souza, Vanderlea1 ade Sá, Gilberto F.1 aMorelli, Sidney R.1 aEberlin, Marcos N.1 aDaroda, Romeu J.0 tBioEnergy research.g2012 Dec., v. 5, no. 4 p.1002-1008dSpringer-Verlagx1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-012-9216-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03189naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002900143245016100172500001400333520146300347592002801810650001101838650002501849650000901874650001801883650001801901650001601919650002201935650001101957650002001968650004201988650001802030650002002048650001502068650001302083650002602096650001302122650002102135650000902156650001902165650001102184650001002195650001602205651001102221700002402232700002402256700002602280700002702306700002002333700002102353700002502374773012602399856007702525852000902602655001202611IND60711642220221119031700.0200928e20200910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071164222DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox90908472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalfa, Giuseppe  Antonio14aThe Antioxidant Activities of Betula etnensis Rafin. Ethanolic Extract Exert Protective and Anti-diabetic Effects on Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetes in Rats  aNAL-light  aPathophysiological mechanisms correlating diabetes mellitus with associated complications are still not completely clear, even though oxidative stress seems to play a pivotal role. Literature data suggest that cell damages induced by hyperglycemia, although multifactorial, have a common pathway in oxidative/nitrosative stress. The present study evaluated the effects of Betula etnensis Raf. bark extract, a plant belonging to the Betulaceae family endemic to Sicily, on oxidative stress and in preventing and/or retarding diabetes-associated complications in streptozotocin diabetic rats treated with the extract at dose of 0.5 g/kg body weight per day for 28 consecutive days. The extract administration significant decreased food and water intake, fasting blood glucose, weight loss and polyuria, compared with untreated diabetic animals. Furthermore, oxidative stress markers particularly, lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) and nitrite/nitrate levels, non-proteic thiol groups (RSH), γ-glutamyl-cysteine-synthetase (γ-GCS) activities and expression, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), endothelial and inducible nitric oxide synthases (i-NOS e-NOS) expression, significantly changed by streptozocin treatment, were markedly restored both in plasma and tissues together with nuclear sirtuins activity (Sirt1). Results suggested that B. etnensis bark alcoholic extract is able to counteract oxidative stress and to ameliorate some general parameters related to diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3aantioxidant activity 3abark 3abark extracts 3ablood glucose 3abody weight 3adiabetes mellitus 3adosage 3aglycemic effect 3aheme oxygenase (biliverdin-producing) 3ahyperglycemia 3alipid peroxides 3aliterature 3anitrates 3anitric oxide synthase 3anitrites 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3astreptozotocin 3athiols 3awater 3aweight loss 3aSicily1 aTomasello, Barbara 1 aAcquaviva, Rosaria 1 aMantia, Alfonsina  La1 aPappalardo, Francesco 1 aRagusa, Monica 1 aRenis, Marcella 1 aDi Giacomo, Claudia 0 tAntioxidants.g2020 Sept. 10, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox90908473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03123naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005300148245013500201300002000336520163400356592002801990596005902018596005902077596005702136596006902193596008102262596007802343650001102421650002502432650001102457650001402468650001302482700001902495773015502514856008302669852000902752655001202761IND60777731220221121021628.0220520e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077773122DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-18383-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Sai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1437-834910aCorporate carbon disclosure, financing structure, and total factor productivity: evidence from Chinese heavy polluting enterprises  ap. 40094-40109.  aLow-carbon economy has become the current global economic development trend, and corporate carbon disclosure has attracted more and more attention from scholars and investors. This study creatively explores the mechanism of corporate carbon disclosure on total factor productivity with financing structure as a mediating variable. The content analysis method is employed to assess carbon disclosure that is suitable for Chinese enterprises. Through the mediating effect model and Sobel test, the internal mechanism of carbon disclosure affecting total factor productivity is analyzed, with Chinese heavy polluting enterprises from 2015 to 2018 as research samples. The results show that, firstly, carbon disclosure has a positive effect on the improvement of total factor productivity. The effect of monetary carbon disclosure on the improvement of total factor productivity is higher than that of non-monetary carbon disclosure. Secondly, the financing structure has a mediating effect between carbon disclosure and total factor profductivity, and the mediating effect of internal financing capabilities is better than those of external financing costs. Finally, external financing costs and internal financing capabilities have mediating effects in both heterogeneous carbon disclosure and total factor productivity. The mediating effect of internal financing capabilities is significantly higher than the mediating effect of external financing costs. The effect of monetary carbon disclosure on total factor productivity indirectly through internal financing capabilities is higher than that of non-monetary carbon disclosure.  aPublisher supplied data  a71734001cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a71934001cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a17BGL266cNational Social Science Foundation Project  aWR2019003cProgram for Liaoning Innovative Talents in University  a2021lslybkt-008cLiaoning Provincial Economic and Social Development Project  aDUT21RW209cFundamental Research Funds of Dalian University of Technology 3acarbon 3aeconomic development 3amodels 3apollution 3aresearch1 aPan, Xiongfeng0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 June, v. 29, no. 26 p.40094-40109dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-18383-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185072000900194100001800203245009000221300001600311500002400327500002400351520132000375650001701695650001401712650001601726650002201742650001901764650002001783650001901803650001601822650001301838650001201851650002601863650001501889650003501904650001201939651001501951653003101966653002201997653002202019653002302041653001602064700001402080773013802094852000902232856008502241856011102326930003302437945002502470946001302495655001202508IND4376239620221119232946.0051122e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437623962DNAL7 a10.1603/0013-8746(2005)098[0444:NESHCP]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL700 0aL001 0aL400 0aL3001 aRakitov, R.A.10aNew egg-powdering sharpshooters (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae: Proconiini) from Costa Rica  ap. 444-457.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  aNew proconiine leafhoppers (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae: Cicadellinae), associated with Chusquea bamboos and other tall grasses, are described from montane forests of Costa Rica: one species of Paraquichira n. gen. and two species of Quichira Young. The latter genus, previously known from only a male of the type species from western Panama, is redescribed with inclusion of female characters; a key to its species is provided. Oviposition into grass leaves was observed in captive females of P. costaricensis n. sp. and Q. tegminis Young. Females of both species powder their egg clusters with specialized brochosomes, stored in the form of spots on the female forewings. Unlike Quichira and several other Proconiini genera displaying this behavior, Paraquichira lacks the rakelike modification of the macrosetae on the female hind tibia. The shape of the female brochosomes, not previously used in cicadellid systematics, is included in the morphological descriptions. Also described are the immature stages of P. costaricensis n. sp. The younger instars seem to mimic jumping spiders, the similarity being enhanced by their unusual habit of holding the abdomen arched, which makes it seem shorter and more inflated in dorsal aspect. Affinities of the two genera are discussed based on their morphology and behavior. 3aCicadellidae 3anew genus 3anew species 3ainsect morphology 3aredescriptions 3ainsect taxonomy 3ataxonomic keys 3ahost plants 3aChusquea 3agrasses 3areproductive behavior 3aegg masses 3abodily secretions and exudates 3abamboos 3aCosta Rica 0aParaquichira costaricensis 0aQuichira tegminis 0aQuichira gracilis 0aQuichira parallela 0abrochosomes1 aGodoy, C.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2005 July, v. 98, no. 4 p.444-457dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.entsoc.org/pubs/periodicals/ann/3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0013-8746(2005)098%5B0444:NESHCP%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20070815b20070902c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/12/01  aOther US 7aarticle03672naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151242010500183245009400288300001600382520140000398536019301798592002801991596012202019596006502141650002202206650001602228650001802244650001402262650002502276650001102301650001402312650001802326650001502344650001802359650001102377650001502388650003102403650001502434650003302449650001702482650002002499650001302519650002702532650002302559650001102582650001102593650001602604650001802620653002302638653002602661653002702687653003302714653001502747700002802762700003002790773011902820856008602939852000903025655001203034IND60679281920221119195155.0200509e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067928192DNAL7 a10.1080/19476337.2019.16075612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarmo, Juliana Rodrigues do10aMayonesa adicionada con tucupí: caracterización, evaluación sensorial y comportamiento reológico10aTucupi-added mayonnaise: Characterization, sensorial evaluation, and rheological behavior  ap. 479-487.  aThe aim of this work was to elaborate a tucupi-added mayonnaise and to assess the physicochemical characteristics, as well the rheological behavior at temperatures from 20°C to 70°C of the product with greater sensorial acceptance. For this purpose, three mayonnaise formulations (10%, 12.5% and 15% of the concentrated tucupi) were developed and submitted to sensorial acceptance and purchase intention tests. Based on the results of acceptance test by Tukey’s test (p ≤ 0.05) and internal preference mapping by principal component analysis (PCA), the formulation with 10% of the tucupi was chosen. The purchase intention test showed that 95% of the judges would buy this product, which presented 41.52% moisture, 2.06% ashes, 43.95% lipids, 4.56% proteins, 3.12% total sugars, 1.51% starch, 1.29% chlorides, 9.40 µg/g β-carotene and energy value of 432 kcal/100 g. According to rheological analysis, the mayonnaise with 10% of the tucupi presented pseudoplastic fluid-like behavior and evidenced hysteresis (showing thixotropic characteristic) between the up-ramp and down-ramp flow curves from 60°C. The Herschel-Bulkley model was efficient in predicting product flow curve and an Arrhenius-like equation estimated activation energy value for the product (8.29 kJ/mol). Thus, the tucupi-added mayonnaise can be considered an excellent and promising alternative for the food industry.  aThis work was supported by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq, Brazil) (407764/2013-5) and Universidade Federal do Pará (PROPESP/UFPA) [014791/2018-34].  aPublisher supplied data  a407764/2013-5cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológicodhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003593  a014791/2018-34cUniversidade Federal do Pará (PROPESP/UFPA) 3aactivation energy 3aash content 3abeta-carotene 3achlorides 3aconsumer preferences 3aenergy 3aequations 3afood industry 3ahysteresis 3alipid content 3alipids 3amayonnaise 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3aproduct flow 3aprotein content 3aproteins 3arheological properties 3asensory evaluation 3astarch 3asugars 3atemperature 3awater content 0aCassava wastewater 0aoil-in-water emulsion 0aindustrial alternative 0aprincipal component analysis 0aflow curve1 aCosta, Telma dos Santos1 aPena, Rosinelson da Silva0 tCyTA: journal of food.g2019 Jan. 1, v. 17, no. 1 p.479-487dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000065x1947-63457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19476337.2019.16075613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04191naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100002400181245007000205300001800275506007600293520210300369592002802472506003702500650001902537650000902556650001902565650003802584650001302622650002502635650003102660650003002691650001002721650004802731650002502779650006702804650005902871650001902930650004202949650002402991650006103015650001303076650002603089650007703115653002203192653003403214653001403248653001203262653001103274653000903285653001303294700002703307700001903334773014103353856007403494852000903568655001203577IND60118920920221207113626.0141127e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011892092DNAL7 a246926502pmid7 aPMC40859632pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/eru1302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharwood, Robert E.10aPhotosynthetic flexibility in maize exposed to salinity and shade  ap. 3715-3724.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aC₄ photosynthesis involves a close collaboration of the C₃ and C₄ metabolic cycles across the mesophyll and bundle-sheath cells. This study investigated the coordination of C₄ photosynthesis in maize plants subjected to two salinity (50 and 100mM NaCl) treatments and one shade (20% of full sunlight) treatment. Photosynthetic efficiency was probed by combining leaf gas-exchange measurements with carbon isotope discrimination and assaying the key carboxylases [ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC)] and decarboxylases [nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate malic enzyme (NADP-ME) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEP-CK)] operating in maize leaves. Generally, salinity inhibited plant growth and photosynthesis to a lesser extent than shade. Salinity reduced photosynthesis primarily by reducing stomatal conductance and secondarily by equally reducing Rubisco and PEPC activities; the decarboxylases were inhibited more than the carboxylases. Salinity increased photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination (Δp) and reduced leaf dry-matter carbon isotope composition (¹³δ) due to changes in p(i)/p(a) (intercellular to ambient CO₂ partial pressure), while CO₂ leakiness out of the bundle sheath (ϕ) was similar to that in control plants. Acclimation to shade was underpinned by a greater downregulation of PEPC relative to Rubisco activity, and a lesser inhibition of NADP-ME (primary decarboxylase) relative to PEP-CK (secondary decarboxylase). Shade reduced Δp and ɸ without significantly affecting leaf ¹³δ or p(i)/p(a) relative to control plants. Accordingly, shade perturbed the balance between the C₃ and C₄ cycles during photosynthesis in maize, and demonstrated the flexible partitioning of C₄ acid decarboxylation activity between NADP-ME and PEP-CK in response to the environment. This study highlights the need to improve our understanding of the links between leaf ¹³δ and photosynthetic Δp, and the role of the secondary decarboxylase PEP-CK in NADP-ME plants such as maize.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon dioxide 3acorn 3aphotosynthesis 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3asalinity 3astomatal conductance 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aCarbon Isotopesxanalysis 2aLight 2aMalate Dehydrogenasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPhosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (ATP)xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Transpiration 2aRibulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSalinity 2aStress, Physiological 2aZea maysxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiologyxradiation effects. 0aC4 photosynthesis 0acarbon isotope discrimination 0aleakiness 0aNADP-ME 0aPEP-CK 0aPEPC 0aRubisco.1 aSonawane, Balasaheb V.1 aGhannoum, Oula0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2014 July, v. 65, no. 13 p.3715-3724dOxford University Press [etc.]wJournal:jnl44658x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eru1303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02914naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008500164300001400249520151000263592002801773650002201801650002401823650002301847650001701870650001901887650001501906650001201921650001501933650002001948650001501968650003001983650001602013650001702029650001002046650001702056650001202073650001702085700001402102700001302116700001602129700001702145700001602162700001602178700001602194773010802210856008102318852000902399655001202408IND60580688120221118063016.0170930e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058068812DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-017-3194-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBauke, S. L.10aMacropore effects on phosphorus acquisition by wheat roots – a rhizotron study  ap. 67-82.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Macropores may be preferential root pathways into the subsoil. We hypothesised that the presence of macropores promotes P-uptake from subsoil, particularly at limited water supply in surface soil. We tested this hypothesis in a rhizotron experiment with spring wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Scirocco) under variation of fertilisation and irrigation. METHODS: Rhizotrons were filled with compacted subsoil (bulk density 1.4 g cm⁻³), underneath a P-depleted topsoil. In half of these rhizotrons the subsoil contained artificial macropores. Spring wheat was grown for 41 days with and without irrigation and ³¹P–addition. Also, a ³³P–tracer was added at the soil surface to trace P-distribution in plants using liquid scintillation counting and radioactive imaging. RESULTS: Fertilisation and irrigation promoted biomass production and plant P-uptake. Improved growing conditions resulted in a higher proportion of subsoil roots, indicating that the topsoil root system additionally promoted subsoil nutrient acquisition. The presence of macropores did not improve plant growth but tended to increase translocation of ³³P into both above- and belowground biomass. ³³P–imaging confirmed that this plant-internal transport of topsoil-P extended into subsoil roots. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of penetration resistance in macropores did not increase plant growth and nutrient uptake from subsoil here; however, wheat specifically re-allocated topsoil-P for subsoil root growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3abelowground biomass 3abiomass production 3abulk density 3aimage analysis 3airrigation 3aliquids 3amacropores 3anutrient uptake 3aphosphorus 3aresistance to penetration 3aroot growth 3aroot systems 3aroots 3aspring wheat 3atopsoil 3awater supply1 aLandl, M.1 aKoch, M.1 aHofmann, D.1 aNagel, K.

Using a large‐scale pan European study including 786 fields within 261 farms from eight countries, we analysed differences in the taxonomic and functional diversity of arable weeds assemblages across different levels of agricultural intensification. We estimated weed species frequency in each field, and collected species' traits (vegetative height, SLA and seed mass) from the TRY plant trait database. With this information, we estimated taxonomic (species richness), functional composition (community weighted means) and functional diversity (functional richness, evenness, divergence and redundancy). We used indicators of agricultural management intensity at the individual field scale (e.g. yield, inputs of nitrogen fertilizer and herbicides, frequency of mechanical weed control practices) and at the landscape scale surrounding the field (i.e. number of crop types, mean field size and proportion of arable land cover within a radius of 500 m from the sampling points). The effects of agricultural intensification on species and functional richness at the field scale were stronger than those of intensification at the landscape scale, and we did not observe evidence of interacting effects between the two scales. Overall, assemblages in more intensified areas had fewer species, a higher prevalence of species with ruderal strategies (low stature, high leaf area, light seeds), and lower functional redundancy. Maintaining the diversity of Europe's arable weed communities requires some simple management interventions, for example, reducing the high intensity of field‐level agricultural management across Europe, which could be complemented by interventions that increase landscape complexity.

However, during exposure to elevated humidity and temperature, the deposited APS layers can decompose, leading to reduction in coupling efficiency, thus decreasing the product quality and the mechanical strength of the polymer–inorganic material interface. Therefore, a better understanding of the chemical state and stability of APS on inorganic surfaces is needed. In this work, we investigated APS adhesion on silica wafers and compared its properties with those on complex silicate surfaces such as those used by industry (mineral fibers and fiber melt wafers). The APS was deposited from aqueous and organic (toluene) solutions and studied with surface sensitive techniques, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), streaming potential, contact angle, and spectroscopic ellipsometry. APS configuration on a model silica surface at a range of coverages was simulated using density functional theory (DFT). We also studied the stability of adsorbed APS during aging at high humidity and elevated temperature. Our results demonstrated that APS layer formation depends on the choice of solvent and substrate used for deposition. On silica surfaces in toluene, APS formed unstable multilayers, while from aqueous solutions, thinner and more stable APS layers were produced. The chemical composition and substrate roughness influence the amount of deposited APS. More APS was deposited and its layers were more stable on fiber melt than on silica wafers. The changes in the amount of adsorbed APS can be successfully monitored by streaming potential. These results will aid in improving industrial- and laboratory-scale APS deposition methods and increasing adhesion and stability, thus increasing the quality and effectiveness of materials where APS is used as a coupling agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadhesion 3aaqueous solutions 3aatomic force microscopy 3achemical composition 3acontact angle 3ahumidity 3aindustry 3amelting 3amodels 3apolymers 3aproduct quality 3aroughness 3asilica 3asilicates 3asolvents 3astrength (mechanics) 3asynthetic fibers 3atemperature 3atoluene 0aadhesion 0asurface treatment 0aaminosilane 0acoatings 0amaterial stability 0amineral wool 0afibers1 aBudi, Akin1 aCeccato, Marcel1 aCárdenas, Marité1 aJohansson, Dorte B.1 aLybye, Dorthe1 aBechgaard, Klaus1 aAndersson, Martin P.1 aStipp, Susan L.

We aim to study plant species-specific effects of iron toxicity when grown in the iron-rich sediments of lake Markermeer (the Netherlands). METHODS: Using three sediment sources that varied in total Fe and Fe-P concentrations, we performed a greenhouse experiment to study the development of three wetland species that differ in their tolerance to iron and utilization capacity of Fe-P: Rumex maritimus, Phragmites australis and Eupatorium cannabinum. RESULTS: Phragmites australis was the only species that developed an epidermis-damaging iron plaque on its roots. Plaque formation mainly depended on the Fe(III) and Fe-P concentration of the sediment, which led to different nutrient imbalances in leaves. All three species showed reduced growth compared to the control substrate, which could not be linked to indirect Fe toxicity. In contrast, direct Fe toxicity following the uptake of Fe could not be excluded as a mechanism potentially explaining our results, and this result warrants further examination in longer-term experiments. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the importance of considering the Fe and Fe-P availability in sediments, as these properties may constrain plant performance and delay the development of pioneer ecosystems in wetland construction sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEupatorium cannabinum 3aPhragmites australis 3aRumex maritimus 3aecosystems 3agreenhouse experimentation 3airon 3alakes 3aleaves 3aplant development 3aroots 3asediments 3atoxicity 3awetlands 3aNetherlands1 aDekker, Stefan C.1 aEppinga, Maarten B.1 aGriffioen, Jasper1 aWassen, Martin J.0 tPlant and soil.g2017 July, v. 416, no. 1-2 p.83-96dSpringer International Publishingx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-017-3190-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02728naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245011100166520157100277592002801848650002701876650001501903650001901918650002101937650002901958650001001987650001801997650001102015650001402026650001902040651001302059700002502072700002302097700002402120773012202144856007902266852000902345655001202354IND60794322820221119123033.0220922e20220913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079432282DNAL7 a10.3390/plants111823852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrowell, Chase R.10aEvidence of Asexual Overwintering of Melampsora paradoxa and Mapping of Stem Rust Host Resistance in Salix  aMelampsora rust is a devastating disease of shrub willow in North America. Previous work has identified Melampsora paradoxa as one of two identified rust species in New York State that infect Salix purpurea and other important Salix host species, however little is known about the population of this rust species in this region. Genotyping-by-sequencing was used to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and assess population diversity of M. paradoxa isolates collected from three Salix breeding populations in Geneva, NY between 2015 and 2020. Statistical analyses of SNP revealed that all isolates collected were clonally derived even though they were collected across years. In 2020, isolates were collected from stem infections where uredospore pustules were observed, and these isolates were also identical to M. paradoxa collected in previous seasons. These data suggest that M. paradoxa sampled across multiple years overwintered and reproduced asexually and that stem infection is a possible mechanism for overwintering, both of which are novel findings for this rust species. Additionally, field disease ratings were conducted on a S. purpurea × S. suchowensis F₁ breeding population with high disease severity, enabling the discovery of QTL for resistance on chromosomes 1 and 19. Lastly, Colletotrichum salicis was frequently associated with stem rust and may play a role in M. paradoxa stem infection. Together, this work is the first substantial exploration into M. paradoxa population biology, stem infection, and host resistance in Salix.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColletotrichum salicis 3aMelampsora 3aSalix purpurea 3adisease severity 3agenotyping by sequencing 3ahosts 3aoverwintering 3ashrubs 3astem rust 3aurediniospores 3aNew York1 aWilkerson, Dustin G.1 aSmart, Lawrence B.1 aSmart, Christine D.0 tPlants.g2022 Sept. 13, v. 11, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111823853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03598naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245014800167500001400315520170500329592002802034650002602062650002002088650000802108650001702116650001502133650001602148650001002164650001702174650001402191650001002205650002002215650001102235650001102246650002202257650001602279650001102295650002002306650001602326650002102342650001302363650001302376650001602389650001402405650001302419650001102432650000902443650002702452650001202479650002102491700002702512700002502539700001702564700002202581700002502603700002602628700002202654700002002676700001602696773012602712856007702838852000902915655001202924IND60711642520221119031827.0200928e20200910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071164252DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox90908502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLazzarino, Giacomo 10aLow Molecular Weight Dextran Sulfate (ILB®) Administration Restores Brain Energy Metabolism Following Severe Traumatic Brain Injury in the Rat  aNAL-light  aTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability in people less than 40 years of age in Western countries. Currently, there are no satisfying pharmacological treatments for TBI patients. In this study, we subjected rats to severe TBI (sTBI), testing the effects of a single subcutaneous administration, 30 min post-impact, of a new low molecular weight dextran sulfate, named ILB®, at three different dose levels (1, 5, and 15 mg/kg body weight). A group of control sham-operated animals and one of untreated sTBI rats were used for comparison (each group n = 12). On day 2 or 7 post-sTBI animals were sacrificed and the simultaneous HPLC analysis of energy metabolites, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), oxidized and reduced nicotinic coenzymes, water-soluble antioxidants, and biomarkers of oxidative/nitrosative stress was carried out on deproteinized cerebral homogenates. Compared to untreated sTBI rats, ILB® improved energy metabolism by increasing ATP, ATP/ adenosine diphosphate ratio (ATP/ADP ratio), and triphosphate nucleosides, dose-dependently increased NAA concentrations, protected nicotinic coenzyme levels and their oxidized over reduced ratios, prevented depletion of ascorbate and reduced glutathione (GSH), and decreased oxidative (malondialdehyde formation) and nitrosative stress (nitrite + nitrate production). Although needing further experiments, these data provide the first evidence that a single post-injury injection of a new low molecular weight dextran sulfate (ILB®) has beneficial effects on sTBI metabolic damages. Due to the absence of adverse effects in humans, ILB® represents a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of sTBI patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aadverse effects 3aage 3aantioxidants 3abiomarkers 3abody weight 3abrain 3abrain damage 3acoenzymes 3adeath 3adextran sulfate 3adosage 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3aglutathione 3ahumans 3amalondialdehyde 3ametabolites 3amolecular weight 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anucleosides 3aoxidation 3apatients 3apeople 3arats 3asubcutaneous injection 3atesting 3awater solubility1 aAmorini, Angela  Maria1 aBarnes, Nicholas  M.1 aBruce, Lars 1 aMordente, Alvaro 1 aLazzarino, Giuseppe 1 aDi Pietro, Valentina,1 aTavazzi, Barbara 1 aBelli, Antonio 1 aLogan, Ann 0 tAntioxidants.g2020 Sept. 10, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox90908503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245010800167300001800275520115400293592002801447650001301475650001101488650001001499650001101509650001801520650001401538650000901552650001901561650001001580650002001590650002001610650001901630650002101649650002601670653002801696653002101724653003601745653002901781653002701810653002601837700002001863700001601883700002101899700002301920700002101943700002501964700002401989773012302013856008002136852000902216655001202225IND60564325820221119044528.0170318e20170308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056432582DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b146312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Hyungryul J.10aSuperoleophilic Titania Nanoparticle Coatings with Fast Fingerprint Decomposition and High Transparency  ap. 8354-8360.  aLow surface tension sebaceous liquids such as human fingerprint oils are readily deposited on high energy surfaces such as clean glass, leaving smudges that significantly lower transparency. There have been several attempts to prevent formation of these dactylograms on glass by employing oil-repellent textured surfaces. However, nanotextured superoleophobic coatings typically scatter visible light, and the intrinsic thermodynamic metastability of the composite superoleophobic state can result in failure of the oil repellency under moderate contact pressure. We develop titania-based porous nanoparticle coatings that are superoleophilic and highly transparent and which exhibit short time scales for decomposition of fingerprint oils under ultraviolet light. The mechanism by which a typical dactylogram is consumed combines wicking of the sebum into the nanoporous titania structure followed by photocatalytic degradation. We envision a wide range of applications because these TiO₂ nanostructured surfaces remain photocatalytically active against fingerprint oils in natural sunlight and are also compatible with flexible glass substrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3aenergy 3aglass 3ahumans 3ananoparticles 3ananopores 3aoils 3aphotocatalysis 3asebum 3asolar radiation 3asurface tension 3athermodynamics 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet radiation 0afingerprint degradation 0asmudge resistant 0atransparent nanoporous surfaces 0asuperoleophilic surfaces 0aphotocatalytic effects 0atitania nanoparticles1 aPark, Kyoo-Chul1 aLee, Hyomin1 aCrouzier, Thomas1 aRubner, Michael F.1 aCohen, Robert E.1 aBarbastathis, George1 aMcKinley, Gareth H.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Mar. 08, v. 9, no. 9 p.8354-8360dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b146313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04103naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100002000181245007500201300001800276506007600294520207000370592002802440506003702468650002202505650002202527650001902549650001202568650002502580650003102605650002502636650003702661650002502698650003702723650005602760650004802816650001902864650004202883650003102925650002402956650005002980650002203030653003903052653001603091653001103107653001203118653000903130653001103139653001203150653003903162700002403201700002103225700001903246773014103265856007403406852000903480655001203489IND60118921120221207100842.0141127e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011892112DNAL7 a247234092pmid7 aPMC40859652pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/eru1552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinto, Harshini10aPhotosynthesis of C₃, C₃–C₄, and C₄ grasses at glacial CO₂  ap. 3669-3681.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMost physiology comparisons of C₃ and C₄ plants are made under current or elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO₂ which do not reflect the low CO₂ environment under which C₄ photosynthesis has evolved. Accordingly, photosynthetic nitrogen (PNUE) and water (PWUE) use efficiency, and the activity of the photosynthetic carboxylases [Rubisco and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC)] and decarboxylases [NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEP-CK)] were compared in eight C₄ grasses with NAD-ME, PCK, and NADP-ME subtypes, one C₃ grass, and one C₃–C₄ grass grown under ambient (400 μl l⁻¹) and glacial (180 μl l⁻¹) CO₂. Glacial CO₂ caused a smaller reduction of photosynthesis and a greater increase of stomatal conductance in C₄ relative to C₃ and C₃–C₄ species. Panicum bisulcatum (C₃) acclimated to glacial [CO₂] by doubling Rubisco activity, while Rubisco was unchanged in Panicum milioides (C₃–C₄), possibly due to its high leaf N and Rubisco contents. Glacial CO₂ up-regulated Rubisco and PEPC activities in concert for several C₄ grasses, while NADP-ME and PEP-CK activities were unchanged, reflecting the high control exerted by the carboxylases relative to the decarboxylases on the efficiency of C₄ metabolism. Despite having larger stomatal conductance at glacial CO₂, C₄ species maintained greater PWUE and PNUE relative to C₃–C₄ and C₃ species due to higher photosynthetic rates. Relative to other C₄ subtypes, NAD-ME and PEP-CK grasses had the highest PWUE and PNUE, respectively; relative to C₃, the C₃–C₄ grass had higher PWUE and similar PNUE at glacial CO₂. Biomass accumulation was reduced by glacial CO₂ in the C₃ grass relative to the C₃–C₄ grass, while biomass was less reduced in NAD-ME grasses compared with NADP-ME and PCK grasses. Under glacial CO₂, high resource use efficiency offers a key evolutionary advantage for the transition from C₃ to C₄ photosynthesis in water- and nutrient-limited environments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aC3 photosynthesis 3aC4 photosynthesis 3acarbon dioxide 3agrasses 3awater use efficiency 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aIce Coverxchemistry 2aMalate Dehydrogenasexmetabolism 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPanicumxenzymologyxphysiology. 2aPhosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (ATP)xmetabolism 2aPhosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylasexmetabolism 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPlant Leavesxenzymologyxphysiology. 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPlant Transpiration 2aRibulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylasexmetabolism 2aWaterxmetabolism 0aC3, C3–C4, and C4 photosynthesis 0aglacial CO2 0aNAD-ME 0aNADP-ME 0aPEPC 0aPEP-CK 0aRubisco 0awater and nitrogen use efficiency.1 aSharwood, Robert E.1 aTissue, David T.1 aGhannoum, Oula0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2014 July, v. 65, no. 13 p.3669-3681dOxford University Press [etc.]wJournal:jnl44658x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eru1553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245014800162300001600310520140500326592002801731650001501759650002101774650001301795650002101808650003001829650001301859650001901872650000901891650001701900650001801917650001101935650001701946700001601963700001701979700001601996700001802012700001802030700005502048773009002103856008502193852000902278655001202287IND60679883320221121231438.0200221e20200415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067988332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2019.12.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jia10aN-doped reduced graphene oxide aerogels containing pod-like N-doped carbon nanotubes and FeNi nanoparticles for electromagnetic wave absorption  ap. 357-365.  aLightweight and low filler loading of electromagnetic wave absorption materials remain a huge challenge under the premise of strong absorption and broad absorption band. Here, we offer a facile strategy to prepare the ultralight self-supported N-doped reduced graphene oxide aerogels containing pod-like N-doped carbon nanotubes and FeNi@N-doped graphene layer core-shell nanoparticles for high-performance electromagnetic wave absorbing materials. The mass density of the ultralight aerogels is 0.0131 g cm⁻³, greatly lower than those of activated carbons. With a filling loading of only 10 wt% and the matching thickness of 2.0 mm, the minimal reflection loss of aerogels reaches −39.39 dB at 13.28 GHz. When the matching thickness is smaller than 2.0 mm (1.6–2.0 mm), the minimal reflection loss values of the optimized aerogels can still exceed −20 dB superior to most of reported electromagnetic wave absorption counterparts. Moreover, its maximum effective absorption bandwidth is up to 4.7 GHz at the matching thickness of merely 1.8 mm. The excellent performance of the ultralight bimetal-based aerogels mainly derives from increased dielectric loss, better matching impedance and larger specific surface area. It could be believed our designed ultralight self-supported aerogels can be promising candidates for lightweight absorbers with strong attenuation abilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aactivated carbon 3aaerogels 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectromagnetic radiation 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3airon 3amass density 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3asurface area1 aZhang, Xiao1 aYuan, Haoran1 aZhang, Shen1 aZhu, Chunling1 aZhang, Xitian1 aChen, Yujin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6794-22760 tCarbon.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 159 p.357-365dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.12.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245008200159300001800241520121100259592002801470650001601498650001101514650001101525650002101536650001401557650000901571650001201580650002201592650001501614650001201629650000801641650003701649653001901686653001401705653001401719653001501733653002301748653002301771653001601794700001901810700002501829700001401854700001501868700001601883700002301899700002301922700001701945773012301962856008002085852000902165655001202174IND60564325920221119044654.0170318e20170308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056432592DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b147832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiao10aReversible Li-Ion Conversion Reaction for a TixGe Alloy in a Ti/Ge Multilayer  ap. 8169-8176.  aGroup IV intermetallics electrochemically alloy with Li with stoichiometries as high as Li₄.₄M (M = Si, Ge, Sn, or Pb). This provides the second highest known specific capacity (after pure lithium metal) for lithium-ion batteries, but the dramatic volume change during cycling greatly limits their use as anodes in Li-ion batteries. We describe an approach to overcome this limitation by constructing electrodes using a Ge/Ti multilayer architecture. In operando X-ray reflectivity and ex situ transmission electron microscopy are used to characterize the heterolayer structure at various lithium stoichiometries along a lithiation/delithiation cycle. The as-deposited multilayer spontaneously forms a one-dimensional TiₓGe/Ti/TiₓGe core–shell planar structure embedded in a Ge matrix. The interfacial TiₓGe alloy is observed to be electrochemically active and exhibits reversible phase separation (i.e., a conversion reaction). Including the germanium components, the overall multilayer structure exhibits a 2.3-fold reversible vertical expansion and contraction and is shown to have improved capacity and capacity retention with respect to a Ge film with equivalent active material thickness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aalloys 3aanodes 3aelectrochemistry 3agermanium 3alead 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3aseparation 3asilicon 3atin 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aLi-ion battery 0agermanium 0athin film 0amultilayer 0aX-ray reflectivity 0aPatterson function 0aGe/Ti alloy1 aFister, Tim T.1 aEsbenshade, Jennifer1 aShi, Bing1 aHu, Xianyi1 aWu, Jinsong1 aGewirth, Andrew A.1 aBedzyk, Michael J.1 aFenter, Paul0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Mar. 08, v. 9, no. 9 p.8169-8176dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b147833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01387naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003100149245012700180520048200307592002800789650002300817650001700840650001300857650001100870700002300881773012500904856008301029852000901112655001201121IND60742521220221117020340.0210624e20210601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074252122DNAL7 a10.3390/fermentation70200872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaymond Eder, María Laura10aGenetic, Physiological, and Industrial Aspects of the Fructophilic Non-Saccharomyces Yeast Species, Starmerella bacillaris  aStarmerella bacillaris (synonym Candida zemplinina) is a non-Saccharomyces yeast species, frequently found in enological ecosystems.

A. L.10aSelf-Assembly of Russian Doll Concentric Porphyrin Nanorings  ap. 12713-12718.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aElectronic communication between concentric macrocycles with wave functions that extend around their circumferences can lead to remarkable behavior, as illustrated by multiwalled carbon nanotubes and photosynthetic chlorophyll arrays. However, it is difficult to hold one π-conjugated molecular ring inside another. Here, we show that ring-in-ring complexes, consisting of a 6-porphyrin ring locked inside a 12-porphyrin ring, can be assembled by placing different metals in the two rings (zinc and aluminum). A bridging ligand with carboxylate and imidazole binding sites forms spokes between the two rings, resulting in a highly cooperative supramolecular self-assembly process. Excitation is transferred from the inner 6-ring to the outer 12-ring of this Russian doll complex within 40 ps. These complexes lead to a form of template-directed synthesis in which one nanoring promotes formation of a larger concentric homologous ring; here, the effective template is an eight-component noncovalent assembly. Russian doll templating provides a new approach to amplifying the size of a covalent nanostructure.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaluminum 3abinding sites 3acarbon nanotubes 3achlorophyll 3aligands 3aphotosynthesis 3azinc1 aGong, Juliane Q.1 aHaver, Renée1 aOdell, Barbara Gill,1 aClaridge, Tim D.

A Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) 5 scene and Leica ALS 50-II data from 2009, covering a test area in the mid-Sweden (latitude 60° 43′ N, longitude 16° 43′ E), were used in maximum likelihood and decision tree classifications. Training and validation data were obtained from the interpretation of digital aerial photo stereo models. Combination of SPOT and ALS data gave classification accuracies up to 72%, compared with 56% using only SPOT data. This indicates that integrating features from large area laser scanning may lead to significant improvements in satellite data-based vegetation classifications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerial photography 3adecision support systems 3alatitude 3alongitude 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3avegetation1 aGranholm, Ann-Helen1 aHolmgren, Johan1 aOlsson, Håkan,1 aNilsson, Mats0 tRemote sensing letters.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 3, no. 5 p.393-401dTaylor & Francisx2150-70587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2011.606240  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245013000170520130200300592002801602650002401630650001301654650001401667650001301681650002301694650001601717650001701733650001101750650003201761650001801793650001701811650001401828650001401842650001601856650001901872650001101891650002301902650000701925650001101932700001901943700002601962700002401988773012502012856008302137852000902220655001202229IND60742521320221117020435.0210624e20210601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074252132DNAL7 a10.3390/fermentation70200882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSnopek, Paulina 10aAeration and Stirring in Yarrowia lipolytica Lipase Biosynthesis during Batch Cultures with Waste Fish Oil as a Carbon Source  aYarrowia lipolytica is one of the most studied non-conventional forms of yeast, exhibiting a high secretory capacity and producing many industrially important and valuable metabolites. The yeast conceals a great biotechnological potential to synthesize organic acids, sweeteners, microbial oil, or fragrances. The vast majority of bioprocesses are carried out in bioreactors, where suitable culture conditions are provided. In the current study, the effect of agitation speed (200–600 rpm) and air flow rate (0.0375–2.0 dm³/(dm³ × min)) on the biomass yield and lipase activity of Y. lipolytica KKP 379 is analyzed in a growth medium containing waste fish oil. The increase of aeration intensity limited the period of oxygen deficit in the medium. Simultaneously, an increase in lipolytic activity was observed from 2.09 U/cm³ to 14.21 U/cm³; however, an excessive agitation speed likely caused oxidative or shear stresses, and a reduction in lipolytic activity was observed. Moreover, it is confirmed that the synthesis of lipases is related to oxygen consumption, pH, and the yeast growth phase, and appropriate process selection may provide two advantages, namely, the maximum use of the waste carbon source and the production of lipolytic enzymes that are valuable in many industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aYarrowia lipolytica 3aaeration 3aagitation 3aair flow 3abiomass production 3abioreactors 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3aculture media 3afermentation 3afish oils 3alipolysis 3ametabolites 3amicrobial oils 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3apH 3ayeasts1 aNowak, Dorota 1 aZieniuk, Bartłomiej 1 aFabiszewska, Agata 0 tFermentation.g2021 June 01, v. 7, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26730x2311-56377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fermentation70200883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01259naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245008800167300002000255520035000275592002800625650002300653650002200676650002100698700001800719700002500737773013600762856007400898852000900972655001200981IND60660254720221120025016.0190823e20140821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066025472DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc03756a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShanmugan, Swaminathan14aThe design and synthesis of an innovative octacarboxy-silsesquioxane building block  ap. 11008-11011.  aAn octacarboxy-silsesquioxane was designed and synthesised through a multiple-step regioselective reaction.

A quantum mechanical investigation of the EPR response  ap. 443-450.  aThe VN2− defect in diamond consists of a vacancy surrounded by two substitutional nitrogen atoms, which lower the local symmetry from Td to C₂ᵥ. Calculations of the doublet ground state geometry, electronic structure, EPR parameters, and IR spectra of this defect are reported along with a preliminary investigation of the observed optical transition. For the most part our results were obtained using a uniform charge compensated supercell approach together with the B3LYP functional and all-electron Gaussian basis sets designed for the properties studied. In particular, the computed hyperfine and quadrupolar EPR parameters for the carbon and nitrogen atoms adjacent to the vacancy agree very well with the experiments (Fermi contact values are 245 MHz vs 241 for ¹³C, and 4.1 vs 4.0 for ¹⁵N). The accompanying spin distribution may be described as a damped spherical spin wave with little spin density on the nitrogen atoms. IR spectra show some interesting features in the range of approximately 360–1310 cm⁻¹, which are absent in the pristine diamond. Functionals without exact exchange, such as PBE, better reproduce the observed zero phonon line.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3ageometry 3anitrogen 3aquantum mechanics 3astable isotopes 0aDiamond 0aVN2− defect 0aVN20 defect 0aElectronic structure 0aBand structure 0aIR spectrum 0aElectron paramagnetic resonance response 0aComparison simulation-experiment1 aKirtman, Bernard1 aGentile, Francesco Silvio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2853-56431 aPlatonenko, Alexander1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8800-34111 aFerrari, Anna Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1465-27741 aDovesi, Roberto0 tCarbon.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 159 p.443-450dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.12.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04577naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005500145245019600200300001800396500001400414500002000428520231000448592002802758596005902786596005902845596007502904596007502979650001303054650001403067650001303081650002803094650001403122650001403136650002203150650001303172650001603185650001603201650001403217650001103231650000903242650001703251650001603268650002203284650000703306650001503313650001503328650001603343650001003359650000903369650001103378700005603389700002103445700001503466700005603481700005803537700005603595700006803651773012003719856007903839852000903918655001203927IND60701112520221118074025.0200707e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070111252DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.135622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Zhihui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8842-867110aContrasting patterns in biomass allocation, root morphology and mycorrhizal symbiosis for phosphorus acquisition among 20 chickpea genotypes with different amounts of rhizosheath carboxylates  ap. 1311-1324.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAdjustments in root biomass allocation, root morphology, carboxylate exudation and mycorrhizal symbiosis are well‐known strategies for plants to cope with phosphorus (P) deficiency. Large genotypic variation in these functional traits has been demonstrated within numerous species. Yet, whether these functional traits are coordinated differently among genotypes of a species to enhance P acquisition remains unknown. We characterized 11 root functional traits associated with P acquisition in 20 chickpea genotypes with contrasting amounts of rhizosheath carboxylates, grown in a glasshouse with severely limiting insoluble (10 mg/kg FePO₄), moderately limiting soluble (10 mg/kg KH₂PO₄) and adequate (50 mg/kg KH₂PO₄) P supply. Substantial variation was found among genotypes in root functional traits associated with P acquisition. Genotypes with a large amount of carboxylates (HRC) had thinner roots, and a lower root mass fraction and root mass density (RMD), but higher specific root length (SRL) and colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) than genotypes with a small amount of rhizosheath carboxylates. In response to soil P availability, chickpea genotypes showed large plasticity in root biomass allocation, rhizosheath pH, carboxylate amount and colonization by AMF, but a limited response in most root morphological traits (i.e. mean root diameter, RMD and SRL). Shoot P content was strongly correlated with different root functional traits in the three P treatments. Our findings suggest a range of predictable relationships between root functional traits among chickpea genotypes; those with HRC tended to have relatively thinner roots with lower cost of root construction, while allocating more resources to carboxylate exudation and colonization by AMF. The shift in the relationships between shoot P content and root functional traits indicates that root traits and/or trait combinations in chickpea vary in a manner that enhances P acquisition under specific soil P conditions (i.e. P sources/levels). Such knowledge provides valuable information for chickpea genotype breeding and our understanding of evolution of traits with improved root/rhizosphere functioning.

(0, 1, 3, 4, and 5 g/100 g of wheat flour) were added to the wheat flour to make bread. Farinograph properties of dough were studied, and the properties of enriched bread were evaluated. According to the results, Moldavian dragonhead leaves increased water absorption by the flour but decreased the volume of bread and crumb lightness. The enriched breads were characterized by a higher value of crumb hardness than that of control bread. The total phenolics content linearly increased with the percentage increase in the addition of dragonhead leaves from 4.8 to 10.1 mg GAE/g dry mass. As a result, the antioxidant activity of bread increased. Sensory evaluation revealed that the wheat bread can be supplemented with Moldavian dragonhead leaves up to 3 g/100 g wheat flour addition of dragonhead leaves with good consumer acceptability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDracocephalum moldavica 3aantioxidant activity 3abaking quality 3abreads 3aconsumer acceptance 3adough 3ahardness 3aleaves 3aphenolic compounds 3asensory evaluation 3awater uptake 3awheat 3awheat flour 0aBread 0aMoldavian balm 0aantioxidant properties 0asensory evaluation 0atexture 0acolor1 aCacak-Pietrzak, Grażyna1 aGawlik-Dziki, Urszula1 aSułek, Alicja1 aKocira, Sławomir1 aBiernacka, Beata0 tCyTA: journal of food.g2019 Jan. 1, v. 17, no. 1 p.536-543dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000065x1947-63457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19476337.2019.16095873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01742naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006100145245014300206300001800349520060700367592002800974650001401002650001201016650003601028650002201064650001401086700002101100700002801121700001701149700002901166773013301195856007901328852000901407655001201416IND60699477020221119160951.0200619e20200520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069947702DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.0c009672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJafarpour, Farnaz1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5242-274810aDivergent Synthesis of α-Aroyloxy Ketones and Indenones: A Controlled Domino Radical Reaction for Di- and Trifunctionalization of Alkynes  ap. 8287-8294.  aThree different modes of aldehyde/alkyne assembly through a controlled radical reaction are devised.

In the first part, the optical and holographic studies of natural photonic structures are presented as well as conditions for the appearance of the photophoretic effect, namely, the displacement or deformation of a nanostructure due to a light-induced thermal gradient, at the nanoscale. This effect is revealed by real-time digital holographic interferometry monitoring the deformation of scales covering the wings of insects induced by temperature. The link between geometry and nanocorrugation that leads to the emergence of the photophoretic effect is experimentally demonstrated and confirmed. In the second part, it is shown how holography can be potentially used to uncover hidden details in the chemical system with nonlinear dynamics, such as the phase transition phenomenon that occurs in complex oscillatory Briggs-Rauscher (BR) reaction. The presented potential of holography at the nanoscale could open enormous possibilities for controlling and molding the photophoretic effect and pattern formation for various applications such as particle trapping and levitation, including the movement of unburnt hydrocarbons in the atmosphere and separation of different aerosols, decomposition of microplastics and fractionation of particles in general, and assessment of temperature and thermal conductivity of micron-size fuel particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3afractionation 3afuels 3ageometry 3aholography 3ainterferometry 3amicroplastics 3ananomaterials 3anonlinear models 3aoptics 3aphase transition 3aphotons 3atemperature 3athermal conductivity1 aPagnacco, Maja C.1 aGrujic, Dusan1 aBokic, Bojana1 aVasiljevic, Darko1 aMouchet, Sébastien1 aVerbiest, Thierry1 aKolarić, Branko,0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2022 Mar. 31, , no. 181 p.e63676-e63676dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/636763Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/63676/uncovering-hidden-dynamics-natural-photonic-structures-using  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245014000169520124400309592002801553650001201581650001201593650001401605650001701619650001701636650002101653650001101674650000701685650001501692650002001707650001401727700002201741773012501763856008301888852000901971655001201980IND60742521520221117020049.0210624e20210603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074252152DNAL7 a10.3390/fermentation70200902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuncey, Lauren 10aDevelopment of Probiotic Almond Beverage Using Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GR-1 Fortified with Short-Chain and Long-Chain Inulin Fibre  aPlant-based beverages are growing in popularity due to the rise of vegetarianism and other health trends. A probiotic almond beverage that combines the properties of almonds, inulin, and Lacticaseibacillusrhamnosus GR-1 may meet the demand for a non-dairy health-promoting food. The purpose of this study was to investigate the viability of L. rhamnosus GR-1 and pH in five fermented almond beverage samples, supplemented with either 2% or 5% (w/v) short-chain or long-chain inulin over 9 h of fermentation and 30 days of refrigerated storage. All almond beverage samples achieved a mean viable count of at least 10⁷ CFU/mL during 9h of fermentation and 30 days of refrigerated storage. The probiotic almond beverage supplemented with 2% (w/v) short-chain inulin had a significantly higher mean microbial count (p = 0.048) and lower pH (p < 0.001) throughout fermentation, while the control and the long-chain inulin treatments had the lowest viable counts and acidity, respectively. This study shows that the addition of short-chain and long-chain inulin had no adverse effects on the viability of L. rhamnosus GR-1. Therefore, the probiotic almond beverage has the potential to be a valid alternative to dairy-based probiotic products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aalmonds 3abeverages 3acold storage 3afermentation 3ahealth promotion 3ainulin 3apH 3aprobiotics 3avegetarian diet 3aviability1 aHekmat, Sharareh 0 tFermentation.g2021 June 03, v. 7, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26730x2311-56377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fermentation70200903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010500167300001600272520127600288592002801564650001801592650002301610650001901633650001601652650001501668650002001683650001101703650004301714650001301757650001901770650002301789650002501812650001701837650001501854651001101869700001601880700002301896700002301919700002001942700002101962700001601983700002001999700002202019700002002041773010002061856005102161852000902212655001202221IND50088077220221117233557.0140412e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008807722DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2011.6162382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeeti, Neeti10aMapping seasonal trends in vegetation using AVHRR-NDVI time series in the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico  ap. 433-442.  aThis research examines the spatio-temporal trends in Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series to ascribe land use change and precipitation to observed changes in land cover from 1982 to 2007 in the Mexican Yucatán Peninsula, using seasonal trend analysis (STA). In addition to discrete land cover transitions across the study region, patterns of agricultural intensification, urban expansion and afforestation in protected areas have enacted changes to the seasonal patterns of apparent greenness observed through STA greenness parameters. The results indicate that the seasonal variation in NDVI can be used to distinguish among different land cover transitions, and the primary differences among these transitions were in changes in overall greenness, peak annual greenness and the timing of the growing season. Associations between greenness trends and precipitation were weak, indicating a human-dominated system for the 26 years examined. Changes in the states of Campeche, Quintana Roo and Yucatán appear to be associated with pasture cultivation, urban expansion-extensive cultivation and urban expansion-intensive cultivation, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aafforestation 3aconservation areas 3agrowing season 3ainventories 3aland cover 3aland use change 3amodels 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apastures 3aremote sensing 3aseasonal variation 3atime series analysis 3aurbanization 3avegetation 3aMexico1 aRogan, John1 aChristman, Zachary1 aEastman, J.

Speeding up the dehydrogenation rate and lowering the reaction temperature are the main focuses of LOHC dehydrogenation catalysts. In this paper, Pd/SBA-15 catalysts (Pd-IP/S15) were prepared by NaOH treatment of surface hydroxyl groups on SBA-15, the ion exchange of Na⁺ with Pd(NH₃)₄²⁺, and then reduction of Pd ions via glow discharge plasma. The dehydrogenation performance of dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole on the prepared catalysts is studied. The turnover frequency of Pd-IP/S15 is 13.94 min⁻¹ at 170°C, which is 10.25 times that of commercial Pd/C. It is ensured via the ion exchange method that Pd(NH₃)₄²⁺ could be precisely targeted at the Si-OH of SBA-15 to form Si-O-Pd(NH₃)₄²⁺, which effectively prevents the aggregation and uncontrollable growth of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) during the in situ reduction by plasma. Pd NPs with high dispersion are obtained on SBA-15, which enhances the catalytic activity of Pd-IP/S15. The coordination of Pd NPs with O of Si-OH on SBA-15 enabled Pd-IP/S15 to exhibit excellent catalytic stability. After 7 dehydrogenation cycles at 180°C, the dehydrogenation efficiency remained above 97%.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3adehydrogenation 3ahydrogen 3aion exchange 3aliquids 3ananocatalysts 3apollution 3aresearch 3atemperature1 aWang, Yindong1 aBai, Xuefeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8757-70340 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 June, v. 29, no. 26 p.39266-39280dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-18926-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245011600161300001800277520136600295592002801661650001601689650001401705650002001719650001301739650001601752650001101768650002301779650001301802650001501815650001301830653001401843653001501857653002201872653001201894653001201906700002201918700001801940700001901958700002101977700001701998773012302015856008002138852000902218655001202227IND60564326320221119044536.0170318e20170308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056432632DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b151672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVegso, Karol10aKinetics of Polymer–Fullerene Phase Separation during Solvent Annealing Studied by Table-Top X-ray Scattering  ap. 8241-8247.  aSolvent annealing is an efficient way of phase separation in polymer–fullerene blends to optimize bulk heterojunction morphology of active layer in polymer solar cells. To track the process in real time across all relevant stages of solvent evaporation, laboratory-based in situ small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements were applied simultaneously to a model P3HT:PCBM blend dissolved in dichlorobenzene. The PCBM molecule agglomeration starts at ∼7 wt % concentration of solid content of the blend in solvent. Although PCBM agglomeration is slowed-down at ∼10 wt % of solid content, the rate constant of phase separation is not changed, suggesting agglomeration and reordering of P3HT molecular chains. Having the longest duration, this stage most affects BHJ morphology. Phase separation is accelerated rapidly at concentration of ∼25 wt %, having the same rate constant as the growth of P3HT crystals. P3HT crystallization is driving force for phase separation at final stages before a complete solvent evaporation, having no visible temporal overlap with PCBM agglomeration. For the first time, such a study was done in laboratory demonstrating potential of the latest generation table-top high-brilliance X-ray source as a viable alternative before more sophisticated X-ray scattering experiments at synchrotron facilities are performed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aannealing 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3aevaporation 3amodels 3aphotovoltaic cells 3apolymers 3aseparation 3asolvents 0aP3HT:PCBM 0asolar cell 0asolvent annealing 0aGI-SAXS 0aGI-WAXS1 aSiffalovic, Peter1 aJergel, Matej1 aNadazdy, Peter1 aNadazdy, Vojtech1 aMajkova, Eva0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Mar. 08, v. 9, no. 9 p.8241-8247dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b151673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02156naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245009200159300002000251520090000271592002801171650001301199650002001212650002301232650002201255650002101277650001801298650001801316650002101334650001301355650001701368700002701385700001301412700001401425700001601439700002101455700002301476700001401499773013401513856007801647852000901725655001201734IND60541631120221122202252.0160822e20151007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054163112DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b080692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Xueguang10aProviding Oligonucleotides with Steric Selectivity by Brush-Polymer-Assisted Compaction  ap. 12466-12469.  aDifficult biopharmaceutical characteristics of oligonucleotides, such as poor enzymatic stability, rapid clearance by reticuloendothelial organs, immunostimulation, and coagulopathies, limit their application as therapeutics. Many of these side effects are initiated via sequence-specific or nonsequence-specific interactions with proteins. Herein, we report a novel form of brush-polymer/DNA conjugate that provides the DNA with nanoscale steric selectivity: Hybridization kinetics with complementary DNA remains nearly unaffected, but interactions with proteins are significantly retarded. The relative lengths of the brush side chain and the DNA strand are found to play a critical role in the degree of selectivity. Being able to evade protein adhesion also improves in vivo biodistribution, thus making these molecular nanostructures promising materials for oligonucleotide-based therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aadverse effects 3abiopharmaceuticals 3acomplementary DNA 3aenzyme stability 3ahybridization 3ananomaterials 3aoligonucleotides 3aproteins 3atherapeutics1 aTrần, Thanh Huyền,1 aJia, Fei1 aTan, Xuyu1 aDavis, Sage1 aKrishnan, Swathi1 aAmiji, Mansoor M.,1 aZhang, Ke0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Oct. 07, v. 137, no. 39 p.12466-12469dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b080693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01655naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245009800164300001800262520051500280592002800795650002400823650002800847650002500875650002300900650002200923650002300945650001700968700006000985700006301045773013301108856007901241852000901320655001201329IND60699477420221119161122.0200619e20200529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069947742DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.0c010232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuruya, Shohei10aCopper-Catalyzed Asymmetric 1,3-Dipolar Cycloaddition of Imino Esters to Unsaturated Sultones  ap. 8142-8148.  aThe asymmetric 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of glycine imino esters to 1-propene-1,3-sultone or sulfocoumarins is described.

To understand how evolution shapes the thermodynamic drivers of catalysis, we optimized the modest activity of a computationally designed enzyme for an elementary proton-transfer reaction by nearly 4 orders of magnitude over 9 rounds of mutagenesis and screening. As theorized for primordial enzymes, the catalytic effects of the original design were almost entirely enthalpic in origin, as were the rate enhancements achieved by laboratory evolution. However, the large reductions in ΔH⧧ were partially offset by a decrease in TΔS⧧ and unexpectedly accompanied by a negative activation heat capacity, signaling strong adaptation to the operating temperature. These findings echo reports of temperature-dependent activation parameters for highly evolved natural enzymes and are relevant to explanations of enzymatic catalysis and adaptation to changing thermal environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3aenzymes 3aheat 3amutagenesis 3areaction kinetics 3ascreening 3atemperature1 aKries, Hajo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4919-28111 aMarchetti, Luca1 aZeymer, Cathleen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7138-381X1 aMittl, Peer R.

In sharp contrast, such recognition is barely detectable in analogous cholesterol-rich, liquid-ordered (l₀) bilayers.

For this purpose, 25 caprine fetal fluids, 18 caprine fetal brains and 10 caprine placentas from 8 dairy/meat goat farms from Argentina were analyzed. Gestational age of the aborted fetuses was determined in 18 cases. Protozoal infections were detected by at least one of the applied diagnostic techniques in 44% (11/25) of examined fetuses; specifically, 24% (6/25) were positive to T. gondii, 8% (2/25) were positive to N. caninum and 12% (3/25) were positive to both parasites. In this study IFAT titers were similarly distributed in younger and older fetuses. Macroscopical and microscopical examination of one placenta revealed chalky nodules in the fetal cotyledons and normal intercotyledonary areas, as well as necrosis and calcification of mesenchymal cells in villi. Tachyzoites were observed in peritoneal wash from 2 mice inoculated with brain and a pool of brain and placenta of two fetuses. Cell culture growth of tachyzoites was achieved from one inoculated mouse, and confirmed as T. gondii by PCR. The T. gondii isolate was identified as atypical or non-canonical by nested-PCR-RFLP. This is the first study that investigated the involvement of N. caninum and T. gondii in cases of goat abortion in Argentina.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeospora caninum 3aToxoplasma gondii 3abioassays 3abrain 3acalcification 3acell culture 3acotyledons 3adiagnostic techniques 3afarms 3afetus 3agestational age 3agoats 3amice 3anecrosis 3aparasites 3aplacenta 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprotozoal infections 3atachyzoites 3avilli 3aArgentina 0aToxoplasma gondii 0aNeospora caninum 0aGoat 0aAbortion1 aMoré, G.1 aBacigalupe, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9983-32931 aRambeaud, M.1 aPardini, L.1 aDellarupe, A.1 aDe Felice, L.1 aGos, M.L.1 aVenturini, M.C.0 tParasitology international.g2014 Dec., v. 63, no. 6 p.865-867dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:12048x1383-57697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2014.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245009100163300002000254520208000274592002802354650002502382650002302407650002202430650003002452650001402482650002702496650001502523700001802538773015502556856008302711852000902794655001202803IND60777732820221121000052.0220520e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077773282DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-18464-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Jundi10aWill China’s R&D investment improve green innovation performance? An empirical study  ap. 39331-39344.  aIn 2020, China’s R&D investment reached 2442.6 billion RMB, and it ranks second in the world, but the performance of green innovation has not proportionately improved. The question of how to promote the improvement of green innovation performance is particularly important in order to mitigate future environmental problems and issues due to rapid development of China’s economy. While past research has examined the relationship between R&D investment and green innovation, they have not explicitly considered the effect of regional technological innovation level on this relationship. Hence, we fill this gap by exploring the relationship between R&D investment and green innovation performance using data from various regions in China from 2015 to 2019, under the effect of a threshold variable, namely, technological innovation. We explore the impact of economic development level, environmental regulation level, foreign direct investment, and science and technology in fiscal expenditures on green innovation performance. The empirical results show that when the regional technological innovation level is used as the threshold variable, the R&D investment has a significant double-threshold effect with the lagging three-phase green innovation performance. When the technological innovation level is low (< 0.1082), R&D investment has a negative impact on green innovation performance. Moreover, when the technological innovation level is high (>0.5837), the impact of regional R&D investment on green innovation performance is sub-optimal. Consequently, the range of [0.1082 to 0.5837] is the best range for the positive impact of R&D investment on green innovation performance. Furthermore, among China’s 30 provinces and cities, 24% (mostly areas located in the southwest and northeast of China) have the technological innovation level in the optimal range. Our results help explain the current status of China's R&D investment and green innovation development, and provide a theoretical basis for the formulation of government innovation investment policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic development 3aempirical research 3aenvironmental law 3aforeign direct investment 3apollution 3asustainable technology 3atechnology1 aTeo, Thompson0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 June, v. 29, no. 26 p.39331-39344dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-18464-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245011700157520140100274592002801675650002301703650002001726650002201746650002101768650001201789650001201801650001401813650001001827650001001837650001401847650002001861650002601881700001801907700001901925700001901944700002001963773012201983856007902105852000902184655001202193IND60794323920221119123201.0220922e20220914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079432392DNAL7 a10.3390/plants111823972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Qi 10aGenome-Wide Identification and Analysis of Lbd Transcription Factor Genes in Jatropha curcas and Related Species  aLateral organ boundaries domain (LBD) proteins are plant-specific transcription factors that play important roles in organ development and stress response. However, the function of LBD genes has not been reported in Euphorbiaceae. In this paper, we used Jatropha curcas as the main study object and added rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) and castor (Ricinus communis L.) to take a phylogenetic analysis of LBD genes. Of LBD, 33, 58, 54 and 30 members were identified in J. curcas, rubber tree, cassava and castor, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis showed that LBD members of Euphorbiaceae could be classified into two major classes and seven subclasses (Ia-Ie,IIa-IIb), and LBD genes of Euphorbiaceae tended to cluster in the same branch. Further analysis showed that the LBD genes of Euphorbiaceae in the same clade usually had similar protein motifs and gene structures, and tissue expression patterns showed that they also have similar expression profiles. JcLBDs in class Ia and Ie are mainly expressed in male and female flowers, and there are multiple duplication genes with similar expression profiles in these clades. It was speculated that they are likely to play important regulatory roles in flower development. Our study provided a solid foundation for further investigation of the role of LBD genes in the sexual differentiaion of J. curcas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHevea brasiliensis 3aJatropha curcas 3aManihot esculenta 3aRicinus communis 3acassava 3afemales 3aflowering 3agenes 3amales 3aphylogeny 3astress response 3atranscription factors1 aYang, Zitian 1 aYang, Wenjing 1 aGao, Xiaoyang 1 aLiu, Changning 0 tPlants.g2022 Sept. 14, v. 11, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111823973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03812naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006200145245012300207300001800330500001400348500002000362520193100382592002802313596004702341596009002388650001202478650001602490650001102506650002402517650001502541650002602556650002602582650001502608650002802623650001302651650002102664650000902685650001702694650002102711650003302732650002102765700006402786700006302850700002102913700006202934700002302996700005503019773012003074856007903194852000903273655001203282IND60701113220221118074027.0200707e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070111322DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.135602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPichon, Noémie A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2972-191210aDecomposition disentangled: A test of the multiple mechanisms by which nitrogen enrichment alters litter decomposition  ap. 1485-1496.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNitrogen (N) enrichment has direct effects on ecosystem functioning by altering soil abiotic conditions and indirect effects by reducing plant diversity and shifting plant functional composition from dominance by slow to fast growing species. Litter decomposition is a key ecosystem function and is affected by N enrichment either by a change in litter quality (the recalcitrance of the plant material) or through a change in soil quality (the abiotic and biotic components of the soil that affect decomposition). How the direct and indirect effects of N alter soil and litter quality remains poorly known. We designed a large grassland field experiment manipulating N enrichment, plant species richness and functional composition in a full factorial design. We used three complementary litterbag experiments, combined in a structural equation model (SEM), to quantify the effects of the treatments and various measures of functional composition and diversity on litter and soil quality and overall decomposition. Our results revealed multiple drivers of litter quality and showed that nutrient concentrations (N and calcium) were about twice as important as structural components (leaf dry matter content, fibres) in determining litter quality. Overall the experimental results suggest that N enrichment increases litter decomposition mostly indirectly through a shift in functional composition toward faster growing plant species, producing higher quality litter. N enrichment also altered soil quality and thereby litter decomposition, through its effects on vegetation cover. Our approach provides a mechanistic tool to test the drivers of litter decomposition across different ecosystems. Our results show that litter quality is determined by several nutrient and structure traits and highlight the importance of considering shifts in plant species composition when assessing the effects of N enrichment on decomposition.  aPublisher supplied data  aRYC‐2016‐ 20604cRamón y Cajal, Spain  a160212cSchweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung 3acalcium 3adegradation 3adesign 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3afield experimentation 3agrasslands 3aleaf dry matter content 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3asoil 3asoil quality 3aspecies richness 3astructural equation modeling 3avegetation cover1 aCappelli, Seraina L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8141-404X1 aSoliveres, Santiago1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9661-71921 aHölzel, Norbert1 aKlaus, Valentin H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7469-68001 aKleinebecker, Till1 aAllan, Eric1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9641-94360 tFunctional ecology.g2020 July, v. 34, no. 7 p.1485-1496dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44821x0269-84637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.135603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02065naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245009500161300002000256520107500276592002801351650001501379650002201394650001101416650001901427650001401446650001301460650001701473700001401490773015501504856008301659852000901742655001201751IND60777732920221121000043.0220520e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077773292DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-18182-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Yu13aAn emergency supplies scheduling for chemical industry park: based on super network theory  ap. 39345-39358.  aIn a concentrated area of chemical industry parks (CIPs), emergency relief efficiency is not only affected by the rescue capability of themselves, but also their coordination relationships with other CIPs. Previous studies focus on the location of resource warehouse and the scheduling of logistics transportation, in the relief process after unexpected events, but rarely integrate them ideally in practice. This paper utilizes the super network theory to propose a regional emergency scheduling model to improve collaboration efficiency among primary relief centers (PRC), local relief centers (LRC), and CIPs. So, the proposed super network model fills the research gap of only considering emergency logistic supply chain and provides decision scheme regarding the emergency material dispatch plan. We developed a modified projection algorithm to solve the scheduling problem by turning it to a variational inequality and compare the performance under several disaster scenarios. The practicability of the model is proved by the result of the numerical example given.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3achemical industry 3amodels 3anetwork theory 3apollution 3aresearch 3asupply chain1 aWang, Fei0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 June, v. 29, no. 26 p.39345-39358dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-18182-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02181naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245010400167300001600271520088000287592002801167596004701195650003401242650001501276650002501291650001601316650001401332650002101346650001101367650001401378650001701392650001601409653001701425653001501442653002801457653001601485700002001501700001701521700002201538773010101560856007701661852000901738655001201747IND60791216720221121040402.0220826e20220927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079121672DNAL7 a10.1515/hf-2022-00232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAufischer, Gottfried10aDepolymerisation of kraft lignin to obtain high value-added products: antioxidants and UV absorbers  ap. 845-852.  aThis study demonstrates that bio-based products of lignin depolymerisation can potentially replace common antioxidants and UV absorbers in the plastics and cosmetics industries. The kraft lignin Indulin AT was used to obtain low-MW lignin and monomers & oligomers rich in phenolic hydroxyl groups. Both thermo-oxidative stability and antioxidant activity significantly improved upon lignin depolymerisation. The results from oxidation induction time differential scanning calorimetry (OIT-DSC) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) measurements show that the lignin based depolymerisation products are comparable with commercial antioxidants like pentaerythritol-tetrakis-(3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionate) (Irganox 1010). UV/vis spectroscopy was investigated to confirm absorption of the depolymerisation products in the UVA and UVB range (280–400 nm).  aPublisher supplied data  aWood K plus Comet Funding Period 2019-2022 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aabsorption 3aantioxidant activity 3acalorimetry 3acosmetics 3adepolymerization 3alignin 3aoxidation 3aspectroscopy 3avalue added 0aantioxidants 0aIndulin AT 0alignin depolymerisation 0aUV absorber1 aSüss, Raphaela1 aKamm, Birgit1 aPaulik, Christian0 tHolzforschung.g2022 Sept. 27, v. 76, no. 9 p.845-852dDe GruyterwJournal:1940x1437-434X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/hf-2022-00233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02459naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245013300205300001600338520112700354592002801481650002301509650001101532650002101543650003001564650001601594650001401610650001901624700001601643700001401659700001901673700001501692700001301707700005201720700001601772700005701788700002001845773009001865856008501955852000902040655001202049IND60679884420221121041625.0200221e20200415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067988442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2019.12.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xigui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8473-475410aBand-gap engineering and structure evolution of confined long linear carbon chains@double-walled carbon nanotubes under pressure  ap. 266-272.  aLong linear carbon chains (LLCCs) with sp hybridization are emerging as a promising realization of carbyne, which has been predicted to be a semiconducting nanowire with tunable electronic properties by external stimuli. Here, the LLCCs confined in double-walled carbon nanotubes have been studied by resonant Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory under high pressure. Our results indicate that the band gap linearly decreases from 2.18 to 1.73 eV as pressure increases, which can be explained by the reduction of the bond length alternation of the chains due to the enhanced interaction between the inner tube and the carbon chain. Furthermore, both our experiment and theoretical calculations show that an irreversible pressure-induced interlinkage between inner tubes and carbon chains forms at the system collapse pressure. In our study this value is of 20 GPa, which is determined by the inner tube diameter. These findings provide important insights for tuning the structural and electronic properties of carbon chains, thus may open new perspectives for the realization of nanoscale cables and devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3adensity functional theory 3aengineering 3ananowires 3asemiconductors1 aLv, Chaofan1 aYao, Zhen1 aYao, Mingguang1 aQin, Jinxu1 aLi, Xing1 aShi, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4175-78031 aDu, Mingrun1 aLiu, Bingbing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0152-44691 aShan, Chong-Xin0 tCarbon.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 159 p.266-272dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.12.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245010600159300002000265520168300285592002801968650001401996650001302010650001302023650001802036650001502054650004402069650001102113650002202124650002002146650001102166700001502177700001402192700001702206700001702223700006002240700001902300700005802319773014902377856007602526852000902602655001202611IND60655139320190920000000.0190731e20190711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065513932DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b030092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Xiting10aCombinatorial Identification of Hydrides in a Ligated Ag₄₀ Nanocluster with Noncompact Metal Core  ap. 11905-11911.  aNo formation of bulk silver hydride has been reported. Until very recently, only a few silver nanoclusters containing hydrides have been successfully prepared. However, due to the lack of effective techniques and also poor stability of hydride-containing Ag nanoclusters, the identification of hydrides’ location within Ag nanoclusters is challenging and not yet achieved, although some successes have been reported on clusters of several Ag atoms. In this work, we report a detailed structural and spectroscopic characterization of the [Ag₄₀(DMBT)₂₄(PPh₃)₈H₁₂]²⁺ (Ag₄₀H₁₂) cluster (DMBT = 2,4-dimethylbenzenethiol). The metal framework consists of three concentric shells of Ag₈@Ag₂₄@Ag₈, which can be described as (ν₁-cube)@(truncated-ν₃-octahedron)@(ν₂-cube), respectively. The presence of 12 hydrides in each cluster was systematically identified by various techniques. Based on a detailed analysis of the structural features and ¹H and ²H NMR spectra, the positions of the 12 hydrides were determined to be residing on the 12 edges of the cubic core. As a result, the electron count of the Ag₄₀ cluster is a two-electron superatomic system instead of a 14-electron system. Moreover, based on our DFT calculations and experimental probes, it was demonstrated that the 12 hydrides play a crucial role in stabilizing both the electronic and geometric structure of the Ag₄₀H₁₂ cluster. The successful synthesis of stable hydride-containing Ag nanoclusters and the identification of hydride positions are expected to simulate research attention on both synthesis and application of hydride-containing Ag nanomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeuterium 3ageometry 3ahydrides 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asilver 3aspectral analysis 3astable isotopes 3athiols1 aSun, Cunfa1 aLi, Xihua1 aMalola, Sami1 aTeo, Boon K.1 aHäkkinen, Hannu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8558-54361 aZheng, Lan-Sun1 aZheng, Nanfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9879-47900 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 July 11, v. 141, no. 30 p.11905-11911dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b030093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03698naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100002100181245011700202300001800319506007600337520196300413592002802376506003702404650001102441650001102452650002502463650002502488650003102513650003602544650002402580650001902604650004002623650004102663650002402704650002202728653002602750653002202776653002202798653002502820653002502845653002602870700002202896700002102918700001702939773014102956856007403097852000903171655001203180IND60118922020221207113337.0141127e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011892202DNAL7 a248601852pmid7 aPMC40859682pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/eru2052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWay, Danielle A.10aIncreasing water use efficiency along the C₃ to C₄ evolutionary pathway: a stomatal optimization perspective  ap. 3683-3693.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aC₄ photosynthesis evolved independently numerous times, probably in response to declining atmospheric CO₂ concentrations, but also to high temperatures and aridity, which enhance water losses through transpiration. Here, the environmental factors controlling stomatal behaviour of leaf-level carbon and water exchange were examined across the evolutionary continuum from C₃ to C₄ photosynthesis at current (400 μmol mol⁻¹) and low (280 μmol mol⁻¹) atmospheric CO₂ conditions. To this aim, a stomatal optimization model was further developed to describe the evolutionary continuum from C₃ to C₄ species within a unified framework. Data on C₃, three categories of C₃–C₄ intermediates, and C₄ Flaveria species were used to parameterize the stomatal model, including parameters for the marginal water use efficiency and the efficiency of the CO₂-concentrating mechanism (or C₄ pump); these two parameters are interpreted as traits reflecting the stomatal and photosynthetic adjustments during the C₃ to C₄ transformation. Neither the marginal water use efficiency nor the C₄ pump strength changed significantly from C₃ to early C₃–C₄ intermediate stages, but both traits significantly increased between early C₃–C₄ intermediates and the C₄-like intermediates with an operational C₄ cycle. At low CO₂, net photosynthetic rates showed continuous increases from a C₃ state, across the intermediates and towards C₄ photosynthesis, but only C₄-like intermediates and C₄ species (with an operational C₄ cycle) had higher water use efficiencies than C₃ Flaveria. The results demonstrate that both the marginal water use efficiency and the C₄ pump strength increase in C₄ Flaveria to improve their photosynthesis and water use efficiency compared with C₃ species. These findings emphasize that the advantage of the early intermediate stages is predominantly carbon based, not water related.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon 3amodels 3awater use efficiency 2aBiological Evolution 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aFlaveriaxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aModels, Theoretical 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPlant Stomataxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPlant Transpiration 2aWaterxmetabolism 0aC3–C4 intermediates 0aC3 photosynthesis 0aleaf gas exchange 0aphotosynthetic model 0astomatal conductance 0awater use efficiency.1 aKatul, Gabriel G.1 aManzoni, Stefano1 aVico, Giulia0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2014 July, v. 65, no. 13 p.3683-3693dOxford University Press [etc.]wJournal:jnl44658x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eru2053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245012000160500001400280520141200294592002801706650002101734650001801755650001701773650001201790650001901802650001901821650002401840650001801864650001601882650001701898650001901915650000901934650002301943650001401966650001401980650002101994650001302015650000902028650001702037700001402054700002202068700002102090700002002111700002502131700002402156700002302180700002402203773012602227856007702353852000902430655001202439IND60711643720221116222837.0200928e20200914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071164372DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox90908602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBode, David 10aOxidative Stress and Inflammatory Modulation of Ca2+ Handling in Metabolic HFpEF-Related Left Atrial Cardiomyopathy  aNAL-light  aMetabolic syndrome-mediated heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is commonly accompanied by left atrial (LA) cardiomyopathy, significantly affecting morbidity and mortality. We evaluate the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and intrinsic inflammation (TNF-α, IL-10) related to dysfunctional Ca²⁺ homeostasis of LA cardiomyocytes in a rat model of metabolic HFpEF. ZFS-1 obese rats showed features of HFpEF and atrial cardiomyopathy in vivo: increased left ventricular (LV) mass, E/e’ and LA size and preserved LV ejection fraction. In vitro, LA cardiomyocytes exhibited more mitochondrial-fission (MitoTracker) and ROS-production (H2DCF). In wildtype (WT), pro-inflammatory TNF-α impaired cellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis, while anti-inflammatory IL-10 had no notable effect (confocal microscopy; Fluo-4). In HFpEF, TNF-α had no effect on Ca²⁺ homeostasis associated with decreased TNF-α receptor expression (western blot). In addition, IL-10 substantially improved Ca²⁺ release and reuptake, while IL-10 receptor-1 expression was unaltered. Oxidative stress in metabolic syndrome mediated LA cardiomyopathy was increased and anti-inflammatory treatment positively affected dysfunctional Ca²⁺ homeostasis. Our data indicates, that patients with HFpEF-related LA dysfunction might profit from IL-10 targeted therapy, which should be further explored in preclinical trials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aanimal models 3aantioxidants 3acalcium 3acardiomyocytes 3acardiomyopathy 3aconfocal microscopy 3aheart failure 3ahomeostasis 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-10 3amass 3ametabolic syndrome 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aoxidative stress 3apatients 3arats 3atherapeutics1 aWen, Yan 1 aHegemann, Niklas 1 aPrimessnig, Uwe 1 aParwani, Abdul 1 aBoldt, Leif-Hendrik 1 aM.

Overexpression of Dga1∆Np in the ∆snf2 mutant, however, did not increase lipid content as expected, which prompted us to search for a more suitable strain in which to study the role of Dga1∆Np in lipid accumulation. We found that the overexpression of Dga1∆Np in the ∆dga1 mutant effectively increased the lipid content up to about 45 % in the medium containing 10 % glucose. The high lipid content of the transformant was dependent on glucose concentration, nitrogen limitation, and active leucine biosynthesis. To better understand the effect of dga1 disruption on the ability of Dga1∆Np to stimulate lipid accumulation, the ∆dga1-1 mutant, in which the 3'-terminal 36 bp of the dga1 open reading frame (ORF) remained, and the ∆dga1-2 mutant, in which the 3'-terminal 36 bp were also deleted, were prepared with URA3 disruption cassettes. Surprisingly, the overexpression of Dga1∆Np in the ∆dga1-1 mutant had a lower lipid content than the original ∆dga1 mutant, whereas overexpression in the ∆dga1-2 mutant led to a high lipid content of about 45 %. These results indicated that deletion of the 3' terminal region of the dga1 ORF, rather than abrogation of genomic Dga1p expression, was crucial for the effect of Dga1∆Np on lipid accumulation. To investigate whether dga1 disruption affected gene expression adjacent to DGA1, we found that the overexpression of Esa1p together with Dga1∆Np in the ∆dga1 mutant reverted the lipid content to the level of the wild-type strain overexpressing Dga1∆Np. In addition, RT-qPCR analysis revealed that ESA1 mRNA expression in the ∆dga1 mutant was decreased compared to the wild-type strain at the early stages of culture, suggesting that lowered Esa1p expression is involved in the effect of dga1 disruption on Dga1∆Np-dependent lipid accumulation. These results provide a new strategy to engineer S. cerevisiae for optimal lipid production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aamino acids 3abiosynthesis 3adiacylglycerol acyltransferase 3agene overexpression 3aglucose 3alipid content 3alipids 3amessenger RNA 3amutants 3anitrogen 3aopen reading frames 3ayeasts 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aDiacylglycerol O-Acyltransferasexbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aGene Expression 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aLipid Metabolism 2aMetabolic Engineeringxmethods 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aSequence Deletion1 aKimura, Kazuyoshi1 aUemura, Hiroshi1 aYamaoka, Masakazu0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2013 Aug., v. 97, no. 16 p.7345-7355dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-013-4915-9  aDNAL 7aarticle03886naa a2200889 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002600155245010200181500002200283520165000305592002801955650001401983650002101997650002202018650003902040650001702079650001002096650001702106650003102123650001002154650001902164650001502183650001102198650001702209650001902226650001802245650001702263650001302280650001502293650003602308650001902344653000802363653000802371653000802379653000802387653000902395653000802404653001202412653000802424653000802432653000802440653000902448653000802457653000702465653000702472653000702479653000802486653000702494653000702501653000802508653000702516653001102523653000702534653000702541653000902548653000702557653000902564653000802573653000702581653000802588653001602596653001702612653001602629653001802645653002802663700001502691700002102706700005502727773010302782856009002885852000902975655001202984IND60625061220221119081237.0190923e20181129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062506122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2018.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKommineni, Nagavendra10aCabazitaxel and thymoquinone co-loaded lipospheres as a synergistic combination for breast cancer  aPre-press version  aCabazitaxel as microtubule inhibitor and thymoquinone as HDAC inhibitor affects the important genes like p53, STAT3, Bax, BCL-2, p21 and down regulation of NF-κB are reported for potential activity against breast tumors. However, poor aqueous solubility and permeability hinders the delivery of these drugs to target site. To address the delivery challenges cabazitaxel and thymoquinone co-loaded lipospheres were developed. Lipospheres are the lipid based self-assemblies of particle size below 150 nm were prepared with more than 90% entrapment efficiency for both the drugs. In vitro drug release studies revealed there was a sustained diffusion controlled drug release from liposphere matrix leading to decrease in particle size with increase in zeta potential. Cytotoxicity studies on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells demonstrated cabazitaxel and thymoquinone as synergistic combination for the treatment of breast cancer which was proved by CompuSyn software. Enhanced efficacy of developed lipospheres can be due to rapid cellular internalization which was observed in confocal laser scanning microscopy. Drastic changes in cancer cell morphology such as nuclear fragmentation were observed upon treatment with these lipospheres in comparison to combination solution as observed in fluorescent imaging which are the hall marks of apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis and apoptosis studies confirmed the increased Sub G1 phase arrest as well as cell death due to apoptosis. Thus, as per observed results, it can be concluded that cabazitaxel and thymoquinone co-loaded lipospheres are the efficient delivery vehicles in management of breast cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3acomputer software 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3afluorescence 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aimage analysis 3ainterphase 3alipids 3amicrotubules 3aneoplasm cells 3aparticle size 3apermeability 3aquinones 3asolubility 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3azeta potential 0aCBZ 0aTMQ 0aLSP 0asol 0aDMEM 0aFBS 0aRP-HPLC 0aPDA 0aPDI 0aPBS 0aDMSO 0aMTT 0aTO 0aTP 0aTM 0aNMP 0aTC 0aTS 0akDa 0amL 0aEgg PC 0aDL 0aAO 0aEtBr 0aPI 0aFITC 0aEPR 0aEE 0aFig 0aCabazitaxel 0aThymoquinone 0aLipospheres 0aBreast cancer 0aSynergistic combination1 aSaka, Raju1 aBulbake, Upendra1 aKhan, Wahid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5365-96480 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2018 Nov. 29, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl20199x0009-30847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2018.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02405naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245009400164300001600258520106700274592002801341650001601369650001701385650001801402650002101420650002101441650002101462650001301483650001301496650001301509650002001522653001801542653001401560653001301574653001001587700001401597700001801611700001501629700001401644700001301658700001501671700001501686700001801701773010901719856008601828852000901914655001201923IND60533286920221122103741.0190319e20140122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053328692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2013.10.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Can10aSodium selenite regulates phenolics accumulation and tuber development of purple potatoes  ap. 142-147.  aIt has been reported that selenium could increase nutritional components as carbohydrates, organic selenium, proteins and total amino acids of potatoes. However, there have been few reports on selenium-enriched purple potatoes as yet. In this study, the effects of selenium on phenolics and tuber development of purple potatoes were investigated. The main phenolic components in purple potatoes were separated and identified as chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, malvidin-5-glu-3-dirhamnose-glucose, caffeic acid-acetylrhamnose ester and caffeic acid-prenylrhamnose ester. The total phenolics including malvidin-5-glu-3-dirhamnose-glucose could be directly quantified at 325nm, with chlorogenic acid as a standard. The main phenolic components were significantly increased by selenium. Total tuber weight was significantly increased by selenium (R2=0.964, P=0.002). In conclusion, selenium significantly increased phenolic components and promoted tuber formation of purple potatoes; in this sense, selenium-enriched purple potato should be a better functional food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3acaffeic acid 3acarbohydrates 3achlorogenic acid 3afunctional foods 3anutrient content 3apotatoes 3aproteins 3aselenium 3asodium selenite 0aPurple potato 0aPhenolics 0aSelenium 0aTuber1 aMa, Qiong1 aTang, Qiao Y.1 aAi, Xun R.1 aZhou, Zhi1 aYao, Lan1 aWang, Ying1 aWang, Qing1 aDong, Jing Z.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2014 Jan. 22, v. 165 p.142-147dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2013.10.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02210naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245006800183300001600251500001900267520096100286592002801247596013801275650002101413650002901434650001801463653001001481653001801491653002201509653002301531700002001554700002701574700001701601773013601618856008501754852000901839655001201848IND60692758920221119145237.0200503e20160402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069275892DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2015.11169242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedina-Martínez, María S.10aAntimicrobial activity of hydroxytyrosol: a current controversy  ap. 801-810.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study focus on the main factors that affect the antimicrobial capacity of hydroxytyrosol, including the concentration (200, 400, and 1000 μg/mL), target strains, and the culture media (nutrient-rich and less-rich culture media). The potential HT degradation was also evaluated by HPLC-PAD. Kinetic parameters from growth curves showed that HT concentrations produced a doses-dependent shift when compared to the untreated control. In most of the cases, the highest tested dose (1000 μg/mL) was needed to inhibit growth of the selected strains. However, all the strains were able to grow even at the highest HT dose when cultivated in nutrient-rich culture media. It was observed that HT concentrations were reduced by about 15%, except for Escherichia coli 533 and 679 in Muller Hinton broth, where HT was reduced up to 35%. The results showed a limited antimicrobial activity, contrary to information previously published in some research papers.  aPublisher supplied data  cCOST ACTION FA1202 BacFoodNet. P.

To apply a correct SLM in particular sample pretreatment, rapid determination of the transfer of analytes and matrix compounds across the SLM is necessary, which requires the use of an analytical method with universal detection technique. Capillary electrophoresis with capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection (CE-C⁴D) has proven to be a useful tool for the determination of SLM selectivity. Background electrolyte solution consisting of 1M acetic acid (pH 2.4) was used for simultaneous separation and detection of three basic drugs (nortriptyline, haloperidol and loperamide) and major matrix components (inorganic cations, proteins, amino acids, etc.) after electromembrane extraction (EME) of standard solutions and complex samples. The CE-C⁴D method has evidenced for the first time that large proteins, such as human serum albumin, are efficiently retained on all examined SLMs and that transfer of other matrix components and the analytes is strongly SLM dependent. Excellent transfer of the analytes was achieved across SLMs impregnated with 2-nitrophenyl octyl ether (NPOE) or 1-ethyl-2-nitrobenzene, however, an increased co-extraction of interfering matrix components, which disabled quantitative determination of haloperidol with the current CE-C⁴D setup, was observed for the latter. After addition of a commonly used ion carrier (bis(2-ethylhexyl)phosphate) to NPOE, a wide range of matrix components were transferred across the SLM with no measurable transfer of the analytes. Best selectivity regarding transfer of the basic drugs and elimination of matrix components was obtained using SLM impregnated with NPOE. An optimized EME-CE-C⁴D method was used to determine the basic drugs in various samples and satisfactory analytical parameters were obtained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3ahaloperidol 3aquantitative analysis 3amonitoring 3aliquid membranes 3acations 3achromatography 3aamino acids 3acapillary electrophoresis 3apH 3ahuman serum albumin 0aelectrolytes1 aBoček, P.q(Petr),0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 Dec. 7, v. 1267 p.96-101dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01377naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245009200167300001800259500002900277520034000306592002800646650001500674650001100689650001100700650001600711700001600727700005400743700005400797773012000851856008300971852000901054655001201063IND60738207520221120054448.0210521e20210511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073820752DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c008352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, Li-Qiang10aCobalt-Catalyzed Umpolung Alkylation of Imines To Generate α-Branched Aliphatic Amines  ap. 3818-3822.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aHere we report a general and mild approach to prepare α-branched aliphatic amines from imines.

Some strains of Listeria monocytogenes can persist over months or years in meat processing plants increasing the risk of product contamination. The presence of L. monocytogenes was examined in 10 dry-cured ham processing facilities. A total of 1801 samples were collected from environment and equipment, during processing (1095) and after cleaning and disinfection (706). These samples were taken from non-food contact (736) and food contact (1065) surfaces. In addition, 204 samples from ham surfaces were also analysed. Prevalence varied from 6% to 34% among facilities, and was higher during processing than after cleaning and disinfection (24.8% vs 11.0%) and from non-food than from food contact surfaces (22.6% vs 17.4%). L. monocytogenes serotype 1/2a was predominant (53.9%), followed by 1/2c (26.0%) and 1/2b (15.3%) and less frequently 4b (4.8%). A total of 142 different pulsotypes were registered. Potential persistent L.monocytogenes strains were isolated in 9 out the 10 facilities, with no more than 6 pulsotypes in a given plant. Two pulsotypes were common in different installations, detected before and after cleaning and disinfection, highlighting the importance of monitoring the presence of this pathogen in dry-cured ham processing environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3acured meats 3adisinfection 3aequipment 3afood contamination 3afood microbiology 3aham 3alisteriosis 3apathogens 3arisk 3aserotypes 0aContamination 0aPFGE 0aEnvironment 0aSurfaces1 aMateo-Vivaracho, Laura1 aGuillamón, Eva,1 aFernández-León, María Fernanda1 aBravo, Daniel1 aPeirotén, Ángela1 aMedina, Margarita1 aGarcía-Lafuente, Ana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5147-31450 tFood microbiology.g2020 Dec., v. 92 p.103581-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2020.1035813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03123naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245009800172300001400270520139400284592002801678650002101706650002701727650002601754650002501780650001701805650002001822650001001842650002201852650002201874650001101896650001901907653000801926653000701934653000801941653000901949653000901958653001101967653000801978653000701986653000701993653000702000653000902007653000902016653000702025653000702032653000802039653002902047653002502076653001602101653002902117653003202146653002102178700006602199700001902265773011402284856009002398852000902488655001202497IND60625061520221119081056.0190214e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062506152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2018.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoyo, Javier10aPhysical states and thermodynamic properties of model gram-negative bacterial inner membranes  ap. 57-64.  aNovel antimicrobial agents are focused to interact with the bacterial membrane whose lipid composition (number and position of unsaturations and lipid headgroup) is adapted according to environmental signals. The anticipation of the adapted membrane properties is of high relevance to increase the targetability of such drugs. Herein, natural lipids extracted from Escherichia coli -phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL)- are used to form biomimetic membranes constituted by several PE:lipid ratios using the Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett techniques. The use of these techniques and the natural myriad of each lipid structures that constitute the biological E.coli membrane establishes a simple and reproducible model to evaluate the lipid-lipid interactions. PE and PG present similar shape and size, thus establish ideal and fluid -liquid expanded (LE) state - mixtures, whereas the differences between PE and CL motivate the formation of non-ideal and fluid (LE state) mixtures. The same physical state and the minor differences in elasticity (differences in the inverse of the compressibility modulus < 15 mN·m−1) between both systems regardless the PE content in the (PE:lipid) mixture suggest that the changes in the lipid composition influence the membrane proteins function rather than affecting the rigidity of the bacterial membrane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aanti-infective agents 3aartificial membranes 3acardiolipins 3acompressibility 3adrugs 3alipid composition 3amembrane proteins 3amodels 3athermodynamics 0aAFM 0aCL 0aCLP 0aDPPE 0aDPPG 0aE.coli 0aPLE 0aLB 0aLC 0aLE 0aPOPE 0aPOPG 0aPE 0aPG 0aSPB 0aPhosphatidylethanolamine 0aPhosphatidylglycerol 0aCardiolipin 0aLipid-lipid interactions 0aBacterial mimetic membranes 0aEscherichia coli1 aTorrent-Burgués, Juan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4952-736X1 aTzanov, Tzanko0 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2019 Jan., v. 218 p.57-64dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl20199x0009-30847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2018.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002600154245017500180300001400355520132600369592002801695650002501723650002201748650001101770650001101781650002901792650001301821650001201834650002001846700002001866700002801886700006601914773012001980856008902100852000902189655001202198IND60543406820221119204621.0190410e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054340682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2015.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNellaepalli, Sreedhar10aAntimycin A sensitive pathway independent from PGR5 cyclic electron transfer triggers non-photochemical reduction of PQ pool and state transitions in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 24-33.  aWe investigated the mechanism involved in triggering state transitions at 40°C in Arabidopsis thaliana. Leaves (1–6week old) exposed to 40°C exhibited state II transition indicating its role as one of the earliest stress responsive mechanism apart from regulation of light energy distribution between photosystem (PS)II and PSI. Post illumination transients (rise in Fo′) revealed that non-photochemical reduction of PQ pool at 40°C in dark is responsible for activation of STN7 kinase, consequently light harvesting complex (LHC)II phosphorylation leading to state II condition. Later, in pgr5 mutant, non-photochemical reduction of PQ pool was observed indicating the involvement of alternative electron transfer routes. In chlororespiratory mutant crr2-2, state II transition occurred signifying that the reduction of PQ pool is independent from NDH mediated cyclic electron transfer. Further, antimycin A inhibitor studies in wt and mutants revealed its inhibitory action on non-photochemical reduction of PQ pool affecting both LHCII phosphorylation and migration to PSI which leads to state I. Thus, our study showed that antimycin A sensitive pathway independent from PGR5 dependent cyclic electron transfer, is responsible for inducing non-photochemical reduction of PQ pool and state transitions at 40°C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3aleaves 3alight harvesting complex 3alighting 3amutants 3aphosphorylation1 aKodru, Sireesha1 aRaghavendra, Agepati S.1 aSubramanyam, Rajagopal1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3872-83900 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2015 May, v. 146 p.24-33dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2015.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01743naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006100140245007600201300001800277520057800295592002800873650001500901650001400916650002000930650003100950650001500981650001600996700001801012700001601030700001201046700001701058700001901075700001801094700001401112700001501126773013301141856007401274852000901348655001201357IND60636337620221120121906.0190408e20190404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063633762DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc01027k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQinThese authors contributed equally to this work., Xuan10aAutophagy inducing cyclic peptides constructed by methionine alkylation  ap. 4198-4201.  aPeptides that induced autophagy at micromolar concentrations with improved proteolytic resistance properties were generated using the facile methionine bis-alkylation method.

Four hypotheses were tested using carbon (δ¹³C) and nitrogen (δ¹⁵N) stable isotope values as a proxy for foraging behavior: 1) species exhibit ontogenetic shifts in habitat and thus display a shift in ¹³C with differential use of the continental shelf; 2) species exhibit ontogenetic prey shifts (i.e. from smaller to larger prey items) and become enriched in ¹⁵N; 3) individuals acquire energy from spatially confined local resource pools and exhibit limited displacement; and 4) species exhibit similarly sized and highly overlapping trophic niches. We found some evidence for ontogenetic shifts in habitat‐use (δ¹³C) for thorny and little skate and diet (δ¹⁵N) of thorny and winter skate and hypothesize that individuals exhibit gradual trophic niche transition, especially in δ¹⁵N space, rather than a clear and distinct shift in diet throughout ontogeny. Spatial isoscapes generated for little, thorny, and winter skate highlighted distinct spatial patterns in isotopic composition across the coastal shelf. For little and thorny skate, patterns mimicked expected spatial variability in the isotopic composition of phytoplankton/POM, suggesting limited displacement and utilization of spatially confined resource pools. Winter skate, however, exhibited a much narrower range of δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N values, suggesting individuals may use resources from a more confined latitudinal range. Although high total trophic niche overlap was observed between some species (e.g. little and thorny skate), sympatric species (e.g. little and winter skate) exhibited a degree of trophic niche separation. These findings offer new insight into the trophic dynamics of a poorly‐studied, vulnerable group of predators, and highlight a need to re‐examine assumptions pertaining to aspects of their ecology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmblyraja radiata 3aLeucoraja erinacea 3acarbon 3acontinental shelf 3adiet 3aecological differentiation 3aenergy 3aforaging 3aniches 3anitrogen 3aontogeny 3aphytoplankton 3apredators 3astable isotopes 3asympatry 3awinter1 aOlin, Jill A.1 aPower, Michael1 aCerrato, Robert M.1 aFrisk, Michael G.0 tEcography.g2019 May, v. 42, no. 5 p.1037-1049dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3867072x0906-75907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.039903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245011700164500001900281520147800300592002801778650002601806650002701832650002701859650001601886650002901902650001301931650001901944650001001963650001801973650001601991650001602007650001202023650002802035650001202063650002802075650001402103650001202117653002202129653002402151653001702175653001402192700005502206773010002261856008102361852000902442655001202451IND60700786220221122074053.0201025e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070078622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fm.2020.1035842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeon, Min-Jin10aBactericidal and synergistic effects of X-ray irradiation and gallic acid against foodborne pathogens on lettuce  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe objectives of this study were to evaluate the bactericidal effects of X-ray irradiation and gallic acid (GA) against Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Listeria monocytogenes on lettuce leaves and in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).

Combined treatment with 0.15 kGy X-ray and 0.5% GA reduced counts for the same species by 6.54, 4.24, and 1.51 log CFU/mL in PBS. The combined treatments exerted a synergistic antibacterial effect against E. coli O157:H7 on lettuce, but not against S. Typhimurium or L. monocytogenes. In PBS, the synergistic effect was confirmed in both E. coli O157:H7 and S. Typhimurium cells. Mechanistic investigations indicated that the synergistic antibacterial effect was associated with intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and bacterial cell membrane damage. Additionally, the X-ray and GA combination treatment did not adversely affect the color, total phenol content, and texture of lettuce. These findings demonstrate that treatment with X-ray radiation and GA can enhance the microbiological safety of fresh produce.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aX-radiation 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3acell membranes 3acolor 3afresh produce 3agallic acid 3airradiation 3alettuce 3amicrobiological quality 3aphenols 3areactive oxygen species 3asynergism 3atexture 0aX-ray irradiation 0aFoodborne pathogens 0aInactivation 0aMechanism1 aHa, Jae-Won1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2097-72410 tFood microbiology.g2020 Dec., v. 92 p.103584-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2020.1035843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01586naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245010800167300001800275500002900293520053500322592002800857650001100885650001500896650002300911650001200934650001600946650001200962700001700974700005700991773012001048856008301168852000901251655001201260IND60738207820221122055639.0210521e20210507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073820782DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c009102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jia-Cheng10aAsymmetric Counteranion Directed Catalytic Heck/Tsuji–Trost Annulation of Aryl Iodides and 1,3-Dienes  ap. 3834-3838.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aA chiral anion-mediated asymmetric Heck/Tsuji–Trost reaction of aryl iodides and 1,3-dienes is presented.

However, recent studies suggest that antioxidants, besides scavenge free radicals could lead development of tumors. Due to conflicting reports on the antioxidant benefits, the capacity to photosensitize the generation of singlet oxygen of seven natural antioxidants was evaluated through photo-oxidation of ergosterol which proved to be an efficient method of indirect detection of singlet oxygen. Our results showed that curcumin, resveratrol and quercetin have pro-oxidant activity due they act as photosensitizers in generation of singlet oxygen. In addition, we observed that genistein, naringenin, β-carotene and gallic acid besides their antioxidant activity against ROS radicals, are capable of quenching ROS non-radicals as singlet oxygen. Finally, our results allow us to propose a new approach in classification of natural antioxidants scavengers of free radicals, based on their activity as quenchers of singlet oxygen or as photosensitizers in singlet oxygen generation.  aPublisher supplied data 3agallic acid 3asinglet oxygen 3anaringenin 3aphotosensitizing agents 3aneoplasms 3abeta-carotene 3agenistein 3aquercetin 3aresveratrol 3acurcumin 3aantioxidant activity 3aphotooxidation 3aergosterol 0aantioxidants1 aTrigos, Ángel0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2015 Apr., v. 145 p.30-34dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2015.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245016900167300001600336500001400352520095100366592002801317596024601345650002301591650001701614650002401631650001801655650002201673650001601695650004901711650002201760650002201782650002001804650001301824653001801837653002401855653002601879653002801905700001801933700001801951700002301969700001901992700002302011700001802034700001802052700001702070773013602087856008502223852000902308655001202317IND60692759420221119145517.0200503e20160402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069275942DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2015.11169292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Kichul10aComparative studies on the fish-killing activities of Chattonella marina isolated in 1985 and Chattonella antiqua isolated in 2010, and their possible toxic factors  ap. 811-817.  aNAL-light  aChattonella antiqua isolated in 2010 showed extremely more potent fish-killing activities against red sea bream, Japanese horse mackerel, and blue damselfish than those of Chattonella marina isolated in 1985. Chemiluminescence and electron spin resonance (ESR) analyses suggested greater reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing activity of C. antiqua than that of C. marina. Sodium benzoate, a hydroxyl radical scavenger, significantly suppressed the fish-killing activity of C. antiqua on blue damselfish. The chlorophyll level in the gill tissue of blue damselfish exposed to flagellate cells increased along with the exposure time, and the cell count of gill-associated C. antiqua estimated with chlorophyll level was higher than that of C. marina. These results suggest that the ROS-producing activity and affinity of Chattonella cells to the gill surface may be important factors influencing the fish-killing activity of Chattonella species.  aPublisher supplied data  cGrant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan, and by a fund from Nagasaki University Major Research Project (Research Initiative for Adaptation to Future Ocean Change). 3aChattonella marina 3aPagrus major 3aTrachurus japonicus 3abiotechnology 3achemiluminescence 3achlorophyll 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aexposure duration 3ahydroxyl radicals 3asodium benzoate 3atoxicity 0araphidophytes 0aChattonella antiqua 0afish-killing activity 0areactive oxygen species1 aSakamoto, Jun1 aNoda, Tatsuki1 aNishiguchi, Tomoki1 aUeno, Mikinori1 aYamasaki, Yasuhiro1 aYagi, Motoaki1 aKim, Daekyung1 aOda, Tatsuya0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2016 Apr. 2, v. 80, no. 4 p.811-817dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2015.11169293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245007000168300001600238500001900254520119400273592002801467650001201495650001801507650001801525650001701543650002501560650002001585650001701605650001401622650001801636651001801654700002101672700002001693700001901713700001501732773014101747856008601888852000901974655001201983IND60694326120221122055540.0200511e20070101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069432612DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2007.115122342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPacheco, G.10aIn vitro regeneration and conservation of wild species of Arachis  ap. 311-315.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWild species of Arachis are restricted to South America and generally occur in regions under intensive environmental disturbance. Both in situ and ex situ conservation strategies are required in order to maintain the availability of these genotypes. This work developed in vitro regeneration systems from seed explants of 17 wild species of Arachis from six Sections (Heteranthae, Caulorrhizae, Triseminatae, Erectoides, Procumbentes and Arachis). After seed disinfection, embryonic axes, leaflets and cotyledons were excised aseptically and cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 8.8 µM, 22 µM or 110 µM 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP). Cultures were maintained in a growth chamber at 28° ± 2°C with a 16 h photoperiod. Regeneration patterns from seed explants were similar among species from all Sections. Embryonic axes produced plants through meristematic amplification or multiple shoot formation, while cotyledons and embryonic leaflets produced shoots at significantly lower frequencies through direct and indirect organogenesis, respectively. Shoots obtained from all explants were transferred to MS medium without growth regulators to induce root formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArachis 3abenzyladenine 3abiotechnology 3adisinfection 3aex situ conservation 3agrowth chambers 3ahorticulture 3ameristems 3aorganogenesis 3aSouth America1 aGagliardi, R.

Daily food consumption was estimated by the single 24 h dietary recall method. Antioxidant vitamins (C, E, and β-carotene) and minerals (Zn, Fe, Mn, and Cu) from the diet and supplements were calculated using 5D Diet software, and dietary total polyphenol intake (DTPI) was determined using the Phenol-Explorer database and our database. Total diet quality was measured by the Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI) based on World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for the prevention of CVD. DTAC was calculated using the data on food consumption and the antioxidant potential of foods measured by the FRAP (ferric ion reducing antioxidant potential) method. It was shown that higher DTAC was associated with a higher intake of polyphenols, antioxidant vitamins, and minerals. Moreover, a higher quartile of DTAC was associated with a reduced odds ratio for cardiovascular diseases in a Polish population, as well as with a higher HDI. Therefore, dietary recommendations for the prevention and therapy of CVDs should take into account a high DTAC. DTAC, measured by the FRAP method, can be considered an indicator of healthy diet quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aadults 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acomputer software 3across-sectional studies 3adatabases 3adiet recall 3afluorescence recovery after photobleaching 3afood consumption 3afood quality 3ahealthy diet 3aodds ratio 3apolyphenols 3atherapeutics1 aWaśkiewicz, Anna 1 aWitkowska, Anna Maria1 aCicha-Mikołajczyk, Alicja 1 aZujko, Kinga 1 aDrygas, Wojciech 0 tNutrients.g2022 Aug. 06, v. 14, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141532193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01478naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012100157300001800278520040800296592002800704650001400732650002300746650001200769650001800781650001300799700001200812700001700824700001800841700001900859700001700878700001700895773013300912856007401045852000901119655001201128IND60636337820221120121905.0190408e20190402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063633782DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc01081e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Chunli10aMOF-templated self-polymerization of p-phenylenediamine to a polymer with a hollow box-assembled spherical structure  ap. 4071-4074.  aThis paper presents the first transformation of MOFs to polymers without any additives by using a one-step MOF-templated self-polymerization approach.

In this work the toxicity of four simulated textile and tannery wastewaters was evaluated by means of a battery of seven bioassays, using organisms that belong to different trophic levels. Moreover, since the outputs of the bioassay battery were quite difficult to compare, a novel synthetic index for environmental risk assessment was applied to the outputs of the test battery. All four simulated wastewaters were very toxic but they showed no mutagenic effect. The alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata was the most sensitive organism. In addition, the use of two mathematical models pointed out the interaction effect between dyes and salts, which resulted in a synergistic effect of wastewater toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSelenastrum capricornutum 3abioassays 3adyes 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3afabrics 3agenotoxicity 3amathematical models 3amutagenicity 3apollutants 3arisk 3asalts 3asynergism 3atrophic relationships1 aGiansanti, Pietro1 aMangiavillano, Antonella1 aPannocchia, Antonella1 aVarese, Giovanna Cristina0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2011 May, v. 74, no. 4 p.866-873dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2010.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01333naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245011000173300001600283520052600299592002800825650001900853650002100872650001600893773011300909856004801022852000901070655001201079IND50058877420221122053700.0121011e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005887742DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-012-0634-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAttanasio, Alessandro10aTesting for linear Granger causality from natural/anthropogenic forcings to global temperature anomalies  ap. 281-289.  aIn this paper, we analyze the Granger causality from natural or anthropogenic forcings to global temperature anomalies.

The grading platform achieved root mean squared errors of predictions for TSS of < 0.8%, and for FWs of 0.5 g. Thinning to one fruit cm–² trunk cross-sectional area resulted in an increase in fruit TSS content of approx. 2% for peach and nectarine, and 0.5% TSS for plum, and an increase in fruit FW by an average of 30 g for nectarine, 40 g for peach, and 10 g for plum fruit. Fruits harvested from the upper tree canopy (> 3 m height) were higher in TSS contents compared to lower (0 – 1.5 m) canopy fruit (3% increase in TSS for peach, 2% for nectarine, and 1.5% for plum). Future work to introduce NIR technology into agronomic programmes aimed at improving the TSS contents of fruit is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3acanopy 3afruits 3ahorticulture 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3anectarines 3apeaches 3aplums 3asugar content1 aLong, Robert L.1 aMiddleton, Simon G.0 tJournal of horticultural science & biotechnology.g2007 Jan. 1, v. 82, no. 2 p.316-322dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12181x2380-40847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14620316.2007.115122353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01565naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245007700167300001800244520044200262592002800704650002600732650002300758650002200781650001300803650001300816650002700829700001800856700002700874700001900901700002200920700002400942700002100966773013300987856007401120852000901194655001201203IND60636337920221120112513.0190408e20190404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063633792DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc01092k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDichiarante, Valentina14aThe diiodomethyl-sulfonyl moiety: an unexplored halogen bond-donor motif  ap. 4234-4237.  aHerein, we report the crystal structures of the antimicrobial agent diiodomethyl-p-tolylsulfone and of three halogen bonded co-crystals demonstrating that the bioactive moiety –SO₂CHI₂ can function as a quite effective halogen bond based motif in the solid state and in solution, namely demonstrating that α-iodosulfones may become a new entry in the quite small group of alkyl-iodides functioning as reliable halogen bond-donors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-infective agents 3achemical reactions 3acrystal structure 3ahalogens 3amoieties 3aorganoiodine compounds1 aKaiho, Tatsuo1 aMetrangolo, Pierangelo1 aPilati, Tullio1 aResnati, Giuseppe1 aTerraneo, Giancarlo1 aUrsini, Maurizio0 tChemical communications.g2019 Apr. 4, v. 55, no. 29 p.4234-4237dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9cc01092k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03388naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245013600170300001400306520184000320592002802160650002202188650001302210650002802223650001902251650001902270650001102289650001402300650000902314650002102323650001302344650001702357650001402374650000902388650001002397650001202407650001402419653000802433653001602441653001802457653002102475653003202496653002502528653001902553700001802572700001402590700001302604700001402617700001402631773009302645856008702738852000902825655001202834IND60625061920221119080752.0190215e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062506192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryobiol.2018.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠterbenc, N.10aSingle layer colloid centrifugation technique improves motility, viability and chromatin integrity of ram spermatozoa after thawing  ap. 77-83.  aThe cell membrane of ram spermatozoa is more sensitive to the freezing process than in other species due to its composition. As a result, the quality and viability of frozen thawed ram spermatozoa are often poor, which together with the specific structure of the ewe's cervix are the main reasons for lower fertility in ewes after intracervical insemination. In the present study we investigated the effects of semen centrifugation through a single layer of a species-specific colloid (Androcoll-O) on post-thaw quality of ram spermatozoa. Motility, viability and morphology were analysed 0, 6, 12 and 24 h after thawing. DNA fragmentation index (%DFI) of the samples was assessed 0 h after thawing, by SCSA™. Membrane and acrosome integrity of spermatozoa were analysed by Sybr-14/PI/PNA test 0 h after thawing.The proportion of motile spermatozoa was significantly higher in SLC – selected samples in comparison to control (not SLC – selected) samples at 0, 6, 12 (P < 0.001) and 24 h (P < 0.05). The proportion of viable spermatozoa was also significantly higher in SLC - selected samples in comparison to control samples at all times (P < 0.001). The proportion of abnormal acrosomes and morphologically abnormal spermatozoa (MAS) were significantly lower in SLC – selected samples compared to control samples at all times (P < 0.001). Analysis of chromatin stability revealed significantly lower %DFI values in SLC – selected samples compared to control samples (P < 0.001). The SYBR-14/PI/PNA test also revealed significantly better values in SLC – selected compared to control samples (P < 0.05). In conclusion, single layer colloid centrifugation significantly improved post-thaw quality and longevity of ram spermatozoa, making it suitable for artificial insemination initiatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aacrosome 3aartificial insemination 3acell membranes 3acentrifugation 3acervix 3achromatin 3aewes 3afemale fertility 3afreezing 3ainsemination 3alongevity 3arams 3asemen 3athawing 3aviability 0aRam 0aSpermatozoa 0aCell membrane 0aCryopreservation 0aSingle layer centrifugation 0aSingle layer colloid 0aFlow cytometry1 aMorrell, J.M.1 aKosec, M.1 aRath, D.1 aKlein, S.1 aKlinc, P.0 tCryobiology.g2019 Feb., v. 86 p.77-83dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45487x0011-22407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2018.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245011900135300001600254520171600270592002801986650002102014650001402035650001502049650001402064650001102078650001402089650001102103651001702114651001302131700002102144700001902165700002302184773010102207852000902308655001202317IND60459374120221120232259.0151110s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6045937412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunning, Dennis J.10aEffect of Striped Bass Larvae Transported from the Hudson River on Juvenile Abundance in Western Long Island Sound  ap. 343-353.  aFreshwater flow can have a profound influence on the transport of larvae within large tidal estuaries, and tidal flow can transport larvae away from those estuaries. Our objectives were to (1) confirm that a combination of freshwater and tidal flows transported post-yolk-sac larvae (PYSL) striped bass Morone saxatilis from the Hudson River, New York, to western Long Island Sound (WLIS), a nearby nursery area, and (2) assess the effect of PYSL transported from the river on the abundance of juvenile striped bass in WLIS. This approach included (1) calculating an index of juvenile striped bass abundance in WLIS (WLIS juvenile index) for July and regressing it on an index of striped bass PYSL abundance for the Battery region of the Hudson River (Battery region PYSL index), which represented annual changes in the abundance of striped bass PYSL that could be transported from the river to WLIS, and (2) regressing a WLIS juvenile index for August on the WLIS juvenile index for July. The regression of the WLIS juvenile index for July on the Battery region PYSL index was significant and positive. The regression of the WLIS juvenile index for August on that for July was not significant. We confirmed that striped bass PYSL were transported from the Hudson River to WLIS by a combination of freshwater and tidal flows. Furthermore, in years when striped bass PYSL abundance and freshwater flow in the Hudson River were unusually high, striped bass PYSL transported from the Hudson River substantially influenced abundance of juvenile striped bass in WLIS during July but not August. The difference in abundance between months was apparently due to high natural mortality early in the juvenile life stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMorone saxatilis 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3amortality 3arivers 3aHudson River 3aNew York1 aRoss, Quentin E.1 aMcKown, Kim A.1 aSocrates, Julia B.0 tMarine and coastal fisheries.g2009,  p.343-353dThe American Fisheries Societyx1942-51207nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02066naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010100165300001600266500001900282520051800301592002800819596015200847650002100999650002501020650001801045650001201063650001701075650002101092650001301113650000901126650001501135653002801150653001601178653002401194653001701218700002201235700001901257700002801276700002201304700001901326700002101345773013601366856008501502852000901587655001201596IND60692759820221119145432.0200503e20160402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069275982DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2015.11169332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Jian10aMicrobial production of poly(lactate-co-3-hydroxybutyrate) from hybrid Miscanthus-derived sugars  ap. 818-820.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aP[(R)-lactate-co-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] [P(LA-co-3HB)] was produced in engineered Escherichia coli using lignocellulose-derived hydrolysates from Miscanthus × giganteus (hybrid Miscanthus) and rice straw.

The study area is extended from Ra’s Shikh Humayd to the town of Maqnah, northwest of Saudi Arabia. Eight electrical profiles were conducted using the Wenner–Schlumberger configuration. The total length of each profile was 360 m providing an expected maximum depth of penetration of about 50 m. All electrical profiles were conducted perpendicular to the coast and directed in the west–east direction. The inversion of the electrical data provided a clear two-dimensional image of the subsurface in the area that reflected the variations in the resistivity of the shallow aquifer system. The subsurface is composed of three layers: the upper layer corresponds to the dry alluvial and gravel deposits that have resistivity values in the range between 40 and 1400 Ω m. The second layer is the saturated zone of the alluvial sediments which represents the coastal aquifer in the study area. The resistivity value of the saturated zone is in the range of 0.15 to 25 Ω m. The lower layer in the subsurface stratification is the resistive bedrock which has resistivity values of more than 100 Ω m. It is composed of Pleistocene–Miocene sediments. The extension of saline water body has been mapped along all electrical profiles. The interpretation of the resistivity models shows that the salinity of the groundwater in the area is strongly related to three main factors: (1) the closeness to the coast; (2) closeness to wadis and low areas which allow saline surface water to infiltrate into the shallow aquifer and; (3) the abundance of gypsum outcrop in the vicinity. This last factor emphasizes the important effect of the local geological setting on the salinity of groundwater; the abundant supply of leached gypsum contributes to the salinity of the shallow aquifer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abedrock 3acase studies 3acoastal plains 3acoasts 3aelectrical resistance 3agravel 3agypsum 3amodels 3asaline water 3asurface water 3asurveys 3atomography 3awater salinity 3aGulf of Aqaba 3aSaudi Arabia1 aEl-Waheidi, Mahmoud M.1 aJallouli, Chokri1 aBatayneh, Awni T.0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 Aug., v. 74, no. 3 p.2105-2114dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4195-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02414naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010000168500001900268520124200287592002801529650004401557650003701601650001601638650001201654650000701666650002401673650001901697653004801716653001601764653001401780653001401794700001301808700001701821773010601838856008701944852000902031655001202040IND60713983220221119053201.0210408e20210120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071398322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1256232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Hongli10a1-Hydroxydodecylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid flotation of bastnäsite: Performance and mechanism  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo separate and enrich rare-earth elements (REE) minerals from their ores through flotation process has become an attracting topic for REE’s strategic position. In the present investigation, the floatability of bastnäsite [(Ce,La)CO₃F] was explored by using 1-hydroxydodecylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid (HDDPA) as a collector. The micro-flotation results showed that bastnäsite displayed an eminent floatability under pH 7.0–10.0, and HDDPA realized an efficient separation of bastnäsite from calcite at pH around 8.0. Zeta potential and solution chemistry inferred that at pH 7.5–9.3, HDDPA³⁻ anions were glad to replace the CO₃²⁻ ions of Ce(Ⅲ) carbonates in/on bastnäsite interface, resulting in a high flotation recovery of bastnäsite. With increasing OH- concentration, the competition ability of OH- against HDDPA anion intensified, gradually the surface Ce(III) hydroxide species increased, and the floatability of bastnäsite reduced. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) recommended that the surface Ce(III) of bastnäsite interacted with the O atoms of HDDPA’s OP(O)O group to generate a four membered ring configuration, which hydrophobized bastnäsite particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abastnaesite 3acalcite 3apH 3arare earth elements 3azeta potential 0a1-Hydroxydodecylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid 0aBastnäsite 0aFlotation 0aMechanism1 aTan, Wen1 aLiu, Guangyi0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Jan. 20, v. 609 p.125623-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1256233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02228naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245008900174300001600263520119200279592002801471650001701499650001001516650001001526650002701536650001801563650002401581650001501605650001601620700002201636700002601658773011301684856008401797852000901881655001201890IND60625062120221119081001.0210513e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062506212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.11.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKassmer, Susannah H.10aCellular and molecular mechanisms of regeneration in colonial and solitary Ascidians  ap. 271-278.  aRegenerative ability is highly variable among the metazoans. While many invertebrate organisms are capable of complete regeneration of entire bodies and organs, whole-organ regeneration is limited to very few species in the vertebrate lineages. Tunicates, which are invertebrate chordates and the closest extant relatives of the vertebrates, show robust regenerative ability. Colonial ascidians of the family of the Styelidae, such as several species of Botrylloides, are able to regenerate entire new bodies from nothing but fragments of vasculature, and they are the only chordates that are capable of whole body regeneration. The cell types and signaling pathways involved in whole body regeneration are not well understood, but some evidence suggests that blood borne cells may play a role. Solitary ascidians such as Ciona can regenerate the oral siphon and their central nervous system, and stem cells located in the branchial sac are required for this regeneration. Here, we summarize the cellular and molecular mechanisms of tunicate regeneration that have been identified so far and discuss differences and similarities between these mechanisms in regenerating tunicate species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotrylloides 3aCiona 3ablood 3acentral nervous system 3ainvertebrates 3asignal transduction 3astem cells 3avertebrates1 aNourizadeh, Shane1 aDe Tomaso, Anthony W.0 tDevelopmental biology.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 448, no. 2 p.271-278dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.11.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02224naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245006700132300001600199520114600215592002801361650001101389650001201400650001601412650002701428650001401455650001201469650001301481650001401494650001101508650001701519650001001536650001401546650001301560650001301573650001701586651001501603700002601618700002401644700002401668773010101692852000901793655001201802IND60459374520221120232303.0151110s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6045937452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, Eric F.10aLife History, Ecology, and Long-term Demographics of Queenfish  ap. 187-199.  aQueenfish Seriphus politus were collected at coastal power plants from San Clemente to Ventura, California. Power functions best described relations between otolith length, width, or weight and either standard length (SL) or total body weight. The length––weight relationship was described by the following equation: weight == 10⁻⁻⁵ ×× SL³.⁰⁹. Individuals were aged to 12 years by using sagittal otolith sections. Females grew at a significantly faster rate than males. Both sexes reached 50%% maturity by 100 mm SL, or shortly after age 1. The total annual instantaneous mortality coefficient was estimated at 0.42. Catalina Harbor (on the windward side of Santa Catalina Island) and Ventura were the most populous sites based on gill-net catch per unit effort from 1995 to 2006. Juvenile and adult queenfish populations have declined since 1980 in a significant relationship with nearshore plankton biomass. Larval queenfish densities recorded in King Harbor (Redondo Beach) have declined since 1987. Long-term recruitment estimates indicated peak recruitment prior to 1976, with three subsequent downward baseline shifts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abiomass 3abody weight 3ademographic statistics 3aequations 3afemales 3agillnets 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3alife history 3amales 3amortality 3aotoliths 3aplankton 3apower plants 3aCalifornia1 aWilliams, Jonathan P.1 aPondella, Daniel J.1 aHerbinson, Kevin T.0 tMarine and coastal fisheries.g2009,  p.187-199dThe American Fisheries Societyx1942-51207nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01635naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100003000154245011600184300001600300520045600316592002800772650004400800650002200844650002200866650000900888650001400897650002100911650003300932650002100965650003700986700002101023700002001044773012301064856008901187852000901276655001201285IND60543407420221119094007.0190410e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054340742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2015.02.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNajafpour, Mohammad Mahdi10aNano-sized Mn3O4 and β-MnOOH from the decomposition of β-cyclodextrin–Mn: 1.

In order to improve the sensitivity of MEKC–UV, two-step preconcentration strategy was employed, off-line solid phase extraction (SPE) and on-line large volume sample stacking (LVSS). d,l-SeMet was first retained on the Cu(II) loaded mesoporous TiO₂, then eluted by 0.1mL of 5molL⁻¹ ammonia, and finally introduced for MEKC–UV analysis by LVSS injection after evaporation of NH₃. With the enrichment factors of 1400 and 1378, the LODs of 0.44 and 0.60ngmL⁻¹ for l-SeMet and d-SeMet was obtained, respectively. The developed method was applied to the analysis of d,l-SeMet in a certified reference material of SELM-1 and a commercial nutrition yeast, and the results showed that most of SeMet in the SELM-1 selenized yeast was l isomer and the recovery for l and d isomers in the spiked commercial nutrition yeast was 96.3% and 103%, respectively. This method is featured with low running cost, high sensitivity and selectivity, and exhibits application potential in chiral analysis of seleno amino acids in real world samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3acopper 3aenantiomers 3aevaporation 3amicellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography 3amicelles 3anutrition 3aphenylalanine 3aselenomethionine 3asolid phase extraction 3atitanium dioxide 3ayeasts1 aHe, Man1 aHu, Bin0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 Dec. 14, v. 1268 p.173-179dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02008naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100001800136245010300154300001600257520106900273592002801342653002201370653002101392653002101413653001401434700001801448700001801466773015501484856007001639852000901709655001201718IND60131650720221119081532.0151127e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013165072DNAL7 a10.1638/02-0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUzun, Metehan10aElectrocardiography of rock partridges (alectoris graeca) and chukar partridges (alectoris chukar)  ap. 510-514.  aStandard limb, six lead (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, and aVF) electrocardiograms (ECGs) were recorded in 10 awake mature rock partridges (Alectoris graeca) and 10 chukar partridges (Alectoris chukar).

Thus, we aimed to analyze the association between several plasma cytokines with IR as evaluated by the metabolic score for insulin resistance, METS-IR. Methods: We measured the plasma concentrations of thirty cytokines from a cohort of older persons and analyzed their role as independent factors for IR. We used regression analyses adjusted for known IR-associated factors (including age, gender, cholesterol levels, and BMI) to find the determinants of IR. Results: The study evaluated 132 subjects, mostly women (82F/50M), slightly overweight, and with a mean age of 78.5 ± 6.5 years. In the overall population, IL-15 significantly and negatively correlates with METS-IR (r = −0.183, p = 0.036). A regression model showed that the association between IL-15 and METS-IR was significantly modulated by gender and BMI (R²: 0.831). Only in women, EGF, Eotaxin and MCP-1 significantly correlated with METS-IR even after controlling by age (EGF, r = 0.250 p = 0.025; Eotaxin, r = 0.276 p = 0.13; MCP-1, r = 0.237, p = 0.033). Furthermore, regression models showed that these molecules were associated with METS-IR and were strongly mediated by BMI. Conclusions: Our results indicate the association between cytokines and IR has to be interpreted in a gender-specific manner. In women, EGF, Eotaxin, and MCP-1 circulating levels are associated with METS-IR being BMI a significant mediator. Understanding the role of gender in the relationship between cytokines and IR will help to define individualized preventive and treatment interventions to reduce the risk of age-related metabolic disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3acholesterol 3agender 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3ainterleukin-15 3aoverweight 3aregression analysis 3arisk reduction1 aMancinetti, Francesca 1 aBaroni, Marta 1 aCecchetti, Roberta 1 aBastiani, Patrizia 1 aRuggiero, Carmelinda 1 aMecocci, Patrizia 0 tNutrients.g2022 Aug. 07, v. 14, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141532283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03621naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245014300166300001400309520146600323592002801789650001601817650002001833650001901853650001601872650001101888650001401899650001801913650001901931650002201950650001201972650001001984650000901994650001102003650001302014650001602027650001102043650002402054650002102078650001402099650001902113650001702132650001502149650002102164650001302185650001402198650001502212650002102227650001202248653001002260653000902270653000802279653000802287653001102295653000702306653000702313653000802320653000902328653000902337653000802346653000902354653000802363653002002371653001902391653001002410653002002420653001002440653003002450653000902480700001302489700001702502700001602519700001302535700001702548773010702565856008602672852000902758655001202767IND60533288120221120230447.0190319e20140122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053328812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2013.10.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ping10aIsolation and characterization of MdATG18a, a WD40-repeat AuTophaGy-related gene responsive to leaf senescence and abiotic stress in Malus  ap. 51-61.  aAutophagy is an important means for recycling damaged cell components or degrading various proteins when plants are under starvation or oxidative stress. AuTophaGy-related gene 18 (ATG18), a phosphoinositide-binding protein that functions through the WD40 domain, is required for vesicle formation in autophagy. Here, we isolated and characterized MdATG18a from Malus domestica. Its full-length cDNA is a complete 1281bp open reading frame (ORF) of nucleotides encoding a polypeptide of 426 amino acids. The deduced protein contains two WD40 domains. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that MdATG18a clusters with Arabidopsis members AtATG18a, c, d, and e. The 3D structure has a seven-bladed β-propeller and two putative phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) binding sites. When transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells, the MdATG18a–GFP fusion protein was localized in the nucleus and cell membrane. Prediction of a 1824bp promoter region cloned from apple genome DNA indicated several key cis-regulatory elements involved in plant responses to abiotic stresses. MdATG18a was expressed in all tested tissues and showed obvious up-regulation under leaf senescence, drought, heat, oxidative stress, nitrogen starvation or ER stress. Taken together, our findings suggest that MdATG18a plays a role in responses to leaf senescence and abiotic stresses, which might be indicative of autophagy involved in mechanism regulation for stress tolerance in apple.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aMalus domestica 3aabiotic stress 3aamino acids 3aapples 3aautophagy 3abinding sites 3acell membranes 3acomplementary DNA 3adrought 3agenes 3aheat 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anucleotides 3aonions 3aopen reading frames 3aoxidative stress 3aphylogeny 3aplant response 3apolypeptides 3aprediction 3apromoter regions 3aproteins 3arecycling 3astarvation 3astress tolerance 3atissues 0aATG18 0aCRL4 0aCvt 0aDWD 0aEF-1α 0aER 0aMV 0aORF 0aPI3K 0aPI3P 0aROS 0aTSPO 0aUPR 0aWIPI1 and WIPI2 0aAbiotic stress 0aATG18 0aLeaf senescence 0aMalus 0aSub-cellular localization 0aWD401 aSun, Xun1 aYue, Zhiyong1 aLiang, Dong1 aWang, Na1 aMa, Fengwang0 tScientia horticulturae.g2014 Jan. 22, v. 165 p.51-61dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2013.10.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03257naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011500164300001800279520221400297592002802511650001502539650000902554650001402563650001302577650001502590650002002605650001102625651001002636700001802646700001802664700001902682773011602701856008102817852000902898655001202907IND60440607520221120121012.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044060752DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4240-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, NanNan10aLarge-depth hydrogeological detection in the North China-type coalfield through short-offset grounded-wire TEM  ap. 2393-2404.  aThe North China-type coalfield is the most important coalfield in China. With the development of Chinese economy, shallow coal resources (<600 m) have been exhausted and large-depth detection is being conducted. Water-inrush is disastrous for coal mining. However, large-depth (600–1200 m) detection of water-filled zones in the North China-type coalfield is a difficult geophysical task due to its low-resistivity coverage. The traditional loop-source transient electromagnetic method (TEM) cannot realize large-depth detection. On the other hand, high-resolution detection of LOTEM is limited by the problem of recording points and large volume effect. To explore the large-depth targets with high-resolution, Short-offset grounded TEM (SOTEM) was applied in the North China-type coalfield. SOTEM is one branch of grounded-wire TEM. The response of SOTEM is calculated using superposing-dipole method rather than the direct-dipole approximation, which is used in the calculation of the response of LOTEM. This paper analyzes the comparison of the resolution and detection depth between SOTEM and loop-source TEM at first. Compared to the loop-source TEM with frequently used parameters, the detection depth of SOTEM with the usual setup parameters is about twice of magnitude, and the resolution capability of SOTEM at large depth is higher than that of loop-source TEM. Then, the resolution capability and detection depth between LOTEM and SOTEM are analyzed. For the grounded-wire TEM, offsets are strictly related to the detection depth. So, the detection depth of LOTEM with larger receiver–transmitter offset will be greater. However, at the depth of 600–1200 m, the resolution capability to conductive targets of SOTEM is higher than that of LOTEM. At last, SOTEM with a 1000-m long source and 1000–2000 m offset is applied to the 1200 m-depth exploration of water-filled zones in the North China-type coalfield. The induced voltage is observed and transformed into magnetic field. Then, the data is inverted using the least mean fourth algorithm. The distribution of water on the top and bottom surface of the large-depth No. 4 coal seam is given, and is verified by the drilling result.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acoal 3adetection 3adrilling 3ageophysics 3amagnetic fields 3amining 3aChina1 aXue, GuoQiang1 aChen, Weiying1 aCheng, Jiulong0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 Aug., v. 74, no. 3 p.2393-2404dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4240-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03452naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245009300131300001600224520245100240592002802691650001202719650001102731650002902742650001802771650001902789650002202808650001702830650001402847650001602861650002402877650001302901650002602914651001802940700002202958773010102980852000903081655001203090IND60459374920221120232217.0151110s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6045937492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCope, Jason M.10aLength-Based Reference Points for Data-Limited Situations: Applications and Restrictions  ap. 169-186.  aCurrent fisheries management policies generally require an assessment of stock status, which is a difficult task when population and fisheries data are limited. Three simple metrics based on catch length compositions (i.e., that reflect exclusive take of mature individuals, Pₘₐₜ; that consist primarily of fish of optimal size, the size at which the highest yield from a cohort occurs, Pₒₚₜ; and that demonstrate the conservation of large, mature individuals, Pₘₑgₐ) can be used to monitor population status relative to exploitation. The metrics (collectively referred to as Pₓ) were intended to avoid growth and recruitment overfishing, but there was no quantitative linkage to stock status and calculation of future sustainable catches. We attempt to make this connection by exploring the relationship of Pₓ measures to fishing mortality and spawning biomass (SB). The relationships are compared specifically to the current target reference point (0.4 times the virgin, or unfished, SB [[SB₀]]) and limit reference point (0.25SB₀) used for the U.S. West Coast groundfish fishery by using simulations based on a deterministic age-structured population dynamics model. Sensitivity to fishery selectivity, life history traits, and recruitment compensation (steepness) is explored. Each Pₓ measure showed a wide range of possible values depending on fishery selectivity, steepness, and the ratio of the length at maturity (Lₘₐₜ) to the optimal fishing length (Lₒₚₜ). Although the values of Pₓ may be compatible with sustainable fishing, these values are not always sufficient to ensure stock protection from overfishing. Moreover, values for Pₓ cannot be interpreted adequately without knowledge of the selectivity pattern. A new measure, Pₒbⱼ (the sum of Pₘₐₜ, Pₒₚₜ, and Pₘₑgₐ), is introduced to distinguish selectivity patterns and construct a decision tree for development of stock status indicators. Heuristic indicator values are presented to demonstrate the utility of this approach. Although several caveats remain, this approach builds on the recommendations of previous literature by giving further guidance related to interpreting catch length composition data under variable fishery conditions without collecting additional information. It also provides a link to developing harvest control rules that inform proactive fisheries management under data-limited conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acoasts 3adecision support systems 3ademersal fish 3adynamic models 3aissues and policy 3alife history 3amortality 3aoverfishing 3apopulation dynamics 3aspawning 3asustainable fisheries 3aUnited States1 aPunt, Andréé E.0 tMarine and coastal fisheries.g2009,  p.169-186dThe American Fisheries Societyx1942-51207nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245019600168300001600364500001900380520117300399592002801572650002201600650001301622650001701635650001801652650001401670650001101684650001801695650001701713650001201730650001301742650001401755650001001769650001201779650001701791650003101808700001701839700001701856700001301873700001701886700001601903700001701919773014101936856008602077852000902163655001202172IND60694329820221119214759.0200511e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069432982DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2014.115130842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, G.

Over 360 different aromatic compounds have been identified from strawberry. In order to analyse patterns of inheritance in the biosynthesis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in strawberry, 40 hybrid strawberry plants from a cross between ‘Camarosa’ (♀) and ‘Benihoppe’ (♂) that emitted different scents were characterised. The 89 most abundant VOCs synthesised by the parents and the hybrid progeny were identified, and the relative contents of the VOCs among individual progeny plants were used to study the inheritance of aroma-related traits. Methyl butanoate, ethyl butanoate, hexyl hexanoate, methyl hexanoate, octyl caproate, ethyl caprylate, and hexyl acetate were detected in > 75.0% of the progeny plants and were the most common VOCs. The important VOC, nerolidol, appeared to be inherited in a qualitative manner, while linalool was inherited quantitatively. An analysis of the inheritance of these major VOCs should help breeders select suitable material with the potential for improved aroma, and assist in future selection and breeding processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFragaria ananassa 3aacetates 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3abutyrates 3afruits 3ahexanoic acid 3ahorticulture 3ahybrids 3alinalool 3anerolidol 3aodors 3aprogeny 3astrawberries 3avolatile organic compounds1 aChang, L.

Because GAPDH is required for the insertion of cellular heme into inducible nitric oxide synthase [Chakravarti, R., et al. (2010) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 107, 18004–18009], we extensively characterized the heme binding properties of GAPDH. Substoichiometric amounts of ferric heme bound to GAPDH (one heme per GAPDH tetramer) to form a low-spin complex with UV–visible maxima at 362, 418, and 537 nm and when reduced to ferrous gave maxima at 424, 527, and 559 nm. Ferric heme association and dissociation rate constants at 10 °C were as follows: kₒₙ = 17800 M–¹ s–¹, kₒff₁ = 7.0 × 10–³ s–¹, and kₒff₂ = 3.3 × 10–⁴ s–¹ (giving approximate affinities of 19–390 nM). Ferrous heme bound more poorly to GAPDH and dissociated with a kₒff of 4.2 × 10–³ s–¹. Magnetic circular dichroism, resonance Raman, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic data on the ferric, ferrous, and ferrous–CO complexes of GAPDH showed that the heme is bis-ligated with His as the proximal ligand. The distal ligand in the ferric complex was not displaced by CN– or N₃– but in the ferrous complex could be displaced by CO at a rate of 1.75 s–¹ (for >0.2 mM CO). Studies with heme analogues revealed selectivity toward the coordinating metal and porphyrin ring structure. The GAPDH–heme complex was isolated from bacteria induced to express rabbit GAPDH in the presence of δ-aminolevulinic acid. Our finding of heme binding to GAPDH expands the protein’s potential roles. The strength, selectivity, reversibility, and redox sensitivity of heme binding to GAPDH are consistent with it performing heme sensing or heme chaperone-like functions in cells.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3abacteria 3abinding properties 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adissociation 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aglycolysis 3aheme 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3aoxidative stress 3arabbits 3aspectral analysis 3atranscription (genetics)1 aCollins, D.q(Daniel),1 aBrassard, Julie1 aChakravarti, Ritu1 aVempati, Rajesh1 aDorlet, Pierre1 aSantolini, Jérôme1 aDawson, J.

The genetic variation of the many red raspberry cultivars makes it difficult to use one growth medium for all. Although some cultivars grow well on Murashige and Skoog (1962) medium (MS), others display stunting, hyperhydricity, discoloration, callus, leaf spots, or necrosis. This study used response surface methodology (RSM) to determine the effects of MS mineral salts on red raspberry growth and which of these mineral salts are critical for improving growth. In vitro growth of five red raspberry cultivars was determined by varying five factors that included NH4NO3, KNO3, mesos salts (CaCl2, KH2PO4 and MgSO4), minor elements (Zn–Mn–Cu–Co–Mo–B–I), and EDTA-chelated iron. The effects of these five factors on plant quality, multiplication, shoot length, leaf size, leaf area, leaf color, callus and leaf spots were determined. The effects varied by cultivar for some characteristics, but all cultivars had improved growth or appearance on some experimental treatments when compared to MS medium. Increased mesos was the most significant factor associated with plant quality, multiplication and shoot length in all cultivars. Increasing iron above MS levels decreased quality in all cultivars except ‘Willamette’. Decreased KNO3 with increased mesos and low iron were required to improve shoot multiplication. Increased NH4NO3 resulted in greater shoot elongation only in ‘Willamette’. Determining the driving mineral factors is the first step in improved medium formulations for micropropagated red raspberries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRubus idaeus 3aammonium nitrate 3aboron 3acalcium chloride 3acallus 3acobalt 3acolor 3acopper 3acultivars 3aculture media 3adiscoloration 3agenetic variation 3agrowth retardation 3ahyperhydricity 3aiodine 3airon 3aleaf area 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3amagnesium sulfate 3amanganese 3amicropropagation 3amodels 3amolybdenum 3anecrosis 3anursery crops 3anutrition 3apotassium dihydrogen phosphate 3apotassium nitrate 3aresponse surface methodology 3azinc 0aIn vitro culture 0aMineral nutrition 0aResponse surface methodology 0aRubus 0aRed raspberry1 aReed, Barbara M.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2014 Jan. 22, v. 165 p.132-141dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2013.10.0403Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle04025naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100001900190245015000209300001800359500002400377500001500401520193500416650001502351650002002366650001202386650002302398650001302421650001102434650001902445650001102464650001402475650001702489650001902506650001502525650001402540650002302554650001502577650001902592650001902611650002402630650001202654650002902666650001302695650007402708650002202782650002602804650002902830653001502859653002602874653001002900653001802910653002602928700002802954700001902982700002203001773012503023852000903148856007503157930003303232945002503265946001303290655001203303IND4443340220221116135950.0101012e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444334022DNAL7 a210619902pmid7 a10.1603/EC100042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF600 0aL600 0aL0011 aCardona, Cesar10aIndependence of Resistance in Brachiaria spp. to Nymphs or to Adult Spittlebugs (Hemiptera: Cercopidae): Implications for Breeding for Resistance  ap. 1860-1865.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBoth nymphal and adult spittlebugs (Hemiptera: Cercopidae) cause serious economic damage to susceptible brachiariagrass [genus Biachiaria (Trin.) Griseb], pastures in tropical America. Both life stages are xylem feeders: nymphs feed primarily on roots and stems, whereas the adults feed mainly on foliage. Numerous interspecific brachiariagrass hybrids with high levels of antibiosis resistance to nymphs of several important spittlebug species have been obtained. Recent studies revealed major inconsistencies between reaction to nymphs and reaction to adults on the same host genotype. Because both insect life stages can cause severe economic damage on susceptible brachiariagrass pastures, a cultivar development strategy must take into account resistance to both life stages. To assess the degree of association between resistance to spittlebug nymphs and to adult feeding, we tested 164 hybrids and six check genotypes for resistance to both life stages of three spittlebug species: Aeneolamia varia (F.), Aeneolamia reducta (Lallemand), and Zulia carbonaria (Lallemand). Most hybrids tested were classified as resistant to nymphs. On the contrary, for all three species, the overall mean damage score of the 164 hybrids did not differ from the mean score of the susceptible checks. None of the hybrids was classified as resistant to adult feeding damage. Correlations between percentage nymph survival and adult damage scores were consistently low (r = 0.0104–0.0191). Correlations between nymphal and adult damage scores were also low (0.109–0.271), suggesting that resistances to the different life stages are largely independent. Chi-square analyses comparing frequency distributions of responses of the 164 breeding hybrids to nymphs or adults confirmed essential genetic independence of these two traits. We conclude that attention to improving genetic resistance specifically to adult feeding damage is warranted. 3aBrachiaria 3apest resistance 3ahybrids 3agenetic resistance 3agenotype 3anymphs 3ainsect control 3aimagos 3acultivars 3ainsect pests 3aforage grasses 3aAeneolamia 3amortality 3abiological control 3aantibiosis 3aplant breeding 3apasture plants 3afeeding preferences 2aAnimals 2aBrachiariaxparasitology 2aGenotype 2aHemipteraxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aLife Cycle Stages 2aPest Controlxmethods 2aReproductionxphysiology 0aCercopidae 0abiological resistance 0aZulia 0aadult insects 0aresistance mechanisms1 aMiles, J.

Little is known regarding the association between increased CVD risk and dietary changes using approaches such as diet quality. The relevance of predefined diet quality scores (DQS) in non-Western developing countries has not yet been established. The association between dietary intakes and CVD risk factors was investigated using two DQS, adapted to the black South African diet. Dietary intake data were collected using a quantitative FFQ. CVD risk was determined by analysing known CVD risk factors. Urban and rural areas in North West Province, South Africa. Apparently healthy volunteers from the South African Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiological (PURE) study population (n 1710). CVD risk factors were significantly increased in the urban participants, especially women. Urban men and women had significantly higher intakes of both macro- and micronutrients with macronutrient intakes well within the recommended CVD guidelines. While micronutrient intakes were generally higher in the urban groups than in the rural groups, intakes of selected micronutrients were low in both groups. Both DQS indicated improved diet quality in the urban groups and good agreement was shown between the scores, although they seemed to measure different aspects of diet quality. The apparent paradox between improved diet quality and increased CVD risk in the urban groups can be explained when interpreting the cut-offs used in the scores against the absolute intakes of individual nutrients. Predefined DQS as well as current guidelines for CVD prevention should be interpreted with caution in non-Western developing countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adeveloping countries 3afood intake 3aguidelines 3amen 3anutrients 3anutritional adequacy 3arisk factors 3arural areas 3aurban population 3aurbanization 3avolunteers 3awomen 0aDiet quality scores 0aUrbanization 0aCVD risk1 aWentzel-Viljoen, Edelweiss1 aJerling, Johann C1 aFeskens, Edith JM1 aKruger, Annamarie1 aPieters, Marlien0 tPublic health nutrition.g2014 Aug., v. 17, no. 8 p.1706-1716dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800130022063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02277naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010800166520130700274592002801581650001101609650001001620650002901630653004001659653002101699653001901720653001801739653002201757773010201779856008501881852000901966655001201975IND60752279620221122082036.0211206e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075227962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.1014372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhejun10aExtraction and mapping of component information of ancient buildings in Huizhou based on UAV technology  aThe component information collection of ancient buildings is an important form of heritage protection in Huizhou. The application of UAV-based mapping technology has the advantages of small size, flexibility, and high precision. It has been widely used in the surveying and mapping projects of ancient building. Drones are tiny unmanned aerial vehicles that can be remotely controlled from a distance, i.e., drones. In appearance, they resemble helicopters or reconnaissance aircraft, and their versatility makes them a valuable asset. In this paper, the UAV technology was applied to photograph and map the components of ancient buildings in Huizhou. It is found that the UAV shooting, dynamic video, mapping and measurement can achieve the image acquisition, and the physical data such as image information of the building components can be captured by the UAV. Besides, the radio adaption method was used in the UAV shooting to ensure the faster sub-packet transfer rate and lower error packet rate, which can greatly improve the shooting quality of component information extraction for the ancient building in Huizhou. The numerical finding for the proposed method enhances the comparison of data rate under better communication quality and comparison of data rate under poor communication quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3aradio 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 0aHuizhou ancient building components 0aBuilding mapping 0aUAV technology 0aDynamic video 0aError packet rate0 tEcological informatics.g2021 Dec., v. 66 p.101437-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2190x1574-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.1014373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010300167300001600270520150100286592002801787650002101815650002301836650001201859650001901871650001901890650002901909650000701938650001901945650003201964700002601996700006002022700006102082773011102143856008402254852000902338655001202347IND60682533420221118030732.0200128e20200109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068253342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b030262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Xuanli10apH-Responsive Copolymer Films Prepared by Surface-Initiated Polymerization and Simple Modification  ap. 715-722.  aWe report the preparation of pH-responsive, ester/carboxylic acid random copolymer films via simple modification of poly(norbornene diacyl chloride) (pNBDAC), prepared via surface-initiated ring-opening metathesis polymerization, with mixtures of water and ethanol to form carboxylic acid and ethyl ester side groups. The pNBDAC film serves as a compositionally versatile platform to controllably obtain copolymers with multiple functionalities. In modifying the pNBDAC to form the copolymer film, ethanol exhibits a significantly higher reactivity with acyl chloride groups within the film than does water. The magnitude and range of the pH-responsive performance are highly dependent on the carboxylic acid content in the copolymer films, which demonstrates the effect of film hydrophilicity on the pH-responsive switching of ionic barrier properties. The resistance of the film against ion transfer can be decreased by a factor of 10⁴ through pH change, demonstrating pH-induced switching from hydrophobic and insulating to swollen and ion-permeable films. The interactions of the copolymer films with water at different pH values were also explored. When the copolymer contains 34% carboxylic acids, a 4× greater film thickness is obtained in high pH solution than in low pH solution due to ionically driven water swelling. The reversibility of the pH-responsive performance of these copolymer films is high based on measurements using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D).  aPublisher supplied data 3acarboxylic acids 3acomposite polymers 3aethanol 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aorganochlorine compounds 3apH 3apolymerization 3aquartz crystal microbalance1 aLivingston, Joshua L.1 aSpear, Nathan J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0881-67981 aJennings, G.

However, individual studies have never been combined in a quantitative manner to determine if seabird bycatch reduction devices (BRD) have a detrimental effect upon target species catch. We performed a meta-analysis of the longline fishery BRD literature to determine the general impact of BRD technology upon commercial fishing operations. There were relatively few papers with data suitable for a meta-analysis (15), therefore we pooled studies in the analysis with BRD and fishery related metrics included as covariates. Overall, we found no reduction in target fish catch. In fact, we found an increase in target catch of 9% (95% CI [1,17]) with BRD use. We show that this increase occurs while BRDs reduce seabird bycatch by 89% (95% CI [82,93]). These patterns do not change with respect to geographic location or BRD type, indicating that efforts to reduce seabird bycatch are generally effective under different conditions. Our review identifies research needed to ensure the generality of our findings and to better understand the impacts of BRD implementation upon seabird conservation and commercial fisheries.  aPublisher supplied data 3abycatch 3afish 3alongline fisheries 3ameta-analysis 3amortality 3aseabirds 0aSeabird conservation 0aBycatch 0aFisheries 0aMeta-analysis 0aLongline fishing1 aAagaard, Kevin1 aBurkhalter, J.C.1 aRobinson, Orin J.0 tJournal for nature conservation.g2017 July, v. 38 p.37-45dElsevier GmbHwJournal:J000000095x1617-13817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2017.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01547naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245006600130300001400196500001900210520079200229592002801021650001601049650001001065650001201075651001001087653001701097653001601114653001201130773010601142852000901248655001201257IND60709878820221122032350.0200908e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070987882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKharat, G.

Histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) is required for licensing piRNA production by these clusters. However, it is unclear when and how they acquire this permissive heterochromatic state. Here, we show that transient Piwi depletion in Drosophila embryos results in H3K9me3 decrease at piRNA clusters in ovaries. This is accompanied by impaired biogenesis of ovarian piRNAs, accumulation of transposable element transcripts, and female sterility. Conversely, Piwi depletion at later developmental stages does not disturb piRNA cluster licensing. These results indicate that the identity of piRNA clusters is epigenetically acquired in a Piwi-dependent manner during embryonic development, which is reminiscent of the widespread genome reprogramming occurring during early mammalian zygotic development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aadults 3abiogenesis 3aembryogenesis 3afemale fertility 3afemales 3agenome 3agerm cells 3aheterochromatin 3ahistones 3alysine 3amammals 3atransposons 0aheterochromatin 0apiRNA 0aH3K9me3 0aPiwi 0aDrosophila embryo 0areprogramming 0aepigenetics 0atransposable elements1 aMugat, Bruno1 aBarckmann, Bridlin1 aVarela-Chavez, Carolina1 aLi, Blaise1 aRaffel, Raoul1 aPélisson, Alain1 aChambeyron, Séverine0 tMolecular cell.g2017 May 04, v. 66, no. 3 p.411-419.e4dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2017.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02180naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245007000165300001800235520047000253536032600723592002801049596001301077596001601090596001801106650002201124650002201146650001201168650001301180650002101193650002201214653002801236653001601264653001801280653003801298700001401336700001801350700001901368700002201387700001901409700001801428700001601446700001601462773012501478856008601603852000901689655001201698IND60772562020221120083515.0220404e20220418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077256202DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2020.18512242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Pei12aA new picrotoxane-type sesquiterpene from Dendrobium nobile Lindl  ap. 2112-2117.  aA picrotoxane-type sesquiterpene, dendroterpene E (1), together with five benzene derivatives (2–6), were isolated from the stems of Dendrobium nobile Lindl.

To understand the factors that regulate the success of alien plant species we sampled alien plant biomass and species composition in 66 sites representing a wide variety of habitat types within Bruce Peninsula National Park, Ontario, Canada. We quantified the response of existing alien biomass to a suite of habitat variables including habitat productivity, standing biomass, species richness, soil nutrients and disturbance factors. Standing biomass in the sites varied from 0 to nearly 60 000 g/m² and annual productivity ranged from 0 to nearly 800 g·m⁻²·yr⁻¹. The response of both absolute and relative alien biomass (dominance) to the independent variables was assessed using univariate plots and multivariate canonical correspondence analysis. The results show that total standing alien biomass and site disturbance history can predict alien dominance, but other factors including primary productivity, nutrient levels, and site species richness cannot. In the multivariate analysis, species composition of both aliens and natives was best explained by nutrient levels, disturbance type, biomass, and, to a lesser extent, productivity. The study illustrates the value of examining both absolute abundance and dominance of aliens across a broad array of habitat types, and in the context of a large suite of possible driving functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainvasive species 3aplant growth 3adry matter accumulation 3acolonizing ability 3aspecies diversity 3aenvironmental factors 3aOntario1 aReader, R.

The beads were grafted with poly(hydroxylpropyl methacrylate) (pHPMA) and used for immobilization of trypsin via click chemistry. The p(HPMA) units in the brushes made the fibrous polymer hydrophilic. Synthesized beads were characterized by swelling studies, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The bromo groups of the grafted polymer were modified into azide groups, and the enzyme was alkyne-functionalized for conjugation with azide-modified magnetic beads via click reaction. The kinetic constants (Kₘ and Vₘₐₓ) were determined by measuring initial reaction rates using the artificial chromogenic substrate N-benzoyl-dl-arginine 4-nitroanilide hydrochloride (BApNA). The optimal pH value for the immobilized enzyme was slightly higher compared to free enzyme. The immobilized trypsin possessed much higher thermal stability than the free enzyme. Finally, the immobilized enzyme was placed in a microbioreactor for efficient proteolysis of model proteins, namely, bovine serum albumin (BSA), lysozyme, and cytochrome c.

The biosensor is based on a direct competitive immunoassay using peroxidase–cortisol conjugate, detected by adding the chemiluminescent substrate luminol/enhancer/hydrogen peroxide. The smartphone camera is used as light detector, for image acquisition and data handling via a specific application. We 3D-printed simple accessories to adapt the smartphone. The system comprises a cartridge, which houses the LFIA strip, and a smartphone adaptor with a plano-convex lens and a cartridge-insertion slot. This provides a mini-darkbox and aligned optical interface between the camera and the LFIA membrane for acquiring CL signals. The method is simple and fast, with a detection limit of 0.3ng/mL. It provides quantitative analysis in the range of 0.3–60ng/mL, which is adequate for detecting salivary cortisol in the clinically accepted range. It could thus find application in the growing area of home-self-diagnostic device technology for clinical biomarker monitoring, overcoming the current difficulties in achieving sensitive and quantitative information with conventional systems taking the advantage of smartphone connectivity and the enhanced performance of the included camera.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3acameras 3achemiluminescence 3acortisol 3adetection limit 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aimmunoassays 3amonitoring 3aquantitative analysis 0aBiosensor 0aChemiluminescence 0aLateral flow immunoassay 0aCortisol 0aPoint-of-care 0aSmartphone1 aCevenini, Luca1 aAnfossi, Laura1 aBaggiani, Claudio1 aSimoni, Patrizia1 aDi Nardo, Fabio1 aRoda, A.q(Aldo),0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2015 Feb. 15, v. 64 p.63-68dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2014.08.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245012400168300001800292520141700310592002801727650001201755650002301767650001001790650001901800650001501819650000701834650001201841650001601853700002001869700002401889700002401913773012701937856007402064852000902138655001202147IND60638371620221119182133.0190429e20160526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063837162DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ay00104a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerenjeh, Fariba Nazari12aA new optical sensor for selective quantitation of uranium by the immobilization of arsenazo III on an agarose membrane  ap. 4181-4187.  aA highly selective optical sensor was introduced for the determination of UO₂²⁺ through the chemical immobilization of arsenazo III on a transparent agarose membrane. Spectrophotometric studies of complex formation between arsenazo III and several metal ions at pH 2 show a significantly larger stability constant for the uranyl ion complex compared to the others. Consequently, arsenazo III was used as an appropriate ionophore for the preparation of a selective UO₂²⁺ optical sensor, through its chemical immobilization on a transparent agarose film. The immobilization conditions were optimized and the prepared optical sensor showed a distinct color change from purple to dark violet upon increasing the analyte concentration in a buffered solution at pH 2. The effects of pH, the ionophore concentration, the ionic strength and the reaction time on the response of the sensor were carefully studied. The experimental points were best fitted to two distinct lines within the concentration ranges of 3.8 × 10⁻⁷ to 7.4 × 10⁻⁵ mol L⁻¹ and 7.4 × 10⁻⁵ to 2.1 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹ with R² values of 0.982 and 0.994, respectively. No significant interference from 100 times the concentration of a number of potentially interfering ions was detected during uranyl ion determination. The optical sensor was successfully applied to the determination of UO₂²⁺ in spiked water samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagarose 3aanalytical methods 3acolor 3aionic strength 3ametal ions 3apH 3auranium 3auranyl ions1 aHashemi, Payman1 aGhiasvand, Ali Reza1 aRasolzadeh, Fahimeh0 tAnalytical methods.g2016 May 26, v. 8, no. 21 p.4181-4187dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ay00104a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245009100154300001600245500002000261520097700281592002801258650000901286650001601295650002501311650001601336650001001352650001801362650001501380650001701395650002001412650001701432650001601449650002801465650002001493700001801513700002201531700001901553700001601572700001401588700002901602773012201631856007301753852000901826655001201835IND60537295320221116174526.0160807e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053729532DNAL7 a10.1111/jbg.121962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGurgul, A.10aIdentification of genome‐wide selection signatures in the Limousin beef cattle breed  ap. 264-276.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe study is aimed at identifying selection footprints within the genome of Limousin cattle. With the use of Extended Haplotype Homozygosity test, supplemented with correction for variation in recombination rates across the genome, we created map of selection footprints and detected 173 significant (p < 0.01) core haplotypes being potentially under positive selection. Within these regions, a number of candidate genes associated inter alia with skeletal muscle growth (GDF15, BMP7, BMP4 and TGFB3) or postmortem proteolysis and meat maturation (CAPN1 and CAPN5) were annotated. Noticeable clusters of selection footprints were detected on chromosomes 1, 4, 8 and 14, which are known to carry several quantitative trait loci for growth traits and meat quality. The study provides information about the genes and metabolic pathways potentially modified under the influence of directional selection, aimed at improving beef production characteristics in Limousin cattle.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3abeef cattle 3abiochemical pathways 3achromosomes 3agenes 3agrowth traits 3ahaplotypes 3ahomozygosity 3ameat production 3ameat quality 3aproteolysis 3aquantitative trait loci 3askeletal muscle1 aSzmatoła, T.1 aRopka‐Molik, K.1 aJasielczuk, I.1 aPawlina, K.1 aSemik, E.1 aBugno‐Poniewierska, M.0 tJournal of animal breeding and genetics.g2016 Aug., v. 133, no. 4 p.264-276dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0931-26687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbg.121963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04467naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245014800167500001400315520256100329592002802890650001002918650001902928650001302947650001002960650002002970650002602990650001703016650001803033650002303051650001203074650001103086650001403097650001503111650002203126650001403148651001003162651001003172653000903182653000903191653000903200653000803209653000903217653000903226653000803235653001403243653000903257653001803266653000803284653000703292653000803299653000803307653002303315653001403338653000903352653001403361653003403375700002403409700002103433700002003454700001803474700002203492700002003514700001903534773008803553856008303641852000903724655001203733IND60674218120221118035324.0191231e20200205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067421812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2019.1441622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuhonja, Linah10aGenome-wide SNP marker discovery and phylogenetic analysis of mulberry varieties using double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing  aNAL-light  aThere has been long taxonomic debate on mulberry species (genus Morus) because the classification of mulberry species has relied on morphological characteristics. Although attempts for classifying mulberry species using molecular markers have been performed, phylogenetic relationships among diploid mulberry species remain unclear. In this study, we aim to investigate the genetic relationship between 54 diploid mulberry varieties belonging to seven different Morus species (M. alba, M. indica, M. bombycis, M. acidosa, M. latifolia, M. kagayamae, and M. rotundiloba) and one unspecified Morus species (‘Enbu’) using genome-wide SNP discovery and phylogenetic analysis via double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq). Genome-wide 2229 homozygous SNPs of 54 mulberry varieties in the eight species were identified by ddRAD-seq. Results of the phylogenetic analysis identified only three clear monophyletic clades in two Japanese native species, M. acidosa and M. kagayamae, which are found on different geographically isolated islands and a Thai species, M. rotundiloba, whereas the other species were non-monophyletic. Varieties of M. bombycis, another Japanese native species, were roughly classified into three groups. Of these, two M. bombycis groups were monophyletic with M. acidosa and M. kagayamae, respectively, while another M. bombycis group was not monophyletic. Varieties of M. indica, an Indian native species, were classified into two different monophyletic clades. Of these, one clade was clearly monophyletic with an indigenous variety in Kenya, ‘Enbu’, while another clade was monophyletic with M. rotundiloba and one M. latifolia variety. There were no clear monophyletic clades within M. alba and M. latifolia varieties, which could be a result of several hybridization events after their introductions from China to Japan. Our results suggested that it was difficult to clearly classify the hybridized mulberry varieties even with genome-wide DNA markers. In addition to phylogenetic analysis, we also evaluated morphological characteristics of mulberry leaves for each variety. The results of morphological evaluation indicated that leaf tip ratio may correlate to genetic difference among the two M. bombycis groups in monophyletic clades and another M. bombycis group in non-monophyletic clades. These results suggested that leaf tip ratio might be used for evaluating hybridization of M. bombycis varieties. Over all, our results may provide new insights into taxonomic debate of mulberry species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aclassification 3adiploidy 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenetic relationships 3ahomozygosity 3ahybridization 3aindigenous species 3aislands 3aleaves 3amonophyly 3amulberries 3asequence analysis 3avarieties 3aChina 3aKenya 0aAFLP 0aDAMD 0aRAPD 0aSSR 0aISSR 0aSRAP 0aITS 0addRAD-seq 0aSNPs 0aNARO Genebank 0aDRA 0aNJ 0aLTR 0aLBR 0aMulberry varieties 0addRAD-seq 0aSNPs 0aPhylogeny 0aMorphological characteristics1 aYamanouchi, Hiroaki1 aYang, Ching-chia1 aKuwazaki, Seigo1 aYokoi, Kakeru1 aKameda, Tsunenori1 aSezutsu, Hideki1 aJouraku, Akiya0 tGene.g2020 Feb. 05, v. 726 p.144162-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2019.1441623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04378naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003400135040001800169100002100187245017300208300001200381506007600393520254800469592002803017506003703045650002103082650000903103650002503112650001403137650001403151650001303165650001803178650001703196650002903213650001903242650003503261650002003296650001403316650001503330650001103345650001903356650001603375650002203391650001203413650005203425650001303477650001503490700001703505700002003522700001703542700002003559773013103579856008103710852000903791655001203800IND60555615220221207125550.0220810e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055561522DNAL7 a231105072pmid7 aPMC35752962pmcid7 a10.1186/1472-6882-12-2012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Chien-hung,10aEpigallocathechin gallate, polyphenol present in green tea, inhibits stem-like characteristics and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in nasopharyngeal cancer cell lines  ap. 201.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that the consumption of green tea inhibits the growth of various cancers. Most cancers are believed to be initiated from and maintained by a small population of cancer stem-like cells (CSC) or tumor-initiating cells (TIC) that are responsible for tumor relapse and chemotherapeutic resistance. Although epigallocathechin gallate (EGCG), the most abundant catechin in green tea, has been reported to induce growth inhibition and apoptosis in some cancer cells, its effect on CSC is undefined. In this study, we enriched CSC by the sphere formation, and provided an efficient model for further experiments. Using this method, we examined the effects of EGCG regulating the nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) CSC and attempted to elucidate the possible mechanisms. METHODS: NPC TW01 and TW06 cell lines were enriched by sphere formation and characterized their phenotypical properties, such as invasion capacity, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and gene expression were analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (q-RT-PCR). EGCG-induced growth inhibition in the parental and sphere-derived cells was determined by MTT and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) assay. EGCG-induced apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry with Annexin V and PI staining. The effects of EGCG on sphere-derived cell tumorigenicity, migration and invasion were determined by soft agar assay, wound healing, and cell invasion assay. The alternation of protein expression regulated by EGCG on these sphere-derived cells was assessed by immunofluorescence staining and western blot. RESULTS: NPC sphere-derived cells grown in serum-free non-adherent culture showed increased expression of stem cell markers and EMT markers compared to parental cells grown in conventional culture. Although EGCG induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in the parental cells in a dose-dependent manner, it was not as effective against spheres. However, EGCG potently inhibited sphere formation and can eliminate the stem cell characteristics of NPC and inhibit the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signatures. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings show that NPC cells with sphere formations possess the properties of CSC. Using this model, we found that EGCG regulated NPC CSC, their self-renewal capacity, and inhibited their invasive characteristics. It supports the pivotal role of EGCG as a dietary compound targeting NPC and may decrease recurrence and metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWestern blotting 3aagar 3aalternative medicine 3aapoptosis 3acarcinoma 3acatechin 3adose response 3adrug therapy 3aepigallocatechin gallate 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agene expression 3agreen tea 3ametastasis 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3apolyphenols 3aprotein synthesis 3arelapse 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astaining 3astem cells1 aShen, Yao-An1 aHung, Peir-Haur1 aYu, Yuan-Bin1 aChen, Yann-Jang0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2012 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.201-201dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-12-2013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02101naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012200164300001600286520085800302592002801160650003201188650001701220650001501237650002001252650002501272650002201297650002001319650001001339650001101349650001501360650001301375650001901388650002901407700001801436700002401454700001801478700002101496773010501517856004801622852000901670655001201679IND50064450520221119201833.0130530e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006445052DNAL7 a10.1007/s12272-013-0067-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoo, Jung Ki10amiR-7641 modulates the expression of CXCL1 during endothelial differentiation derived from human embryonic stem cells  ap. 353-358.  aMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression through binding to 3′ untranslated region. We identified and characterized the novel miRNA, miR-7641, in human mesenchymal stem cells. The expression of miR-7641 was downregulated during differentiation from human embryonic stem cells to endothelial cells. The CXCL1, a member of the CXC chemokine family, is known as promoting neovascularization by binding G-protein coupled receptors and is related to endothelial cells biogenesis such as angiogenesis, and it was predicted as target gene of miR-7641 by computerized analysis and the luciferase reporter assay. The miR-7641 significantly suppressed CXCL1 of transcriptional and post-translational levels. These data suggest that miR-7641 might be related with differentiation of human endothelial cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aangiogenesis 3abiogenesis 3achemokine CXCL1 3aembryonic stem cells 3aendothelial cells 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahumans 3aluciferase 3amicroRNA 3anon-coding RNA 3atranscription (genetics)1 aJung, Ho Yong1 aKim, Chʻang-hyŏn,1 aSon, Woo Sung1 aKim, Jin Kyeoung0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g2013 Mar., v. 36, no. 3 p.353-358dSpringer-Verlagx0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12272-013-0067-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02041naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245014000166300001600306520075400322592002801076650001501104650001601119650002201135650002001157650001301177653003001190653001801220653001601238653002301254700001201277700001301289700001601302700001701318700001401335700001501349700002601364700001601390700001401406773009601420856008201516852000901598655001201607IND60091685020221121062712.0161021e20131115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009168502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2013.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMei, Zhanlong10aOne-step signal amplified lateral flow strip biosensor for ultrasensitive and on-site detection of bisphenol A (BPA) in aqueous samples  ap. 457-461.  aA one-step signal amplified lateral flow strip (LFS) biosensor has been developed for ultrasensitive and on-site visual detection of bisphenol A (BPA). This signal amplified LFS was based on the dual labeling using different-sized gold nanoparticles (Duo-LFS). This Duo-LFS could achieve BPA detection with 0.5ng/mL as the visual sensitivity by naked eye observation and with 0.076ng/mL as the limit of detection (LOD) for semi-quantitative detection by software analysis, which is at least 10-fold improvement of the sensitivity of traditional LFS based methods. This one-step signal amplified lateral flow strip biosensor and related signal enhancement method could be adopted as a potential generous technique for all LFS-based detection methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3abisphenol A 3acomputer software 3adetection limit 3ananogold 0aSensitivity amplification 0aBPA detection 0aFood safety 0aLateral flow strip1 aQu, Wei1 aDeng, Yi1 aChu, Huaqin1 aCao, Jinxuan1 aXue, Feng1 aZheng, Lei1 aEl-Nezamic, Hani Said1 aWu, Yucheng1 aChen, Wei0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2013 Nov. 15, v. 49 p.457-461dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2013.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03604naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245011900152300001600271500001900287500002000306520212000326592002802446596005902474596005902533650002102592650001902613650001602632650001302648650002002661650001202681650001302693650001802706650001402724650001602738650001602754650002502770650001302795700005202808700001302860700001102873700001302884700001202897773013102909856007303040852000903113655001203122IND60701731320221123011206.0200714e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070173132DNAL7 a10.1111/lam.133042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, R.10aProteolytic activity of Vibrio harveyi YeaZ is related with resuscitation on the viable but non‐culturable state  ap. 126-133.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe YeaZ protein of Vibrio harveyi was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The purified recombinant protein YeaZ exhibited the protease activity. The proteolytic activities with azocasein as substrate were 39 130 U mg⁻¹. The mutation of the amino acid in active sites such as Asp⁸⁸, Ser¹⁸⁵ and Trp¹⁶⁹ was performed. The enzyme activities of the purified mutant proteins with Asp⁸⁸‐Ala, Ser¹⁸⁵‐Leu and Trp¹⁶⁹‐Glu were decreased to 24·28, 35·27 and 41·66%, respectively. The mutant protein with two amino acid residues (Asp⁸⁸‐Ala/Ser¹⁸⁵‐Leu) lost the protease activity completely. Addition of the purified recombinant YeaZ increased resuscitation of the viable but non‐culturable state (VBNC) cells to culturable state, and the culturable cell count increased from 1·35 × 10² to 3·10 × 10⁶ CFU per ml. While addition of the mutant YeaZ without protease activities did not show obvious promoting effect on resuscitation of VBNC cells. Moreover, the purified YeaZ also showed lower muralytic activity, and the activities of proteins with single amino acids mutation (Thr⁷¹ and Asp¹¹²) were reduced from 7·05 to 4·75 and 2·50 U mg⁻¹, the resuscitation‐promoting effect on VBNC cells was not affected by these mutant proteins. These results implied that resuscitation‐promoting effect of YeaZ on VBNC cell was partly related to its protease activities, but not with the muralytic activity. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Vibrio harveyi is a major pathogen of marine animals. The bacterium could enter into a viable but non‐culturable state (VBNC) state when exposed to harsh conditions, and retains its pathogenicity after resuscitation. In this work, we analysed the enzyme activities of a resuscitation‐promoting factor YeaZ and the relationship of protease activities with its promoting effect on the resuscitation of VBNC cells. The results partly revealed the promoting mechanism of the YeaZ on the bacterial resuscitation from VBNC state. The protein could be used as a new drug target and vaccine candidate.  aPublisher supplied data  a31272694cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31760028cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aEscherichia coli 3aVibrio harveyi 3aamino acids 3abacteria 3aenzyme activity 3amutants 3amutation 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aproteinases 3aproteolysis 3arecombinant proteins 3avaccines1 aChen, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2032-87271 aWang, Y.1 aLi, Y.1 aKong, X.1 aHan, Y.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2020 Aug., v. 71, no. 2 p.126-133dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl37648x0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.133043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03485naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245007300205500001400278520178400292592002802076650001202104650002802116650001402144650001302158650001002171650001702181650001802198650001702216650002202233650001102255650001702266650002402283650001302307650001702320650001302337650003502350650001102385651001202396653000802408653001102416653000802427653001002435653000802445653000902453653000902462653001502471653001002486700005802496700001902554700002102573700002002594700001702614710004502631773010302676856008302779852000902862655001202871IND60674218220221118035449.0201111e20200130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067421822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2019.1441632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkosile, Wole1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3183-904710aNLRP3 is associated with coronary artery disease in Vietnam veterans  aNAL-light  aPrevious studies have established that coronary artery disease is associated with excess inflammation. These studies have shown an elevation of both pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines in sufferers of coronary artery disease. There is increasing interest in the role played by the inflammasome Nod Like Receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) in the aetiology of coronary artery disease. Increased severity of coronary artery disease correlates with higher levels of expression of NLRP3. Does NLRP3 polymorphisms play a role in the aetiology of coronary artery disease?In a cohort of Vietnam War (n-299) veterans who have been previously exposed to trauma, NLRP3 polymorphisms were analysed for association with coronary calcium scores using analyses of variance. Independent t-test was used to analyse genotypes. In samples with a small representation of minor homozygotes, genotypes were combined and analysed using independent t-test. If any of the genotype analysis suggested the potential for a dominant or a recessive model the model was further explored. Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium was calculated using Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium calculator including analysis for ascertainment bias.The NLRP3 polymorphism, rs10159239 was significantly associated (p = 0.001) with a higher raised coronary calcium score. The Single Nucleotide Polymorphism rs10159239 was examined by logistic regression with known risk factors for Coronary artery disease and remained significant (0.035). This is the first time rs10159239 A-allele has been associated with raised coronary calcium score.This is the first time rs10159239 A-allele has been associated with raised coronary calcium score. Further research is needed to replicate our results in larger well-characterised cohorts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acoronary artery disease 3acytokines 3aetiology 3agenes 3ahomozygosity 3ainflammasomes 3ainflammation 3amilitary veterans 3amodels 3apolymorphism 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3arisk factors 3asampling 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3at-test 3aVietnam 0aCAD 0aNLRP12 0aNLR 0aNLRP3 0aCVD 0aPTSD 0aSNPS 0aDepression 0aNLRP31 aVoisey, Joanne1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6645-61641 aLawford, Bruce1 aColquhoun, David1 aMcD Young, Ross1 aMehta, Divya2 aon behalf of the PTSD Initiativeeauthor0 tGene.g2020 Jan. 30, v. 725 p.144163-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2019.1441633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03572naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245019200171520164600363592002802009650001502037650001102052650001202063650001702075650001902092650002902111650000902140650001602149650002202165650001502187650001802202650002602220650002002246650001102266650001402277650001402291650000902305650001202314650001802326651001602344653003402360653002202394653003802416653001702454653002402471653002802495653002002523700002802543700002802571700001802599700002502617700001502642700001702657700002102674700001702695700002302712773010502735856008502840852000902925655001202934IND60689025320221121223530.0200607e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068902532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2020.1057082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCreusot, Nicolas10aRetrospective screening of high-resolution mass spectrometry archived digital samples can improve environmental risk assessment of emerging contaminants: A case study on antifungal azoles  aEnvironmental risk assessment associated with aquatic and terrestrial contamination is mostly based on predicted or measured environmental concentrations of a limited list of chemicals in a restricted number of environmental compartments. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) can provide a more comprehensive picture of exposure to harmful chemicals, particularly through the retrospective analysis of digitally stored HRMS data. Using this methodology, our study characterized the contamination of various environmental compartments including 154 surface water, 46 urban effluent, 67 sediment, 15 soil, 34 groundwater, 24 biofilm, 41 gammarid and 49 fish samples at 95 sites widely distributed over the Swiss Plateau. As a proof-of-concept, we focused our investigation on antifungal azoles, a class of chemicals of emerging concern due to their endocrine disrupting effects on aquatic organisms and humans. Our results demonstrated the occurrence of antifungal azoles and some of their (bio)transformation products in all the analyzed compartments (0.1–100 ng/L or ng/g d.w.). Comparison of actual and predicted concentrations showed the partial suitability of level 1 fugacity modelling in predicting the exposure to azoles. Risk quotient calculations additionally revealed risk of exposure especially if some of the investigated rivers and streams are used for drinking water production. The case study clearly shows that the retrospective analysis of HRMS/MS data can improve the current knowledge on exposure and the related risks to chemicals of emerging concern and can be effectively employed in the future for such purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGammaridae 3aazoles 3abiofilm 3acase studies 3adrinking water 3aenvironmental assessment 3afish 3agroundwater 3amass spectrometry 3aprediction 3arelative risk 3aretrospective studies 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3ascreening 3asediments 3asoil 3astreams 3asurface water 3aSwitzerland 0aEnvironmental risk assessment 0aAntifungal-azoles 0aHigh resolution mass spectrometry 0aPartitioning 0aExposure assessment 0aRetrospective screening 0aDigital samples1 aCasado-Martinez, Carmen1 aChiaia-Hernandez, Aurea1 aKiefer, Karin1 aFerrari, Benoit J.D.1 aFu, Qiuguo1 aMunz, Nicole1 aStamm, Christian1 aTlili, Ahmed1 aHollender, Juliane0 tEnvironment international.g2020 June, v. 139 p.105708-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.1057083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007300164520134600237592002801583650001401611650002001625650001001645650001101655650001101666650001301677650001901690650001201709650002701721650002001748650001601768653000901784653002701793653001901820700001301839700001701852700001301869700001401882700001301896773010701909856008202016852000902098655001202107IND60684988820221121071319.0201024e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068498882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2020.1029362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Huiping10aEffect of NaCl on rheological properties of dough and noodle quality  aTo assess the effect of NaCl on processing properties of different varieties of wheat flour and noodle quality, the rheological properties of dough, and the quality of white salted noodles made from three different varieties of wheat flour were evaluated. The results showed that the addition of NaCl had different effects on the rheological properties of different varieties of wheat flour. As NaCl concentration increased, the stability time of both intermediate-gluten and weak-gluten wheat flour increased, while that of strong-gluten wheat flour increased initially and then remained stable. The developing time of strong-gluten wheat flour increased, while those of both intermediate-gluten and weak-gluten wheat flour did not change significantly. The energy values of intermediate- and weak-gluten wheat flour did not change significantly while that of strong-gluten wheat flour increased. NaCl had no apparent effects on the hardness, springiness, gumminess, chewiness and resilience of noodles. The cooking loss of fresh noodles increased positively with increasing NaCl concentration. Microstructure of noodles showed that gluten network structure of noodles became more and more dense with increasing NaCl concentration. The effect of NaCl on gluten protein contributed to the change of rheological properties and noodle quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3achewiness 3acooking quality 3adough 3aenergy 3agluten 3ahardness 3amicrostructure 3anoodles 3arheological properties 3asodium chloride 3awheat flour 0aNaCl 0aRheological properties 0aNoodle quality1 aFu, Feng1 aChen, Yuehua1 aLiu, Mei1 aAi, Zhilu1 aBian, Ke0 tJournal of cereal science.g2020 May, v. 93 p.102936-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2020.1029363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03499naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009700171520179600268592002802064650001502092650001102107650002402118650002602142650002102168650001702189650000902206650002102215650002302236650001302259650001902272650001302291650001102304650001502315650002602330650001902356650001902375650001102394650000702405650000902412650001402421650001002435650001302445650001802458650001302476651001102489653001402500653001202514653002302526700002002549700002002569700002302589700002802612700001902640700001302659773010702672856008502779852000902864655001202873IND60676160020221117180824.0200210e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067616002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2019.1136012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaulier, Camille10aLeaching of two northern France slag heaps: Influence on the surrounding aquatic environment  aAfter the exploitation of coal mines in the 19th and 20th centuries in northern France, many mining slag heaps (SH) were left without any particular management or monitoring. Currently, the influence of these SHs on the quality of surrounding wetlands is hardly known.The purpose of this work is to determine the water quality in the neighbourhood of two SHs located near the city of Douai and its influence on the distribution of aquatic invertebrates in local wetlands. Our approach involves (1) the spatial and temporal characterization of the water composition (anions, major elements, sulphide, DOC and alkalinity) and of the biological diversity (aquatic invertebrates) and (2), based on this chemical and biological screening, the establishment of relationships between water quality and biodiversity distribution through multivariate data analysis. The results clearly indicate that substantial leaching from the slag heaps occurs, given the very high concentrations of dissolved sulphates (in the range of 2 g L⁻¹). While the pH remains weakly basic, indicating that the leaching water has been neutralized by the highly carbonated regional substratum, high levels of biodegradable organic matter and sulphate contents have been noticed. They sporadically cause significant drops in dissolved oxygen and the occurrence of dissolved sulphides that massively reduce biodiversity, qualitatively and quantitatively. In Summer, oxygen saturation is generally lower due to the higher rate of organic matter degradation, and the risk of anoxic episodes therefore increases. Finally, as wetlands are vulnerable environments, these preliminary results suggest that monitoring and management of these sites must be attempted quickly to avoid the degradation of those valuable habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalinity 3aanions 3aaquatic environment 3aaquatic invertebrates 3abiodegradability 3abiodiversity 3acoal 3adissolved oxygen 3adissolved sulfates 3ahabitats 3ahydrochemistry 3aleaching 3amining 3amonitoring 3amultivariate analysis 3aneutralization 3aorganic matter 3aoxygen 3apH 3arisk 3ascreening 3aslags 3asulfides 3awater quality 3awetlands 3aFrance 0aSlag heap 0aWetland 0aAcid mine drainage1 aBillon, Gabriel1 aLesven, Ludovic1 aFalantin, Cécilia1 aSuperville, Pierre-Jean1 aBaeyens, Willy1 aGao, Yue0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Feb., v. 257 p.113601-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.1136013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245006900162520166700231592002801898650002501926650001301951650001101964650003101975650001702006650002502023650001502048650002402063650002202087650001302109650001802122650001002140651001002150653002102160653001602181653002302197700001302220700001702233700001602250700001402266700001202280700001202292700001702304700001502321700001702336773010502353856008502458852000902543655001202552IND60689025420221121194057.0200607e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068902542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2020.1057072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Qi10aUrine metals concentrations and dyslexia among children in China  aExposures to heavy metals has been linked to many developmental disorders. However, few studies have investigated the effects of exposure and co-exposure to metals on dyslexia, especially with regard to dyslexics in China.To investigate the association between urine metal concentrations and dyslexia in a case-control study among children in China.A case-control study was conducted in the Tongji Reading Environment and Dyslexia (READ) research program. A total of 228 dyslexics and 228 controls were matched on gender, age (within one year), and grade. The concentrations of 21 urine metals were measured by an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were applied to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of Chinese dyslexia.After adjusting for potential confounders, two metals (selenium and argentum) were significantly associated with dyslexia in single-metal multivariable models. Argentum was positively associated with the risk of dyslexia, while selenium was negatively associated. In the multiple-metal model, compared with extreme quartiles, the ORs (95% CIs) for selenium was 0.36 (95% CI: 0.14–0.93; Pₜᵣₑₙd = 0.029). In the joint association analysis, children with higher levels of urine argentum and lower level of urine selenium had a significantly higher risk of dyslexia than those with low levels of argentum and selenium (OR = 5.06, 95% CI: 1.67–18.84).The findings suggest that exposure to selenium and argentum may relate to dyslexia in China. Longitudinal studies are needed to further evaluate these relationships and investigate potential mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase-control studies 3achildren 3agender 3ahealth effects assessments 3aheavy metals 3alongitudinal studies 3aodds ratio 3aregression analysis 3aresearch programs 3aselenium 3aspectrometers 3aurine 3aChina 0aChinese dyslexia 0aUrine metal 0aCase-control study1 aZhou, Yu1 aGu, Huaiting1 aXie, Xinyan1 aHou, Fang1 aLiu, Qi1 aWu, Hao1 aZhu, Kaiheng1 aWan, Zihao1 aSong, Ranran0 tEnvironment international.g2020 June, v. 139 p.105707-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.1057073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02557naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245013400159520112400293592002801417650001201445650001101457650002201468650001001490650001801500650001001518650001101528650000901539650000901548650003301557650002001590650001901610650002101629650001901650650001701669653001801686653002201704653002401726653002401750700001501774700001601789700002901805700001601834700001501850773010701865856008201972852000902054655001202063IND60684988920221121055520.0201024e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068498892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2020.1029372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yao10aComparison of structural features of reconstituted doughs affected by starches from different cereals and other botanical sources  aStarch, as the main component of flour products, determines the physicochemical properties of dough. This work investigated the relationship of the physical properties of seven types of starches from various cereals with the structural features of reconstituted dough. Results of mixing and tensile properties analysis and scanning electron microscopy displayed that rice reconstituted flour exhibited maximum water absorption; pea reconstituted flour had higher dough stability; sweet potato dough had higher tensile resistance; highland barley dough had the greatest extensibility. Moisture distribution analysis revealed that various model dough showed remarkably different water distribution, which was distributed at T₂₁ (0.07–0.11 ms), T₂₂ (0.8–2.66 ms) and T₂₃ (10.0–20.82 ms). Correlation analysis indicated that large starch granules associated with good dough stability; amylose content of starch positively affected tensile resistance of dough; crystallinity of starch showed negative effects on water absorption; starch with higher crystallinity associated with greater dough stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylose 3abarley 3acrystal structure 3adough 3aextensibility 3aflour 3amixing 3apeas 3arice 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astarch granules 3asweet potatoes 3atensile strength 3awater activity 3awater uptake 0aCereal grains 0aStarch properties 0aStructural features 0aReconstituted dough1 aLiu, Haibo1 aWang, Yuyan1 aShabani, Kinyoro Ibrahim1 aQin, Xiaoli1 aLiu, Xiong0 tJournal of cereal science.g2020 May, v. 93 p.102937-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2020.1029373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01800naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011100156300001800267520080200285592002801087650001401115650001601129650001201145650001301157650001401170650002101184700001901205700001401224700001801238773013401256856007501390852000901465655001201474IND60537668420221121190235.0160809e20140326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053766842DNAL7 a10.1021/ie500280e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Shuxian10aComparing Polymer-Supported TEMPO Mediators for Cellulose Oxidation and Subsequent Polyvinylamine Grafting  ap. 4748-4754.  aA new poly(acrylic acid)-grafted TEMPO (PAA-T) is compared to polyvinylamine-grafted TEMPO and free TEMPO as oxidation mediators for cellulose. The polymer-immobilized mediators require lower overall TEMPO concentrations and they restrict oxidation to the exterior surfaces of porous cellulose. On the other hand, the resulting surfaces are coated with grafted polyvinylamine and laccase, if the enzyme is used as the primary oxidant. PAA-T is anionic and does not sufficiently adsorb onto anionic cellulose to give oxidation, whereas cellulose rendered cationic by an adsorbed layer of PVAm is oxidized by PAA-T + laccase. There is no clear “best choice” mediator/primary oxidant combination for cellulose oxidation subsequent to PVAm grafting; the advantages of each mediator are summarized.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3aengineering 3alaccase 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3apolyacrylic acid1 aPelton, Robert1 aFu, Qiang1 aYang, Songtao0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 Mar. 26, v. 53, no. 12 p.4748-4754dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie500280e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245017100160300001800331520113900349592002801488650001601516650002101532650002101553650004301574650001801617650002701635650001301662650001701675650001801692650002101710700002801731700001701759773012801776856007401904852000901978655001201987IND60638372020221119182024.0190429e20160616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063837202DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ay00112b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVosough, Maryam10aOptimization of matrix solid-phase dispersion coupled with high performance liquid chromatography for determination of selected antibiotics in municipal sewage sludge  ap. 4853-4860.  aTwo alternative matrix nano-solid phase dispersion approaches coupled with HPLC-DAD were developed for the determination of sulfadiazine, sulfamerazine and sulfamethoxazole in STP sludge samples. 0.2 g portions of the sludge sample were mixed with MWCNT–silica, and/or nano-silica–C18 as dispersant–sorbent materials and then extracted with appropriate solvents. Two series of 2⁴⁻¹ fractional factorial designs were assigned to study the most important experimental variables, weight and composition of the dispersing materials and type and volume of the elution solvent, and also to help find the optimized operational conditions. Among these, the set based on carbon nanotubes showed more acceptable results regarding the clean-up and final extract solution quality. The selected approach showed good sensitivity for the analytes with LOD values of 3.1–4.0 ng g⁻¹. It also produced linear responses over a range of three orders of magnitude (up to 4000 ng g⁻¹). The precision of the method was estimated for inter- and intra-day replicates at various concentrations and RSD values of less than 9.5% were achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3acarbon nanotubes 3achemical species 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3asewage sludge 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3asulfadiazine 3asulfamerazine 3asulfamethoxazole1 aOnilghi, Mahdieh Nazari1 aSalemi, Amir0 tAnalytical methods.g2016 June 16, v. 8, no. 24 p.4853-4860dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ay00112b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012800162300001600290500001900306520182500325592002802150650002702178650002802205650001402233650001802247650001602265650001802281650001702299650001802316650001102334650003002345650001902375653002002394653002002414653003002434700006202464700002302526700002102549700001902570700002002589700003002609773013602639856008102775852000902856655001202865IND60730336120221120163818.0210309e20210428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073033612DNAL7 a10.1017/S00071145200033722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yibin10aNutritional contributions of food pantries and other sources to the diets of rural, Midwestern food pantry users in the USA  ap. 891-901.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFood pantries provide free food to individuals at nutritional risk given lack of available foods. Frequent use of food pantries is associated with higher dietary quality; however, neither the nutrient contributions of food pantries to participant diets nor their relationship with household food security are known. This cross-sectional analysis used secondary data from rural food pantry participants, including sociodemographic characteristics, household food security and 24-h recalls. Mean intakes of selected food groups and nutrients from food pantries, supermarkets, other stores and restaurants, and other were compared by one-way ANCOVA. Interaction effects of household food security with food sources were evaluated by two-way ANCOVA. About 40 % of participants’ dietary intake came from food pantries. Mean intakes of fibre (P < 0·0001), Na (P < 0·0001), fruit (P < 0·0001), grains (P < 0·0001) and oils (P < 0·0001) were higher from food pantries compared with all other sources, as were Ca (P = 0·004), vitamin D (P < 0·0001) and K (P < 0·0001) from food pantries compared with two other sources. Percentage total energy intake (%TEI) from added sugars (P < 0·0001) and saturated fat (P < 0·0001) was higher from supermarkets than most other sources. Significant interaction effects were observed between food sources and household food security for vegetables (P = 0·01), Na (P = 0·01) and %TEI from saturated fat (P = 0·004), with food-insecure participants having significantly higher intakes from food pantries and/or supermarkets compared with all other sources. Future interventions may incorporate these findings by providing education on purchasing and preparing healthy meals on limited budgets, to complement foods received from pantries, and by reducing Na in pantry environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of covariance 3across-sectional studies 3aeducation 3aenergy intake 3afood intake 3afood pantries 3afood quality 3afood security 3afruits 3anutrition risk assessment 3asaturated fats 0aFood insecurity 0aNutrient intake 0aEmergency food assistance1 aDesmond, Nicole E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4157-26301 aWright, Breanne N.1 aBailey, Regan L.1 aDong, Tianning1 aCraig, Bruce A.1 aEicher-Miller, Heather A.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2021 Apr. 28, v. 125, no. 8 p.891-901dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145200033723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01208naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001800188245004500206300001600251506007600267520021100343592002800554506003700582650001900619650001700638650001900655650003100674650001900705773010100724856004800825852000900873655001200882IND50069999620221207113807.0131019e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006999962DNAL7 a240376822pmid7 aPMC38250342pmcid7 a10.1007/s11120-013-9919-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMauzerall, D.10aThermodynamics of primary photosynthesis  ap. 363-366.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe thermodynamics of photosynthesis has been much discussed, but recent articles have pointed to some confusion on the subject.

The mites from Lupinus albicaulis (no galls), Lupinus densiflorus (with gall-like deformities although not true galls), Cytisus striatus and C. scoparius are confirmed as A. genistae (the first three species were used in host specificity tests for A. genistae from C. scoparius and only C. striatus is confirmed as a new host for A. genistae). Another unrelated species, Aculops hussongi Keifer, was found on L. albicaulis in Nisqually, Washington, USA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAceria 3aAculops 3aCytisus scoparius 3aGenista monspessulana 3aLupinus 3aUlex europaeus 3agalls 3ahost specificity 3ahosts 3amites 3aNew Zealand 3aWashington (state) 0aeriophyoid mites 0ataxonomy 0aidentification 0amorphology 0ahost plants 0aAceria genistae1 aHong, Xiao-Yue1 aZhang, Zhi-Qiang0 tSystematic and applied acarology.g2016, v. 21, no. 11 p.1525-1533dSystematic and Applied Acarology SocietywJournal:23061x1362-19717nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245016700158300001800325520122400343592002801567650001701595650002201612650001001634650004101644650002601685650002301711650001501734650002101749650000901770650001601779700001801795700001901813700001301832700002101845700001401866700001401880700001501894700001601909773012701925856007402052852000902126655001202135IND60638372120221119182132.0190429e20160609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063837212DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ay00113k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Chunsu10aDevelopment of a GC-MS method for the determination and pharmacokinetics of trans-π-oxocamphor after intravenous administration of Vitacamphorae injection in rat  ap. 4720-4726.  aVitacamphorae injection is an aqueous solution of trans-π-oxocamphor (TOC) mainly used to treat central respiratory problems, such as cardiac and circulatory failure. Although in clinical use for decades, bioanalytical and pharmacokinetic data for TOC are limited due to its chemical and metabolic instability. This paper reports a simple and specific method for the determination of TOC in rat blood based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Sample preparation was limited to protein precipitation with acetonitrile after the addition of 2-nitro-1,3-dimethyl-5-tert-butylbenzene as the internal standard. Chromatography was carried out on an Agilent HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm) with temperature programming from 70 °C to 170 °C at a rate of 20 °C min⁻¹. Detection by electron impact mass spectrometry with selected ion monitoring was linear in the range of 50–5000 ng mL⁻¹ with good accuracy and precision. The method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of TOC in Sprague-Dawley rats after intravenous injection of a dose of 3.57 mg kg⁻¹. We anticipate that the assay will facilitate the further development and clinical application of Vitacamphorae injection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aaqueous solutions 3ablood 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aintravenous injection 3alaboratory animals 3amonitoring 3apharmacokinetics 3arats 3atemperature1 aYang, Zhichao1 aMeng, Xiangjun1 aYin, Lei1 aFawcett, J.

The gill transcript levels of genes involved in the transport of Cu (CTR1 and ATP7A), Na (NHE-2), Ca (ECaC), divalent metals (DMT1), and Zn (ZIP8) were also compared between treatments at 24 and 48 h. Cd uptake was significantly suppressed in the presence of Cu, indicating interaction between Cu and Cd at uptake sites, but Cu uptake was unaffected by Cd. The decrease in Cd accumulation rates in the presence of Cu was associated with an increase in transcript abundance of ECaC at 24 h and DMT1 at 48 h and a decrease in Zip8 transcript levels, all known as routes for Cd uptake. Fish exposed to 0.5 μM ⁶⁵Cu show an increase in gill ATP7a transcript abundance, suggesting that Cu is removed from the gill and is transferred to other organs for detoxification. A reduction in gill CTR1 transcript abundance was observed during the Cu–Cd exposure; this may be a regulatory mechanism to reduce Cu loading if Cu is entering the gills by other uptake routes, such as ECaC and DMT1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acopper 3acopper metabolism 3adivalent metals 3afish 3agene expression 3agenes 3agills 3amessenger RNA 3aphysiological transport 3asodium 3azinc1 aBury, N.R.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2014 Nov. 04, v. 48, no. 21 p.12946-12951dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes50322723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245011600159300001800275500002000293520180900313592002802122650001502150650003002165650001102195650001302206650002002219650002002239650002402259650001202283650001302295650001402308650001802322650001502340650001202355650001002367650000902377651001902386651001802405700001602423700001702439700001502456700001702471700001902488773011502507856007202622852000902694655001202703IND60537295920221116174449.0160807e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053729592DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.29682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHough‐Snee, N.10aHydrogeomorphic and Biotic Drivers of Instream Wood Differ Across Sub‐basins of the Columbia River Basin, USA  ap. 1302-1315.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInstream wood promotes habitat heterogeneity through its influence on flow hydraulics and channel geomorphology. Within the Columbia River Basin, USA, wood is vital for the creation and maintenance of habitat for threatened salmonids. However, our understanding of the relative roles of the climatic, geomorphic, and ecological processes that source wood to streams is limited, making it difficult to identify baseline predictions of instream wood and create targets for stream restoration. Here, we investigate how instream wood frequency and volume differ between seven sub‐basins of the interior Columbia River Basin and what processes shape these differences within these sub‐basins. We collected data on wood volume and frequency, discharge and stream power, and riparian and watershed forest structure for use in modelling wood volume and frequency. Using random forest models, we found that mean annual precipitation, riparian tree cover, and the individual watershed were the most important predictors of wood volume and frequency. Within sub‐basins, we used linear models, finding that some basins had unique predictors of wood. Discharge, watershed area, or precipitation often combined with forest cover, riparian conifer, and/or large tree cover in models of instream large wood volume and frequency. In many sub‐basins, models showed at least one hydrologic variable, indicative of transport competence and one ecological variable, indicative of the reach or upstream watershed's capability to grow measurable instream wood. We conclude that basin‐specific models yield important insights into the hydrologic and ecological processes that influence wood loads, creating tractable hypotheses for building predictive models of instream wood.

However, p53 deficiency or accumulated mutations are not the causes of aCLS cancers. The cause is the reversal, to unicellularity, of a metabolic stressed cell by activating silenced transition switches and ancestral gene networks inherited from early Metazoans. After reprogramming and transformation the cell-of-origin of cancer bypasses mitosis and forms the polyploid pCLS, the homemade pathogen of aCLS cancers. pCLS's daughter cells (microcells) generate the pretumorigenic cancer stem cell pool (pCSCs) that start in turn the unicellular cancer cell lineage containing reproductive and somatic sublines. While the reproductive subline gives rise to new autonomous aCLSs by asymmetric division and cyclic differentiation, the somatic subline grows aCLS free. In the course of cancer evolution, some of the somatic mutants convert to stem cell precursors (SCPs). Somatic SCPs transfer part of somatic mutations and epimutations to the genome of newly formed reproductive clones. In this way, subsequent generations of tumorigenic and metastatic CSCs are being produced. aCLS cancer development is neither chaotic nor deregulated it follows unicellular development patterns. The unicellular program is controlled by mechanisms from early eukaryotic evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnimalia 3acarcinogenesis 3aepigenetics 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenomics 3alifestyle 3ametastasis 3amitosis 3aneoplasm cells 3apathogens 3apolyploidy 3astem cells 0aCLS 0apCLS 0aaCLS 0agiCLS 0aPGCC 0aCSC 0aUG 0aMG 0aMG:UG 0aACD 0aICD 0aMUT 0aSCP 0aOCB 0aCancer 0aUnicellular 0aReproductive and somatic cell lines 0aStem cells (CSCs) 0aSomatic stem cell precursors (SCPs) 0aProtist stem cells0 tGene.g2020 Feb. 05, v. 726 p.144174-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2019.1441743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245013600171300001600307520134000323592002801663650002401691650000801715650000901723650001801732650002201750650001501772650002601787650001301813650002701826650002501853650001101878650001201889700002301901773013001924856008202054852000902136655001202145IND60575374820221119035429.0180619e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057537482DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-017-0591-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeilveil, JeffreyS.10aGenetic signatures of translocations and habitat fragmentation for two evolutionarily significant units of a protected fish species  ap. 631-638.  aGenetic population structure was evaluated for the White Sands pupfish (Cyprinodon tularosa), a protected fish species comprised of two Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs); the Malpais Spring ESU and the Salt Creek ESU. The Malpais Spring ESU is restricted to Malpais Spring, whereas the Salt Creek ESU includes the native Salt Creek population and two Salt Creek-derived populations at Mound Spring and Lost River; all three of these habitats are physically fragmented. We sampled the upper and lower reaches of the four populations, examining 13 DNA microsatellite loci from 40 individuals per population. As expected, significant genetic structure was observed between the two ESUs; Malpais Spring and Salt Creek. Substantial genetic drift was observed for the introduced Lost River population, with modest genetic drift for the introduced Mound Spring population. Taken together with ecological data, neither of the introduced populations successfully replicates the Salt Creek population. We also report significant reductions in genetic diversity for the upper reaches of both Salt Creek and Lost River, indicating that recent habitat changes have altered the genetic structure of these two populations. We consider these findings along with previously reported ecological data to develop guidelines for managing C. tularosa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinodon tularosa 3aDNA 3afish 3agenetic drift 3agenetic variation 3aguidelines 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation structure 3arivers 3astreams1 aStockwell, CraigA.0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2017 June, v. 100, no. 6 p.631-638dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl43475x0378-19097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-017-0591-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245009200174300001400266506002800280520151000308592002801818506003701846650001501883650002601898650001901924650001601943650001201959650001801971650002201989650001002011650001202021650002002033650001702053650002602070650001102096651001402107653001502121653001502136653002002151653001702171653000902188700002402197700002202221773015502243856009002398852000902488655001202497IND60775052120221207122847.0150622e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077505212DNAL7 a10.24843/Pastura.2012.v01.i02.p062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSirait, Juniar10aPOTENSI Indigofera sp.

The aim of this research was to study morphology, nutritive value, and palatability of Indigofera sp. that planted on 0.4 ha area at 1x0.5m2 plant-spaced. The research has conducted in lowland-wet climate agro-ecosystem at Goat Research Institute in Sungai Putih, Deli Serdang, North Sumatra, Indonesia. The fresh legume Indigofera sp. which harvested at seven months age and Leucaena leucocephala were fed to goats at the same time on palatability study. Twelve Boerka-goats were used in this experiment with average body weight 11.86±1.5 kg. The animals were allocated randomly into individual cages. The study of Indigofera sp. palatability has conducted for two weeks by competition system using L. leucocephala as the comparative. Data of dry matter intake were analysed using t-test. The result of this experiment showed that Indigofera sp. had good growth with high production and nutritive value. Fresh and dry matter productions at first harvest were 52 and 11 t/ha, respectively. Leaves proportion (36.4%) was lower than stem (63.6%). Crude protein content of Indigofera sp. was quite high (24.17%) based on dry matter. The palatability of Indigofera sp. was relatively similar with L. leucocephala. There was no difference of dry matter intake between Indigofera sp. (187.38±29.69 g/h/d) and L. leucocephala (193.85±21.53g/h/d). It was concluded that Indigofera sp. was a-high production and nutritive value; potential for goat feed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aIndigofera 3aLeucaena leucocephala 3aagroecosystems 3abody weight 3aclimate 3acrude protein 3adry matter intake 3agoats 3alegumes 3anutritive value 3apalatability 3aresearch institutions 3at-test 3aIndonesia 0aindigofera 0aproduction 0anutritive value 0apalatability 0agoat1 aSimanihuruk, Kiston1 aHutasoit, Rijanto0 tPastura: Jurnal Ilmu Tumbuhan Pakan Ternak.g2011 Aug., v. 1, no. 2 p.56-60dHimpunan Ilmuwan Tumbuhan Pakan IndonesiawJournal:27809x2549-84447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.24843/Pastura.2012.v01.i02.p063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009400170300001800264500000900282520190900291592002802200650001402228650001802242650001802260650002302278650001302301650001102314650002502325650001402350650001502364650000902379650001502388650002502403650002002428650001502448700002102463700002202484773014002506856008302646852000902729655001202738IND60668473220221119220317.0191228e200109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066847322DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2001.6551392x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaragunduz, Ahmet10aInfluence of a Nonionic Surfactant on the Water Retention Properties of Unsaturated Soils  ap. 1392-1399.  aepub  aSurfactants are widely used in household products, industrial processes and as adjuvants to improve the delivery and effectiveness of agrochemicals. Due to their amphiphilic nature, surfactants tend to accumulate at gas-liquid and solid-liquid interfaces, and thus, have the potential to influence water flow and retention in unsaturated soils. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of a nonionic surfactant, Triton X-100, on the interfacial properties and capillary pressure-water content relationships of F-70 Ottawa sand and Appling soil. In the presence of surfactant, soil water contents decreased incrementally as the surfactant concentration was increased from 0 g L⁻¹ up to the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of Triton X-100 (0.15 g L⁻¹). Over the same surfactant concentration range, the surface tension of water decreased from 7.2 × 10⁻² J m⁻² to 3.2 × 10⁻² J m⁻² while solid-liquid contact angle decreased from 40° to 10°. No further changes in interfacial properties or soil water characteristics were observed at surfactant concentrations above the CMC. The experimental results were used to develop and evaluate alternative scaling approaches to describe concentration dependent changes in soil water characteristics based on the van Genuchten model. A scaling factor that incorporated both surface tension and content angle relationships provided accurate predictions of soil water retention curves over a range of surfactant concentrations. A simplified form of the scaling factor also was developed, on the basis of a single fitting parameter without the need for surface tension and contact angle data. Although further validation of the simplified scaling factor will be required, this approach offers an efficient means to describe the effects of concentration dependent changes in interfacial properties on soil water characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3aagrochemicals 3acontact angle 3ahousehold products 3amicelles 3amodels 3anonionic surfactants 3aoctoxynol 3aprediction 3asand 3asoil water 3asoil water retention 3asurface tension 3awater flow1 aPennell, Kurt D.1 aYoung, Michael H.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2001 Sept., v. 65, no. 5 p.1392-1399dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2001.6551392x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03519naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005300153245014600206300001400352520195400366592002802320650002902348650002302377650001902400650001602419650002502435650001002460650001302470650002002483650002402503650001702527650001002544650001102554650001502565650002102580650001102601653002102612653002902633653001302662653001902675700002002694700001902714700002302733700001902756700002002775773012102795856008802916852000903004655001203013IND60556774220221120044232.0220802e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055677422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.05.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaas, Alo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4801-037710aSummer depth distribution profiles of dissolved CO2 and O2 in shallow temperate lakes reveal trophic state and lake type specific differences  ap. 63-75.  aKnowledge about dissolved oxygen (DO) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) distribution in lakes has increased considerably over the last decades. However, studies about high resolution dynamics of dissolved CO₂ in different types of lakes over daily or weekly time scales are still very scarce. We measured summertime vertical DO and CO₂ profiles at sub-hourly intervals during one week in eight Estonian lakes representing different lake types according to European Water Framework Directive. The lakes showed considerable differences in thermal stratification and vertical distribution of dissolved oxygen and CO₂ as well as different diurnal dynamics over the measurement period. We observed a continuous CO₂ supersaturation in the upper mixed layer of the alkalitrophic (calcareous groundwater-fed) lake and the dark soft-water lake showing them as CO₂ emitting “chimneys” although with different underlying mechanisms. In three lake types strong undersaturation with CO₂ occurred in the surface layer characterising them as CO₂ sinks for the measurement period while in another three types the surface layer CO₂ was mostly in equilibrium with the atmosphere. Factor analysis showed that DO% in the surface layer and the strength of its relationship with CO₂% were positively related to alkalinity and negatively to trophic state and DOC gradients, whereas deeper lakes were characterised by higher surface concentration but smaller spatial and temporal variability of CO₂. Multiple regression analysis revealed lake area, maximum depth and the light attenuation coefficient as variables affecting the largest number of gas regime indicators. We conclude that the trophic status of lakes in combination with type specific features such as morphometry, alkalinity and colour (DOC) determines the distribution and dynamics of dissolved CO₂ and DO, which therefore may indicate functional differences in carbon cycling among lakes.  aPublisher supplied data 3adissolved carbon dioxide 3atemporal variation 3atrophic levels 3amorphometry 3atemperature profiles 3alakes 3achimneys 3afactor analysis 3aregression analysis 3acarbon cycle 3acolor 3asummer 3aalkalinity 3adissolved oxygen 3aoxygen 0aDissolved oxygen 0aDissolved carbon dioxide 0aProfiles 0aWFD lake types1 aCremona, Fabien1 aMeinson, Pille1 aRõõm, Eva-Ingrid1 aNõges, Tiina,1 aNõges, Peeter,0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 566-567 p.63-75dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.05.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03635naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245009400163520189500257592002802152650001702180650001202197650001902209650002502228650001002253650001602263650001402279650001202293650001602305650002902321650001702350650002002367650000902387650002402396650001402420653002402434653001702458653002002475653003002495653001302525653001702538653002602555700001902581700001902600700005502619700001602674700001702690700005902707700001602766700001302782700005702795773011002852856008602962852000903048655001203057IND60742167320221116190155.0210904e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074216732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.1083452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Yu10aRice rhizodeposition promotes the build-up of organic carbon in soil via fungal necromass  aRice rhizodeposition plays an important role in carbon sequestration in paddy soils. However, the pathways through which rice rhizodeposits contribute to soil organic C (SOC) formation are poorly understood because of specific paddy soil conditions. Furthermore, microbial necromass has been largely ignored in studies examining the contribution of rhizodeposits to C sequestration during plant growth. To evaluate the contribution of microbial necromass to SOC formation via rhizodeposition, rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants were continuously labeled with ¹³CO₂ for 38 days under ambient (aCO₂, 400 μL L⁻¹) or elevated CO₂ (eCO₂, 800 μL L⁻¹) in a paddy field at two levels of N fertilization. The distributions of photosynthetic-¹³C in the shoots and roots, microbial communities, and SOC fractions were quantified. eCO₂ increased plant growth and, consequently, the total ¹³C incorporated into the shoots, roots, and SOC compared to aCO₂, while N fertilization (100 kg N ha⁻¹) decreased root biomass and rhizodeposits in the soil and microbial pools, including living biomass (phospholipid fatty acids, PLFA) and microbial necromass (amino sugars). Rhizodeposits were initially immobilized mainly by bacteria and preferentially recovered in fungal necromass (glucosamine). While ¹³C incorporation into PLFAs was slightly increased during plant growth, ¹³C in microbial necromass increased greatly between the tillering and booting stages. Fungal necromass, which is less decomposable compared to bacterial residues, was the largest contributor to C sequestration with rhizodeposits via the mineral-associated SOC fraction, particularly under elevated CO₂ without N fertilization. This study reveals the significance of the C pathways from rhizodeposits through fungal necromass and organo-mineral associations for the build up of SOC in paddy fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3afungi 3aglucosamine 3anecromass 3apaddies 3apaddy soils 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3aplant growth 3arhizodeposition 3arice 3asoil organic carbon 3atillering 0aMicrobial necromass 0aElevated CO2 0aN fertilization 0aContinuous 13CO2 labeling 0aPLFA-SIP 0aAmino sugars 0aRhizosphere processes1 aXiao, Mouliang1 aYuan, Hongzhao1 aLiang, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9089-65461 aZhu, Zhenke1 aXu, Jianming1 aKuzyakov, Yakov1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9863-84611 aWu, Jinshui1 aGe, Tida1 aTang, Caixian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9138-87700 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2021 Sept., v. 160 p.108345-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.1083453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014600168520185000314592002802164650001602192650001102208650002402219650001402243650001202257650001402269650002002283650002202303650001302325650002202338650002002360650000902380650001602389650001602405650001302421653001502434653001402449700001602463700001902479700001702498700001302515700001702528773010702545856008502652852000902737655001202746IND60676160420221117180821.0191220e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067616042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2019.1134592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaoyan10aInfluence of humic acid on arsenic bioaccumulation and biotransformation to zebrafish: A comparative study between As(III) and As(V) exposure  aPrevious studies have indicated that natural organic matter in the aquatic environment could affect arsenic bioaccumulation and biotransformation to aquatic organisms. However, the differences between the effects of arsenite and arsenate exposure have not been studied and compared in fish exposure models. In this study, adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to 5 mg/L inorganic As solutions, in the presence of a range of humic acid (HA) concentrations (1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 mg/L) in 96 h waterborne exposure. Results showed that in the presence of HA, total As bioaccumulation was significantly reduced in zebrafish following arsenite exposure, while this reduction was not observed during arsenate exposure. The reduction in total arsenic bioaccumulation for arsenite exposure can be explained by the fact that HA forming a surface coating on the cell surface, hindering transport and internalization. However, this reduction in total As was not observed due to differences in uptake pathways for arsenate exposure. Results also showed that Arsenobetaine (AsB) was the main biotransformation product in zebrafish following inorganic As exposure, accounting for 44.8%–64.7% of extracted arsenic species in all exposure groups. The addition of HA caused levels of MMA and As(III) to decrease, while the distribution of AsB significantly increased in arsenite exposure groups. The increase in AsB could be because the As(III)-HA complex was formed, affecting the methylation of As(III). In contrast, the addition of HA to arsenate exposure groups, did not affect the reduction of As(V) to As(III) and therefore, an increase in the distribution of AsB was not observed in arsenate exposure groups. This study provides useful information on the mechanisms of toxicity, for improved risk assessment of As in natural aquatic environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aadults 3aaquatic environment 3aarsenates 3aarsenic 3aarsenites 3abioaccumulation 3abiotransformation 3acoatings 3acomparative study 3aexposure models 3afish 3ahumic acids 3amethylation 3atoxicity 0aHumic acid 0aZebrafish1 aLiu, Liping1 aWang, Xiangrui1 aRen, Jinqian1 aJia, Pei1 aFan, Wenhong0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Jan., v. 256 p.113459-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.1134593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013900166300001600305520126100321592002801582650001301610650001001623650001601633650001101649650003101660650001501691650001101706650001701717650001901734650001301753650001501766650001401781653004601795653002501841653001901866653002001885653001901905700001501924700001501939700001601954700005501970700001902025773012502044856008302169852000902252655001202261IND60687819120221119120413.0200516e20200801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068781912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.03.1262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Wenfang10aBoron and nitrogen co-doped double-layered mesopore-rich hollow carbon microspheres as high-performance electrodes for supercapacitors  ap. 232-240.  aIn this paper, double-layered mesopore-rich hollow carbon microspheres (DHCM) were prepared by a Stöber method using tetraethyl orthosilicate, resorcinol and formaldehyde as precursor materials, and further utilized as carbon sources to prepare the boron and nitrogen co-doped double-layered mesopore-rich hollow carbon microspheres (B, N-DHCM) by hydrothermal approach utilizing ammonium tetraborate tetrahydrate (NH₄B₅O₈·4H₂O) as boron and nitrogen sources. Compared with the undoped DHCM, the as-obtained B, N-DHCM displays improved capacitive properties with a high specific capacitance (221.5 F g⁻¹ at 1 A g⁻¹), good rate performance (104.1 F g⁻¹ at 20 A g⁻¹) and superior cycle life (91% of capacitance retention at 3 A g⁻¹ after 10,000 cycles). The outstanding capacitive performances result from the synergistic effect of the unique double-layered mesopore-rich hollow structure contributing to the rate property and cycle stability and the modification of B and N co-doping providing pseudocapacitance for the enhancement of specific capacitance.

The mean count of total Enterobacteriaceae was 6·5 ± 1·2 log CFU per g and the most frequent genera identified by MALDI‐TOF were Enterobacter (25·9%), Pantoea (9·6%) and Rahnella (9·0%). Overall, results point to poor microbiological quality of a few samples, indicating hygiene failure during their processing. This can pose health risks to consumers, mainly because these products were labelled as sanitized and marketed as ready‐to‐eat. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In this study, the microbiological quality and safety of minimally processed vegetables sold in the city of Piracicaba, SP, Brazil, were evaluated through the detection of Salmonella spp., generic Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae. The results obtained point to poor microbiological quality and safety of a few samples, as generic E. coli was detected in 16 out of 100 samples and Salmonella was isolated from one of them. This indicates hygiene failures during their processing and health risk to consumers, since these products are usually sold as ready‐to‐eat and typically require no further heat treatment before consumption.  aPublisher supplied data  a2013/07914‐8cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a103204/2019‐9cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a434469/2018‐1cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aEnterobacter 3aEscherichia coli 3aPantoea 3aRahnella 3aSalmonella 3aagar 3aheat treatment 3ahygiene 3amicrobiological quality 3amost probable number technique 3aready-to-eat foods 3arisk 3aBrazil1 aCampos, F.B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9828-32021 aPadovani, N.F.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9005-40901 aDias, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2600-45821 aMendes, M.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2078-92861 aMaffei, D.F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0164-88240 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2020 Aug., v. 71, no. 2 p.187-194dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl37648x0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.133053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03376naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245005300162300001800215520216300233592002802396650001502424650002302439650002802462650001502490650001702505650001002522650002002532650001002552650001302562650002602575650001102601650002602612650001902638650001302657650001402670700001902684700001502703700001402718773012702732856007402859852000902933655001202942IND60638372520221119182043.0190429e20160602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063837252DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ay00131a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFortier, Hélène10aAFM force indentation analysis on leukemia cells  ap. 4421-4431.  aA significant body of literature has reported strategies and techniques to assess the mechanical properties of biological samples such as proteins, cellular and tissue systems. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been used to detect elasticity changes of cancer cells. However, only a few studies have provided a detailed and complete protocol of the experimental procedures and data analysis methods for non-adherent blood cancer cells. In this work, the elasticity of NB4 cells derived from acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) was probed by AFM indentation measurements to investigate the effects of the disease on cellular biomechanics. Understanding how leukemia influences the nanomechanical properties of cells is expected to provide a better understanding of the cellular mechanisms associated with cancer, and promises to become a valuable new tool for cancer detection and staging. In this context, the quantification of the mechanical properties of APL cells requires a systematic and optimized approach for data collection and analysis in order to generate reproducible and comparative data. This report elucidates the automated data analysis process that integrates programming, force curve collection and analysis optimization to assess variations of cell elasticity in response to processing criteria. A processing algorithm was developed to automatically analyze large numbers of AFM datasets in an efficient and accurate manner. In fact, since the analysis involves multiple steps that must be repeated for many individual cells, an automated and unbiased processing approach is essential to precisely determine cell elasticity. Different fitting models for extracting the Young’s modulus have been systematically applied to validate the process, and the best fitting criteria, such as the contact point location and indentation length, have been determined in order to obtain consistent results. The designed automated processing code described in this report not only permits us to correlate alterations in cellular biomechanics to cancer cell maturity, but also to assess drug-induced changes in cell elasticity for drug screening purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aanalytical methods 3aatomic force microscopy 3aautomation 3abiomechanics 3ablood 3adata collection 3adrugs 3aleukemia 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3amodulus of elasticity 3aneoplasm cells 3aproteins 3ascreening1 aVariola, Fabio1 aWang, Chen1 aZou, Shan0 tAnalytical methods.g2016 June 2, v. 8, no. 22 p.4421-4431dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ay00131a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02211naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245014600171300001600317520087700333592002801210650001501238650002401253650001401277650001201291650001401303650001201317650001101329650003201340650001001372650001601382651001401398653002901412653001701441653001501458653001701473653001601490700002101506700003401527773012201561856008501683852000901768655001201777IND60655041520221118192045.0190729e20190703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065504152DNAL7 a10.1080/14728028.2019.16183982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVento, Bárbara12aA non-destructive methodology for estimating leaf biomass in Morus alba and Platanus hispanica in the urban area of central-western Argentina  ap. 221-226.  aMost allometric equations to estimate tree biomass have been established in a forest context. However, trees living in an urban environment and trees living in a forest one are confronted with very different constraints that have consequences, among others, on their morphology. It is thus necessary to establish specific allometric equations to estimate the biomass of urban trees. We here explore morphological parameters from two species of trees (Morus alba L. and Platanus hispanica Mill. ex Münchh.), located in an arid urban environment in central-western Argentina, to develop a non-destructive methodology for estimating leaf biomass. Our results show that, for the studied urban trees, crown parameters are better estimators than the diameter at breast height, and allowed us to propose allometric equations using crown height for estimating their leaf biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMorus alba 3aPlatanus acerifolia 3aallometry 3abiomass 3aequations 3aforests 3aleaves 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3aurban areas 3aArgentina 0aAllometric relationships 0aconservation 0aestimation 0aleaf biomass 0aurban trees1 aMoreno, Gabriela1 aMartínez Carretero, Eduardo,0 tForests, trees and livelihoods.g2019 July 3, v. 28, no. 3 p.221-226dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2169x2164-30757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14728028.2019.16183983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03225naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245007900210300001600289520207300305592002802378650001902406650001102425650001502436650001502451650001502466650001202481650001302493650000902506650001402515650001302529651001002542700002402552700002002576700002102596773013102617856008202748852000902830655001202839IND60589329120221118225159.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058932912DNAL7 a10.1007/s11852-017-0569-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvadzi, ProsperI.

Strategies formulated and implemented to curb these impacts can thus be more effective if scientific findings on the response to climate change and SLR impacts on coastal communities are taken into consideration and not based merely on the need for coastal protection due to physical coastal erosion. There is also the need to determine the level of awareness of sea-level rise and responses in coastal communities to improve adaptation planning. This study assesses the impact of future erosion on the coastal land cover of Ghana. This assessment estimates approximately 2.66 km², 2.77 km², and 3.24 km² of coastal settlements, 2.10 km², 2.20 km² and 2.58 km² of lagoons, 1.39 km², 1.46 km² and 1.71 km² of wetlands to be at risk of inundation by the year 2050 based on coastal erosion estimates for the 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) used in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This study also assesses the level of awareness of respondents to SLR on the coast of Ghana and explores the availability and level of integration of scientific knowledge of SLR into coastal adaptation strategies in Ghana. Assessment of the awareness of SLR responses to the changing climate in Ghana is made through semi-structured interviews at national, municipal/district and coastal community scales. Although settlements may be inundated based on the coastal erosion estimates, coastal dwellers interviewed cherish their proximity to the sea and are determined to maintain their occupancy close to the sea as spatial location influences their source of livelihood (fishing). Respondents lack knowledge/understanding of SLR, as the majority of household interviewees attributed the rise or fall in sea level to God. Respondents from Ngiresia alleged that the ongoing coastal sea defence project in their community has led to increased malaria cases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3ainterviews 3aland cover 3alivelihood 3amalaria 3aplanning 3arisk 3asea level 3awetlands 3aGhana1 aScheffran, Jürgen,1 aZorita, Eduardo1 aHünicke, Birgit0 tJournal of coastal conservation.g2018 Feb., v. 22, no. 1 p.183-197dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000609x1400-03507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11852-017-0569-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245014200168520117400310592002801484650002901512650002801541650002301569650001701592650002001609650001001629650003401639650003701673650001601710650001101726650001601737650001401753650001401767650001401781650002401795650002101819650001101840650002901851650001001880650001101890653000901901653002001910653001801930653001901948653002801967700006401995700002202059773010102081856008102182852000902263655001202272IND60684989520221121035730.0200427e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068498952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fm.2020.1034632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTondini, Federico10aEarly adaptation strategies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Torulaspora delbrueckii to co-inoculation in high sugar grape must-like media  aTorulaspora delbrueckii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are yeast species found concurrently in wine. In order to commence fermentation, they adapt to the initial harsh environment, maintaining cellular homeostasis and promoting metabolism. These actions involve an intricate regulation of stress tolerance, growth and metabolic genes. Their phenotypes are influenced by the fermentation environment and physiological state of the cell, but such gene-environment interactions are poorly understood. This study aimed to compare the cell physiology of the two species, through genome-wide analysis of gene expression, coupling Oxford Nanopore MinION and Illumina Hiseq sequencing platforms. The early transcriptional responses to stress, nutrients and cell-to-cell communication were analysed. Particular attention was given to the fundamental gene modulations, leading to an understanding of the physiological changes needed to maintain cellular homeostasis, exit the quiescent state and establish dominance in the fermentation. Our findings suggest the existence of species-specific adaptation strategies in response to growth in a high sugar synthetic grape juice medium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aTorulaspora delbrueckii 3acell communication 3afermentation 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agrape juice 3agrapes 3ahomeostasis 3ananopores 3anutrients 3aphenotype 3aphysiological state 3astress tolerance 3asugars 3atranscription (genetics) 3awines 3ayeasts 0aWine 0aStress response 0aTranscriptome 0aCo-inoculation 0aTorulaspora delbrueckii1 aOnetto, Cristobal A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0875-30931 aJiranek, Vladimir0 tFood microbiology.g2020 Sept., v. 90 p.103463-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2020.1034633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01731naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245010300161300002000264520064100284592002800925650001600953650001500969650002300984650001301007650001201020650001301032650002201045700001701067700001901084700001801103700001801121700001901139773012101158856008101279852000901360655001201369IND60558001820221119062144.0161105e20161104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055800182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.6b009912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ya-Ni10aFormal [3 + 2] Cycloadditions via Indole Activation: A Route to Pyrroloindolines and Furoindolines  ap. 10491-10498.  aHere, we describe a novel [3 + 2] cycloaddition of 3-substituted indoles with vinyl aziridines and vinyl epoxides that provides a straightforward approach to pyrroloindolines and furoindolines bearing vinyl groups (up to 96% yield and 9:1 dr).

K.10aPlant regeneration from leaf explants of mature sandalwood (Santalum album L.) trees under in vitro conditions  ap. 216-222.  aSandalwood (Santalum album L.) is a small evergreen, hemi-parasitic tree having more than 18 woody species that are mostly distributed in South Asia, Australia, and Hawaii. Its economical importance is derived from its heartwood oil, but its difficult propagation makes conservation essential. The percentage of seed germination is poor and germination time exceeds 12 mo. Vegetative propagation can be accomplished by grafting, air layering, or with root suckers, but the production of clones is inefficient and time consuming. In this study, efficient plant regeneration was achieved via indirect organogenesis from callus cultures derived from leaf tissues of S. album. Callus induction was induced when leaf explants were cultured on woody plant media (WPM) supplemented with either thidiazuron (TDZ) or 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. The highest callus frequency (100%) was obtained when leaf tissue was cultured in the medium with 0.4 mg l⁻¹ TDZ. Fresh weight (141.92 mg) and dry weight (47 mg) of leaf-derived callus were highest in the medium supplemented with 0.8 mg l⁻¹ TDZ. The WPM medium supplemented with 2.5 mg l⁻¹ BA + 0.4 mg l⁻¹ NAA was the most effective, producing the highest number of shoot buds (24.6) per callus. The highest number of shoots per explant (20.67) and shoot length (5.17 cm) were observed in media supplemented with 5.0 mg l⁻¹ BA and 3.0 mg 1⁻¹ Kn, respectively. Plantlets were rooted on WPM medium with different concentrations of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). The highest rooting percentage (91.67) and survival were achieved using WPM media with 1.5 mg l⁻¹ IBA. All plantlets survived acclimatization, producing healthy plants in the greenhouse.

Herein, we explored the localization of cSP-A and cLL in the chicken respiratory system. Six tissues from 30-days-old SPF chickens were used to quantify the expression of cSP-A and cLL using the quantitative real-time reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and fluorescence multiplex immunohistochemistry staining (fluorescence mIHC staining). Results showed that cSP-A and cLL mRNA were highly expressed in lungs compared to other tissues. cSP-A mRNA expression levels in all tissues were higher compared with cLL expression levels as analyzed using qRT-PCR. Fluorescence mIHC co-expression of cSP-A and cLL were mainly detected in lung parabronchial epithelia, and mucosal epithelia of larynx, trachea, syrinx, bronchus and air sac, with cSP-A showing a stronger positive staining compared with cLL. cLL is expressed on both mucosal surfaces, some individual lung epithelial cells and cartilage cells, while cSP-A is mainly restricted to mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract. These histological findings may be useful for understanding the biological significance of this pulmonary lectins in future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abronchi 3achickens 3achondrocytes 3aepithelial cells 3afluorescence 3agene expression 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alarynx 3amessenger RNA 3amucosa 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astaining 3asurfactant proteins 3atranscription (genetics) 0aChicken surfactant protein A 0aChicken lung lectin 0aExpression 0aCo-localization 0aRespiratory system1 aHuang, Xueting1 aXiong, Haifeng1 aLiu, Miaomiao1 aHu, Dongmei1 aWei, Changqing1 aWang, Guijun1 aQi, Kezong0 tMolecular immunology.g2020 June, v. 122 p.49-53dElsevier LtdwJournal:12510x0161-58907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2020.03.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245013300204300001600337520163400353592002801987650002502015650001702040650001902057650001202076650002202088650001502110650002202125650001102147650001202158650001002170651001202180773013102192856008202323852000902405655001202414IND60589329320221118224939.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058932932DNAL7 a10.1007/s11852-016-0467-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSüsser, Diana1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9757-349110aCoastal dwellers-power against climate change: a place-based perspective on individual and collective engagement in North Frisia  ap. 169-182.  aClimate change induces non-linear and unevenly distributed changes, such rising sea levels and extreme weather events that materialise on the regional level and considerably contribute to changes in the social fabric of regions, communities and places. Because of the need for societal responses, an in-depth understanding of individual and collective forms of engagement with climate change is of growing relevance. To contribute to close this gap, this paper applies a place-based approach for investigating how people’s place attachments and meanings inform individual and collective engagement with climate change. As a case study, the district of North Frisia (Germany) was chosen, a region between climate-change vulnerability and renewable-energy potential. Qualitative interviews and a household survey with coastal dwellers of the municipality of Reußenköge have been conducted, a group discussion with the Country Youth (Landjugend) and further interviews with experts from government, companies and associations spread over North Frisia and in Kiel. The results reveal two main findings: firstly, place-dependent attachments and meanings play a pivotal role for understanding people’s engagement with climate change, and secondly, the behavioural dimension of engagement involves diverse adaptation and mitigation measures adopted on individual and collective level. In sum, the findings conceptually and empirically reveal the importance of memories, experiences, knowledge and creativity for how people engage with climate change, but also exhibit the importance of policies mobilising community-based actions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aexperts 3ahousehold surveys 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3amemory 3aweather 3ayouth 3aGermany0 tJournal of coastal conservation.g2018 Feb., v. 22, no. 1 p.169-182dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000609x1400-03507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11852-016-0467-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013500166300001600301500001500317520114200332592002801474650001301502650001501515650001101530650001601541650003001557650001401587650001501601650003501616650002001651650001101671650001001682650001301692650001001705650001501715650002401730653005801754653002101812653002901833653005101862653005101913700001801964700001701982700001801999700001702017773009602034856008202130852000902212655001202221IND60091686020221120203802.0161021e20131115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009168602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2013.05.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChin, Yu-Ting10aLabel-free detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with myeloid differentiation-2 using a nanostructured biosensor  ap. 506-511.  a2019-12-06  aHouse dust mites are the major source of indoor allergens that are responsible for asthma. The major dust mite allergen is the group II allergen, Der p2. Myeloid differentiation-2 (MD-2) acts as an essential component in the CD14-TLR4 (toll-like receptor)/MD-2 receptor complex for Der p2 recognition. Mutations of the MD-2 associated gene on chromosome 8 degrade a human's innate responses. In this study, we report the effective detection of mutations to the MD-2 gene promoter, using a sensitive nanostructured biosensor with a sensing electrode of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) uniformly deposited in a nanohemisphere array. The 70 mer MD-2 expressed gene fragment was used to probe gene mutation. The complementary target, containing 156 mer nucleotide, was prepared using the fresh blood from patients with allergic disease. A total of 37 target samples, including 19 gene mutated samples and 18 normal samples, were prepared by a 20 cycles PCR process, and used for discrimination experiments. Experimental results illustrated that the nanostructured biosensor clearly discriminates between mutated and non-mutated MD-2 allergy genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3ananogold 3adust mites 3ahumans 3achromosomes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aallergens 3aelectrodes 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3agene expression 3aasthma 3agenes 3apatients 3ablood 3abiosensors 3aToll-like receptors 0aElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis 0ahypersensitivity 0aNanostructured biosensor 0aSingle nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection 0aMyeloid differentiation-2 (MD-2) gene promoter1 aLiao, En-Chih1 aWu, Chia-Che1 aWang, Gou-Jen1 aTsai, Jaw-Ji0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2013 Nov. 15, v. 49 p.506-511dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2013.05.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03396naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245021700161300001600378520156000394592002801954650005601982650002202038650002402060650002102084650001002105650003802115650002802153650002002181650003102201650001002232650002002242650001802262650001602280650001402296650001202310650002202322650002202344650004302366650004202409650003602451651001002487700001802497700001802515700001902533700001902552700001802571700001802589700001702607700002002624773009602644856008102740852000902821655001202830IND60121356920221122052014.0150301e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012135692DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-014-2309-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Yan14aThe gene expression profile of porcine alveolar macrophages infected with a highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus indicates overstimulation of the innate immune system by the virus  ap. 649-662.  aSince the highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) variant emerged in 2006, it has caused death in more than 20 million pigs in China and other Southeast Asian countries, making it the most destructive swine pathogen currently in existence. To characterize the cellular responses to HP-PRRSV infection, the gene expression profile of porcine alveolar macrophage (PAM) cells, the primary target cells of PRRSV, was analyzed in HP-PRRSV-infected and uninfected PAMs by suppression subtractive hybridization. After confirmation by Southern blot, genes that were differentially expressed in the HP-PRRSV-infected and uninfected PAMs were sequenced and annotated. Genes that were upregulated mainly in HP-PRRSV-infected PAM cells were related to immunity and cell signaling. Among the differentially expressed genes, Mx1 and HSP70 protein expression was confirmed by western blotting, and IL-8 expression was confirmed by ELISA. In PAM cells isolated from HP-PRRSV-infected piglets, the differential expression of 21 genes, including IL-16, TGF-beta type 1 receptor, epidermal growth factor, MHC-I SLA, Toll-like receptor, hepatoma-derived growth factor, FTH1, and MHC-II SLA-DRB1, was confirmed by real-time PCR. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate differential gene expression between HP-PRRSV-infected and uninfected PAMs in vivo. The results indicate that HP-PRRSV infection excessively stimulates genes involved in the innate immune response, including proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aSouthern blotting 3aToll-like receptors 3aWestern blotting 3adeath 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepidermal growth factor 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ainnate immunity 3ainterleukin-8 3amacrophages 3apathogens 3apiglets 3aprotein synthesis 3apulmonary alveoli 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asuppression subtractive hybridization 3atransforming growth factor beta 3aChina1 aAn, Tong-Qing1 aTian, Zhi-Jun1 aWei, Tian-Chao1 aJiang, Yi-Feng1 aPeng, Jin-Mei1 aZhou, Yan-Jun1 aCai, Xue-Hui1 aTong, Guang-Zhi0 tArchives of virology.g2015 Mar., v. 160, no. 3 p.649-662dSpringer-Verlagx0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-014-2309-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012900173520133700302592002801639650001101667650001801678650002101696650001701717653000901734653001801743653002301761653002201784700001801806700002401824700001601848700002101864773009001885856008501975852000902060655001202069IND60680015720221121060059.0200217e20200301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068001572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.1168532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerma, Sujit Kumar10a“Performance comparison of innovative spiral shaped solar collector design with conventional flat plate solar collector”  aFlat plate solar collector is an essential device, which facilitate direct application of solar energy for water heating in household and industrial sector. Existing Flat plate solar collectors (FPSC) suffers from stagnant and comparatively low efficiency. Further research to improve efficiency of FPSC by inculcating innovative design is necessary. To fill the gap, the presented work is an experimental investigation of an innovative design and fabrication approach which deals with analysis of flat plate solar collector efficiency. Design modifications of solar collector always offer an important alternative to achieve significant effect on thermal efficiency. In this work single spiral shaped collector tube as compare to number of riser tubes connected with headers in conventional type flat plate solar collector has been developed. Keeping all other parameters similar to conventional design, it has been observed very encouraging outcomes in efficiencies of solar collector. Under forced mode of testing, enhancement in thermal efficiency achieved is, 21.94% compared to conventional flat plate collector design. Enhancement in exergy efficiency is 6.73%. Overall material saving is about ∼30% and cost of manufacturing and maintenance can be significantly reduced at equivalent performance of conventional collector.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexergy 3amanufacturing 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 0aFPSC 0aSpiral design 0aThermal efficiency 0aExergy efficiency1 aSharma, Kamal1 aGupta, Naveen Kumar1 aSoni, Pawan1 aUpadhyay, Neeraj0 tEnergy.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 194 p.116853-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.1168533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03808naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012500164300001800289520167300307592002801980650002102008650002502029650002602054650002902080650002102109650002602130650001302156650001702169650001102186650001502197650002102212650001502233650000902248650001202257650001702269650002602286650002202312650001902334650004402353650001202397650001602409650001402425653001602439653002702455653001602482653000802498653000802506653000802514653000702522653001102529653001002540653000802550653000802558653000802566653000902574653000802583653000802591653000902599700002602608700002202634700002302656700001602679700001602695700002402711700003002735700002502765700002202790773012302812856008202935852000903017655001203026IND60707374820221120210020.0201104e20200904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070737482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2020.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yifan14aThe Pneumococcal Iron Uptake Protein A (PiuA) Specifically Recognizes Tetradentate FeIIIbis- and Mono-Catechol Complexes  ap. 5390-5410.  aStreptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) is an important Gram-positive human pathogen that causes millions of infections worldwide with an increasing occurrence of antibiotic resistance. Fe acquisition is a crucial virulence determinant in Spn; further, Spn relies on exogenous Feᴵᴵᴵ-siderophore scavenging to meet nutritional Fe needs. Recent studies suggest that the human catecholamine stress hormone, norepinephrine (NE), facilitates Fe acquisition in Spn under conditions of transferrin-mediated Fe starvation. Here we show that the solute binding lipoprotein PiuA from the piu Fe acquisition ABC transporter PiuBCDA, previously described as an Fe-hemin binding protein, binds tetradentate catechol Feᴵᴵᴵ complexes, including NE and the hydrolysis products of enterobactin. Two protein-derived ligands (H238, Y300) create a coordinately saturated Feᴵᴵᴵ complex, which parallel recent studies in the Gram-negative intestinal pathogen Campylobacter jejuni. Our in vitro studies using NMR spectroscopy and ⁵⁴Fe LC-ICP-MS confirm the Feᴵᴵᴵ can move from transferrin to apo-PiuA in an NE-dependent manner. Structural analysis of PiuA Feᴵᴵᴵ-bis-catechol and Gaᴵᴵᴵ-bis-catechol and Gaᴵᴵᴵ-(NE)₂ complexes by NMR spectroscopy reveals only localized structural perturbations in PiuA upon ligand binding, largely consistent with recent descriptions of other solute binding proteins of type II ABC transporters. We speculate that tetradentate Feᴵᴵᴵ complexes formed by mono- and bis-catechol species are important Fe sources in Gram-positive human pathogens, since PiuA functions in the same way as SstD from Staphylococcus aureus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aABC transporters 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3aanimal pathogens 3aantibiotic resistance 3acatechol 3aenterobactin 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3ain vitro studies 3aintestines 3airon 3aligands 3alipoproteins 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3anorepinephrine 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asolutes 3atransferrin 3avirulence 0airon uptake 0asolute binding protein 0asiderophore 0aSpn 0aSBP 0aABC 0aNE 0aESI-MS 0a6-FNE 0aPRE 0aCSP 0aHDX 0aSAXS 0ahTf 0aEnt 0aCPMG1 aEdmonds, Katherine A.1 aRaines, Daniel J.1 aMurphy, Brennan A.1 aWu, Hongwei1 aGuo, Chuchu1 aNolan, Elizabeth M.1 aVanNieuwenhze, Michael S.1 aDuhme-Klair, Anne-K.1 aGiedroc, David P.0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2020 Sept. 04, v. 432, no. 19 p.5390-5410dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2020.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03592naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001100151245017700162506011700339506007600456520190500532592002802437506003702465650001902502650001302521650001502534650001402549650001602563650001202579650001202591650001502603650002602618650001302644650001502657650001102672650001502683650002802698650001402726651001002740653003902750653002002789653001502809653003402824700001702858700001502875773010102890856008602991852000903077655001203086IND60752277420221207113711.0220921e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075227742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1082402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Li10aEvolution characteristics and simulation prediction of forest and grass landscape fragmentation based on the “Grain for Green” projects on the Loess Plateau, P.R.

Grassland and forest land are the largest landscape types, which have contributed the most to ecosystem services on the Loess Plateau. However, there is no precedent for the combined study of the landscape fragmentation of forest and grassland ecosystems. In particular, there is still a lack of clear spatial significance and a quantitative description of fragmentation at the regional scale. Based on the implementation background for the “Grain for Green” Project, we selected the Loess Plateau as the research area and used the coupled future land use simulation (FLUS) model and landscape fragmentation model to explore the temporal and spatial changes in forest and grass landscape fragmentation. The results showed that (1) Woodland, grassland, and cropland are the main landscape types, and the area of cropland initially increased and then decreased, while the area of woodland and grassland exhibited the opposite trend. In particular, the period from 2000 to 2015 was forest and grass restoration stage. (2) The kappa coefficient was 0.85, and the figure of merit coefficient (FOM) was 0.11 for a 1% random sampling when using FLUS model to predict the land use, and the simulation results are also consistent with the objective change in the current social and economic development. (3) The fragmentation of woodland and grassland were dominated by edge type and core type, and the core type had an absolute advantage. It is predicted that the landscape fragmentation will gradually slowdown in 2030 under different intensities of the “Grain for Green” project. The dynamics of landscape fragmentation are conducive to the reasonable planning and objective evaluation of woodland and grassland spatial allocation and quality improvement.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate change 3acropland 3aecosystems 3aevolution 3aforest land 3aforests 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aprediction 3asustainable development 3awoodlands 3aChina 0aLandscape fragmentation simulation 0aLand use change 0aFLUS model 0a“Grain for Green” Project1 aGong, Zhiwen1 aDu, Yuxiao0 tEcological indicators.g2021 Nov., v. 131 p.108240-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1082403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024001900113024003600132040001800168100002000186245010100206300001600307500001500323520180200338592002802140650001702168650002202185650002402207650002002231650002202251650001802273650003102291650001202322650002402334650002802358650003502386653002002421773013202441852000902573856008202582856011202664961001502776655001202791IND4435826320221122052521.0181030e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443582632DNAL7 a10113/410032hdl7 a153057342pmid7 a10.1177/1040638704016004012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiegers, Ann L.14aThe Quality Assurance of Proficiency Testing Programs for Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratories  ap. 255-263.  a2019-12-05  aLaboratory data credibility has 3 major components: 1) valid methods, 2) proficiency testing (PT) to verify that the analyst can conduct the method and to compare results of other laboratories using the same method, and 3) third-party accreditation to verify that the laboratory is competent to conduct testing and that the method validation has been done within the environment and requirements of an effective quality-management system. Participation in external PT programs by a laboratory is strongly recommended in International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission International Standard 17025. Most laboratory accreditation bodies using this standard require that laboratories participate in such programs to be accredited. Internal PT is also recommended for each analyst. Benchmarking, or comparison between laboratories using PT or reference materials, is also recommended as part of the validation and evaluation of test methods. These requirements emphasize the need for proficiency test providers to demonstrate their competence. Requirements for competence are documented in national and international standards and guidelines, and accreditation is available for providers. This article discusses the activities and the components that are necessary and recommended for PT projects and programs for animal disease diagnostic testing. These are based on the requirements of the national and international standards, which address this subject, and on the experience of the author. The accreditation of external PT programs is also discussed. Organizations that accredit PT providers or that provide PT programs are listed. Existing references, guidelines, and standards that are relevant to PT in veterinary diagnostic laboratories are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3alaboratories 3awildlife diseases 3aveterinary medicine 3aquality control 3adisease diagnosis 2aAccreditation 2aAnimal Diseasesxdiagnosis 2aAnimals 2aGuidelines as Topic 2aLaboratoriesxstandards 2aQuality Assurance, Health Care 0aanimal diseases0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 16, no. 4 p.255-263dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638704016004013Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/410033Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle03290naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245021200166300001600378520130900394592002801703650002301731650003701754650001201791650001701803650001501820650001301835650001401848650002301862650001501885650001601900650004401916650001701960650003301977650001102010650002002021650001502041650003702056650003702093653004402130653003502174653002702209653004502236653001302281700001502294700001802309700001502327700001602342700001702358700001602375700001502391700001602406700001702422700001702439700001402456773010202470856008302572852000902655655001202664IND60609291120221116151638.0180905e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060929112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2017.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiao, Jinqing10aAl-modified dendritic mesoporous silica nanospheres-supported NiMo catalysts for the hydrodesulfurization of dibenzothiophene: Efficient accessibility of active sites and suitable metal–support interaction  ap. 269-282.  aDendritic mesoporous silica nanospheres (DMSNs) with center–radial pore structure were successfully fabricated via an anion-assisted method. Al-modified DMSNs-supported NiMo catalysts were prepared and used for hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of dibenzothiophene (DBT). The DMSNs supports and corresponding supported NiMo catalysts were characterized by SEM, TEM, N2 adsorption/desorption, electron tomography (ET), ²⁷Al NMR, NH3-TPD, UV–Vis spectroscopy, XPS, H2-TPR, Raman spectroscopy, and Pyridine-FTIR spectra. The average pore diameter of DMSNs is around 26.4 nm, which is helpful for eliminating the diffusion resistance of S-containing compounds. The center–radial pore structure of DMSNs, confirmed by ET measurement, is beneficial for enhancing the accessibility of active sites in the pore channels. The incorporation of aluminum into the framework of DMSNs can improve the acidity and modulate the metal–support interaction. Consequently, NiMo/Al-DMSNs catalysts exhibited higher HDS conversions (97.9%) for DBT than commercial NiMo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The superior catalytic activity of NiMo/Al-DMSNs results from a perfect combination of large center–radial pore channels, increased acidity, suitable metal–support interaction, and good dispersion/accessibility of active metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aacidity 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adesorption 3ananospheres 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aporous media 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3astable isotopes 3atomography 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aDendritic mesoporous silica nanospheres 0aCenter–radial pore structure 0aAluminum incorporation 0aHydrodesulfurization of dibenzothiophene 0aCatalyst1 aFu, Jianye1 aWei, Yuechang1 aZhao, Zhen1 aDuan, Aijun1 aXu, Chunming1 aLi, Jianmei1 aSong Hào,1 aZheng, Peng1 aWang, Xilong1 aYang, Yannan1 aLiu, Yang0 tJournal of catalysis.g2017 Dec., v. 356 p.269-282dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2017.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02020naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013900169300001800308520063200326536018700958592002801145596001601173650001401189650001001203650001801213650001301231650000901244653002001253653002201273653001101295653004101306653002801347653002101375700001801396773012501414856008601539852000901625655001201634IND60772560220221121001504.0220404e20220418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077256022DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2020.18446942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStec, Józef,10aFacile synthesis of the fungus-derived natural products: N,N′-dipalmitoleyl urea (C₁₆:₁) and N,N′-dioleyl urea (C₁₈:₁)  ap. 2158-2165.  aOxalyl chloride is one of the most versatile reagents used in organic synthesis.

Along with enhancing the overall properties of the system, filler particles also induce some inelastic effects including the Mullins and the Payne effect. In this paper, computational modeling using finite element methods has been employed to study the mechanical behavior of such systems. A nonlinear model is applied, to predict the macroscopic large deformation behavior, with morphology evolution and deformation occurring at the microscopic level, using the representative volume element (RVE) approach. The approach is based on a micro mechanically motivated hyper-elastic constitutive model, describing the elastomeric matrix within the RVE. In order to simulate the breakdown and reaggregation of filler networks, effects like the change in the glass transition temperature in the vicinity of filler particles, are incorporated in the system. The implementation is designed to be robust, for accommodating large rotations and stretches of the matrix local to, and between, the nanoparticles. The nanocomposite microstructure is reconstructed at the RVE level using a random particle generation algorithm, with the assumption of periodicity. Computational experiments using this methodology enable prediction of the strain softening behavior of filled elastomers, observed experimentally, and to understand the behavior of the interphase between two filler particles and its effect on the characteristic material behavior of filled elastomers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adeformation 3afinite element analysis 3aglass transition temperature 3ainterphase 3amechanical properties 3amicrostructure 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3anonlinear models 3aperiodicity 3aprediction1 aReese, Stefanie0 tMacromolecules.g2014 May 13, v. 47, no. 9 p.3161-3169dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma402404x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01377naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245009100130300001400221500001900235520051400254592002800768650002700796650002200823650001400845650001000859653002300869653002500892653002800917653001500945773010600960852000901066655001201075IND60709876720221121051145.0200908e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070987672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSutare, M.

Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has proven for over two decades to be a powerful ally in the elucidation of RNA modification identity and location, but the technique has not proceeded without its own unique technical challenges. The throughput of LC-MS/MS modification mapping experiments continues to be impeded by tedious and time-consuming spectral interpretation, particularly during for the analysis of complex RNA samples. RNAModMapper was recently developed as a tool to improve the interpretation and annotation of LC-MS/MS data sets from samples containing post-transcriptionally modified RNAs. Here, we delve deeper into the methodology and practice of RNAModMapper to provide greater insight into its utility, and remaining hurdles, in current RNA modification mapping experiments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3agene expression regulation 3aliquid chromatography 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aTransfer RNA 0aModified nucleosides 0aBioinformatics 0aSequence analysis 0aModification placement1 aYu, Ningxi1 aJora, Manasses1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8825-08371 aAbernathy, Scott1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1526-45461 aLimbach, Patrick A.0 tMethods.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 156 p.128-138dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12000x1046-20237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2018.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008500166300001800251520148500269592002801754650004401782650003101826650002101857650001901878650001801897650001301915650001201928650001301940650002001953650001201973650002101985650001402006650001702020653000902037653001102046653001602057653000902073653000902082653000802091653000902099653000802108653000802116700001902124700001902143700001602162700002002178773012302198856008202321852000902403655001202412IND60707374920221120210044.0201104e20200904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070737492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2020.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatayama, Kota10aDisruption of Hydrogen-Bond Network in Rhodopsin Mutations Cause Night Blindness  ap. 5378-5389.  aRhodopsin is the photosensitive protein, which binds to 11-cis-retinal as its chromophore. In the dark, rhodopsin exists as a stable complex between the opsin moiety and 11-cis-retinal. The absorption of a light photon converts 11-cis-retinal to all-trans-retinal and initiates our vision. As a result, the increase in the rate of dark activation of rhodopsin reduces its photosensitivity resulting in night blindness. The mutations, G90D and T94I are night blindness-causing mutations that exhibit completely different physicochemical characteristics associated with the dark activation of rhodopsin, such as a high rate of thermal isomerization of 11-cis-retinal and a slow pigment regeneration. To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which G90D and T94I mutations affect rhodopsin dark activation and regeneration, we performed light-induced difference FTIR spectroscopy on dark and primary photo-intermediate states of G90D and T94I mutants. The FTIR spectra clearly show that both charged G90D and hydrophobic T94I mutants alter the H-bond network at the Schiff base region of the chromophore, which weakens the electrostatic interaction with Glu113 counterion. Our results further show an altered water-mediated H-bond network around the central transmembrane region of mutant rhodopsin, which is reminiscent of the active Meta-II state. This altered water-mediated H-bond network may cause thermal isomerization of the chromophore and facilitate rhodopsin dark activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3aisomerization 3amoieties 3amutants 3amutation 3anight blindness 3aphotons 3aphotosensitivity 3arhodopsin 3aschiff bases 0aFTIR 0aH-bond 0achromophore 0aGPCR 0aCSNB 0aPSB 0aHOOP 0aDDM 0aROS1 aTakeyama, Yuri1 aEnomoto, Akiko1 aImai, Hiroo1 aKandori, Hideki0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2020 Sept. 04, v. 432, no. 19 p.5378-5389dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2020.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010000169300001600269520102700285592002801312650001901340650001301359650001201372650001401384650004101398650001701439650000901456650002401465651002101489653002401510653002101534653002001555653001301575653001201588653001001600700002201610700002101632700001901653773011801672856008401790852000901874655001201883IND60517534420221117233156.0160331e20160217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051753442DNAL7 a10.1080/0972060X.2014.9775812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYarazavi, Mina10aComparison between the Concretes Obtained from Fresh and Distilled Rosa damascena Mill.

In the factories, petals of rose are harvested and distilled to produce rose oil and rose water. Distilled petals are wasted and don’t have any usage. Therefore, the purpose of the present work was to use fresh and, for the first time, distilled petals to produce concrete by Soxhlet method. Then the components of obtained concretes were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and compared with the concrete of Turkey. Results indicated that, concretes of fresh and distilled petals of Lalehzar of Kerman have 0.5 % and 0.25 % content, respectively. In attention to the content of 2-phenylethanol (36.28 %, 15.48 %), and long-chain hydrocarbons such as nonadecane (9.20 %, 11.18 %), nonadecene (1.84 %, 2.15 %), eicosane (1.37 %, 1.86 %) and heneicosane (7.70 %, 8.81 %) in the concretes of fresh and distilled petals respectively, concrete of distilled rose flowers is as a new product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRosa damascena 3aconcrete 3acorolla 3afactories 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahydrocarbons 3aoils 3aphenylethyl alcohol 3aTurkey (country) 0aRosa damascena Mill 0adistilled petals 0a2-phenylethanol 0aconcrete 0aSoxhlet 0aGC-MS1 aShamspur, Tayebeh1 aAfzali, Daryoush1 aMostafavi, Ali0 tJournal of essential oil-bearing plants.g2016 Feb. 17, v. 19, no. 2 p.479-484dTaylor & Francisx0976-50267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0972060X.2014.9775813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245014300156300001800299520128600317592002801603650002301631650002101654650001801675650002401693700001901717700001701736700002501753700001501778700001701793773010301810856007501913852000901988655001201997IND60578059420180731000000.0170811e20140513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057805942DNAL7 a10.1021/ma402416g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalevi, Amit10aCo-Assembly of A–B Diblock Copolymers with B′-type Nanoparticles in Thin Films: Effect of Copolymer Composition and Nanoparticle Shape  ap. 3022-3032.  aThe coassembly of A–B diblock copolymers with B′-type nanoparticles (i.e., nanoparticles that are slightly incompatible with the B domain) leads to hierarchical structures, where the block copolymer phase separates first and the nanoparticles create close-packed arrays within the B domains due to a slower, secondary phase separation process. Here we report the results of a comprehensive study, which focused on two aspects: the influence of the nanoparticle shape (spherical vs rod-like) and the effect of the volume composition of the blocks. Three polystyrene-block-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) copolymers featuring similar molecular weights but differing in PS volume fraction were mixed with spherical and rod-shaped poly(ethylene oxide)- (PEO-) capped CdS nanoparticles at different filling fractions and cast as thin films. Our results highlight the mutual influence between the block copolymer and the nanoparticles on the resulting morphology, demonstrating the ability to control the film morphology by the filling fraction of the nanoparticles and their tendency to localize at the film surface, and by confinement-induced nanoparticle aggregation. Most importantly, the results reveal the influence of the nanoparticle shape on the structure of the film.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3amolecular weight 3ananoparticles 3apolyethylene glycol1 aHalivni, Shira1 aOded, Meirav1 aMüller, Axel H.

For monitoring the total fungal spore burden in the air, Burkard 7-day volumetric sampler was used, whereas Andersen two-sage viable sampler was used for isolating the cultivable airborne fungi. Among the 37 fungal spore types identified in the air samples, the predominant ones were Cladosporium, unidentified ascospores, unidentified basidiospores, Aspergilli/Penicilli, Nigrospora, Periconia, Chaetomium, Drechslera, Alternaria, Coprinus, Ganoderma, Pithomyces, and rust spores. Only six fungal spore types (Alternaria, Aspergilli/Penicilli, Cladosporium, Curvularia, Drechslera, and Nigrospora) were recovered in common by the two samplers. For Aspergilli/Penicilli, Drechslera, and Nigrospora, the spore concentration was underestimated in the non-viable sampling method (Burkard sampler). In general, higher spore count was recorded in winter. The highest fungal species variability was observed in early monsoon (June). Relative humidity could significantly predict the seasonal periodicity of the maximum number of airborne spores. The total airborne fungi concentration recorded in the study (15–16 × 103 spores m−3 of air) was lower than the proposed threshold limit value for clinical significance, suggesting apparently no or less airborne-fungi-exposure-related health risk in the sampling area. Cladosporium cladosporioides was recorded beyond the proposed threshold limit value in January 2003 and March 2004; Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus nidulans in winter that might have posed considerable health risk to sensitized individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus nidulans 3aPithomyces 3aat-risk population 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aGanoderma 3aChaetomium 3aNigrospora 3arisk 3ainterspecific variation 3amonsoon season 3aair 3aCurvularia 3awinter 3arelative humidity 3aCladosporium cladosporioides 3aAlternaria 3aascospores 3aDrechslera 3aPericonia 3abasidiospores 3aCoprinus 3asamplers 3aairborne microorganisms 2aAir Microbiology 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aFungixclassificationxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aSpores, Fungalxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 3aIndia 0aIndia 0aspecies differences 0arisk groups 0aAspergillus nidulellus1 aGupta-Bhattacharya, Swati0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2012 Aug., v. 184, no. 8 p.4671-4684dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-011-2294-1  aDNAL 7aarticle01403naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245014500160300001800305520031700323592002800640650001600668650001300684650001200697650002300709650002100732650001400753650001800767700002300785700002000808700002600828773012900854856007300983852000901056655001201065IND60657553820221117002012.0190816e20040901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065755382DNAL7 a10.1039/b407386j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGorodetsky, Brian10aElectrochemical reduction of an imidazolium cation: a convenient preparation of imidazol-2-ylidenes and their observation in an ionic liquid  ap. 1972-1973.  a1,3-Bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)imidazolium chloride is reduced electrochemically and chemically to produce a nucleophilic carbene, namely 1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene.

Results showed that K accumulation and leaf K content in ND202 were higher than those in NC89. The distribution rate and K accumulation in the leaves of ND202 increased significantly, while the distribution rate in the roots and stems had lower values. In addition, the maximum K accumulation rate and high-speed K accumulation duration in ND202 were found to be better than those in NC89. The expression of NKT1 in the upper and middle leaves of ND202 had an advantage, and the relative expression of NtKC1 and NtTPK1 in both the upper and middle leaves, as well as the roots, was also significantly upregulated. Conversely, the expression of NTRK1 in the lower leaves and roots of ND202 was weaker. ND202 had significantly greater expression levels of NtHAK1 than NC89 in the upper and middle leaves and roots; moreover, the expression of NtKT12 in the upper leaves and roots of ND202 was also higher. In comparison with common varieties, high-K varieties had a stronger ability to absorb and accumulate K. They also possessed higher expression of K+ channel- and transporter-related genes and showed a superior K accumulation rate and longer duration of high-speed K accumulation. Furthermore, K accumulation rate at 40&#x2013;60days can be suggested as an important reference for the selection of high-K tobacco varieties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aleaves 3ametabolism 3amodels 3apotassium 3atobacco 0aaccumulation 0acharacteristic 0agene expression 0ahigh-K variety 0apotassium metabolism 0autilisation1 aLin, Ying-Chao1 aCao, Yi1 aWang, Ren-Gang1 aKong, De-Jun1 aHou, Qian1 aGou, Jian-Yu1 aKakar, Kaleem U.1 aZhang, Ji-Shun1 aWang, Zhi-Hong1 aYu, Shi-Zhou0 tFunctional plant biology.g2022, v. 49, no. 10 p.887-897dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl70735x1445-44087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP220113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245014100178300001600319520160500335592002801940650002201968650002201990650001002012650001502022650000802037650001302045650001702058650001402075650001902089650002002108650001102128650001502139650001502154651002202169651002802191653002802219653002202247653001502269653002202284653002202306653001402328700002002342700001702362700001902379773012402398856008402522852000902606655001202615IND60568697320221119192130.0190411e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056869732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2017.04.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCopilaş-Ciocianu, Denis10aEpigean gammarids survived millions of years of severe climatic fluctuations in high latitude refugia throughout the Western Carpathians  ap. 218-229.  aIsolated glacial refugia have been documented in Central Europe for a number of taxa, but conclusive evidence for epigean aquatic species has remained elusive. Using molecular data (mitochondrial and nuclear markers), we compared the spatial patterns of lineage diversity of the widely distributed Gammarus fossarum species complex between two adjacent biogeographically and geomorphologically distinct Central European regions: the Bohemian Massif and the Western Carpathians. We investigated if the observed patterns of spatial diversity are more likely to stem from historical or present-day factors. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses revealed eight phylogenetically diverse lineages: two exhibiting local signatures of recent demographic expansion inhabit both regions, while the other six display a relict distributional pattern and are found only in the Western Carpathians. Molecular dating indicates that these lineages are old and probably diverged throughout the Miocene (7–18Ma). Furthermore, their distribution does not seem to be constrained by the present boundaries of river catchments or topography. The contrasting spatial patterns of diversity observed between the two regions thus more likely result from historical rather than contemporaneous or recent factors. Our results indicate that despite the high latitude and proximity to the Pleistocene ice sheets, the Western Carpathians functioned as long-term glacial refugia for permanent freshwater fauna, allowing the uninterrupted survival of ancient lineages through millions of years of drastic climatic fluctuations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGammarus fossarum 3aaquatic organisms 3afauna 3afreshwater 3aice 3alatitude 3amitochondria 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3arefuge habitats 3arivers 3atopography 3awatersheds 3aCarpathian region 3aCentral European region 0aBiogeographical barrier 0aCryptic diversity 0aEndemicity 0aGammarus fossarum 0aNorthern refugium 0aPhylogeny1 aRutová, Tereza1 aPařil, Petr1 aPetrusek, Adam0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2017 July, v. 112 p.218-229dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2017.04.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245013400161300001800295520154800313592002801861650001601889650002601905650001001931650001101941650001301952650001701965650001201982650001301994700002402007700002202031700002602053700002202079700002202101700002302123700002202146700002002168700003202188773010302220856007502323852000902398655001202407IND60578059520221120133838.0170811e20140513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057805952DNAL7 a10.1021/ma402521h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Zachary
P.10aInfluence of Diffusivity and Sorption on Helium and Hydrogen Separations in Hydrocarbon, Silicon, and Fluorocarbon-Based Polymers  ap. 3170-3184.  aThe permeability–selectivity upper bounds show that perfluoropolymers have uniquely different separation characteristics than hydrocarbon-based polymers. For separating helium from hydrogen, these differences are particularly dramatic. At a given helium permeability, the upper bound defined by perfluoropolymers has helium/hydrogen selectivities that are 2.5 times higher than that of the upper bound defined by hydrocarbon-based polymers. Robeson hypothesized that these differences in transport properties resulted from the unusual sorption relationships of gases in perfluoropolymers compared to hydrocarbon-based polymers, and this paper seeks to test this hypothesis experimentally. To do so, the gas permeability, sorption, and diffusion coefficients were determined at 35 °C for hydrogen and helium in a series of hydrocarbon-, silicon-, and fluorocarbon-based polymers. Highly or completely fluorinated polymers have separation characteristics above the upper-bound for helium/hydrogen separation because they maintain good diffusivity selectivities for helium over hydrogen and they have helium/hydrogen sorption selectivities much closer to unity than those of hydrocarbon-based samples. The silicon-based polymer had intermediate sorption selectivities between those of hydrocarbon-based polymers and perfluoropolymers. Comparisons of hydrogen and helium sorption data in the literature more broadly extend the conclusion that helium/hydrogen sorption selectivity is rather different in hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon-based media.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiffusivity 3afluorocarbon polymers 3agases 3ahelium 3ahydrogen 3apermeability 3asilicon 3asorption1 aTiwari, Rajkiran R.1 aDose, Michelle E.1 aGleason, Kristofer L.1 aMurphy, Thomas M.1 aSanders, David F.1 aGunawan, Gabriella1 aRobeson, Lloyd M.1 aPaul, Donald R.1 aFreeman, B.

This article first analyzes the historical evolution of CLPP in China and divides it into five stages. Based on this, this paper proposes a CLPP implementation effect evaluation framework based on the perspective of farmers’ perception. Taking Xingning City, Guangdong Province as the research area, the AHP-entropy method and cloud model are used to evaluate the regional CLPP implementation effect. Results show that the comprehensive effect of CLPP is between “middle” and “good,” and specifically close to the “good” level. After the implementation of CLPP, its ecological management and protection, agricultural production enthusiasm, and farmers’ satisfaction levels are generally at a medium or low level, and only the amount of cultivated land protection is at a medium to high level. Therefore, the formulation of CLPP in the future needs to start from the perspective of improving the comprehensive interests of farmers and enhance the focalization of policies. The cloud model realizes the uncertainty mapping of each evaluation index, takes into account the randomness and ambiguity of evaluation index quantification and grade division, and makes the evaluation result objective. This research method can serve as a reference for relevant land use policy evaluation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural land 3acase studies 3afood security 3aland policy 3amodels 3apolicy analysis 3auncertainty 3aChina 0aCultivated land protection policy 0aEffect evaluation 0aAHP–entropy method 0aCloud model1 aZhang, Yanwei1 aZou, Yucheng0 tEcological indicators.g2021 Nov., v. 131 p.108247-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1082473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02165naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245006200164300001800226520102800244592002801272650000901300650001401309650001401323650001401337650001401351650001801365650001401383650003001397650001901427650002001446650001701466650001301483650001701496650001601513700002001529700001901549773010301568856007501671852000901746655001201755IND60578059620180802000000.0170811e20140513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057805962DNAL7 a10.1021/ma402603b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsquirol, Anne-Laure10aTunable Porous Hydrogels from Cocontinuous Polymer Blends  ap. 3068-3075.  aHydrogels embedded with networks of fully interconnected pores were prepared with microporous polylactide (PLA) molds obtained by extracting the polystyrene (PS) phase in melt-processed cocontinuous blends of PLA and PS. Quiescent annealing of the blends prior to the PS extraction allowed control over the average pore diameter from ∼1 to ∼500 μm for the PLA molds. Solutions of agar or alginate were injected within the molds and gelled in situ. Porous gels were obtained by extracting the PLA molds and X-ray microtomography was employed to characterize their microstructure. Water removal/uptake cycles were fully reversible with very fast kinetics. Freeze-drying yielded ultraporous materials without modification of the macroscopic dimensions, and rehydration yielded back porous hydrogels. It was possible to scale up the technique by using extrusion and injection molding equipment. This versatile new method allows extensive control over the gels’ porosity parameters and the use of various gel chemistries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagar 3aalginates 3aannealing 3aequipment 3aextrusion 3afreeze drying 3ahydrogels 3amicro-computed tomography 3amicrostructure 3apolylactic acid 3apolystyrenes 3aporosity 3aporous media 3arehydration1 aSarazin, Pierre1 aVirgilio, Nick0 tMacromolecules.g2014 May 13, v. 47, no. 9 p.3068-3075dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma402603b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02032naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245008900170300001800259520083300277592002801110650001301138650002301151650001201174650001501186650004401201650002201245650002201267650002201289650001901311700002001330700001901350700002501369700002401394700001801418773012001436856008101556852000901637655001201646IND60579805420221120031808.0170901e20170901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057980542DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.7b013882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLa Manna, Pellegrino10aThreading of an Inherently Directional Calixarene Wheel with Oriented Ammonium Axles  ap. 8973-8983.  aThe threading of monostoppered alkylbenzylammonium axles 7⁺ and 8⁺ with the calix[6]-wheel 3 can occur by both routes of entering the macrocycle 3 in the cone conformation: passage through the upper rim and the through the lower rim. Thus, under thermodynamic conditions, with both the axles 7⁺ and 8⁺, the two possible orientations of calix[2]pseudorotaxane, namely, endo-benzyl and endo-alkyl, are formed by a stereoselectivity controlled by the endo-alkyl rule. Interestingly, by ¹H NMR monitoring of the threading process between 8⁺ and 3, we revealed two calix[2]pseudorotaxane isomers in which the calix-wheel adopts 1,2,3-alternate and cone conformations, which represent the kinetic and thermodynamic species, respectively.

The fresh plain and malted muffins contained 22.30 and 22.52% moisture, 10.34 and 9.12% protein, 30.49 and 30.47% fat, 1.52 and 1.68% crude fibre, 35.51 and 37.38% carbohydrate, 163.22 and 164.36 mg/100 g calcium, 6.32 and 3.46 mg/100 g iron respectively. The sensory evaluation of muffins was carried out and it was observed that mean score of plain and malted muffins was 8.5 and 8.5 for colour and appearance, 8.3 and 8.3 for texture, 8.5 and 8.7 for flavour, 8.6 and 8.6 for taste, while 8.4 and 8.5 for overall acceptability respectively. The sensory quality of muffins decreased during storage; however, those were acceptable up to 3 days storage at ambient temperature and 6 days at refrigerated temperatures. Muffins stored in aluminum foil at refrigerated temperature were of better quality as compared to those stored in polypropylene bags, at ambient temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEleusine coracana 3aaluminum foil 3aambient temperature 3acalcium 3acarbohydrates 3acolor 3acrude fiber 3aflavor 3airon 3amillet flour 3apolypropylenes 3arefrigeration 3asensory evaluation 3ataste 3atexture 3awheat flour 0aFinger millet 0amalted finger millet 0amuffins1 aKotecha, P.

Cross-sectional studies were conducted in five high-burden pockets of four Indian states. Prevalence of malnutrition among women and children is very high in these pockets and the government plans to implement community-based pilot projects to address malnutrition in these areas. Anthropometric measurements were carried out on 1716 women with children <5 years of age. However, analyses were conducted on 1538 non-pregnant adult women. The results showed a strong correlation between MUAC and BMI in the non-pregnant women, with correlation coefficient of 0·860 (95 % CI 0·831, 0·883; P < 0·001). Cohen’s κ of 0·812 and 0·884 also showed good agreement between MUAC and BMI in identifying maternal wasting and severe wasting, respectively. The univariate regression model between MUAC and BMI explained 0·734 or 73 % of the variation in BMI. The MUAC cut-offs for wasting (BMI < 18·5 kg/m²) and severe wasting (BMI < 16·0 kg/m²) were calculated as 232 and 214·5 mm, respectively. MUAC is a strong predictor of maternal BMI among non-pregnant women with children <5 years in high-burden pockets of four Indian states. In a resource-constrained setting where BMI may not be feasible, the MUAC cut-offs could reliably be used to screen wasting and severe wasting in non-pregnant women for providing appropriate care.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aarm circumference 3abody mass index 3achildren 3across-sectional studies 3amalnutrition 3aregression analysis 3awomen 3aIndia 0aBMI 0aMid-upper arm circumference 0aCorrelation 0aMaternal wasting1 aSinhā, Rājeśa,1 aPatil, Narendra1 aKumar, Virendra0 tPublic health nutrition.g2019 Oct., v. 22, no. 14 p.2548-2552dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800190007273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01892naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002200154245012900176300001600305520096700321592002801288650001501316650001301331650001201344650001801356650001601374700002201390773012401412856005701536852000901593655001201602IND4473482420221118150258.0120727e198112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447348242DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.1981.tb00352.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSIEBER, VIVIEN K.10aHybridization between tetraploid species of Alopecurus L.

It is suggested that plants morphologically intermediate between the parental species are hybrids or of hybrid origin. Hybridization occurs more readily between A. pratensis and A. arundinaceus than between A. pratensis and A. geniculate, since intermediate forms were recovered from all mixed populations of A. pratensis and A. arundinaceus. The intermediate forms occur only in a few populations of A. pratensis and A. geniculars where an appropriate habitat is available. Evidence of backcrossing and therefore introgression comes from the continuum of intermediate forms that exists between the species. Scatter diagrams for individual populations show distinct differences in the degree of introgression. Observations on artificially produced hybrids are similar to those on naturally occurring hybrids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlopecurus 3ahabitats 3ahybrids 3aintrogression 3atetraploidy1 aMurray, Brian G.,0 tBotanical journal of the Linnean Society.g1981 Dec., v. 83, no. 4 p.285-292dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.1981.tb00352.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245008900166300001600255500001400271520146300285592002801748650002201776650001201798650001101810650001001821650001601831650001901847650002001866650001301886650001301899650001301912650001701925650001301942700001501955700001901970700001401989700005202003700005402055773011502109856008302224852000902307655001202316IND60682532220221118030714.0200128e20191108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068253222DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.9b008002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Fadeng10aTargeting the Amyloid-β Fibril Surface with a Constrained Helical Peptide Inhibitor  ap. 290-296.  aNAL-light  aAmyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers are well-known toxic molecular species associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Recent discoveries of the ability of amyloid fibril surfaces to convert soluble proteins into toxic oligomers suggested that these surfaces could serve as therapeutic targets for intervention. We have shown previously that a short helical peptide could be a key structural motif that can specifically recognize the K₁₆–E₂₂ region of the Aβ40 fibril surface with an affinity at the level of several micromolar. Here, we demonstrate that in-tether chiral center-induced helical stabilized peptides could also recognize the fibril surfaces, effectively inhibiting the surface-mediated oligomerization of Aβ40. Moreover, through extensive computational sampling, we observed two distinct ways in which the peptide inhibitors recognize the fibril surface. Apart from a binding mode that, in accord with the original design, involves hydrophobic side chains at the binding interface, we observed much more frequently another binding mode in which the hydrophobic staple interacts directly with the fibril surface. The affinity of the peptides for the fibril surface could be adjusted by tuning the hydrophobicity of the staple. The best candidate investigated here exhibits a submicromolar affinity (∼0.75 μM). Collectively, this work opens an avenue for the rational design of candidate drugs with stapled peptides for amyloid-related disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aamyloid 3adesign 3adrugs 3aexhibitions 3ahydrophobicity 3aoligomerization 3apeptides 3asampling 3asurfaces 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity1 aZhang, Wan1 aJiang, Yixiang1 aYin, Feng1 aHan, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0759-17661 aLi, Zigang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3630-85200 tBiochemistry.g2019 Nov. 08, v. 59, no. 3 p.290-296dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.9b008003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03999naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005800153245011000211300001600321520235900337592002802696650002202724650002002746650001302766650001302779650002202792650002002814650002602834650001202860650002202872650001102894650001002905650001602915650001402931650002602945650002402971650003102995650001003026653002103036653002303057653002803080653002103108653003303129653001803162700001803180700006003198773012603258856008803384852000903472655001203481IND60611104220221122050416.0200607e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061110422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2018.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaple, Jodi M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6914-631314aThe utility of elliptical Fourier analysis for estimating ancestry and sex from lateral skull photographs  ap. 352-362.  aCurrent quantitative methods for estimating ancestry and sex from skulls typically require substantial manual data collection and specialized recording equipment, which can limit analysis to the laboratory. This limitation could be addressed by establishing a faster, more user-friendly, and automatic data protocol as investigated in the current study using elliptical Fourier analysis (EFA). Ancestry and sex were estimated using outlines acquired from standardized photographs of the skull in norma lateralis (left side). In this investigation, training samples comprised anatomical specimens from five collections: the Hamann-Todd Human Osteological Collection, WM Bass Donated Skeletal Collection, Robert J. Terry Anatomical Skeletal Collection, Khon Kaen Osteological Collection, and Chiba Bone Collection. Groups were defined as Black American female (n=87), Black American male (n=109), Japanese male (n=59), Thai female (n=39), Thai male (n=47), White American female (n=97), and White American male (n=134). EFA was conducted on partial Procrustes-aligned skull outline coordinates, before extracting principal components and using linear discriminant analysis for group assignment. Classification accuracy was determined using the 5-fold cross-validation protocol. Ancestry and sex were classified correctly 73% of the time when all seven reference samples were used. When only Black and White Americans were retained in the reference sample with sex pooled, they were correctly classified 94% of the time. Accuracy of out-of-group ancestry and sex estimation was evaluated using nine White American males from the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency Laboratory. A seven-way comparison with all reference samples for estimating both ancestry and sex achieved 89% (8/9) correct classifications, with one misclassification as White American female. These out-of-group results, along with initial training group accuracies, indicate that lateral skull outlines can be used to successfully estimate ancestry and sex with similar accuracy to other methods, and set the basis for future cross-validation testing. Further, the reliance on a single easy-to-take photograph and user-friendly open-source R script facilitates easy application and field use. The protocol is freely available from CRANIOFACIALidentification.com as the SkullProfiler script.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican Americans 3aWhite Americans 3aaccuracy 3aancestry 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3adiscriminant analysis 3afemales 3aforensic sciences 3ahumans 3amales 3aphotographs 3aprotocols 3aquantitative analysis 3arecording equipment 3asex determination analysis 3askull 0aForensic science 0aBiological profile 0aSkeletal identification 0aFourier analysis 0aLinear discriminant analysis 0aSkullProfiler1 aByrd, John E.1 aStephan, Carl N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8696-38090 tForensic science international.g2018 Aug., v. 289 p.352-362dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2018.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03251naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015200165300001600317520148000333592002801813650002801841650002501869650001201894650001701906650001901923650002101942650002801963650002301991650002802014650002002042650002302062650001202085650002102097650003302118650001602151650001602167650001002183650002902193650001702222650001702239650001102256651001002267700001702277700001602294700001702310700001902327700001602346700001602362700001702378700001502395700002002410700001602430773011302446856008102559852000902640655001202649IND60572383920221117062848.0170717e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057238392DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-016-0334-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Shihong10aRhizosphere and bulk soil enzyme activities in a Nothotsuga longibracteata forest in the Tianbaoyan National Nature Reserve, Fujian Province, China  ap. 521-528.  aThe rhizosphere, distinct from bulk soil, is defined as the volume of soil around living roots and influenced by root activities. We investigated protease, invertase, cellulase, urease, and acid phosphatase activities in rhizosphere and bulk soils of six Nothotsuga longibracteata forest communities within Tianbaoyan National Nature Reserve, including N. longibracteata + either Phyllostachys pubescens, Schima superba, Rhododendron simiarum, Cunninghamia lanceolata, or Cyclobalanopsis glauca, and N. longibracteata pure forest. Rhizosphere soils possessed higher protease, invertase, cellulase, urease, and acid phosphatase activities than bulk soils. The highest invertase, urease, and acid phosphatase activities were observed in rhizosphere samples of N. longibracteata + S. superba. Protease was highest in the N. longibracteata + R. simiarum rhizosphere, while cellulase was highest in the pure N. longibracteata forest rhizosphere. All samples exhibited obvious rhizosphere effects on enzyme activities with a significant linear correlation between acid phosphatase and cellulase activities (p < 0.05) in rhizosphere soils and between protease and acid phosphatase activities (p < 0.05) in bulk soils. A principal component analysis, correlating 13 soil chemical properties indices relevant to enzyme activities, showed that protease, invertase, acid phosphatase, total N, and cellulase were the most important variables impacting rhizosphere soil quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCunninghamia lanceolata 3aPhyllostachys edulis 3aQuercus 3aRhododendron 3aSchima superba 3aacid phosphatase 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3aconservation areas 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzyme activity 3aforest communities 3aforests 3anitrogen content 3aprincipal component analysis 3aproteinases 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3asoil chemical properties 3asoil enzymes 3asoil quality 3aurease 3aChina1 aYou, Huiming1 aYou, Weibin1 aLiu, Jinshan1 aCai, Changtang1 aWu, Jianqin1 aJi, Zhirong1 aZhan, Shihua1 aHu, Zhesen1 aZhang, Zhongrui1 aHe, Dongjin0 tJournal of forestry research.g2017 May, v. 28, no. 3 p.521-528dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-016-0334-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04366naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245009600175300001400271520274200285592002803027650001003055650001903065650002603084650001303110650001203123650002203135650002403157650001603181650001003197650002303207650001703230650001603247650001803263650001503281650002103296650001803317650002003335650001003355650001403365650001603379650001003395650001803405651001103423651001803434653001803452653001203470653000903482653002403491653001503515700001903530700001903549773011403568856008503682852000903767655001203776IND50066715920221120102621.0190403e20130701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006671592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2013.02.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSt. Clair, Samuel B.14aThe role of facilitation and competition in the development and resilience of aspen forests  ap. 91-99.  aUnderlying the development and function of aspen forest communities are interactions between aspen and a broad suite of plant species. These plant–plant interactions can be facilitative or antagonistic in nature and their influence varies depending on multiple environmental factors that are changing with human activity. The purpose of this synthesis paper is to identify the patterns, mechanisms and consequences of facilitation and competition in aspen communities and how they vary based on environmental conditions and different aspen forest types.Across its expansive range, aspen commonly associate with conifers to form mixed forests. There is increasing evidence that facilitation in early stand development alters competitive interactions between aspen and conifers in later stages of development. However, the influences of facilitation and competition vary depending on conifer species and aspen forest type. In drier, montane aspen forests of the western US, shade and higher moisture content at the base of aspen trees facilitate the germination and survival of young fir seedlings. This facilitation effect increases the proximity of aspen and fir which over time creates competitive interactions that favor conifer dominance. In the more mesic conditions of eastern Canada, aspen also promotes fir establishment but the facilitation effect occurs at the stand level and is most likely driven by increased light penetration and more optimal edaphic conditions rather than by mitigating moisture limitations. In the western and central boreal forest, successional transitions are primarily driven by competitive effects in which short fire cycles and competitive inhibition of spruce favors aspen dominance.Positive and antagonistic interactions between aspen and associated plant species are influenced by environmental conditions that fluctuate according to nature processes and human perturbations. In this review we discuss the impact that plant invasions, global change factors, fire regimes and herbivory have on plant–plant interactions in aspen forest and how they modify successional outcomes. The literature suggests that aspen’s competitive ability is strongly influenced by rising CO2, temperatures, drought and ozone. Conditions resulting in longer fire cycles will tend to promote losses in aspen cover through competitive exclusion through conifer expansion. Finally, competition alters aspen susceptibility to herbivory which is a major threat to aspen resilience in some parts of its range. Identifying the environmental conditions that create the proper balance between facilitative and competitive interactions is paramount in formulating management approaches that promote resilient aspen forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies 3aboreal forests 3acompetitive exclusion 3aconifers 3adrought 3aearly development 3aecological invasion 3afire regime 3afires 3aforest communities 3aforest types 3agermination 3aglobal change 3aherbivores 3amesic conditions 3amixed forests 3amontane forests 3aozone 3aseedlings 3atemperature 3atrees 3awater content 3aCanada 3aUnited States 0aBoreal forest 0aConifer 0aFire 0aPopulus tremuloides 0aSuccession1 aCavard, Xavier1 aBergeron, Yves0 tForest ecology and management.g2013 July 01, v. 299 p.91-99dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2013.02.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02868naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245016100163520154900324592002801873650002001901650001901921650001601940650002101956650001801977650001401995650001102009650002002020650001602040650002702056700002502083700002202108700002402130700002902154700002002183700002702203700002502230773011902255856007502374852000902449655001202458IND60742475120221117013138.0210624e20210526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074247512DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110615512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQaid, Mohammed M.10aEffect of Rumex nervosus Leaf Powder on the Breast Meat Quality, Carcass Traits, and Performance Indices of Eimeria tenella Oocyst-Infected Broiler Chickens  aThis work aimed to assess the effect of using the RNL on performance indices, carcass trait, and meat quality of broiler chicken infected with Eimeria tenella compared with commercially used anticoccidials salinomycin. Moreover, we compare these selected variables between infected medicated groups and a non-infected unmedicated group (UUT) and an infected unmedicated group (IUT). A total of 150 1-day-old Ross 308 mixed-sex broilers were divided into 6 groups. Birds in groups 1, 2, and 3 were fed basic diets supplemented with 1, 3, and 5 g of RNL/kg diet, respectively. Group 4 received a basic diet with 66 mg of salinomycin. The control groups (5 and 6) were given a basic diet with no RNL or salinomycin added. All groups except the negative controls were challenged with Eimeria tenella at 21 days old. Birds in RNL groups outperformed those in the IUT group in performance indices, and they have a similar effect to the salinomycin group. Enhancement-infected birds with RNL affected some chickens’ carcass traits. Drip loss, water-holding capacity, and meat tenderness were improved by RNL inclusion (1 g) in the diet. In conclusion, the meat of infected birds receiving 1 g RNL had increased quality attributes, with preferable tenderness and springiness when compared to the IUT group. RNL could therefore also be considered a promising non-conventional feed source in the future. Further research is needed to optimize the use of RNL to improve broilers production and meat quality in both infected and non-infected conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEimeria tenella 3aRumex nervosus 3abreast meat 3abroiler chickens 3acoccidiostats 3adrip loss 3aleaves 3ameat tenderness 3asalinomycin 3awater holding capacity1 aAl-Mufarrej, Saud I.1 aAzzam, Mahmoud M.1 aAl-Garadi, Maged A.1 aAlqhtani, Abdulmohsen H.1 aH.

Chelsea10aNutrient limitation in tropical secondary forests following different management practices  ap. 734-755.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSecondary forests now make up more than one‐half of all tropical forests, and constraints on their biomass accumulation will influence the strength of the terrestrial carbon (C) sink in the coming decades. However the variance in secondary tropical forest biomass for a given stand age and climate is high and our understanding of why is limited. We constructed a model of terrestrial C, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycling to examine the influence of disturbance and management practices on nutrient limitation and biomass recovery in secondary tropical forests. The model predicted that N limited the rate of forest recovery in the first few decades following harvest, but that this limitation switched to P approximately 30–40 yr after abandonment, consistent with field data on N and P cycling from secondary tropical forest chronosequences. Simulated biomass recovery agreed well with field data of biomass accumulation following harvest (R² = 0.80). Model results showed that if all biomass remained on site following a severe disturbance such as blowdown, regrowth approached pre‐disturbance biomass in 80–90 yr, and recovery was faster following smaller disturbances such as selective logging. Field data from regrowth on abandoned pastures were consistent with simulated losses of nutrients in soil organic matter, particularly P. Following any forest disturbance that involved the removal of nutrients (i.e., except blowdown), forest regrowth produced reduced biomass relative to the initial state as a result of nutrient loss through harvest, leaching and/or sequestration by secondary minerals. Differences in nutrient availability accounted for 49–94% of the variance in secondary forest biomass C at a given stand age. Management lessons from this study are the importance of strategies that help retain nutrients on site, recognizing the role of coarse woody debris in immobilization and subsequent release of nutrients, and the potential for nutrient additions to enhance biomass growth and recovery in secondary tropical forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass production 3acarbon 3achronosequences 3aclimate 3acoarse woody debris 3aforest damage 3aleaching 3alogging 3aminerals 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3anutrients 3apastures 3aphosphorus 3areforestation 3aregrowth 3asecondary forests 3asoil organic matter 3astand age 3atropical forests 3avariance1 aRastetter, Edward B.1 aNeill, Christopher1 aPorder, Stephen0 tEcological applications.g2017 Apr., v. 27, no. 3 p.734-755dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.14783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012400165500001400289520140500303592002801708650002201736650002601758650001601784650001501800650001201815650001201827650000901839650002001848650001301868650001301881650001201894650001701906650002001923650001101943650001201954650001401966650001601980653001901996653001602015653001902031653002302050700001602073700003002089700001602119773011902135856008302254852000902337655001202346IND60707375420221122060715.0200907e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070737542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2020.1016782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSreedhar, M.10aBiochemical changes in groundnut pods due to infestation of bruchid Caryedon serratus (Olivier) under stored conditions  aNAL-light  aA study on the “Biochemical changes in groundnut pods due to infestation of bruchid, Caryedon serratus (Olivier) under stored conditions” was conducted at Department of Entomology, College of Agriculture, SVPUA&T, Meerut during August 2018 to February 2019. Results of the study showed that there was significant increase in weight loss of the groundnut pods (test varieties) with the increase in storage period i.e. 30, 90, and 150 DAS (days after storage). This significant increase in weight loss was due to infestation of groundnut bruchid. In addition to the weight loss, distinct differences in the biochemical components such as sugars, proteins, tannins, phenols were found in between infested and uninfested groundnut pods. A significant reduction in sugars, tannins, phenol whereas increase in protein content was noticed with the increase in the storage period i.e. 30, 90 and 150 DAS. Correlation studies relating weight loss and biochemical components from different groundnut varieties (resistant and susceptible) due to bruchid infestation were also worked out in the study. Pod sugar and pod protein content showed significant positive correlation with weight loss (positive effect on the development of the bruchid). While, pod tannins and pod phenols content showed significant negative correlation with weight loss (exerted a negative effect on the development of the bruchid).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaryedon serratus 3aagricultural colleges 3acorrelation 3aentomology 3apeanuts 3aphenols 3apods 3aprotein content 3aproteins 3aresearch 3astorage 3astorage time 3astored products 3asugars 3atannins 3avarieties 3aweight loss 0aStorage period 0aBiochemical 0aGroundnut pods 0aDays after storage1 aSingh, D.V.1 aReddy, D.V.

Evidence from studies targeting non-white, non-Western populations is still sparse, although coffee is popular and widely consumed in Asian countries. Population-based, prospective cohort study. We used Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for dietary and lifestyle factors to estimate associations between coffee consumption and all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Dietary intake including coffee consumption was assessed only at baseline using a validated FFQ. A Japanese city. Individuals aged 35 years or older without cancer, CHD and stroke at baseline (n 29 079) and followed from 1992 to 2008. From 410 352 person-years, 5339 deaths were identified (mean follow-up = 14·1 years). Coffee consumption was inversely associated with mortality from all causes and CVD among all participants, but not from cancer. Compared with the category of ‘none’, the multivariate hazard ratio (95 % CI) for all-cause mortality was 0·93 (0·86, 1·00) for <1 cup/d, 0·84 (0·76, 0·93) for 1 cup/d and 0·81 (0·71, 0·92) for 2–3 cups/d. The multivariate hazard ratio (95 % CI) for cardiovascular mortality were 0·87 (0·77, 0·99) for <1 cup/d, 0·76 (0·63, 0·92) for 1 cup/d and 0·67 (0·50, 0·89) for 2–3 cups/d. Inverse associations were also observed for mortality from other causes, specifically infectious and digestive diseases. Drinking coffee, even 1 cup/d, was inversely associated with all-cause mortality and mortality from cardiovascular, infectious and digestive diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoffee (beverage) 3acohort studies 3adigestive system diseases 3afood intake 3alifestyle 3amortality 3aneoplasms 3astroke 3aAsia 0aCoffee 0aProspective studies1 aWada, Keiko1 aGoto, Yuko1 aMizuta, Fumi1 aKoda, Sachi1 aUji, Takahiro1 aNagata, Chisato0 tPublic health nutrition.g2019 Oct., v. 22, no. 14 p.2561-2568dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800190007643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01861naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245003800168300001400206520080700220592002801027650002101055650001401076650000901090650002601099650000901125650001401134650001201148653001901160653001101179653001101190653001501201653002201216700002301238700002201261773010001283856008301383852000901466655001201475IND60568697720221119192304.0190411e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056869772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2017.04.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunday, John S.10aPapillomaviruses in dogs and cats  ap. 23-31.  aPapillomaviruses (PVs) cause disease in both dogs and cats.

In cats, PVs are currently thought to cause oral papillomas, feline viral plaques, Bowenoid in situ carcinomas and feline sarcoids. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that PVs may also be a cause of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and basal cell carcinomas in cats. These diseases are discussed in this review.

The vast majority of experimental evidence does not support claims of enhanced ecological benefits in IRG compared to other grazing strategies, including the capacity to increase storage of soil organic carbon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal performance 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3afences 3aforage quality 3agrazing intensity 3ahydrology 3ainfrastructure 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3alivestock 3apastures 3arotational grazing 3asoil1 aAsh, Andrew J.1 aDerner, Justin D.1 aHuntsinger, Lynn0 tAgricultural systems.g2014 Mar., v. 125 p.50-53dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2013.12.0013Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/584103Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/AGSY1824.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003300166245015300199300001800352520149100370592002801861650003001889650002801919650001401947650002101961650002201982650001102004650002202015650001402037650001502051650001402066650002202080650001002102653002002112653002102132653002102153653002102174653001902195653001102214700002102225700002102246700002002267700001602287700002702303773012902330856008202459852000902541655001202550IND60517448320221120162735.0190803e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051744832DNAL7 a239246172pmid7 a10.1017/S136898001300195X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez-Fernandez, Rodrigo10aReview ArticleCurrent salt reduction policies across gradients of inequality-adjusted human development in the WHO European region: minding the gaps  ap. 1894-1904.  aTo assess current salt† reduction policies in countries of the WHO European Region against the backdrop of varying levels of human development adjusted for income, education and health (longevity) inequalities. Population-based, cross-sectional study, with data gathered through systematic review of relevant databases and supplementary information provided by WHO Nutrition Counterparts. Member States of the WHO European Region. Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index scores were analysed against assessed levels of development and implementation of national nutrition policies and initiatives targeting population-level salt reduction. Within the WHO European Region, Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index values among countries with no existing salt reduction initiatives (mean 0·643 (se 0·022)) were significantly lower than among those with either partially implemented/planned salt initiatives (mean 0·766 (se 0·017), P < 0·001) or fully implemented salt initiatives (mean 0·780 (se 0·021), P < 0·001). Where salt reduction strategies are implemented as an integral part of national policy, outcomes have been promising. However, low- and middle-income countries may face severe resource constraints that keep them from emulating more comprehensive strategies pursued in high-income countries. Care must be taken to ensure that gaps are not inadvertently widened by monitoring differential policy impacts of salt policies, particularly regarding trade flows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3across-sectional studies 3adatabases 3ahealth education 3ahuman development 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3alongevity 3amonitoring 3anutrition 3asystematic review 3atrade 0aSodium chloride 0aFood legislation 0aNutrition policy 0aHealth promotion 0aSocial justice 0aEurope1 aSiopa, Margarida1 aSimpson, Sarah J1 aAmiya, Rachel M1 aBreda, Joao1 aCappuccio, Francesco P0 tPublic health nutrition.g2014 Aug., v. 17, no. 8 p.1894-1904dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S136898001300195X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245016100175300001600336520152000352592002801872650002701900650001501927650001901942650002401961650001301985650002201998650002602020650001402046650002302060650002102083650001402104650002202118650001002140650002202150650002002172650002002192650001402212650001202226650001302238650001402251650001202265650003302277650001102310653002302321653001402344653001202358653001602370653001302386700002502399700002102424700006002445773010302505856008902608852000902697655001202706IND60619747720221121044952.0190410e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061974772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2018.10.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaiyee, Burhanah10aTrichoderma spirale T76-1 displays biocontrol activity against leaf spot on lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) caused by Corynespora cassiicola or Curvularia aeria  ap. 195-200.  aLettuce (Lactuca sativa) is an edible leafy vegetable used in diverse recipes. The disease known as leaf spot leads to plant death and is caused Corynespora cassiicola or Curvularia aeria. In this study, 5 selected isolates of Trichoderma spp. were assessed for their antifungal activities against C. cassiicola and C. aeria. Trichoderma spirale T76-1 was superior in inhibiting the mycelial growth of C. cassiicola and C. aeria by 84.68% and 93.03%, respectively, in dual culture assays. In a volatile antifungal bioassay T. spirale T76-1 suppressed the growths of C. cassiicola and C. aeria by 41.29% and 42.35%, respectively. GC/MS profiling revealed the presence of antifungal compounds, including alcohol and pyran. Poisoned food technique showed that the cell-free culture filtrate of T. spirale T76-1 inhibited C. cassiicola and C. aeria by 48.47% and 51.67%, respectively. The enzyme activities of β-1,3-glucanase and chitinase in the cell-free culture filtrate were 10.13 and 0.93 U mL−1, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy of mycelia incubated with cell-free culture filtrate of T. spirale T76-1 showed abnormal shapes in both pathogens. Leaf spraying with a spore suspension of T. spirale T76-1 suppressed disease incidence by up to 58–62% compared to control (96–98% penetration, inoculation with pathogen alone). These findings reveal that competition, volatile antifungals, and enzyme activities are mechanisms involved in the biocontrol of leaf spot in lettuce by T. spirale T76-1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynespora cassiicola 3aCurvularia 3aLactuca sativa 3aTrichoderma spirale 3aalcohols 3aantifungal agents 3aantifungal properties 3abioassays 3abiological control 3acell free system 3achitinase 3aculture filtrates 3adeath 3adisease incidence 3aenzyme activity 3afoliar spraying 3aleaf spot 3alettuce 3amycelium 3apathogens 3arecipes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspores 0aBiological control 0aLeaf spot 0aLettuce 0aTrichoderma 0aVolatile1 aPornsuriya, Chaninun1 aItō, Shin'ichi,1 aSunpapao, Anurag1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3208-40560 tBiological control.g2019 Feb., v. 129 p.195-200dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2018.10.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245009000185300001800275520177000293592002802063650002002091650002802111650002302139650001802162650001102180650002102191650002502212650001202237650001902249650001702268651001402285653001402299653001402313653003002327653001802357653002002375700001102395700002502406700001802431700001502449773012902464856008202593852000902675655001202684IND60517448420221120152731.0190803e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051744842DNAL7 a239056232pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800130019972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhitton, Clare10aFast-food consumers in Singapore: demographic profile, diet quality and weight status  ap. 1805-1813.  aTo determine the demographic profile of fast-food consumers among adult Singapore residents and ascertain whether fast-food consumption frequency is associated with diet quality and weight status. A nationally representative cross-sectional survey including an FFQ and anthropometric measures. Participants were grouped based on their fast-food consumption frequency as non-consumer, occasional consumer or regular consumer, with regular defined as at least once per week. Individuals living in the community in Singapore. Singapore residents (n 1627) aged 18–69 years of Chinese, Malay and Indian ethnicity. Proportions of regular fast-food consumers were higher in younger age groups, higher income groups and middle education level groups. Mean daily energy intake was positively associated with fast-food consumption frequency (non-consumers 9636 kJ (2303 kcal); occasional consumers 11 159 kJ (2667 kcal); regular consumers 13 100 kJ (3131 kcal); P for trend < 0·001). Fast-food consumers were more likely to exceed the RDA for energy, fat and saturated fat, and less likely to meet wholegrain and fruit recommendations. Both regular consumers (OR = 1·24; 95 % CI 1·03, 1·51) and occasional consumers (OR = 1·52; 95 % CI 1·32, 1·77) were more likely to have a waist:hip ratio indicating abdominal obesity. Occasional consumers were more likely to have a BMI ≥ 23·0 kg/m² (OR = 1·19; 95 % CI 1·04, 1·37), whereas regular consumers were less likely (OR = 0·76; 95 % CI 0·64, 0·91) to have an ‘at-risk’ BMI. Fast-food consumption is most prevalent in young adults, high income and middle education level groups. Frequent fast-food consumption in Singapore is associated with unfavourable dietary and nutrient profiles and abdominal obesity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3across-sectional studies 3aeducational status 3aenergy intake 3aincome 3anutrient content 3anutritional adequacy 3aobesity 3asaturated fats 3ayoung adults 3aSingapore 0aFast food 0aSingapore 0aNational Nutrition Survey 0aWeight status 0aNutrient intake1 aMa, Yi1 aBastian, Amber Carla1 aFen Chan, Mei1 aChew, Ling0 tPublic health nutrition.g2014 Aug., v. 17, no. 8 p.1805-1813dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800130019973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03120naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100002100171245009500192300001500287520122100302592002801523650002501551650001801576650001001594650001501604650001201619650001501631650001301646650001601659650001901675650001101694650001501705650001301720650002201733650002101755650003901776650003601815650003801851650003101889650002201920650004001942650001301982650004201995650003202037650006302069650004502132700002302177700002002200700001902220700002002239700002202259700002502281700001902306773008602325856008602411852000902497655001202506IND60113929520221118003455.0141112e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011392952DNAL7 a221186202pmid7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2011.03.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlet, Analía I.10aNew insights into the role of spermine in Arabidopsis thaliana under long-term salt stress  ap. 94-100.  aPolyamines (putrescine, spermidine and spermine) are traditionally implicated in the response of plants to environmental cues. Free spermine accumulation has been suggested as a particular feature of long-term salt stress, and in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana the spermine synthase gene (AtSPMS) has been reported as inducible by abscisic acid (ABA) and acute salt stress treatments. With the aim to unravel the physiological role of free spermine during salinity, we analyzed polyamine metabolism in A. thaliana salt-hypersensitive sos mutants (salt overlay sensitive; sos1-1, sos2-1 and sos3-1), and studied the salt stress tolerance of the mutants in spermine and thermospermine synthesis (acl5-1, spms-1 and acl5-1/spms-1). Results presented here indicate that induction in polyamine metabolism is a SOS-independent response to salinity and is globally over-induced in a sensitive background. In addition, under long-term salinity, the mutants in the synthesis of spermine and thermospermine (acl5-1, spms-1 and double acl5-1/spms-1) accumulated more Na⁺ and performed worst than WT in survival experiments. Therefore, support is given to a role for these higher polyamines in salt tolerance mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aabscisic acid 3agenes 3ametabolism 3amutants 3aputrescine 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asodium 3aspermidine 3aspermine 3aspermine synthase 3astress tolerance 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBiogenic Polyaminesxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plantxdrug effects 2aGenetic Variation 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxmetabolism 2aSalinity 2aSalt Tolerancexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSodium Chloridexmetabolism 2aSperminexanalogs & derivativesxbiosynthesisxmetabolism. 2aSpermine Synthasexgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aSánchez, Diego H.1 aCuevas, Juan C.1 aMarina, María1 aCarrasco, Pedro1 aAltabella, Teresa1 aTiburcio, Antonio F.1 aRuiz, Oscar A.0 tPlant science.g2012 Jan., v. 182 p.94-100dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0168-94527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2011.03.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009800164300001600262520106400278592002801342650003501370650002901405650001001434650001101444650001501455650001301470650001401483650001701497650002001514650001301534650002301547650001701570650001401587650002101601650001201622700001701634700001601651700001801667700001801685773009601703856008101799852000901880655001201889IND60121357720221120021606.0150301e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012135772DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-014-2319-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jianye10aSequencing and generation of an infectious clone of the pathogenic goose parvovirus strain LH  ap. 711-718.  aIn this study, the complete genome of the virulent strain LH of goose parvovirus (GPV) was sequenced and cloned into the pBluescript II (SK) plasmid vector. Sequence alignments of the inverted terminal repeats (ITR) of GPV strains revealed a common 14-nt-pair deletion in the stem of the palindromic structure in the LH strain and three other strains isolated after 1982 when compared to three GPV strains isolated earlier than that time. Transfection of 11-day-old embryonated goose eggs with the plasmid pLH, which contains the entire genome of strain LH, resulted in successful rescue of the infectious virus. Death of embryos after transfection via the chorioallantoic membrane infiltration route occurred earlier than when transfection was done via the allantoic cavity inoculation route. The rescued virus exhibited virulence similar to that of its parental virus, as evaluated by the mortality rate in goslings. Generation of the pathogenic infectious clone provides us with a powerful tool to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of GPV in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnseriform dependoparvovirus 1 3achorioallantoic membrane 3adeath 3agenome 3agoose eggs 3agoslings 3amortality 3apathogenesis 3aplasmid vectors 3aplasmids 3asequence alignment 3atransfection 3avirulence 3avirulent strains 3aviruses1 aDuan, Jinkun1 aZhu, Liqian1 aJiang, Zhiwei1 aZhu, Guoqiang0 tArchives of virology.g2015 Mar., v. 160, no. 3 p.711-718dSpringer-Verlagx0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-014-2319-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03377naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002900137245011000166300001600276520168200292592002801974650002102002650002502023650002002048650001602068650001202084650001102096650001902107650001302126650002602139650001902165650002002184650000702204650001502211650001302226650001902239650001602258650001102274650001502285650001702300650002402317650001502341650002302356650001702379650001902396651001102415653001302426653001702439653002002456653001902476653001702495653002502512653002102537700002202558773010202580856007202682852000902754655001202763IND60792838020221120132219.0220910s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079283802DNAL7 a10.1071/SR211562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrymark-Szymkowiak, Anna10aImpacts of hydrological conditions on the activities of soil enzymes in temperate floodplain forest sites  ap. 637-647.  aContext The development and survival of floodplain forests are dependent on the occurrence of seasonal flooding that provides soil moisture and nutrient availability suitable for the development of soil microorganisms, which are the main sources of soil enzymes involved in the decomposition and mineralisation of soil organic matter. Aims We compared the soil enzyme activities of a floodplain forest in the Lower Vistula Valley, Poland, cut off for 80 years from the river by artificial embankment, and of two other floodplain forests located in close vicinity and subjected to seasonal flooding. We hypothesised that inhibiting the inflow of the river water to the floodplain forest will alter the soil water and mineral conditions, decreasing the activity of extracellular soil enzymes. Methods Enzyme activity, soil moisture content, and pH were monitored for 3 years in the upper soil level (0&#x2013;30cm). The activities of soil &#x3b2;-glucosidase, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, and nonspecific dehydrogenase were determined by spectrophotometry. Key results Inhibition of floods decreased soil moisture, the concentrations of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, as well as the activity of soil enzymes. Conclusions Forest site and soil depth, but not season, had significant effects on soil chemical and biological features. Soil enzyme activities were significantly positively correlated with soil moisture and the levels of total and organic carbon, total nitrogen, and available phosphorus, as well as the carbon/nitrogen ratio. Implications This information is essential for the protection and restoration of riverine habitats destroyed by human activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid phosphatase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aenzyme activity 3afloodplains 3aforests 3ahumans 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3aorganic carbon 3aoxidoreductases 3apH 3aphosphorus 3aresearch 3ariparian areas 3ariver water 3arivers 3asoil depth 3asoil enzymes 3asoil organic matter 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3aspectroscopy 3atotal nitrogen 3aPoland 0aflooding 0aforest soils 0a<i>Populus alba 0ariparian zones 0asoil biology 0asoil enzyme activity 0asoil water</kwd>1 aKarlinski, Leszek0 tSoil research.g2022, v. 60, no. 7 p.637-647dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl44751x1838-675X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR211563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03057naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245014100166300001400307520152800321592002801849650001901877650002001896650001701916650001601933650001601949650001901965650001801984650001602002650002902018650001602047650001302063650001102076650002102087650001902108650001302127650001402140650003702154650001402191650001202205653001002217653001302227653003002240653001702270653001202287700001602299700002102315773009902336856008302435852000902518655001202527IND60568697920221119191918.0190411e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056869792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2017.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdler, D.M.T.14aThe antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine, lidocaine and mepivacaine against equine pathogens: An investigation of 40 bacterial isolates  ap. 27-31.  aLameness is the most commonly reported health problem in horses, and lameness investigations which include local anaesthetic injections are routinely performed by equine practitioners. Through this process, bacteria can enter the tissues perforated by the needle and may cause local infections at the injection site. The objective of this in vitro study was to investigate if local anaesthetics at concentrations available in commercially available solutions could inhibit growth and/or kill bacteria that could be inoculated into the synovial space or soft tissues during injection. This study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of the local anaesthetics bupivacaine, lidocaine and mepivacaine against 40 equine clinical bacterial isolates of the Actinobacillus, Corynebacterium, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus genera. Minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MICs and MBCs) were determined by the broth microdilution method.Clinically applied concentrations of bupivacaine, lidocaine, and mepivacaine inhibited visual growth of 93%, 93%, and 80% of isolates tested, respectively. For the majority (80%) of the inhibited isolates, the concentrations were also bactericidal. The tested local anaesthetics possessed antimicrobial activity against equine pathogens at concentrations that are routinely applied in clinical cases. However, this antimicrobial activity should not discourage antiseptic preparation prior to local anaesthetic injections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacillus 3aCorynebacterium 3aEnterobacter 3aEscherichia 3aPseudomonas 3aStaphylococcus 3aStreptococcus 3aanesthetics 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantiseptics 3abacteria 3ahorses 3ain vitro studies 3ainjection site 3alameness 3alidocaine 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3apathogens 3atissues 0aHorse 0aLameness 0aLoco-regional anaesthesia 0aMicrobiology 0aSurgery1 aDamborg, P.1 aVerwilghen, D.R.0 tveterinary journal.g2017 May, v. 223 p.27-31dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl55231x1090-02337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2017.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03631naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005900153245007400212300001600286520235300302592002802655650001502683650001302698651001902711653002302730653002102753653001802774653001402792700006002806700002302866700005802889700006002947700005403007773011103061856008803172852000903260655001203269IND60611104620221122050350.0200607e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061110462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2018.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChadwick, Scott1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2006-984110aInvestigation of some of the factors influencing fingermark detection  ap. 381-389.  aThe primary aims of fingermark detection research are to improve the quality and increase the rate of detection of identifiable impressions. This is usually performed through the development of new methods and technologies to provide alternatives to or improve current procedures. While research of this nature is important to pursue, it fails to address the underlying question related to the factors that affect the detection of a latent fingermark. There has been significant research that has examined the differences between techniques, donors and fingermark age, as well as the composition of latent fingermarks. However, they tend not to focus on determining how these factors influence the quality of the developed mark.This study involved the development and evaluation of over 14,000 natural fingermarks deposited on a variety of surfaces to examine the effect of substrate, age, donor variability (both inter- and intra-), depletions and type of finger on fingermark development. Fingermarks were deposited on four substrates (two non-porous and two porous) and developed with either indanedione-zinc (IND-Zn) or cyanoacrylate followed by rhodamine 6G staining (CA+R6G). Three independent assessors graded each mark on the quality of development using an absolute scale proposed by the UK Centre for Applied Science and Technology (CAST). The data generated from these assessments were then analysed for trends or other useful insights.The results from this work reaffirm that individual substrate characteristics (and the choice of development technique) play a significant role in determining the number and quality of marks developed. It was found that fingermarks were more likely to be detected on porous substrates and to also be of a higher quality than on non-porous. The effect of fingermark donor variability was also explored, with significant differences observed between donors and within donors. This research shows that current detection techniques do not detect all available fingermarks, reinforcing the need for further research into the fundamentals of fingermark detection in order to gain a better understanding of the techniques currently used. The study has identified considerations for the development of novel techniques and how we need to account for variability when designing fingermark research experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3arhodamines 3astaining 3aUnited Kingdom 0aLatent fingermarks 0aIndanedione-zinc 0aCyanoacrylate 0aDetection1 aMoret, Sebastien1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5099-46971 aJayashanka, Nilesh1 aLennard, Chris1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9164-71031 aSpindler, Xanthe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6379-351X1 aRoux, Cl.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3610-420X0 tForensic science international.g2018 Aug., v. 289 p.381-389dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2018.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01506naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006000140245009700200300001800297520042100315592002800736650002900764650001000793650001300803650002800816650001800844700001500862700001900877700001700896700001900913700001900932773013400951856007401085852000901159655001201168IND60648581620221122035906.0190701e20190627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064858162DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc03737c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYinThese authors contributed equally to this work., Han10aNickel-catalyzed monofluoromethylation of (hetero)aryl bromides via reductive cross-coupling  ap. 7635-7638.  aA mild and efficient nickel-catalyzed direct monofluoromethylation of (hetero)aryl bromides by reductive cross-coupling has been developed.

It documents results obtained in experimental (n = 6) and control (n = 2) elk. During the first 2 years postinoculation (PI), 3 animals died or were euthanized because of infection or injuries other than spongiform encephalopathy (SE). In years 3 and 4 PI, 3 other inoculated elk died after brief terminal neurological episodes. Necropsy of these animals revealed moderate weight loss but no other gross lesions. Microscopically, characteristic lesions of SE were seen throughout the brain and spinal cord, and the tissue was positive for proteinase K-resistant prion protein (PrPʳᵉˢ) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and by Western blot. Scrapie-associated fibrils (SAF) were observed by negative-stain electron microscopy in the brain of elk with neurologic signs. PrPʳᵉˢ and SAF were not detected in the 3 inoculated elk necropsied during the first 2 years or in the 2 control animals. Retrospective analysis of the gene-encoding cervid PrP revealed a polymorphism at codon 132. The elk with SE were either homozygous (MM) or heterozygous (LM). These findings confirm that intracerebral inoculation of sheep scrapie agent results in SE with accumulations of PrPʳᵉˢ in the central nervous system of elk. Based on morphologic and IHC findings, the experimentally induced SE cannot be distinguished from chronic wasting disease of elk with currently available diagnostic techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimmunohistochemistry 3asheep 3abrain 3aCervus canadensis nelsoni 3aPrPSc proteins 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3adisease transmission 3ascrapie 3ahistopathology 3ainfection 2aAnimals 2aAutopsyxveterinary 2aBrainxpathology 2aCase-Control Studies 2aDeer 2aDiagnosis, Differential 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aPrionsxanalysis 2aScrapiextransmission 2aSheep 2aWasting Syndromexveterinary 0acentral nervous system 0aCervus elaphus nelsoni1 aMiller, Janice M.1 aCutlip, Randall C.1 aKunkle, Robert A.1 aJenny, Allen L.1 aStack, Mick J.1 aChaplin, Melanie J.1 aRicht, Juergen A.0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 16, no. 4 p.316-321dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638704016004103Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/410053Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03083naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002800154245007500182300001600257520163500273592002801908650001501936650001201951650001901963650002801982650001002010650001202020650002502032650001002057650001302067650003102080650001402111650001102125650001802136650001102154650001402165650001202179650001502191650001002206653001102216653001102227653001202238653001302250653001402263700002802277700002302305700002402328773010302352856008902455852000902544655001202553IND60619747820221121045011.0190410e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061974782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2018.10.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenhadi-Marín, Jacinto10aSpiders actively choose and feed on nutritious non-prey food resources  ap. 187-194.  aSpiders are generalist predators adapted to consume a wide range of prey although their ability to exploit non-prey foods such as pollen, nectar, and honeydew has been referred but less studied. In this work, we investigated the effect of different non-prey food items (Glucose at 0.5 M; aphid honeydew; black scale honeydew; a mixture of glucose 0.5 M, phenylalanine 0.1 mM, proline 0.1 mM, and tryptophan 0.1 mM; honey at 10%, and pollen at 10%) on the survival of immature spiders of two functional groups represented by Haplodrassus rufipes (ground hunters) and Synema globosum (ambushers), and their feeding choices, in laboratory experiments. The overall survival of both species fed on non-prey foods significantly increased compared to individuals fed on water. The black-scale honeydew was the best food for H. rufipes increasing longevity up to 117 days. The highest survival reached by S. globosum was observed when fed on a mixture of glucose 0.5 M and three amino acids. When different non-prey food items were offered together, the exploring rate was significantly higher for H. rufipes than for S. globosum. H. rufipes chose to feed on honey whereas S. globosum chose the mixture treatment. The most chosen food items corresponded with those that provided the highest longevities in both species. Our results suggest that spiders could search, recognize and actively select the most beneficial non-prey food. Habitat management practices such as maintaining weed strips in the crop may provide these valuable supplementary food resources within agroecosystems contributing for biological pest control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphidoidea 3aAraneae 3aagroecosystems 3abiological pest control 3afoods 3aglucose 3ahabitat conservation 3ahoney 3ahoneydew 3alaboratory experimentation 3alongevity 3anectar 3aphenylalanine 3apollen 3apredators 3aproline 3atryptophan 3aweeds 0aGuilds 0aSugars 0aProtein 0aHoneydew 0aPredators1 aPereira, José Alberto,1 aSousa, José Paulo1 aSantos, Sónia A.P.0 tBiological control.g2019 Feb., v. 129 p.187-194dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2018.10.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002100122040001800143072000900161072000900170072000900179100002200188245013300210300001600343500002400359520148200383650002601865650002101891650001001912650001801922650001401940650002001954650002301974650001301997650002002010650003002030650001302060651003102073651001602104653001602120700002402136773011102160852000902271856008002280856011202360930003302472945002502505946001302530961001302543655001202556IND4427604420221120100105.0091021e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442760442DNAL7 a10.1653/024.092.02032doi7 a10113/352262hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL300 0aL0011 aHight, Stephen D.10aFlight phenology of male Cactoblastis cactorum (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) at different latitudes in the southeastern United States  ap. 208-216.  aIncludes references  aLong term trapping studies of the invasive moth Cactoblastis cactorum (Berg) were conducted at various latitudes from Puerto Rico to South Carolina. Three flight periods per year were identified at the five temperate sties studied, which covered the majority of the insects¿ mainland United States infested range. In general, the three flight times across a latitudinal gradient from south Florida to central, coastal South Carolina were a spring flight during February-May, a summer flight during June-August, and a fall flight during September-November. At any one site, each flight period lasted about two months. In the tropical areas of the Florida Keys and a Caribbean Island, the insect had overlapping generations throughout the year. Previous studies conducted of this insect as a biological control agent indicated two flight periods per year in the insects¿ native range of Argentina and introduced range of Australia and South Africa. A newly developed synthetic sex pheromone baited trap was a good indicator of generational time for this insect, and trapping in previously studied areas will likely identify three generations rather then two. Initiation and timing of the three generational flights has importance in the current United States and Mexico monitoring program for the presence and expansion of this invasive insect, development of mapping programs to identify appropriate monitoring times, and management efforts using the Sterile Insect Technique. 3aCactoblastis cactorum 3ainvasive species 3amales 3ainsect flight 3aphenology 3apest monitoring 3aseasonal variation 3atrapping 3apheromone traps 3ageographical distribution 3alatitude 3aSoutheastern United States 3aPuerto Rico 0agenerations1 aCarpenter, James E.0 tFlorida entomologist.g2009 June, v.  92, no.  2 p.208-216dFlorida Entomological Societyx0015-40407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1653/024.092.02033Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/352263Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20091104b20091204c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/11/02  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02638naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009900157520146000256592002801716650001801744650001101762650001901773650001201792650001501804650001201819650001001831650001501841650001001856650002501866650001501891650001601906650000901922651001001931700001901941700001801960700001401978700002101992773012002013856007402133852000902207655001202216IND60771283420221123031445.0220325e20220227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077128342DNAL7 a10.3390/f130303902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wenjia 10aSmoke Injection Heights from Forest and Grassland Fires in Southwest China Observed by CALIPSO  aSmoke injection height (SIH) determines the distance and direction of smoke transport, thus impacting the atmospheric environment. In this study, we used Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations data coupled with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model to derive the SIH values during the peak forest and grassland fire seasons from 2012 to 2017 in Southwest China. The results suggest that the SIH values ranged from 2500 m to 2890 m. An analysis of the dependence of SIH on fire characteristics revealed no obvious correlation between SIH and fire radiative power (FRP) because other factors in addition to FRP have an important impact on SIH. Moreover, MODIS FRP data has a drawback in representing the energy released by real fires, also leading to this result. The topographic variables of forest and grassland fires in Southwest China are very different. Complex topography affects SIH by affecting fire intensity and interactions with wind. A comparison of the SIHs with boundary layer height reveals that 75% of the SIHs are above the boundary layer. Compared with other areas, a higher percentage of free troposphere injection occurs in Southwest China, indicating that smoke can cause air pollution over large ranges. Our work provides a better understanding of the transport and vertical distribution of smoke in Southwest China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aenergy 3afire intensity 3aforests 3agrasslands 3ahybrids 3alidar 3asatellites 3asmoke 3aspatial distribution 3atopography 3atroposphere 3awind 3aChina1 aZhang, Qixing 1 aZhao, Ranran 1 aLuo, Jie 1 aZhang, Yongming 0 tForests.g2022 Feb. 27, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f130303903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02377naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245007400157300001800231520129900249592002801548650003101576650003301607650001201640650002301652650001301675650001401688650002201702650002301724700002201747700001701769700002201786700001801808773010501826856007501931852000902006655001202015IND60577845220221119195013.0170810e20130813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057784522DNAL7 a10.1021/ma40116322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyulin, S.

As electrostatic interactions are essential for the polyimides considered, we propose a two-step equilibration protocol that includes long (microsecond-scale) MD simulations of polymer melt with partial atomic charges switched off, followed by relatively short runs (100 ns) of the polymer system with full electrostatics. We demonstrate that macroscopic characteristics of a polyimide sample (such as the glass transition temperature and density) are not particularly sensitive to the degree of equilibration. However, great caution should be paid when local structural characteristics are considered: proper equilibration of the local polymer structure (monitored through the radius of gyration and the end-to-end distance of individual chains) is found to require simulations on a microsecond time scale. Finally, we found a dramatic impact of electrostatic interactions on the properties of the bulk polyimides considered: when intra- and intermolecular dipole–dipole interactions come into play we witness compaction of individual polymer coils and eventually an increase in the glass transition temperature and polymer density.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aglass transition temperature 3amelting 3amolecular dynamics 3apolymers 3aprotocols 3asimulation models 3athermal properties1 aGurtovenko, A.

Attention to adaptation focuses on reduction of climate change vulnerability and increase of adaptive capacity. In order to better understand the role of decision-making in urban forestry, this paper assesses the perceptions of urban forestry stakeholders towards climate change adaptation, in the city of Belgrade (Serbia), based on Q-method interviews. The views of respondents were clustered into three distinct perspectives: (a) ‘Management-oriented perspective’, (b) ‘Sceptics’, (c) ‘General-awareness perspective’. Overall, a majority of interviewees (50%) are allocated to group (a), about a third to group (c), and only a minority (15%) to group (b). The sceptics’ perspective holds the opinion that climate variations are normal and there is insufficient evidence to prove the existence of climate change. Representatives of the two other perspectives recognize climate change as a challenge, but adopt different opinions to communication and coordination of the adaptation process. While the ‘Management-oriented perspective’ is advocating for more bottom-up initiatives and improvement of dialogue between stakeholders, the ‘General-awareness perspective’ opine that climate change is an issue to be governed by the national level organizations. Through these three varied perspectives, the main factors for the current lack of responses to climate change adaptation and related needs in urban forestry are identified: lack of coordination and communication between stakeholders, lack of scale-relevant technical and scientific data, lack of specific regulations and financial means. To move forward, we recommend empowering various stakeholders, improving organizational relations and introducing various means of education and information-sharing mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adecision making 3aeducation 3ainterviews 3astakeholders 3aurban forestry 3aSerbia 0aQ-methodology 0aUrban forests 0aSouth-East Europe 0aWestern Balkans 0aStakeholder awareness1 aWolfslehner, Bernhard0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2015, v. 14, no. 4 p.1079-1087dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2015.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02025naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011100170300001600281500001900297520095000316592002801266650001801294650001701312650001801329653002501347653001201372653000801384653001701392700006201409700002301471773009901494856008501593852000901678655001201687IND60701485220221121042249.0200819e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070148522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2020.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoozesh, Sadegh10aInterrogation of a new inline multi-bin cyclone for sorting of produced powders of a lab-scale spray dryer  ap. 590-598.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSpray drying as a primary powder synthesis tool is not designed to separate particles during the process. Here we report on the simulation, optimization, and development of a customized multi-bin cyclone for a lab-scale spray dryer to segregate particles based on their sizes. Two criteria were chosen to optimize the number of bins, cutoff size, and pressure drop. Accordingly, a non-dimensional factor describing cyclone performance was introduced by investigating which five bins of powder collection were found to render a compromise between competing factors. Spray-dried powders were administered to the cyclone, and deposition of the particles in the bins was recorded. The cyclone could segregate particles with a size resolution as low as 4 μm. For each bin, the data on particle size, morphology, pore attributes, BET surface, and moisture content showed that even within a single batch, there is a broad span of particle properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aparticle size 3aspray drying 3awater content 0aParticle engineering 0aCyclone 0aCFD 0aOptimization1 aJafari, Seid Mahdi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6877-95491 aAkafuah, Nelson K.0 tPowder technology.g2020 Aug., v. 373 p.590-598dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2020.07.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008400172300001400256520137000270592002801640650001501668650001101683650001501694650001501709650000901724650001901733650001501752650001501767653002901782653002301811653001601834653002301850653003501873700001201908700002501920700006601945773010202011856008502113852000902198655001202207IND60546253520221117223209.0160903e20140215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054625352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.12.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlias, Noraliani10aSectional analysis of the pollutant wash-off process based on runoff hydrograph  ap. 63-69.  aThe validity of using rainfall characteristics as lumped parameters for investigating the pollutant wash-off process such as first flush occurrence is questionable. This research study introduces an innovative concept of using sector parameters to investigate the relationship between the pollutant wash-off process and different sectors of the runoff hydrograph and rainfall hyetograph. The research outcomes indicated that rainfall depth and rainfall intensity are two key rainfall characteristics which influence the wash-off process compared to the antecedent dry period. Additionally, the rainfall pattern also plays a critical role in the wash-off process and is independent of the catchment characteristics. The knowledge created through this research study provides the ability to select appropriate rainfall events for stormwater quality treatment design based on the required treatment outcomes such as the need to target different sectors of the runoff hydrograph or pollutant species. The study outcomes can also contribute to enhancing stormwater quality modelling and prediction in view of the fact that conventional approaches to stormwater quality estimation is primarily based on rainfall intensity rather than considering other rainfall parameters or solely based on stochastic approaches irrespective of the characteristics of the rainfall event.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrograph 3amodels 3apollutants 3aprediction 3arain 3arain intensity 3astormwater 3awatersheds 0aRainfall characteristics 0aPollutant wash-off 0aFirst flush 0aStormwater quality 0aStormwater pollutant processes1 aLiu, An1 aEgodawatta, Prasanna1 aGoonetilleke, Ashantha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8783-12230 tJournal of environmental management.g2014 Feb. 15, v. 134 p.63-69dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.12.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03402naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002900165245019300194300001600387520151800403592002801921650001101949650002201960650005301982650001102035650001602046650002102062650001702083650001502100650000802115650000902123650001002132650001802142650000902160650002202169650002402191650002802215650001802243650001102261650004802272650002002320650001102340650000902351650002202360650001602382650005102398650002902449650002002478651001802498700002402516700002002540700002602560773012302586856008202709852000902791655001202800IND4491794720221118065352.0141111e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449179472DNAL7 a227324622pmid7 a10.1016/j.jada.2011.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanderwall, Cassandra M.10aExamination of Circulating Folate Levels as a Reflection of Folate Intakes among Older Adult Supplement Users and Nonusers in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2004  ap. 285-290.  aHigh intakes of folic acid and/or elevated blood folate concentrations have been associated with negative health outcomes; thus, it is critical to identify those at greatest risk of such exposures. The goal of this research was to describe folate intakes (folic acid [μg], folate [μg], and total folate [dietary folate equivalent] from food) and identify people 45 years or older in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2004 at risk of exposure to elevated serum folate concentrations (≥21.8 ng/mL [49.4 nmol/L]) when stratified by race or ethnicity and supplement use within sex. Black men consumed a lower mean food folate and exhibited lower red blood cell folate concentrations when compared to those of white or Mexican-American men (P<0.01 and P<0.01 for both). Black women consumed a lower food folate than Mexican-American women (P<0.01), less total folate (dietary folate equivalent) than white women (P<0.01), and had lower red blood cell folate concentrations than white women (P<0.01). Multivariate odds of elevated serum folate levels increased with age in men (P<0.001) and women (P=0.01). All white subjects and all supplement users (all P<0.001) were more likely to have elevated folate concentrations, while smoking reduced the odds of such exposures in women (P<0.001) and men (P=0.04). These findings highlight the need to understand the impact of chronic exposure to elevated folate intakes, especially among white subjects with increasing age and who use supplements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlacks 3aMexican Americans 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aadults 3ablood serum 3achronic exposure 3aerythrocytes 3afolic acid 3amen 3arisk 3awomen 2aBlack People. 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aDietary Supplements 2aErythrocytesxchemistry 2aWhite People. 2aFemale 2aFolic Acidxadministration & dosagexblood. 2aFood, Fortified 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMexican Americans 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutrition Surveysxstatistics & numerical data 2aNutritional Requirements 2aRisk Assessment 0aUnited States1 aTangney, Christy C.1 aKwasny, Mary J.1 aGustashaw, Kristin A.0 tJournal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.g2012 Feb., v. 112, no. 2 p.285-290dElsevier Inc.x0002-82237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jada.2011.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03224naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001300138245010000151300001800251500002000269520173100289592002802020650002202048650001602070650001202086650002902098650001702127650001802144650000902162650002002171650001202191650001302203650001902216650001502235650001602250650002402266650001202290651001302302700001702315700002002332700002002352700001702372700001902389700001602408700001402424700001802438700002102456773013602477856007202613852000902685655001202694IND60588177320221120081937.0180103e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058817732DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.30502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuen, L.10aEffects of Oil Palm Plantations on the Habitat Structure and Biota of Streams in Eastern Amazon  ap. 2081-2094.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOil palm plantations have expanded around the world, increasing concern about its pressure on deforestation rates and the homogenization of the landscape. In this context, the present study aimed to evaluate the impact of oil palm plantations on the physical characteristics of streams in Amazonia and their effects on Heteroptera, Odonata and Fish assemblages. A total of 23 streams were sampled, eight within fragments of primary forest, while 15 were in oil palm plantations. Data were collected on characteristics of the channel morphology, substrate, hydraulics, instream cover for aquatic organisms, riparian vegetation, human impacts and woody debris. Instream cover and proximity of human impacts were the variables that had the greatest effects on the physical structure of the streams, showing variation between streams of forest in pristine areas and oil palm plantations. Of the analyzed parameters, substrate, instream cover and woody debris influence the richness of Heteroptera, Odonata and Fish. The impact of oil palm plantations on local streams depended on the size of the plantations, and they cannot be considered an adequate substitute for lost habitats in efforts to preserve the physical habitat of Amazonian streams. Any type of conversion of the natural forest can have direct or indirect impacts on the dynamics and structure of these environments, with potentially negative consequences for their biodiversity. The maintenance of an adequate buffer zone of native riparian vegetation adjacent to the streams that flow through the plantations recommended, because this appears to be the principal factor determining the physical conditions of these streams.

Pure water and glass beads are chosen as the working media in a smooth copper tube. The results show that the particle addition may enhance the heat transfer of the thermosyphons under different evaporation section settings. The maximum reduction rate of the overall thermal resistance is 23.5% with a evaporation section length of 200 mm at solid holdup of 15% and input power of 300 W. The overall thermal resistances of the two-phase and three-phase thermosyphons decrease with the increase in evaporation section length. The upward movement of the evaporation section is beneficial to the heat transfer of the two-phase closed thermosyphon, but is not conducive to that of the three-phase closed thermosyphon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevaporation 3afluidized beds 3aglass 3aheat tolerance 3aheat transfer 3atechnology 0aHeat transfer enhancement 0aThree-phase closed thermosyphon 0aVariable evaporation section 0aOverall thermal resistance 0aGlass beads1 aShen, Yu1 aJing, Wenyue1 aQi, Guopeng1 aLiang, Xu1 aLi, Ruijia1 aLi, Xiulun0 tPowder technology.g2020 Aug., v. 373 p.569-580dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2020.07.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02054naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245009000207300002000297520080400317592002801121653001101149653002001160653002401180653002301204653002701227700002501254700001501279700002301294700001701317700001901334700002001353700001401373773019301387856007901580852000901659655001201668IND60517959920221122091303.0160406e20151006xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051795992DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.15163731122doi7 aPMC46034692pmcid7 a263925352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamburov, Atanas10aComprehensive assessment of cancer missense mutation clustering in protein structures  ap.

Here, we show that this approach can be extended to identify cancer genes based on clustering of mutations relative to the 3D structure of the protein product. By analyzing the PanCancer compendium of somatic mutations in nearly 5,000 tumors, we identified known cancer genes and previously unidentified candidates based on clustering of missense mutations in protein structures or at interfaces with binding partners. In addition, we found that 3D clustering is present in both oncoproteins and tumor suppressors—contrary to the view that such clustering is a hallmark of oncoproteins.  aPublisher supplied data 0acancer 0acancer genetics 0amutation clustering 0aprotein structures 0ainteraction interfaces1 aLawrence, Michael S.1 aPolak, Paz1 aLeshchiner, Ignaty1 aLage, Kasper1 aGolub, Todd R.1 aLander, Eric S.1 aGetz, Gad0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Oct. 6, v. 112, no. 40 p.E5486-E5495dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.15163731123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245010300154300001600257520163900273592002801912650001001940650001101950650001001961650001001971650001301981650001601994650002302010650001902033650001302052650001402065650001602079650001602095700001602111700002002127773012702147856007402274852000902348655001202357IND60638590620221120151528.0190430e20151215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063859062DNAL7 a10.1039/c5bm00350d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, A.10aElectric field-mediated growth of osteoblasts – the significant impact of dynamic flow of medium  ap. 136-144.  aThe endogenous electric field plays an important role in accomplishing various functions including communication with the brain and with different parts of the physiological system, wound healing, and cellular functions. Furthermore, the endogenous electric field can be modified using the external electric field to induce changes in cell functionality. Given that the cells grow in contact with the dynamic flow of blood and nutrients, the objective of the study is to elucidate the effect of media flow (dynamic conditions) on osteoblast functions at a pulsed DC (direct current) electric field of strength of 0.5–1 V cm⁻¹ and compared with the static conditions (no flow of media and in the presence of an electric field). The electric field provided a guiding cue to cells to move towards the cathode. An interesting aspect of the electric field was the migration of cells towards the cathode with the axis parallel to the direction of the electric field such that the lamellipodia was aligned. Furthermore, there was an absence of membrane blebbing or necrosis at the cathode. However, cell growth and expression of proteins (actin and vinculin) were higher than the anode. In contrast, at the anode, while the cells were healthy, the cell growth was less such that the expression of vinculin was relatively low together with less densely packed actin stress fibers. It is underscored that the biological functionality is favorably altered in the presence of an electrical field under dynamic conditions with a consequent effect on cell proliferation, growth, and expression level of prominent proteins, actin and vinculin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3aanodes 3ablood 3abrain 3acathodes 3acell growth 3acell proliferation 3aelectric field 3anecrosis 3anutrients 3aosteoblasts 3apseudopodia1 aNune, K.

Survival of hybrids in a recent contact zone between two large gull species  ap. 1248-1255.  aHaldane's rule predicts that particularly high fitness reduction should affect the heterogametic sex of interspecific hybrids. Despite the fact that hybridization is widespread in birds, survival of hybrid individuals is rarely addressed in studies of avian hybrid zones, possibly because of methodological constraints. Here, having applied capture–mark–recapture models to an extensive, 19‐year‐long data set on individually marked birds, we estimate annual survival rates of hybrid individuals in the hybrid zone between herring (Larus argentatus) and Caspian (Larus cachinnans) gulls. In both parental species, males have a slightly higher survival rate than females (model‐weighted mean ± SE: herring gull males 0.88 ± 0.01, females 0.87 ± 0.01, Caspian gull males 0.88 ± 0.01, females 0.87 ± 0.01). Hybrid males do not survive for a shorter time than nonhybrid ones (0.88 ± 0.01), whereas hybrid females have the lowest survival rate among all groups of individuals (0.83 ± 0.03). This translates to a shorter adult (reproductive) lifespan (on average by 1.7–1.8 years, i.e. ca 25%) compared with nonhybrid females. We conclude that, in line with Haldane's rule, the lower survival rate of female hybrids may contribute to selection against hybrids in this hybrid zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarus argentatus 3aadults 3abirds 3adata collection 3afemales 3aherring 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3alongevity 3amales 3asurvival rate1 aNowicki, P.1 aZagalska‐Neubauer, M.0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2014 June, v. 27, no. 6 p.1248-1255dBirkhäuserx1010-061X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jeb.124043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245016400209506011700373506007600490520110800566592002801674506003701702650002001739650001601759650001301775650002101788650001401809650002201823650001901845650001701864650000901881651002301890653000801913653003101921653002101952653002401973700002001997700001902017700002002036700001902056773012502075856008202200852000902282655001202291IND60773025120221207064453.0220523e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077302512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1134102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRinaldo, Dominique1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0408-144810aBrowning susceptibility of new hybrids of yam (Dioscorea alata) as related to their total phenolic content and their phenolic profile determined using LC-UV-MS  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn the French West Indies, to cope with the yam disease anthracnose, new hybrids were selected for their resistance to this disease. However, some of them have quality flaws. The new hybrids of Dioscorea alata exhibited contrasted susceptibility to browning in relation to their total phenolic content (r = 0.91). The detailed polyphenol profiles of “INRA15”, highly susceptible to browning, and of “Kabusah”, with moderate susceptibility to this flaw, were achieved by HPLC coupled to UV–Visible and mass spectrometry. For the first time, total procyanidins of yam were finely characterized and quantified using HPLC after phloroglucinolysis, revealing that those compounds are by far the main polyphenols in the two cultivars. Differences in terms of browning susceptibilities of the two cultivars are clearly explained by their contrasted polyphenol profiles: (i) absence versus presence of catechin which is a substrate of polyphenol oxidase (PPO). - (ii) significant differences in procyanidin levels and in their average degree of polymerization potentially involved in PPO inhibition.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDioscorea alata 3aanthracnose 3acatechin 3acatechol oxidase 3acultivars 3amass spectrometry 3apolymerization 3aprocyanidins 3ayams 3aFrench West Indies 0aYam 0aSusceptibility to browning 0aPhenolic profile 0aEnzymatic oxidation1 aSotin, Hélène1 aPétro, Dalila1 aLe-Bail, Gildas1 aGuyot, Sylvain0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 June 01, v. 162 p.113410-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1134103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100002200140245012200162300001600284500000900300520149700309592002801806650002001834650001101854650001401865650002101879650001101900650001101911650001701922650001601939650001601955700002001971700002501991700002402016700002302040700002002063700003502083700002802118773012902146852000902275856007702284655001202361IND4447131520221122035432.0191228e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444713152DNAL7 a10.2136/vzj2009.01592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanderborght, Jan10aWithin-Field Variability of Bare Soil Evaporation Derived from Eddy Covariance Measurements Special Section: Patterns  ap. 943-954.  aepub  aBare soil evaporation was measured with the eddy-covariance method at the Selhausen field site. The site has a distinct gradient in soil texture, with a considerably higher stone content at the upper part of the field. We investigated the effect of different soil properties in the upper and lower parts of the field on evaporation using eddy covariance (EC) measurements that were combined with a footprint model. Because only one EC station was available, simultaneous evaporation measurements from the two field parts were not available. Therefore, measurements were put into the context of meteorologic and soil hydrologic conditions. Meteorologic conditions were represented by the potential evaporation, i.e., the maximum evaporation that is determined by the energy available for evaporation. The influence of precipitation and soil hydrologic conditions on the actual evaporation rate was represented by a simple soil evaporation model. The amount of water that could be evaporated at the potential rate from the lower part of the field was found to be large and considerably larger than from the upper part of the field. The difference in evaporation led to threefold larger predicted percolation or runoff in the upper than the lower part of the field. Simulations using the Richards equation were able to reproduce the differences in evaporation between the lower and upper parts of the field and relate them to the different groundwater table depths in the two parts of the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeddy covariance 3aenergy 3aequations 3aevaporation rate 3amodels 3arunoff 3asoil texture 3avadose zone 3awater table1 aGraf, Alexander1 aSteenpass, Christian1 aScharnagl, Benedikt1 aProlingheuer, Nils1 aHerbst, Michael1 aFranssen, Harrie-Jan Hendricks1 aVereecken, H.q(Harry),0 tVadose zone journal.g2010 Nov., v. 9, no. 4 p.943-954dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2009.01593Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03539naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245014900206500001900355520203600374592002802410650002302438650005202461650001602513650001402529650003102543650001302574650001102587650002002598650001402618650001402632650001802646650002302664650001702687650002402704650001702728653001602745653001302761653001802774653002902792653002002821700001902841773011502860856008502975852000903060655001203069IND60704604920221118031142.0201125e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070460492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2020.1044712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNambou, Komi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3579-362410aDeciphering the co-adaptation of codon usage between respiratory coronaviruses and their human host uncovers candidate therapeutics for COVID-19  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused thousands of deaths worldwide and has become an urgent public health concern. The extraordinary interhuman transmission of this disease has urged scientists to examine the various facets of its pathogenic agent, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Herein, based on publicly available genomic data, we analyzed the codon usage co-adaptation profiles of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory coronaviruses (CoVs) with their human host, identified CoV-responsive human genes and their functional roles on the basis of both the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU)-based correlation of viral genes with human genes and differential gene expression analysis, and predicted potential drugs for COVID-19 treatment based on these genes. The relatively high codon adaptation index (CAI) values (>0.70) signposted the gene expressivity efficiency of CoVs in human. The ENc-GC3 plot indicated that SARS-CoV-2 genome was under strict selection pressure while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were under selection and mutational pressures. The RSCU-based correlation analysis indicated that the viral genomes shared similar codons with a panoply of human genes. The merging of RSCU-based correlation data and SARS-CoV-2-responsive differentially expressed genes allowed the identification of human genes potentially affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that these genes were enriched in biological processes and pathways related to host response to viral infection and immune response. Using the drug-gene interaction database, we screened a list of drugs that could target these genes as potential COVID-19 therapeutics. Our findings not only will contribute in vaccine development but also provide a useful set of drugs that could guide practitioners in strategical monitoring of COVID-19. We recommend practitioners to scrupulously screen this list of predicted drugs in order to authenticate those qualified for treating COVID-19 symptoms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3acodon usage 3adatabases 3agene expression regulation 3agenomics 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3ainfection 3apathogens 3apublic health 3aselection pressure 3atherapeutics 3avaccine development 3aviral genome 0aCoronavirus 0aCOVID-19 0aTranscriptome 0aVirus-host co-adaptation 0aTreatment drugs1 aAnakpa, Manawa0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2020 Nov., v. 85 p.104471-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.1044713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002400158245010100182300001800283520140000301592002801701650002701729650001401756650003201770650001401802650001201816650001201828650001201840650001801852650001101870650002501881700001501906700002601921700001401947700001801961700001701979773010401996856007302100852000902173655001202182IND50090258420150206000000.0150206e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009025842DNAL7 a248199642pmid7 a10.1111/jeb.123892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZabal‐Aguirre, M.10aWolbachia effects in natural populations of Chorthippus parallelus from the Pyrenean hybrid zone  ap. 1136-1148.  aWe evaluate for the first time the effect of Wolbachia infection, involving two different supergroups, on the structure and dynamics of the hybrid zone between two subspecies of Chorthippus parallelus (Orthoptera) in the Pyrenees. Wolbachia infection showed no effects on female fecundity or a slight increment in females infected by F supergroup, although in the last case it has to be well established. Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) is confirmed in crosses carried out in the field between individuals from a natural hybrid population. This CI, registered as the relative reduction in embryo production (sₕ), was of sₕ = 0.355 and sₕ = 0.286 in unidirectional crosses involving B and F supergroups, respectively. CI also occurred in bidirectional crosses (sₕ = 0.147) but with a weaker intensity. The transmission rates of the two Wolbachia strains (B and F) were estimated by the optimization of a theoretical model to reach the infection frequencies observed in certain population. To fit this scenario, both supergroups should present transmission rates close to 1. Further, we have simulated the infection dynamics, and hence, the capacity of Wolbachia to structure the population of the host insects and to affect to reproduction and genetic introgression in the hybrid zone. This represents a first example of the influence of Wolbachia in an insect natural hybrid zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChorthippus parallelus 3aWolbachia 3acytoplasmic incompatibility 3afecundity 3afemales 3ahybrids 3ainsects 3aintrogression 3amodels 3apopulation structure1 aArroyo, F.1 aGarcía‐Hurtado, J.1 aTorre, J.1 aHewitt, G.

However, the virulent form may be the etiology of pneumonia, meningitis, bacteremia, and other respiratory tract infections. Streptococcal diseases are preventable by vaccination; but currently available vaccines have some drawbacks, especially due to the high capsule variability of streptococci strains. Thus, an effective prevention strategy continues to be the focus of extensive research. In our work, several bioinformatics tools were used to identify immunogenic peptides from a selected pool of 46 conserved proteins from Streptococcus pneumoniae. In silico analysis showed that 10 proteins had epitopes with affinity for B and T lymphocytes, which were present in at least 26 different pathogens serotypes and were considered promiscuous. The multi-epitope protein, designated HC44, was designed based on these epitopes and specific linkers to improve stability and exposure to T lymphocytes. The recombinant HC44 protein was expressed in E.coli and Swiss-Webster mice were immunised by intraperitoneal injection. Immunisation with the multi-epitope HC44 protein resulted in the production of very high levels of IgG with title superior to 1/1.200.000. However, subtype IgG was highly unbalanced toward IgG1 and no protection was afforded after challenge with S.pneumoniae in a sepsis model. Thus, our strategy has been effective in constructing a highly antigenic protein but novel immunisation strategies should be investigated to reorient the immune system toward a protective response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3abacteremia 3abioinformatics 3acomputer simulation 3aepitopes 3aevolution 3agenetics 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aintraperitoneal injection 3ameningitis 3amodels 3apathogens 3apeptides 3apneumonia 3arespiratory system 3aserotypes 3asubunit vaccines 3avaccination 3avaccine development 3avirulence 0aReverse vaccinology 0aStructural vaccinology 0aMulti-epitope protein antigen1 ade Paula, Keila Gonçalves1 ade Oliveira, Bianca1 ados Santos, Janete Soares Coelho1 aCunha, Lucas Maciel1 aJunior, Moacyr Comar1 aJung, Lenice Roteia Cardoso1 aTaranto, Alex Gutterres1 ade Oliveira Lopes, Débora1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8559-85521 aLeclercq, Sophie Yvette1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0836-48050 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2020 Nov., v. 85 p.104473-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.1044733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100001300172245016400185300001600349520113700365592002801502650002201530650001101552650001701563650001601580650002001596650002301616650000701639650001501646650002001661650001301681650002701694650005201721650001801773650002001791650004301811650002801854650001301882650008201895700001701977700001401994700001802008700001502026700001802041773008302059856008902142852000902231655001202240IND4466438620221120032100.0141110e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446643862DNAL7 a214594042pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hui10aFormation of 2′-hydroxy-2,3′,4,5′-tetrabromodipheyl ether (2′-HO-BDE68) from 2,4-dibromophenol in aqueous solution under simulated sunlight irradiation  ap. 512-518.  aHydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (HO-PBDEs) have received significant attention due to their toxicities and universal presence in the environmental matrices. However, their origins are not fully understood. We explored the feasibility of the generation of HO-PBDEs through photochemical processes from bromophenol, a commonly detected pollutant with anthropogenic source in freshwater and natural source in the marine environment. The results showed that when 2,4-dibromophenol (2,4-diBP) was irradiated in aquatic solutions under simulated sunlight, significant amounts of 2′-hydroxy-2,3′,4,5′-tetrabromodipheyl ether (2′-HO-BDE68) were rapidly formed as the dimeric product of 2,4-diBP. The formation of 2′-HO-BDE68 intensified with the increase of light intensity and with the initial concentration increase of 2,4-diBP, whereas it weakened with an increase in pH. Moreover, Fe(III) and fulvic acid played important roles in the formation of 2′-HO-BDE68. This study provides important insight into a possible source of HO-PBDEs from bromophenols in natural aquatic systems through photochemical approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3aethers 3afulvic acids 3airradiation 3alight intensity 3amarine environment 3apH 3apollutants 3asolar radiation 3atoxicity 2aBenzopyransxchemistry 2aHalogenated Diphenyl Ethersxchemical synthesis 2aHydroxylation 2aIronxchemistry 2aPhenolsxchemistryxradiation effects. 2aPhotochemical Processes 2aSunlight 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemical synthesisxchemistryxradiation effects.1 aZhao, Huimin1 aQuan, Xie1 aZhang, Yaobin1 aChen, Shuo1 aZhao, Hongxia0 tChemosphere.g2011 July, v. 84, no. 4 p.512-518dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001700140245008700157300001800244500000900262520160700271592002801878650001601906650002401922650002501946650001501971650001501986650002302001650001502024650001602039650001302055700001502068700001802083700001802101700001602119700001802135773013102153852000902284856007702293655001202370IND4447132020221122031844.0191228e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444713202DNAL7 a10.2136/vzj2009.01732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBogena, H.R.10aPotential of Wireless Sensor Networks for Measuring Soil Water Content Variability  ap. 1002-1013.  aepub  aSoil water content (SWC) plays a key role in partitioning water and energy fluxes at the land surface and in controlling hydrologic fluxes such as groundwater recharge. Despite the importance of SWC, it is not yet measured in an operational way at larger scales. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of wireless sensor network technology for the near-real-time monitoring of SWC at the field and headwater catchment scales using the recently developed wireless sensor network SoilNet. The forest catchment Wüstebach (∼27 ha) was instrumented with 150 end devices and 600 EC-5 SWC sensors from the ECH₂O series by Decagon Devices. In the period between August and November 2009, more than six million SWC measurements were obtained. The observed spatial variability corresponded well with results from previous studies. The very low scattering in the plots of mean SWC against SWC variance indicates that the sensor network data provide a more accurate estimate of SWC variance than discontinuous data from measurement campaigns, due, e.g., to fixed sampling locations and permanently installed sensors. The spatial variability in SWC at the 50-cm depth was significantly lower than at 5 cm, indicating that the longer travel time to this depth reduced the spatial variability of SWC. Topographic features showed the strongest correlation with SWC during dry periods, indicating that the control of topography on the SWC pattern depended on the soil water status. Interpolation results indicated that the high sampling density allowed capture of the key patterns of SWC variation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy flow 3aforested watersheds 3agroundwater recharge 3amonitoring 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3atopography 3avadose zone 3avariance1 aHerbst, M.1 aHuisman, J.A.1 aRosenbaum, U.1 aWeuthen, A.1 aVereecken, H.0 tVadose zone journal.g2010 Nov., v. 9, no. 4 p.1002-1013dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2009.01733Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03333naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245008500173520106200258592002801320650003401348650002501382650001601407650001601423650002001439650002301459650001001482650003501492650001801527650002501545650002401570650001201594650001801606650002201624650000901646650001801655653003001673653001501703653002601718653002701744653002201771653002801793653000901821653002701830653001101857653002501868653000901893653002501902653001301927653002801940653001301968653002301981653002002004653002502024653001802049653002402067653002402091653002802115653002002143653002402163700002502187700002002212700002302232700005602255700006402311773012202375856008102497852000902578655001202587IND60670263720221120200641.0200121e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067026372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1086942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJimenez-Escobar, M.P.10aIn vitro and In vivo antioxidant properties of paprika carotenoids nanoemulsions  aThis study aimed to investigate the protective role of emulsions loaded with paprika oleoresin carotenoids on liver and serum of healthy rats.

Conventional (CE) and nano (NE) emulsions were prepared and characterized, showing particle size of 157.9 and 39.2 nm, respectively and a monodisperse-size distribution. Carotenoid concentration analyzed by the DPPH method (EC₅₀) were 347 and 359 μg/mL for CE and NE, respectively. Both emulsions and the surfactant alone (Tween 40) were orally administered to Wistar rats. The results obtained in this study suggests that carotenoid emulsions have a protective effect on liver due to an increase of antioxidant activity, without modifying the transaminases activity. However, when the surfactant was administered alone, a damage on the liver was observed. The damage observed indicates that it is necessary to analyze the appropriate surfactant when emulsions and nanoemulsions are designed.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood serum 3acarotenoids 3aenzyme activity 3alaboratory animals 3aliver 3amedian effective concentration 3ananoemulsions 3anonionic surfactants 3aoral administration 3apaprika 3aparticle size 3aprotective effect 3arats 3atransaminases 0aCarotenoids nanoemulsions 0aSurfactant 0aTransaminase activity 0aAntioxidant properties 0aPaprika oleoresin 0a(PubChem CID: 11980947) 0aDPPH 0a(PubChem CID: 2735032) 0aTrolox 0a(PubChem CID: 40634) 0aTPTZ 0a(PubChem CID: 77258) 0aTween 40 0a(PubChem CID: 92329579) 0aMethanol 0a(PubChem CID: 887) 0aFerric chloride 0a(PubChem CID: 24380) 0aPentobarbital 0a(PubChem CID: 4737) 0aSodium deoxycholate 0a(PubChem CID: 23668196) 0aSodium chloride 0a(PubChem CID: 5234)1 aPascual-Mathey, L.I.1 aBeristain, C.I.1 aFlores-Andrade, E.1 aJiménez, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5437-38121 aPascual-Pineda, L.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2737-282X0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Jan., v. 118 p.108694-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1086943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010100169520126500270592002801535650001701563650002201580650000901602650001901611650001601630650002201646650002501668650001201693650001101705650001301716650001701729650001001746650001501756650002501771650002001796651001001816653002601826653003801852653001901890653002201909653001701931700001801948700002201966700001901988700001402007700001802021700001702039700001702056700001602073773011302089856008602202852000902288655001202297IND60747432920221119215156.0220809e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074743292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1285722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Hong-Peng13aAn optimized design for zero liquid discharge from coal chemical industry: A case study in China  aZero liquid discharge (ZLD) is an efficient solution for the issue of global water scarcity.

In addition, the economic cost of different units for each scenario involved in treating CCI wastewater was calculated. The levelized cost of water (LCOW) reached 1.325 $/m³ when the salinity of input is 3000 mg/L. Furthermore, an environmental impact analysis was conducted on chemical, electricity, steam and solid waste for each technology in the ZLD system for treating CCI wastewater.

General computational approaches that do not require the assumptions of classical theory are therefore quite desirable. One such general approach is provided by the theory of absorbing Markov chains, which can be used to obtain exact results by directly analyzing population genetic Markov models, such as the classic bi-allelic Wright–Fisher model. Although these approaches are sometimes used, they are usually forgone in favor of simulation methods, due to the perception that they are too computationally burdensome. Here we show that, surprisingly, direct analysis of virtually any Markov chain model in population genetics can be made quite efficient by exploiting transition matrix sparsity and by solving restricted systems of linear equations, allowing a wide variety of exact calculations (within machine precision) to be easily and rapidly made on modern workstation computers. Results: We introduce Wright–Fisher Exact Solver (WFES), a fast and scalable method for direct analysis of Markov chain models in population genetics. WFES can rapidly solve for both long-term and transient behaviours including fixation and extinction probabilities, expected times to fixation or extinction, sojourn times, expected allele age and variance, and others. Our implementation requires only seconds to minutes of runtime on modern workstations and scales to biological population sizes ranging from humans to model organisms.

Agri-environment schemes (AES) have been introduced in many countries as an attempt to counteract the negative effects of intensive agriculture by providing financial incentives for farmers to adopt environmentally-sensitive agricultural practices. We surveyed 18 pairs of AES and conventionally-managed farms in central Scotland (United Kingdom) to evaluate the effects of specific AES management prescriptions (field margins, hedgerows, species-rich grasslands and water margins) on foraging bats and nocturnal insects. In addition, we assessed the importance of habitat in the wider landscape at several spatial scales on foraging bats and their insect prey. Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus were the most commonly recorded species, accounting for 98% of total bat activity levels. Overall levels of bat activity and the abundance of their insect prey (mainly Diptera and Trichoptera) were lower (by 40–50%) on farms participating in AES than on non-participating farms. Differences in insect abundance were also significant when we compared specific AES management prescriptions with equivalent conventionally-managed features. The surrounding landscape influenced bat activity; fragmentation metrics related to woodland configuration were the most important landscape characteristics influencing bat activity levels. However, the two Pipistrelle species responded differently to the surrounding landscape, P. pipistrellus being strongly influenced by the landscape at large scales (e.g. within 2km of the monitoring site) and P. pygmaeus being most influenced by the landscape at smaller scales (within 500m of the monitoring site). Insect abundance was positively affected by the percentage cover of semi-natural environment within 500m of trapping sites. We suggest that the implementation of the four common AES management prescriptions assessed in this study does not benefit Pipistrelle bats nor other bat species foraging on similar prey. Such species may respond more positively to a landscape-scale management approach focused mainly on the creation and management of woodland.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiptera 3aPipistrellus pipistrellus 3aTrichoptera 3abiodiversity 3aeconomic incentives 3aedge effects 3afarmers 3afarms 3aforaging 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3ainsects 3alandscapes 3atrapping 3awoodlands 3aScotland1 aGoulson, Dave1 aPark, Kirsty J.0 tBiological conservation.g2011 Sept., v. 144, no. 9 p.2233-2246dElsevier Ltdx0006-32077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2011.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03681naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003800153245012300191300001600314520229600330592002802626650001802654650001102672650002502683650001002708650001702718650001402735650001502749651001202764651002202776651001002798653003502808653002502843653003102868653002402899653002702923653002702950700001902977700001902996700002003015773010303035856008803138852000903226655001203235IND60592947020221120130846.0210201e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059294702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.01.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-Rivarés, Francisco Javier10aTemporal aspects of genetic stratigraphic units in continental sedimentary basins: Examples from the Ebro basin, Spain  ap. 136-153.  aThe utility of genetic stratigraphy lies with the fundamental relationship between genetic stratigraphic units and correlative intervals of geologic time. While high-resolution studies may reveal varying degrees of diachroneity that are associated with their bounding surfaces, genetic stratigraphic units are generally viewed as chronostratigraphic in nature, representing specific periods of basin fill. Despite the vast literature on basin analysis, an evaluation of the temporal character of the boundaries between genetic stratigraphic units, particularly in cases where they are conformable, has not yet been undertaken. The Cenozoic Ebro basin is a foreland basin on the north-eastern Iberian Peninsula that provides a case for assessing the temporal character of the boundaries between genetic stratigraphic units. These units are termed “tecto-sedimentary units”, following the method of tecto-sedimentary analysis that is used in some continental basins. In the Ebro basin tecto-sedimentary analysis is based on direct field observations. In this work, magnetostratigraphic data from four tecto-sedimentary units (units T4 to T7) that span rocks of lower and middle Miocene age (ca. 1000 m thick) in the central and western areas of the basin are analysed. The study area contains alluvial, fluvial and lacustrine deposits that were sourced from Pyrenean and Iberian areas, whose catchments were structured during the collision of Iberia and Eurasia. New magnetostratigraphic data from this study and previously published magnetostratigraphic data enable us to determine the ages of these tecto-sedimentary unit boundaries throughout a 200-km-long, east–west transect that extends from the basin centre to the southwestern margin. The results indicate that the diachrony of the three boundaries between the Miocene tecto-sedimentary units through the central Ebro basin is less than 0.3 Ma where they are conformable. This low degree of diachroneity may be attributed to the effects of allogenic, largely tectonic processes that operate in the catchment areas and methodological inaccuracies. These results provide empirical support to the idea that genetic stratigraphic units are bounded by surfaces that exhibit low amounts of diachroneity where they are conformities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiocene epoch 3abasins 3alacustrine sediments 3arocks 3astratigraphy 3atectonics 3awatersheds 3aEurasia 3aIberian Peninsula 3aSpain 0aContinental sedimentary basins 0aGenetic stratigraphy 0aTecto-sedimentary analysis 0aMagnetostratigraphy 0aConformable boundaries 0aDegree of diachroneity1 aArenas, Concha1 aPardo, Gonzalo1 aGarcés, Miguel0 tEarth-science reviews.g2018 Mar., v. 178 p.136-153dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.01.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02940naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010200158300002000260520164100280592002801921650001301949650001101962650001901973650001301992650001802005650001302023650002902036650001902065650003402084700001502118700001702133700001902150700001402169700001602183700001602199700002002215700001802235700002502253773014502278856007402423852000902497655001202506IND60642614620221119101407.0190507e20170926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064261462DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta05171a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNikolaeva, D.10aPoly(vinylbenzyl chloride)-based poly(ionic liquids) as membranes for CO₂ capture from flue gas  ap. 19808-19818.  aOver the last decade, membrane-based CO₂ capture using ionic liquids (ILs) has been demonstrated as a promising technology. However, elaborative synthesis of monomers and long-term instability of IL-based composite membranes have so far limited their industrial relevance. In this paper, novel membranes are introduced for CO₂ separation using poly(ionic liquids) (PILs) based on polyvinylbenzyl chloride (PVBC). Three PIL-based membranes were prepared as thin-film composites (TFC) by solvent casting with subsequent sealing. They were tested for the CO₂ removal from synthetic flue gas. An ammonium-derivatised PVBC-analogue was prepared as a first PIL-type by polymerisation of an IL monomer, whereas two other PILs, respectively with hydroxyethyl ammonium and pyrrolidinium cations, were obtained using a modification of commercial PVBC. Introduction of bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Tf₂N) anions was accomplished by metathesis. A thorough characterisation of the material structure, composition, membrane morphology and gas separation properties demonstrates that the presence of hydroxyl groups in the polycation enhanced the interaction with CO₂ molecules. The mixed-gas selectivity increases with the higher positive charge on the cation species (hydroxyethyl-dimethylammonium > trimethylammonium > pyrrolidinium). More importantly, experiments performed in humidified conditions particularly revealed a doubled CO₂ permeance and a 20–30% increased selectivity in comparison to dry conditions. These developments are spurring the application of PIL-based TFC membranes for CO₂ capture from flue gas streams.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aanions 3acarbon dioxide 3aflue gas 3aionic liquids 3amoieties 3aorganochlorine compounds 3apolymerization 3athin film composite membranes1 aAzcune, I.1 aSheridan, E.1 aSandru, Marius1 aGenua, A.1 aTanczyk, M.1 aJaschik, M.1 aWarmuzinski, K.1 aJansen, J.

However, the main challenge is to find applications where recycled plastic can successfully provide the same functionality as the replaced virgin plastic. Particularly, the incorporation of recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) to polyethylene (PE) pipe grade resins is a great challenge that is not currently being implemented in the manufacture of pressure pipes. In this study, life cycle assessment (LCA) is applied to quantitatively evaluate the potential environmental impacts from producing PE pipe grade resins from recycled HDPE blended with virgin HDPE. The LCA involves four HDPE waste feedstocks (crates/caps, packaging/detergency bottles, post-consumer industrial containers, and automobile fuel tanks) and two PE pipe grades (PE80 and PE100). Moreover, different allocation approaches that affect the LCA of plastic recycling, namely the cut-off approach and the Circular Footprint Formula, were investigated. The recycled content was found to largely determine the LCA results. In this regard, the production of PE80 quality from the pure HDPE waste feedstocks (such as automobile fuel tanks and post-consumer industrial containers) allows a higher recycled content, thus resulting in lower impacts. Compared with a 100 % virgin resin, these two scenarios show 80 % and 53 % less carbon footprint if the waste feedstock is considered burdens free (cut-off allocation). These percentages however decrease to 32 % and 20 % if the impacts and benefits are shared according to the Circular Footprint Formula. These trends were similarly observed for most of the impact categories evaluated, such as, acidification and fossil resources. The robustness of these results is supported by error propagation via Monte Carlo simulation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMonte Carlo method 3aacidification 3aautomobiles 3acarbon footprint 3afeedstocks 3afossils 3agreenhouse gases 3alandfills 3alife cycle assessment 3amanufacturing 3apolyethylene 3arecycled plastic 0aCarbon footprint 0aCircular economy 0aHigh-density polyethylene (HDPE) 0aLife cycle assessment 0aPlastic pipe 0aPlastic recycling1 aJuan, Rafael1 aMartin-Gamboa, Mario1 aDominguez, Carlos,1 aGarcía-Muñoz, Rafael A.1 aDufour, Javier0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 319 p.128580-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1285803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03709naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005800142245013800200300002000338520116600358592002801524596009101552596010601643596010001749596009101849596010101940596010102041596009102142596006702233596007202300596013002372596010202502650001602604650001502620650002202635650001902657650001302676700002002689700002902709700006902738700006502807700006102872700005802933773015002991856007703141852000903218655001203227IND60793375420220914000000.0220914e20220902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079337542DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.2c063772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLabella, Jorge1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5665-277810aPreparation, Supramolecular Organization, and On-Surface Reactivity of Enantiopure Subphthalocyanines: From Bulk to 2D-Polymerization  ap. 16579-16587.  aThe development of chiral materials is severely limited by the challenge to achieve enantiopure derivatives with both configurational stability and good optoelectronic properties. Herein we demonstrate that enantiopure subphthalocyanines (SubPcs) fulfill such demanding requirements and bear the prospect of becoming components of chiral technologies. Particularly, we describe the synthesis of enantiopure SubPcs and assess the impact of chirality on aspects as fundamental as the supramolecular organization, the behavior in contact with metallic surfaces, and the on-surface reactivity and polymerization. We find that enantiopure SubPcs remarkably tend to organize in columnar polar assemblies at the solid state and highly ordered chiral superstructures on Au(111) surfaces. At the metal interface, such SubPcs are singled out by scanning tunneling microscopy. DFT calculations suggest that SubPcs undergo a bowl-to-bowl inversion that was shown to be dependent on the axial substituent. Finally, we polymerize by means of on-surface synthesis a highly regular 2D, porous and chiral, π-extended polymer that paves the way to future nanodevice fabrication.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcMinisterio de Educaci??n, Cultura y Deportedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003176  aAEI/10.13039/501100011033cMinisterio de Ciencia e Innovaci??ndhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004837  aMAT2016-78293-C6-R6cMinisterio de Ciencia e Innovaci??ndhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004837  aPID2019-c, Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci??ndhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004837  aPID2019-110091GB-I00cMinisterio de Ciencia e Innovaci??ndhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004837  aPID2020-116490GB-I00cMinisterio de Ciencia e Innovaci??ndhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004837  aRED2018-c, Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci??ndhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004837  aNAcEuropean Commissiondhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100008530  aE12-20RcGobierno de Arag??ndhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100010067  aSEV2016-0686cMinisterio de Econom??a, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de Espa??adhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100010198  aCEX2018-000805-McMinisterio de Econom??a y Competitividaddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100011033 3aenantiomers 3amicroscopy 3aoptical isomerism 3apolymerization 3apolymers1 aLavarda, Giulia1 aHernández-López, Leyre1 aAguilar-Galindo, Fernando1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2751-55921 aDíaz-Tendero, Sergio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6253-63431 aLobo-Checa, Jorge1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2698-25431 aTorres, Tomas,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9335-69350 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2022 Sept. 02, v. 144, no. 36 p.16579-16587dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c063773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02250naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245010000152300002000252520101900272592002801291650001201319650001401331650001101345650001401356650002801370650002101398650001701419650002401436650000901460650001101469650001301480650000701493650001301500700001201513700001301525700001601538700001701554700001801571773014401589856007401733852000901807655001201816IND60642614820221119101422.0190507e20170829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064261482DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta05188c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qun10aBromine and nitrogen co-doped tungsten nanoarrays to enable hydrogen evolution at all pH values  ap. 17856-17861.  aIntroducing bromine and nitrogen into metallic tungsten nanoarrays produces a W/BrN electrocatalyst with high performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at all pH ranges. Unlike the acid soluble metals (such as Fe, Co, Ni), the resultant W/BrN has successfully inherited the excellent corrosion resistance from pure metallic W, particularly in proton exchange membrane compatible acid electrolytes. However, more importantly, the W/BrN develops some outstanding electrochemical properties, such as enhanced electrical conductivity, optimized electronic properties, and large turnover frequency (TOF), after codoping with Br and N. Hence, the HER performance of W/BrN was higher by several orders of magnitude in current density than that of pure metallic W. To attain current density of 10 mA cm⁻², the W/BrN only needs overpotentials of 148, 190 and 94 mV in acidic, neutral and alkaline conditions, respectively. In addition, we investigated the long-term stability of W/BrN in three electrolytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abromine 3acatalysts 3acobalt 3acorrosion 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3ahydrogen production 3airon 3anickel 3anitrogen 3apH 3atungsten1 aHan, Ce1 aMa, Xiao1 aWang, Dewen1 aXing, Zhicai1 aYang, Xiurong0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 Aug. 29, v. 5, no. 34 p.17856-17861dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta05188c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03801naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002800153245008600181300001300267520212600280592002802406650002502434650001702459650002202476650002202498650002002520650002502540650002602565650001102591650001902602650000902621650001302630650001702643650001102660650001902671650001102690650001502701650002002716650001302736650001102749650001102760650001602771650002202787650001602809650001902825650001502844653001602859653002002875653001102895653001102906653001202917653001402929700002202943700002502965773010002990856008803090852000903178655001203187IND60592947520221120130737.0210201e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059294752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2017.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLenton, Timq(Timothy),10aCOPSE reloaded: An improved model of biogeochemical cycling over Phanerozoic time  ap. 1-28.  aThe ‘COPSE’ (Carbon, Oxygen, Phosphorus, Sulphur and Evolution) biogeochemical model predicts the coupled histories and controls on atmospheric O₂, CO₂ and ocean composition over Phanerozoic time. The forwards modelling approach utilized in COPSE makes it a useful tool for testing mechanistic hypotheses against geochemical data and it has been extended and altered a number of times since being published in 2004. Here we undertake a wholesale revision of the model, incorporating: (1) elaboration and updating of the external forcing factors; (2) improved representation of existing processes, including plant effects on weathering and ocean anoxia; (3) inclusion of additional processes and tracers, including seafloor weathering, volcanic rock weathering and ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr; (4) updating of the present-day baseline fluxes; and (5) a more efficient and robust numerical scheme. A key aim is to explore how sensitive predictions of atmospheric CO₂, O₂ and ocean composition are to model updates and ongoing uncertainties. The revised model reasonably captures the long-term trends in Phanerozoic geochemical proxies for atmospheric pCO₂, pO₂, ocean [SO₄], carbonate δ¹³C, sulphate δ³⁴S and carbonate ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr. It predicts a two-phase drawdown of atmospheric CO₂ with the rise of land plants and associated cooling phases in the Late Ordovician and Devonian-early Carboniferous, followed by broad peaks of atmospheric CO₂ and temperature in the Triassic and mid-Cretaceous – although some of the structure in the CO₂ proxy record is missed. The model robustly predicts a mid-Paleozoic oxygenation event due to the earliest land plants, with O₂ rising from ~5% to >17% of the atmosphere and oxygenating the ocean. Thereafter, atmospheric O₂ is effectively regulated with remaining fluctuations being a Carboniferous–Permian O₂ peak ~26% linked to burial of terrestrial organic matter in coal swamps, a Triassic–Jurassic O₂ minimum ~21% linked to low uplift, a Cretaceous O₂ peak ~26% linked to high degassing and weathering fluxes, and a Cenozoic O₂ decline.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarboniferous period 3aCenozoic era 3aCretaceous period 3aOrdovician period 3aTriassic period 3aanaerobic conditions 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3adrawdown 3aembryophytes 3amodels 3aorganic matter 3aoxygen 3aprediction 3astable isotopes 3asulfates 3asulfur 3aswamps 3atemperature 3atracer techniques 3auncertainty 3avolcanic rocks 3aweathering 0aPhanerozoic 0aBiogeochemistry 0aCarbon 0aOxygen 0aClimate 0aModelling1 aDaines, Stuart J.1 aMills, Benjamin J.W.0 tEarth-science reviews.g2018 Mar., v. 178 p.1-28dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2017.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03228naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245006300172520191000235592002802145650001502173650001802188650001502206650002502221650001802246650001802264650001802282650001702300650001202317650001002329650001502339650001102354650001102365650002002376650001102396653001302407653003502420653002902455653002102484653002202505700002002527700001802547773009902565856008502664852000902749655001202758IND60704606020221118031159.0201024e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070460602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funeco.2020.1009632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, Daniel C.13aAn agent-based model of the foraging ascomycete hypothesis  aMost trees host hundreds of species of fungi asymptomatically in their internal tissues, known collectively as fungal endophytes. The Foraging Ascomycete (FA) hypothesis proposed that some fungal endophytes inhabit the internal leaf tissue of forest trees in order to enhance dispersal to substrates on the forest floor, by using leaves as vectors and as refugia during periods of environmental stress. This dispersal strategy has recently been termed viaphytism and is now thought to apply to fungal groups beyond ascomycetes. Viaphytism implies that many fungi may be in continuous and cyclical flux between life stages as endophytes in the forest canopy and as wood-decomposing fungi on the forest floor. This cycle may represent a very common and previously-ignored process in the ecology of forests, with implications for forest health. The ecological consequences of the viaphyte lifestyle are complex, so we constructed an agent-based model to explore it. Our model is intended to serve as both an explicit conceptual explanation of viaphytism, and as an exploration of the conditions in which a strategy of endophytism accompanied by leaf dispersal may be advantageous for fungi. In a scenario of a viaphytic fungal species on a model forest landscape, without fungal competitors, viaphytism is predicted to be a plausible alternative to dispersal to substrates by spores alone, allowing the fungus to persist reliably in the landscape. In a scenario that allows competition from aggressively dispersed non-viaphytic fungi, the model predicts some competitive benefits to fungal dispersal via leaves. However, these benefits are conditional, requiring sufficient retention through time of endophyte infections by host trees, and sufficient host trees in the landscape. In the model, loss of these fungal populations can result from increased local disturbances of forest canopy, and deforestation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscomycota 3adeforestation 3aendophytes 3aenvironmental impact 3aforest canopy 3aforest health 3aforest litter 3aforest trees 3aforests 3afungi 3alandscapes 3aleaves 3amodels 3arefuge habitats 3aspores 0aViaphyte 0aForaging ascomycete hypothesis 0aFungal foliar endophytes 0aPlant microbiome 0aAgent-based model1 aVandegrift, Roo1 aRoy, Bitty A.0 tFungal ecology.g2020 Oct., v. 47 p.100963-dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000080x1754-50487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funeco.2020.1009633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245015500166300001600321520162500337592002801962650002701990650004402017650001202061650001302073650001302086650004102099650001802140650001802158650003102176650001402207650001602221650001002237650001402247650001802261651001002279653002702289653002602316653001202342653001202354653000902366700001502375773012502390856008302515852000902598655001202607IND60581530620221118132755.0181012e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058153062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2017.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aR., Sakthivel10aInfluence of temperature on yield, composition and properties of the sub-fractions derived from slow pyrolysis of Calophyllum inophyllum de-oiled cake  ap. 159-169.  aThis study aims to investigate the effects of temperature on the yield and properties of the subfractions derived from the pyrolysis of seed cakes of Calophyllum inophyllum. The seed cake of Calophyllum inophyllum, a large evergreen tree found in southern coastal belts of India, was Pyrolysed in three different temperatures of 450°C, 500°C and 550°C in a fixed bed batch type reactor at a constant heating rate of 30°C/minute and average particle size of 1.44mm. The sub fractions were characterized by analytical techniques like FTIR, GC–MS and GC along with physicochemical characterization using ASTM D7544 standard. The highest yield of bio-oil was observed in the pyrolysis temperature of 500°C above which the gas yield increases due to secondary cracking of volatiles. Major changes in FTIR spectra and peak area of GC–MS were observed for the products derived in three different temperature conditions. Proximate and ultimate analysis showed the significant changes in the composition of char obtained at various temperatures. It was observed that H/C and O/C ratio of biochar decreased with increase in operating temperature. Among the physicochemical of bio-oil, kinematic viscosity decreased by 21.32% as the pyrolysis temperature was increased from 450°C to 550°C whereas water content increased by 19.73% in the same temperature range. Meanwhile, other properties like calorific value, density and cetane number showed minor variations for the bio-oil obtained at dissimilar temperatures. The results proved that the pyrolysis temperature affects the properties of the products in a wide range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalophyllum inophyllum 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiochar 3abiofuels 3acracking 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aoilseed cakes 3aparticle size 3aphysicochemical properties 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3atrees 3aviscosity 3awater content 3aIndia 0aCalophyllum inophyllum 0aPyrolysis temperature 0aGC–MS 0aBio-oil 0aFTIR1 aK., Ramesh0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2017 Sept., v. 127 p.159-169dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2017.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011200167500001900279520098400298592002801282650003301310650001601343650001001359650001601369650002401385650001201409650001801421650001601439650001701455650002301472650001001495650000901505650001701514650001301531650002101544653001201565653001001577653001201587653003001599653000901629700001801638700001501656700001701671700001901688700001601707700001101723700001901734700002101753773011201774856008201886852000901968655001201977IND60704606120221118031058.0201108e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070460612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2020.1041102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Chen-Cuang10aNative polypeptide vglycin prevents nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice by activating the AMPK pathway  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common liver diseases worldwide, and it has no effective treatment. We previously reported that the native polypeptide vglycin (purified from soybean) has a beneficial role in regulating glucose homeostasis in diabetic rats. In this study, we investigated the preventive effects of vglycin and possible mechanisms of action in hepatic steatosis using a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mouse model. The results revealed that vglycin decreased the body weight, liver weight, Lee’s index, and plasma triglyceride level in HFD-fed C57BL/6J mice. Furthermore, it prevented liver injury, inflammation and insulin resistance by inhibiting fat accumulation in liver. These beneficial effects of vglycin are probably attributable to the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and the down-regulation of fatty acid synthase (FAS). Therefore, vglycin holds promise as an oral drug for the prevention of NAFLD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3abody weight 3adrugs 3afatty liver 3afatty-acid synthase 3aglucose 3ahigh fat diet 3ahomeostasis 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3aliver 3amice 3apolypeptides 3asoybeans 3atriacylglycerols 0aVglycin 0aNAFLD 0aObesity 0aMitochondrial dysfunction 0aAMPK1 aTong, Yu-Xing1 aJiang, Hua1 aYang, Dan-Ru1 aZhang, Xue-Jun1 aZhang, Ping1 aSu, Li1 aZhao, Yan-Ying1 aChen, Zheng-Wang0 tJournal of functional foods.g2020 Oct., v. 73 p.104110-dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2020.1041103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03641naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245012400168300001800292520218800310592002802498650002202526650000802548650002102556650001002577650001702587650003002604650001902634650001102653650001302664650003302677650003202710650002202742650003102764700002902795700002602824700002602850700002602876700002302902700001802925700002802943773012102971856008203092852000903174655001203183IND60565663620170926000000.0170325e20170323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056566362DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b116232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeter, Sébastien10aChimeric Autofluorescent Proteins as Photophysical Model System for Multicolor Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation  ap. 2407-2419.  aThe yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) is frequently used in a protein complementation assay called bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), and is employed to visualize protein–protein interactions. In this analysis, two different, nonfluorescent fragments of YFP are genetically attached to proteins of interest. Upon interaction of these proteins, the YFP fragments are brought into proximity close enough to reconstitute their original structure, enabling fluorescence. BiFC allows for a straightforward readout of protein–protein interactions and furthermore facilitates their functional investigation by in vivo imaging. Furthermore, it has been observed that the available color range in BiFC can be extended upon complementing fragments of different proteins that are, like YFP, derived from the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein, thereby allowing for a multiplexed investigation of protein–protein interactions. Some spectral characteristics of “multicolor” BiFC (mcBiFC) complexes have been reported before; however, no in-depth analysis has been performed yet. Therefore, little is known about the photophysical characteristics of these mcBiFC complexes because a proper characterization essentially relies on in vitro data. This is particularly difficult for fragments of autofluorescent proteins (AFPs) because they show a very strong tendency to form supramolecular aggregates which precipitate ex vivo. In this study, this intrinsic difficulty is overcome by directly fusing the coding DNA of different AFP fragments. Translation of the genetic sequence in Escherichia coli leads to fully functional, highly soluble fluorescent proteins with distinct properties. On the basis of their construction, they are designated chimeric AFPs, or BiFC chimeras, here. Comparison of their spectral characteristics with experimental in vivo BiFC data confirmed the utility of the chimeric proteins as a BiFC model system. In this study, nine different chimeras were thoroughly analyzed at both the ensemble and the single-molecular level. The data indicates that mutations believed to be photophysically silent significantly alter the properties of AFPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAequorea victoria 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3acolor 3afluorescence 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3amutation 3aprotein-protein interactions 3arecombinant fusion proteins 3aspectral analysis 3ayellow fluorescent protein1 aOven-Krockhaus, Sven zur1 aVeerabagu, Manikandan1 aRodado, Virtudes Mira1 aBerendzen, Kenneth W.1 aMeixner, Alfred J.1 aHarter, Klaus1 aSchleifenbaum, Frank E.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 Mar. 23, v. 121, no. 11 p.2407-2419dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.6b116233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245012500175300001800300520104600318592002801364650001401392650001901406650001901425650001301444650001901457650000901476650001901485650001301504650002001517650002501537650002501562700001801587700006601605700002001671773016101691856008301852852000901935655001201944IND60743387120221119033628.0220517e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074338712DNAL7 a10.1007/s00477-020-01912-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyễn, Ngọc Sơn,10aDeriving high spatiotemporal rainfall information over Singapore through dynamic-stochastic modelling using ‘HiDRUS’  ap. 1453-1462.  aThe study of climate change adaptation plans for drainage infrastructure in a small country as that of Singapore, rainfall projections on the time scale of minutes and on the spatial scales of 1 km are deemed appropriate In this paper, we introduce an application of radar-based stochastic downscaling for rainfall projections at high temporal and spatial resolutions. The input for stochastic model is derived from a Regional Climate Model. The sub-hourly extreme rainfall intensity derived from stochastic model outputs was validated against observed rain-gauge data over the historical period. Considering the advantage in computational efficiency of the stochastic downscaling method, thousand scenarios of rainfall projections at very high temporal and spatial resolution were generated. The implication of this approach is that, from these stochastically downscaled time series of rainfall, it is possible to study future sub-hourly extreme rainfall intensities which would be useful to address issue of flash floods/drainage systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSingapore 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3adrainage 3ainfrastructure 3arain 3arain intensity 3aresearch 3arisk assessment 3astochastic processes 3atime series analysis1 aLiu, Jiandong1 aRaghavan, Srivatsan V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8008-02951 aLiong, Shie-Yui0 tStochastic environmental research and risk assessment.g2021 July, v. 35, no. 7 p.1453-1462dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4308428x1436-32407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-020-01912-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245009000172300001600262520173800278592002802016650001602044650001502060650001102075650002002086650001702106650000902123650001202132650001402144650001102158650001702169650001602186700002502202773011302227856008202340990002302422852000902445655001202454IND60095153220221122041447.0141104e20110515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009515322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.epsl.2011.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCottrell, Elizabeth14aThe oxidation state of Fe in MORB glasses and the oxygen fugacity of the upper mantle  ap. 270-282.  aMicro-analytical determination of Fe³⁺/∑Fe ratios in mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) glasses using micro X-ray absorption near edge structure (μ-XANES) spectroscopy reveals a substantially more oxidized upper mantle than determined by previous studies. Here, we show that global MORBs yield average Fe³⁺/∑Fe ratios of 0.16±0.01 (n=103), which trace back to primary MORB melts equilibrated at the conditions of the quartz–fayalite–magnetite (QFM) buffer. Our results necessitate an upward revision of the Fe³⁺/∑Fe ratios of MORBs, mantle oxygen fugacity, and the ferric iron content of the mantle relative to previous wet chemical determinations. We show that only 0.01 (absolute, or <10%) of the difference between Fe³⁺/∑Fe ratios determined by micro-colorimety and XANES can be attributed to the Mössbauer-based XANES calibration. The difference must instead derive from a bias between micro-colorimetry performed on experimental vs. natural basalts. Co-variations of Fe³⁺/∑Fe ratios in global MORB with indices of low-pressure fractional crystallization are consistent with Fe³⁺ behaving incompatibly in shallow MORB magma chambers. MORB Fe³⁺/∑Fe ratios do not, however, vary with indices of the extent of mantle melting (e.g., Na₂O(8)) or water concentration. We offer two hypotheses to explain these observations: The bulk partition coefficient of Fe³⁺ may be higher during peridotite melting than previously thought, and may vary with temperature, or redox exchange between sulfide and sulfate species could buffer mantle melting at ~QFM. Both explanations, in combination with the measured MORB Fe³⁺/∑Fe ratios, point to a fertile MORB source with greater than 0.3wt.% Fe₂O₃.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aabsorption 3abasalt 3acrystallization 3aferric oxide 3airon 3amelting 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature1 aKelley, Katherine A.0 tEarth and planetary science letters.g2011 May 15, v. 305, no. 3-4 p.270-282dElsevier B.V.x0012-821X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2011.03.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02148naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245013500165300001800300520100400318592002801322650001601350650001401366650003801380650000901418650002101427650002301448650001901471650003301490650001601523700002201539700002501561773012101586856008201707852000901789655001201798IND60565663720221119035407.0170325e20170323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056566372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b121012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUsma, Cesar
L.10aLyotropic Lamellar Structures of a Long-Chain Imidazolium and Their Application as Nanoreactors for X-ray-Initiated Polymerization  ap. 2502-2510.  aThe lyotropic behavior of the ternary system formed by 1-tetradecyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, 1-decanol, and water is investigated. A lamellar mesophase is formed for a wide range of compositions and is characterized by polarized optical microscopy, low-temperature scanning electron microscopy, small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering with synchrotron radiation, and differential scanning calorimetry. This phase presents onionlike structures. Two lamellar structures are formed: an Lα mesophase between 25 and 50 °C, with an isobaric thermal expansivity of the bilayer thickness of −3.2 × 10–³ K–¹, and a lamellar gel phase, when the temperature decreases below 25 °C. This new medium is employed to perform in situ X-ray-initiated polymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide. When the monomer is incorporated in the lamellar structure, it is distributed between the water layer and bilayer interface and its polymerization can be followed by variations in the diffractograms with time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3achlorides 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3agels 3alight microscopy 3aphysical chemistry 3apolymerization 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature1 aPacios, Isabel E.1 aRenamayor, Carmen S.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 Mar. 23, v. 121, no. 11 p.2502-2510dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.6b121013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010200166300001600268520156000284592002801844650001501872650001201887650001201899650002001911650001001931650001601941650001901957650002801976650001202004650000902016650001002025650001102035650000902046650001102055650002102066650001302087700001902100700001802119700002702137700001902164700001902183700001802202700002202220700002402242700002402266773010502290856008102395852000902476655001202485IND60572826920221120024901.0170718e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057282692DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-016-0883-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAktar, Sharmin10aIndividual and Combined Effects of Arsenic and Lead on Behavioral and Biochemical Changes in Mice  ap. 288-296.  aArsenic (As) toxicity has caused an environmental tragedy affecting millions of people in the world. Little is known about the toxic effects of As on neurobehavioral and biochemical changes in vivo. Along this line of metal toxicity, co-exposure of lead (Pb) could aggravate the situation in the host. The present study was designed to explore the combined effects of As and Pb on behavioral changes like anxiety, spatial memory and learning impairment, and blood indices related to organ dysfunction. Exposure of mice to As (10 mg/kg body weight), Pb (10 mg/kg body weight), and As + Pb via drinking water significantly decreased the time spent exploring the open arms while it increased the time spent in the closed arms compared to control mice in the elevated plus maze. The mean latency time of the control group to find the platform decreased significantly during the learning for 7 days compared to all three treated groups in the Morris water maze test, and the As-exposed group spent significantly less time in the desired quadrant as compared to the control group in the probe trial. Both metals posed an anxiety-like behavior and deficits in spatial memory and learning, and also altered blood indices related to liver and kidney dysfunction, and a combined exposure of these metals inhibited the individual accumulation of As and Pb. Taken together, these data suggest that As has more toxic effects on neurobehavioral and biochemical changes than Pb, and there may be antagonism in the effects and accumulation between these two toxicants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonism 3aanxiety 3aarsenic 3abehavior change 3ablood 3abody weight 3adrinking water 3aelevated plus-maze test 3akidneys 3alead 3aliver 3amemory 3amice 3apeople 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity1 aJahan, Momotaj1 aAlam, Shahnur1 aMohanto, Nayan Chandra1 aArefin, Afroza1 aRahman, Atiqur1 aHaque, Azizul1 aHimeno, Seiichiro1 aHosāina, Khāleda,1 aSaud, Zahangir Alam0 tBiological trace element research.g2017 June, v. 177, no. 2 p.288-296dSpringer USx0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-016-0883-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245009400211300001600305500001900321520132300340592002801663650000801691650001901699650001801718650001201736650000901748650002001757653004101777653002101818653001601839653001801855653001501873700002401888700002001912700002101932773010001953856008502053852000902138655001202147IND60701482120221121031527.0200830e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070148212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2020.06.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Hirakh Jyoti1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2538-597710aPerformance Evaluation of drying Ccharacteristics in conical bubbling fluidized bed dryer  ap. 534-543.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPaddy drying is an important task which is vital to the quality and storability of rice. Hence, evaluation of the drying process has to be performed for achieving a good quality of dried paddy in shorter duration. In this present work, performance evaluation of the drying process of paddy was experimentally investigated in two conical bubbling fluidized bed dryers with cone angles of 5° and 10° and results were compared with a conventional fluidized bed dryer having cone angle 0°. The experiments were conducted at three different superficial air velocities of 1.1, 1.6 and 2.1 m/s with bed inventories between 1 and 3 kg. Three different inlet air temperatures of 55, 60 and 65 °C were maintained for the evaluation of the drying process. Both hydrodynamic behaviour and drying characteristics have been investigated at these operating conditions. It has been evident from the experimental investigations that the conical fluidized bed dryer with 10° cone angle shows better performance than the other two dryers. The quality of the dried product has been tested for three different drying times and results were found to be in good agreement with the previously published literature. The milling quality was also tested for conical dryer and the use of a conical dryer recovered 77% of the milling rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3afluidized beds 3ahydrodynamics 3apaddies 3arice 3astorage quality 0aConical bubbling fluidized bed dryer 0aMoisture content 0aDrying time 0aPressure drop 0aCone angle1 aMahanta, Pinakeswar1 aSaikia, Rituraj1 aAamir, Md Shoaib0 tPowder technology.g2020 Sept., v. 374 p.534-543dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2020.06.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03552naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009200168300001600260520196500276592002802241650002302269650001902292650001602311650001902327650001802346650001102364650001402375650002202389650002302411650001202434650001302446650001402459650002502473650001102498650002102509650001402530650000902544650001102553650001102564650001002575650001002585650001102595650001602606653002302622653002702645653001102672653002302683653001602706700002202722700002002744773011802764856008302882852000902965655001202974IND60532622120221119135530.0190415s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053262212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2015.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSjöman, Henrik10aUrban forest resilience through tree selection—Variation in drought tolerance in Acer  ap. 858-865.  aIt is widely recognized that trees contribute a range of ecosystem services in urban environments. However, the magnitude of their contribution is closely related to their physiological condition and capacity to persist within our towns and cities. Root loss during transplanting, limited soil volume, disruption to soil hydrological processes and impermeable surfaces result in water deficits being major physiological stress limiting the performance of urban trees. The leaf water potential at turgor loss (ΨP0) provides a robust measure of drought tolerance since a more negative ΨP0 allows the leaf to maintain physiological function over a wider range of leaf water potentials and, by implication, soil matric potentials (Ψsoil). In this study, ΨP0 was calculated for 27 maple (Acer) genotypes based on a known linear relationship between the osmotic potential at full turgor (Ψπ100) and ΨP0. In spring, ΨP0 varied between −1.4MPa in Acer carpinifolium and −2.7 in both Acer rubrum ‘Northwood’ and Acer x freemanii ‘Autumn Blaze’. During summer, Acer spicatum had the highest ΨP0 at −1.6MPa and Acer monspessulanum had the lowest ΨP0 at −4.3MPa. Significant differences in ΨP0 were found between cultivars of A. rubrum and Acer saccharum. A highly significant relationship was found between seasonal osmotic adjustment and summer ΨP0 suggesting that osmotic adjustment is a driving force for summer ΨP0 in Acer leaves. These data confirm the wide range of tolerance to water deficits in Acer and give important insight into the potential of species to tolerate periods of low water availability by providing quantitative data not previously available. The technique shows great promise as a screening tool for the drought tolerance of new and traditional plant material. This data will be highly relevant for those selecting trees for urban sites as well as for nurseries seeking to evaluate genotypes for production purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer carpinifolium 3aAcer freemanii 3aAcer rubrum 3aAcer saccharum 3aAcer spicatum 3acities 3acultivars 3adrought tolerance 3aecosystem services 3aforests 3agenotype 3ahydrology 3aleaf water potential 3aleaves 3aosmotic pressure 3ascreening 3asoil 3aspring 3asummer 3atowns 3atrees 3aturgor 3aurban areas 0aEcosystem services 0aLeaf turgor loss point 0aMaples 0aOsmotic adjustment 0aUrban trees1 aHirons, Andrew D.1 aBassuk, Nina L.0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2015, v. 14, no. 4 p.858-865dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2015.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03672naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245009700166300001600263520257200279592002802851650002502879650001102904650001102915650001102926650001202937653001902949653002502968653003002993653002503023653002803048700001603076700002003092773010403112856008503216852000903301655001203310IND60546250920221117222845.0160903e20140115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054625092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.11.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHay, Laura14aThe Sustainability Cycle and Loop: Models for a more unified understanding of sustainability  ap. 232-257.  aIn spite of the considerable research on sustainability, reports suggest that we are barely any closer to a more sustainable society. As such, there is an urgent need to improve the effectiveness of human efforts towards sustainability. A clearer and more unified understanding of sustainability among different people and sectors could help to facilitate this. This paper presents the results of an inductive literature investigation, aiming to develop models to explain the nature of sustainability in the Earth system, and how humans can effectively strive for it. The major contributions are two general and complementary models, that may be applied in any context to provide a common basis for understanding sustainability: the Sustainability Cycle (S-Cycle), and the Sustainability Loop (S-Loop). Literature spanning multiple sectors is examined from the perspective of three concepts, emerging as significant in relation to our aim. Systems are shown to provide the context for human action towards sustainability, and the nature of the Earth system and its sub-systems is explored. Activities are outlined as a fundamental target that humans need to sustain, since they produce the entities both needed and desired by society. The basic behaviour of activities operating in the Earth system is outlined. Finally, knowledge is positioned as the driver of human action towards sustainability, and the key components of knowledge involved are examined. The S-Cycle and S-Loop models are developed via a process of induction from the reviewed literature. The S-Cycle describes the operation of activities in a system from the perspective of sustainability. The sustainability of activities in a system depends upon the availability of resources, and the availability of resources depends upon the rate that activities consume and produce them. Humans may intervene in these dynamics via an iterative process of interpretation and action, described in the S-Loop model. The models are briefly applied to a system described in the literature. It is shown that the S-Loop may be used to guide efforts towards sustainability in a particular system of interest, by prescribing the basic activities involved. The S-Cycle may be applied complementary to the S-Loop, to support the interpretation of activity behaviour described in the latter. Given their general nature, the models provide the basis for a more unified understanding of sustainability. It is hoped that their use may go some way towards improving the effectiveness of human action towards sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEarth system science 3ahumans 3amodels 3apeople 3asociety 0aSustainability 0aSustainability goals 0aSustainability indicators 0aSustainability model 0aActivity sustainability1 aDuffy, Alex1 aWhitfield, R.I.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2014 Jan. 15, v. 133 p.232-257dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.11.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01921naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002700138245008300165300001600248500001100264520091700275592002801192650001201220650001901232650002601251650002101277650001801298650001201316650001701328650002001345651001401365773012301379856007201502852000901574655001201583IND60588174320221120142822.0180103e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058817432DNAL7 a10.1002/ird.20852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFulazzaky, Mohamad Ali10aParticipation of farmers in irrigation water management in Indonesia: a review  ap. 182-191.  aREVIEW  aIt has been argued that policy reform to involve stakeholders in water management is a priority for Indonesia. Given the large allocation of water to the irrigation sector, the improved management of infrastructure and more productive use of irrigation water are important issues. If the enactments of Law No. 7/2004 on water resources and Government Regulation No. 20/2006 on irrigation have accommodated the role of farmers in water management, is there an effective policy for farmers as the main stakeholders in water management? What is the implication by the fact that Indonesian society where the policy reform compulsion has changed to a new paradigm? This paper attempts to provide answers to these questions and offers at least one way in which public policy could possibly be made at work compatibly in participation issues in water management in the country.

During 14‐day storage at 4 °C, texture profile analysis revealed that combined GCSPHs and XT can significantly reduce the hardness from 1181.8 to 249.3 g, which has a more suppressive effect on retrogradation than that of all the other gel samples. The physical phenomena underlying the reduced retrogradation of GRS based on differential scanning calorimetry, X‐ray diffraction, attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared, low‐field 1H nuclear magnetic resonance, and scanning electron microscopy are characterized and it is shown that GCSPHs in GRS/XT gel can remarkably decrease the double helices localized inside crystallites of retrogradation, increase the amorphous region, immobilize the transversal relaxation time, lock the water in the GRS system and form a more homogeneous continuous phase, which can play a significant role in mitigating the retrogradation of GRS. These findings suggest that the synergism of GCSPHs and anionic hydrocolloids (XT) is more effective for inhibiting the retrogradation of GRS and improving the quality and nutrition of RS‐containing GF foods.  aPublisher supplied data  a31671896cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017M612152cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31471629cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aceliac disease 3acold storage 3acrystallites 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aessential amino acids 3agelatinization 3agels 3agluten-free foods 3aguar gum 3ahardness 3ahydrocolloids 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anutrition 3aprotein hydrolysates 3aretrogradation 3arice 3arice starch 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astorage temperature 3asynergism 3atexture 3axanthan gum1 aNiu, Liya1 aZhang, Senwang1 aXiao, Jianhui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6882-96220 tStärke =.g2019 July, v. 71, no. 7-8 p.e1800260-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl50456x0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.2018002603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02190naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012500169300001600294520091900310592002801229650001401257650001901271650001601290650002401306650001301330650001401343650001101357650001501368650001301383650001001396653002101406653000801427653001901435653002101454700001601475700001901491700001701510700001901527773011801546856008301664852000901747655001201756IND60532622220221119135629.0190415s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053262222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2015.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanhuanpää, T.10aMonitoring downed coarse woody debris through appearance of canopy gaps in urban boreal forests with bitemporal ALS data  ap. 835-843.  aThe study introduces a method for detailed mapping of downed coarse woody debris (CWD). Bitemporal airborne laser scanning (ALS) data and existing allometric equations were utilized to map the attributes and location of downed CWD. No training or calibration data were used in the process. The CWD locations were determined through canopy gaps detected with canopy height models (CHM) from 2009 and 2012. The attributes of formed CWD were derived through an individual tree detection (ITD) technique. Within the three year interval, 97.8% of all new downed trees were detected and their species group (conifer/deciduous) was classified correctly in 89.0% of the cases (Kappa 0.76). Tree-level CWD diameter and volume were predicted with an RMSE of 8.7cm and 0.5m3 respectively. The introduced method allows detailed mapping of CWD and can be utilized in forest planning and operational tasks in urban forest areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallometry 3aboreal forests 3acanopy gaps 3acoarse woody debris 3aconifers 3aequations 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aplanning 3atrees 0aDeadwood mapping 0aCWD 0aAirborne LiDAR 0aChange detection1 aKankare, V.1 aVastaranta, M.1 aSaarinen, N.1 aHolopainen, M.0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2015, v. 14, no. 4 p.835-843dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2015.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01756naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245007100171300001400242520062600256592002800882650001600910650001600926651001000942651000900952651001600961651001700977651001000994653001601004653001801020653001601038653001501054653001001069653001701079653000901096653001001105700002001115773011701135856008501252852000901337655001201346IND60627676420221119092210.0190128e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062767642DNAL7 a10.1080/09397140.2018.15401502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZamani, Alireza14aThe flattie spider family Selenopidae (Araneae) in the Middle East  ap. 79-87.  aThe spider family Selenopidae is currently represented by two species in the Middle East: Selenops radiatus Latreille, 1819 and S. oculatus Pocock, 1898.

Therefore, the successful recovery of gas from these rocks depends on the accessible surface area, surface properties, and interconnectivity of the pore system. These parameters can be difficult to determine because of the nanoscale of the structures within source rocks. This study seeks to investigate the pore structure, surface heterogeneity, and composition of isolated kerogens with progressively increasing thermogenic maturities from source rocks at a middle-east reservoir. Prompt gamma-ray activation analysis (PGAA), nitrogen and methane volumetric gas sorption, and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) are combined to explore the relationship between the chemical composition, pore structure, surface roughness, surface heterogeneity, and maturity. PGAA results indicate that more mature kerogens have lower hydrogen/carbon ratios. Nitrogen gas adsorption indicates that the pore volume and accessible specific surface area are higher for more mature kerogens. The methane isosteric heat at different methane uptakes in the kerogens is determined by methane isotherms and shows that approximately two types of binding sites are present in less mature kerogens while the binding sites are relatively homogeneous in the most mature kerogen. The hysteresis effects of the structure during the adsorption and desorption processes at different CD₄ gas pressures are studied. An extended generalized Porod’s scattering law method (GPSLM) is further developed here to analyze kerogens with fractal surfaces. This extended GPSLM quantifies the surface heterogeneity of the kerogens with a fractal surface and shows that more mature kerogen is chemically more homogeneous, consistent with the results from methane isosteric heat. SANS analysis also suggests a pronounced surface roughness in the more mature kerogens. A microporous region circling around the nanopores, which contributes to high surface roughness and methane storage, is shown to develop with maturity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3achemical composition 3adesorption 3aenergy 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3ahysteresis 3amethane 3ananopores 3aneutrons 3anitrogen 3aporous media 3asurface area 3asurface roughness1 aChen, Jin-Hong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0722-02441 aJacobi, David1 aYildirim, Taner1 aTurkoglu, Danyal1 aAlthaus, Stacey1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3487-80011 aLiu, Yun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0944-31530 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Sept. 21, v. 34, no. 10 p.12354-12365dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c022683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245019700159300001800356520145600374592002801830650001601858650001001874650001701884650001701901650001301918650001401931650001201945650001401957650001001971650001901981650001102000650002202011700002702033700002002060700001802080700002102098700002102119773012302140856007302263852000902336655001202345IND60080378720221122144314.0150206e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008037872DNAL7 a10.1111/pce.123322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMARGARIA, PAOLO10aMetabolic and transcript analysis of the flavonoid pathway in diseased and recovered Nebbiolo and Barbera grapevines (Vitis vinifera L.) following infection by Flavescence dorée phytoplasma  ap. 2183-2200.  aFlavescence dorée phytoplasma (FDp) infections seriously affect production and survival of grapevine. We analysed the changes in the flavonoid pathway occurring in two red cultivars, the highly susceptible Barbera and the less susceptible Nebbiolo, following FDp infection. A combination of metabolic and transcript analyses was used to quantify flavonoid compounds and expression of a set of genes involved in their biosynthesis. Quantification of anthocyanins, flavonols, proanthocyanidins and related biosynthetic enzymes was performed over the vegetative season, at four time points, on healthy, infected and recovered plants. A strong activation of anthocyanin accumulation was observed in infected Barbera leaves, while the response was less marked in Nebbiolo. Proanthocyanidins also accumulated mainly in infected Barbera leaves, even if basal proanthocyanidin concentration was higher in healthy and recovered Nebbiolo. Biochemical data were supported by transcript analysis: genes of the stem flavonoid pathway and of the anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin branches were expressed at a higher level in infected than in healthy plants, with a different magnitude between the two cultivars. Based on our results, we hypothesize that flavonoid accumulation is a physiological consequence of FD infection without affecting phytoplasma multiplication, although proanthocyanidin accumulation could help repel further infection by the insect vector.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytoplasma 3aVitis 3aanthocyanins 3abiosynthesis 3abranches 3acultivars 3aenzymes 3aflavonols 3agenes 3ainsect vectors 3aleaves 3aproanthocyanidins1 aFERRANDINO, ALESSANDRA1 aCACIAGLI, PIERO1 aKEDRINA, OLGA1 aSCHUBERT, ANDREA1 aPALMANO, SABRINA0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2014 Sept., v. 37, no. 9 p.2183-2200dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0140-77917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.123323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245006200206300001600268506007600284520113800360592002801498506003701526650002501563650001001588650001001598650000901608650001201617650001401629650001101643650002801654650001101682650001001693651001001703651001001713651001101723651001301734700002801747700001901775700001601794700001701810773010501827856008101932852000902013655001202022IND60572827220221207122309.0170718e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057282722DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-016-0888-82doi7 aPMC54183152pmcid7 a278156892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStyburski, D.10aBeer as a Rich Source of Fluoride Delivered into the Body  ap. 404-408.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFluoride is an element which in the minimum amount is necessary for the proper construction of the teeth and bones. But on the other hand, it increases the synthesis of reactive oxygen species, inflammatory mediators, and impairs the action of enzymes. Beer is the most popular alcoholic beverage in the world. Due to its prevalence and volume of consumption, it should be considered as a potential source of F- and taken into account in designing a balanced diet. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze beer samples in terms of F- levels. The concentrations of fluoride were examined using ion-selective electrode Thermo Scientific Orion and statistical analysis was based on two-way ANOVA and t test. When compared to imported beers, Polish beers were characterized by the lowest mean F- concentration (0.089 ppm). The highest mean F- concentrations were recorded in beers from Thailand (0.260 ppm), Italy (0.238 ppm), Mexico (0.210 ppm), and China (0.203 ppm). Our study shows that beer is a significant source of fluoride for humans, which is mainly associated with the quality of the water used in beer production.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanalysis of variance 3abeers 3abones 3adiet 3aenzymes 3afluorides 3ahumans 3aspecific ion electrodes 3at-test 3ateeth 3aChina 3aItaly 3aMexico 3aThailand1 aBaranowska-Bosiacka, I.1 aGoschorska, M.1 aChlubek, D.1 aGutowska, I.0 tBiological trace element research.g2017 June, v. 177, no. 2 p.404-408dSpringer USx0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-016-0888-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03593naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245013900175300001400314520231400328592002802642650002502670650002102695650001102716650001502727650000902742650002202751650001302773651001202786653001102798653002802809653002402837653002102861653002202882700002702904700002102931700001802952773011602970856008803086852000903174655001203183IND60590496220221118072837.0190318e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059049622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2017.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpence, Kelsey L.10aEstimating the potential for disease spread in horses associated with an equestrian show in Ontario, Canada using an agent-based model  ap. 21-28.  aParticipation in equestrian shows provides opportunities for contact between horses, increasing the risk of disease introduction and spread within the population. The magnitude of a potential outbreak, and the impact of disease prevention and control strategies, can be estimated using simulation modeling. The objectives of this study were to (1) examine the potential spread of equine influenza in a network of horses associated with a 2-day equestrian show in Ontario, Canada; and (2) determine the effectiveness of several interventions during a simulated outbreak. A discrete-event, continuous-time, stochastic agent-based simulation model was constructed to represent horses associated with the show, including those in attendance at the show, and those that were not in attendance but co-boarded with attending horses at their home facilities. At the beginning of each simulation run, one random horse in attendance at the show was infected with equine influenza. In the absence of interventions, the median attack rate was 0.029 (IQR: 0.016–0.056; mean: 0.043; 95% CI: 0.040–0.044) and the average outbreak duration was 19.58 days (95% CI: 19.31–19.85). The most effective intervention was the implementation of either a 5-day or 14-day quarantine period, which both resulted in the same median attack rate of 0.0026 (IQR: 0.0013–0.0039), although the mean attack rates differed (mean: 0.0043, 95% CI: 0.0039–0.0046; and mean: 0.0029, 95% CI: 0.0028–0.0029; respectively). In instances where implementing either a 5-day or 14-day quarantine period would not be feasible, quarantine for shorter time periods was effective when combined with targeted increases in initial facility-level vaccine coverage. The combined implementation of a 2-day quarantine period and an increased vaccine coverage of 75% in facilities with four or more owners resulted in a median attack rate of 0.013 (IQR: 0.0052–0.026; mean: 0.022; 95% CI: 0.020–0.024). This study demonstrates a relative comparison of intervention effectiveness during a simulated outbreak of equine influenza in a population of horses associated with an equestrian show. The results have the potential to inform and improve the current strategies used to prevent the introduction and spread of disease within the equine population.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisease transmission 3aequine influenza 3ahorses 3aquarantine 3arisk 3asimulation models 3avaccines 3aOntario 0aEquine 0aSocial network analysis 0aComputer simulation 0aEquine influenza 0aAgent-based model1 aO’Sullivan, Terri L.1 aPoljak, Zvonimir1 aGreer, Amy L.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 151 p.21-28dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2017.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01856naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245009900164300001800263520091500281592002801196650001601224650001201240650001501252650001601267650001301283650001301296700002001309700002401329773010501353856007501458852000901533655001201542IND60577843020221119060119.0170810e20130813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057784302DNAL7 a10.1021/ma400900s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenavides, Rafael
E.10aRole of Liquid Jet Stretching and Bending Instability in Nanofiber Formation by Gas Jet Method  ap. 6081-6090.  aIn this work, the mechanism of fiber formation from polymer solutions under the action of gas jets in a process named gas jet fibers (GJF) method is studied. The GJF method relies on high velocity gas jet converting polymer solutions streaming from a nozzle into a liquid jet and then into fibers. Polymer nanofibers with diameter as low as 100 nm are continuously produced from polymer solutions. A series of interrelated phenomena including polymer jet initiation and stretching, flapping motion, bending instabilities, and concurrent solvent evaporation were found to influence fiber formation. Specifically, the behavior of the liquid jets, stretching rates, and the onset of the bending instabilities are revealed using high speed video photography. The results indicate that both the initial stretching from flapping and the extension from bending instabilities play important roles in fiber attenuation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevaporation 3aliquids 3ananofibers 3aphotography 3apolymers 3asolvents1 aJana, Sadhan C.1 aReneker, Darrell

The World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED, 1987) outlined imperatives which need to be met for environmental, economic and social sustainability. Development of strategies for measuring and improving sustainability in and across these domains, however, has been hindered by intense debate between advocates for one approach fearing that efforts by those who advocate for another could have unintended adverse impacts. Studies attempting to compare the sustainability performance of countries and industries have also found ratings of performance quite variable depending on the sustainability indices used. Quantifying and comparing the sustainability of industries across the triple bottom line of economy, environment and social impact continues to be problematic. Using the Australian dairy industry as a case study, a Sustainability Scorecard, developed as a Bayesian network model, is proposed as an adaptable tool to enable informed assessment, dialogue and negotiation of strategies at a global level as well as being suitable for developing local solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3acase studies 3adairy industry 3aenvironmental impact 3amodels 3asocial environment 3asocial impact 3asocial sustainability 3aviability 0aSustainability 0aTriple bottom line 0aEnvironmental management 0aBayesian network modelling 0aSustainability Scorecard 0aSustainable industry1 aMengersen, K.1 aJohnson, S.1 avan Buuren, N.1 aChauvin, A.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2014 Jan. 15, v. 133 p.184-192dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04165naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245013900164300001600303506011700319506007600436520204600512592002802558506003702586650003102623650001302654650001902667650001202686650001402698650001402712650002302726650002002749650001502769650001802784650002002802650002402822650001802846650001602864650001402880650001902894650001902913650001202932650001402944650002202958650001802980650001002998651001003008653002303018653001003041653001603051653001503067653001803082700001803100700001603118700001803134700001403152700001803166700001503184700001703199700001203216773016103228856008103389852000903470655001203479IND60745288920221207143711.0220402e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074528892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cj.2021.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Shuonan10aIntegrated transcriptome and metabolite profiling highlights the role of benzoxazinoids in wheat resistance against Fusarium crown rot  ap. 407-417.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFusarium crown rot (FCR), caused by Fusarium spp., is a chronic and severe plant disease worldwide. In the last years, the incidence and severity of FCR in China has increased to the point that it is now considered a threat to local wheat crops. In this study, for the first time, the metabolites and transcripts responsive to FCR infection in the partial resistant wheat cultivar 04 Zhong 36 (04z36) and susceptible cultivar Xinmai 26 (XM) were investigated and compared at 20 and 25 days post inoculation (dpi). A total of 443 metabolites were detected, of which 102 were significantly changed because of pathogen colonization. Most of these 102 metabolites belonged to the flavonoid, phenolic acid, amino acid and derivative classes. Some metabolites, such as proline betaine, lauric acid, ribitol, and arabitol, were stably induced by Fusarium pseudograminearum (Fp) infection at two time points and may have important roles in FCR resistance. In line with the reduced seedling height of 04z36 and XM plants, RNA-seq analysis revealed that FCR infection significantly affected the photosynthesis activities in two cultivars. Furthermore, 15 jasmonate ZIM-domain genes (JAZ) in the significantly enriched ‘regulation of jasmonic acid mediated signaling pathway’ in 04z36 were down-regulated. The down-regulation of these JAZ genes in 04z36 may cause a strong activation of the jasmonate signaling pathway. Based on combined data from gene expression and metabolite profiles, two metabolites, benzoxazolin-2-one (BOA) and 6-methoxy-benzoxazolin-2-one (MBOA), involved in the benzoxazinoid-biosynthesis pathway, were tested for their effects on FCR resistance. Both BOA and MBOA significantly reduced fungal growth in vitro and in vivo, and, thus, a higher content of BOA and MBOA in 04z36 may contribute to FCR resistance. Above all, the current analysis extends our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of FCR resistance/susceptibility in wheat and will benefit further efforts for the genetic improvement of disease resistance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFusarium pseudograminearum 3aarabitol 3abenzoxazinoids 3abetaine 3acrown rot 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3adodecanoic acid 3aflavonoids 3afungal growth 3agene expression 3agenetic improvement 3ajasmonic acid 3ametabolites 3apathogens 3aphenolic acids 3aphotosynthesis 3aproline 3aseedlings 3asequence analysis 3atranscriptome 3awheat 3aChina 0aFusarium crown rot 0aWheat 0aMetabolites 0aTranscript 0aBenzoxazinoid1 aJin, Crystal,1 aGao, Yutian1 aJin, Changlin1 aMu, Junyi1 aZhen, Wenchao1 aSun, Qixin1 aXie, Chaojie1 aMa, Jun0 tcrop journal.g2022 Apr., v. 10, no. 2 p.407-417dElsevier B.V.aCrop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop SciencewJournal:23202x2214-51417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cj.2021.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245011900171520124300290592002801533650002601561650001001587650001501597650002201612650001201634650002201646650001701668650002301685650001901708650001801727650001501745650001401760650001601774650002001790650001301810650002001823653002601843653001501869653004201884653001201926653001601938653002101954700002301975700002101998700002402019773009502043856008402138852000902222655001202231IND60726707720221119232826.0210423e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072670772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2021.1022162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatos, Ângelo P.10aAnaerobic digestate abattoir effluent (ADAE), a suitable source of nutrients for Arthrospira platensis cultivation  aUntreated as well as partially treated anaerobic digestate abattoir effluent (ADAE) were used for the cultivation of Arthrospira platensis in this study.

Homestead woodlands have played a key role in protecting settlements from strong winds, as well as providing timber, green manure, and other services. However, with rapid urbanization and economic and societal change, homestead woodlands in Japan have largely vanished.The primary purpose of this study was to assess residents’ perceptions of homestead woodlands. The secondary purpose was to evaluate residents’ willingness to conserve homestead woodlands using the contingent valuation method (CVM).A survey was conducted in three hamlets with the best-preserved Fukugi homestead woodlands in Okinawa Prefecture. The overwhelming majority of respondents (91%) favored the conservation of homestead woodlands. Residents highly valued the amelioration of the microclimate by homestead woodlands such as serving as windbreaks (85.6%) and cooling the air in summer (60.9%). In contrast, the contribution to biodiversity was only modestly (16.8%) valued. A hierarchical multiple regression model revealed that residents of small islands valued Fukugi trees highly for their function of protection from typhoons. Fukugi homestead woodlands were considered as private goods by the residents as well as by local authorities. Approximately half of the respondents felt that homeowners and/or a local authority such as the hamlet community should be responsible for their conservation. Estimated mean and median WTP values were JPY 1451 (approximately USD14)/household and JPY 1000/household, respectively. The low CV value by the residents and perception of woodlands as private property suggests a relatively low concern for conservation. A BLR model suggested that respondents with better education and higher income were more concerned about conservation. It is suggested that fostering environmental education and awareness will contribute to better conservation of their homestead woodlands.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective clinical study and technique description. ANIMALS: Forty‐two healthy female dogs. METHODS: Laparoscopic‐assisted ovariohysterectomy was performed with a custom‐made single‐port device. The total duration of surgery from first incision to skin closure was compared with previously published durations of LOHE in dogs. Short‐term complications were recorded. RESULTS: The median total duration of surgery was 24 minutes (range, 17.5–39.5; mean, 25.73; SD, 6.12), which was shorter than that described in most previously reported studies of LOHE in dogs (range, 20.8 ± 4.00–60.0 ± 18.45 minutes; P < .001). Intraoperative complications were minor, but wound complications occurred in 12 of 42 (29%) dogs. CONCLUSION: Single‐port LOHE with the glove‐port technique in combination with a wound retractor and nonarticulated instruments was completed in all dogs. This technique was faster than what has been previously reported for other LOHE, but local wound complications were common. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The glove‐port technique described here offers a low‐cost alternative to other commercially available single‐port devices.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adogs 3afemales 3aspaying1 aBockstahler, Barbara1 aDupré, Gilles0 tVeterinary surgery.g2019 July, v. 48, no. 5 p.715-725dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl10192x0161-34997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vsu.132423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01525naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245012400177300001400301520043700315592002800752650001400780650001600794651000900810653001200819653001300831653001400844653001600858653002100874653000900895700002300904700003700927773011700964856008501081852000901166655001201175IND60627676720221119092237.0190128e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062767672DNAL7 a10.1080/09397140.2018.15401552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNamaki Khameneh, Roya10aScuttle flies (Diptera: Phoridae) from Ardabil province in Iran, with description of a new species of Megaselia Rondani  ap. 70-74.  aour named species of scuttle flies were collected from Ardabil province-Iran, during 2013–2014.

Such areas include spontaneously vegetated spaces such as such as brownfields, street or railway verges and vacant lots. While these spaces may contribute to urban conservation, their informal and liminal nature poses a challenge for reviewing what we know about their value for biodiversity. The relevant literature lacks a common terminology. This paper applied a formal definition and typology of informal urban greenspace (IGS) to identify and systematically review a total of 174 peer-reviewed papers in English (152), German (14) and Japanese (8). We identified three main topics: value for conservation (94 papers), factors influencing diversity (80), and non-indigenous species (37). Additionally, we analyzed this literature for temporal trends, spatial patterns, studied IGS types, taxa, climate zones, human impact types, and key authors. Results show IGS plays an important role for biodiversity. Management practices were identified as the most common and negative impact on diversity, while vegetation, site age, distance to city center, and habitat diversity were positive-influence factors. The number and impact of non-indigenous species varied widely. The analysis of literature patterns reveals: an increase in publications over the last 15 years and a strong geographic bias in publications, as well as toward temperate and humid climate zones. Studies of gap, powerline and microsite IGS were scarce, as were studies of mammals and reptiles. Results suggest different maintenance regimes for IGS may improve its contribution to urban conservation. We therefore propose adapting management to the local context.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiodiversity 3abrownfields 3ahabitats 3ahumid zones 3amammals 3arailroads 3areptiles 3asystematic review 3aterminology 3avegetation 0aCities 0aConservation 0aLiminal 0aSpontaneous vegetation 0aUrban ecology 0aWasteland1 aByrne, Jason A.1 aGarden, Jenni G.1 aHero, Jean-Marc0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2015, v. 14, no. 4 p.883-908dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2015.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03622naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245014300168300001600311520246700327592002802794650001602822650001602838650001402854650001202868650001802880650001102898650001402909650001302923650002502936700002302961700001702984700002003001773011303021856008203134990002303216852000903239655001203248IND60095153920221122031850.0141104e20110515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009515392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.epsl.2011.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBroerse, D.B.T.10aOcean contribution to co-seismic crustal deformation and geoid anomalies: Application to the 2004 December 26 Sumatra–Andaman earthquake  ap. 341-349.  aLarge earthquakes do not only heavily deform the crust in the vicinity of the fault, they also change the gravity field of the area affected by the earthquake due to mass redistribution in the upper layers of the Earth. Besides that, for sub-oceanic earthquakes deformation of the ocean floor causes relative sea level changes and mass redistribution of water that have again a significant effect on the gravity field. To model these deformations, sea level changes and gravity field perturbations self-consistently we use an adapted version of the sea level equation (SLE) that has been used for glacial isostatic adjustment studies. The sea level equation, next to our normal mode model for seismic solid earth modeling, allows us to compute a gravitationally self-consistent solution for the co-seismic relative sea level, surface deformation and geoid height changes. We apply our geographically detailed models to the case of the 2004 December 26 Sumatra–Andaman earthquake. Recent studies that have modeled the ocean mass effect on co-seismic gravity change for this specific earthquake show model results that indicate a broad negative change in geoid height around the fault due to ocean water redistribution (de Linage et al., 2009; Melini et al., 2010). Our model results for the ocean contribution to geoid height differ from these studies in the sense that we find a pattern similar to the elongated dipole pattern of the solid earth model outputs for gravity and vertical deformation, together with a relatively small broad negative geoid height change. We explain the relation between outcomes for geoid height, relative sea level and vertical deformation of the ocean floor and we confront our model results with a least squares estimation of the co-seismic discontinuity in GRACE-derived gravity field time series. We show that taking into account the contribution of ocean water redistribution to the co-seismic geoid height change next to a compressible solid earth model is essential to explain the predominant negative co-seismic geoid anomalies from the GRACE gravity field solutions. Besides, we introduce a detailed approach to modeling an earthquake in a normal mode model that better approximates realistic continuous slip on the fault plane than models that do not distribute slip with depth. To demonstrate the importance of the slip distribution we show the differences in outcomes for modeled geoid height and vertical deformation.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3aearthquakes 3aequations 3agravity 3aleast squares 3amodels 3asea level 3aseawater 3atime series analysis1 aVermeersen, L.L.A.1 aRiva, R.E.M.1 avan der Wal, W.0 tEarth and planetary science letters.g2011 May 15, v. 305, no. 3-4 p.341-349dElsevier B.V.x0012-821X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2011.03.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002900138245018000167300001600347500002000363520126200383592002801645650002201673650001501695650002101710650002601731650002001757650001901777650001601796650001801812650001501830650002301845650001801868651000901886700002601895700001901921700001601940773012301956856007202079852000902151655001202160IND60588174820221120132301.0180103e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058817482DNAL7 a10.1002/ird.20982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassan‐Esfahani, Leila10aSpatial Root Zone Soil Water Content Estimation in Agricultural Lands Using Bayesian‐Based Artificial Neural Networks and High‐ Resolution Visual, NIR, and Thermal Imagery  ap. 273-288.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSoil moisture is an important parameter in irrigation scheduling and application. Knowledge of root zone volumetric water content can support decisions for more efficient irrigation management by enabling estimation of required water application rates at appropriate temporal and spatial scales. The study presented here proposes a data mining approach that combines known field conditions with remote sensing observations to provide probabilistic estimates of root zone soil moisture at three different depths in the root zone soil profile. Bayesian data mining algorithms were tested and calibrated to combine the remotely sensed spatial information with field measurements. The remote sensing platform used in this study, called AggieAir™, is an unmanned autonomous aerial system developed by the Utah Water Research Laboratory at Utah State University. Finally, a trapezoidal integration method was used to estimate volumetric water content (VWC) in the root zone using the results of the modelling approach at three different depths in the root zone soil profile. The results show the model could estimate the root zone VWC with good accuracy (RMSE =0.05, MAE = 0.04, r = 0.97, e = 0.92, R² = 0.94).

However less is known about how information functions as a barrier, and to what degree it prevents adaptation compared to other perceived barriers. In addition, the role of institutional context in mediating the demand for information in the context of adaptation has been less well studied. This paper helps to clarify the role that information plays in adaptation planning for two sectors of public employees working at similar scales, in similar locations, with similar challenges. We conducted surveys and semi-structured interviews to investigate the demand for information in support of adaptation implementation and planning from US federal public lands managers and municipal officials in the US interior West. We found that federal managers and municipal officials both consulted information frequently for decision making, and while both groups indicated that lack of information at relevant scales was a barrier to adaptation planning, this was seen as a much stronger barrier for federal managers than for communities. Uncertainty of information was raised as an issue, but results were mixed on whether or not this acted as a strong barrier. While peer-reviewed publications were seen as the "best available science," and correlated with adaptation planning, they were not accessed directly as frequently as other sources of information, including colleagues, the internet and reports. The strong connection between communities and adjacent federal lands may provide an opportunity for networking that could facilitate the flow of information relevant for adaptation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aclimate change 3adecision making 3ahuman resources 3ainformation sources 3ainterviews 3amanagers 3aplanning 3apublic lands 3asurveys 3auncertainty 3aUnited States 0aClimate change adaptation 0aPublic lands 0aMunicipal adaptation 0aInformation demand 0aDecision making1 aDilling, Lisa1 aMilford, Jana B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8573-47371 aPampel, Fred C.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2014 Jan. 15, v. 133 p.397-410dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245009600168300002000264500001900284520110000303592002801403650001601431650001201447650001601459650002101475650002101496650001501517650001701532650001101549650001201560650001501572650001001587650004101597650002301638650001101661650001101672650004401683650001401727650002201741650001301763700001401776700001601790700005401806773012301860856008701983852000902070655001202079IND60713671120221118064909.0201023e20200909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071367112DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c022842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Kaili10aElectrocatalytic Valorization of Organosolv Lignin Utilizing a Nickel-Based Electrocatalyst  ap. 12703-12709.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLignin is a biopolymer that accounts for up to 30% of biomass and is the most abundant aromatic feedstock in nature. Therefore, extraction of valuable aromatic compounds from lignin is regarded as an attractive way for producing various organic chemicals, which are currently derived from fossil fuels. We report an electrochemical approach for the depolymerization of three ethanol organosolv lignins (EOLs), isolated from sweetgum (SW), aspen (AS), and loblolly pine (LP), utilizing a low-cost nickel foam as the working electrode under alkaline conditions. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, two-dimensional (2D) heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and gel permeation chromatography were employed to analyze and quantify the obtained products after electrolysis. Vanillin and syringaldehyde with a combined maximum yield of 17.5% were produced from the electrochemical depolymerization of EOL-SW. Finally, the difference in oxidized products among these three lignin samples was rationalized from the analysis of their native structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus taeda 3abiomass 3abiopolymers 3adepolymerization 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolysis 3aenergy 3aethanol 3afeedstocks 3afoams 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agel chromatography 3alignin 3anickel 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3aquantum mechanics 3avanillin1 aZhang, Yu1 aTu, Maobing1 aSun, Yujie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4122-62550 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Sept. 09, v. 34, no. 10 p.12703-12709dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c022843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03714naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001700158245012300175300001800298520139800316592002801714650002501742650003201767650001601799650002101815650001001836650002401846650001601870650001901886650001301905650001201918650001601930650001401946650002001960650002901980650003102009650001602040650004002056650003902096650004802135650002502183650003002208650003802238650001702276650002402293650003402317650004602351650002502397650002302422650002302445650002802468650003102496650001902527650002002546650004402566650002602610650004102636700001502677700001802692700001602710700002002726700001402746700001502760773012302775856007302898852000902971655001202980IND60080379120221121194101.0150206e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008037912DNAL7 a245480032pmid7 a10.1111/pce.122992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWENG, MINJIE10aHistone chaperone ASF1 is involved in gene transcription activation in response to heat stress in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 2128-2138.  aANTI‐SILENCING FUNCTION 1 (ASF1) is an evolutionarily conserved histone chaperone involved in diverse chromatin‐based processes in eukaryotes. Yet, its role in transcription and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely elusive, particularly in plants. Here, we show that the A rabidopsis thaliana ASF1 homologous genes, AtASF1A and AtASF1B, are involved in gene transcription activation in response to heat stress. The A tasf1ab mutant displays defective basal as well as acquired thermotolerance phenotypes. Heat‐induced expression of several key genes, including the HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN (HSP) genes Hsp101, Hsp70, Hsa32, Hsp17.6A and Hsp17.6B‐CI, and the HEAT SHOCK FACTOR (HSF) gene HsfA2 but not HsfB1 is drastically impaired in Atasf1ab as compared with that in wild type. We found that AtASF1A/B proteins are recruited onto chromatin, and their enrichment is correlated with nucleosome removal and RNA polymerase II accumulation at the promoter and coding regions of HsfA2 and Hsa32 but not HsfB1. Moreover, AtASF1A/B facilitate H3K56 acetylation (H3K56ac), which is associated with HsfA2 and Hsa32 activation. Taken together, our study unravels an important function of AtASF1A/B in plant heat stress response and suggests that AtASF1A/B participate in transcription activation of some but not all HSF and HSP genes via nucleosome removal and H3K56ac stimulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aacetylation 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3aheat shock proteins 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3ahistones 3amutants 3anucleosomes 3aphenotype 3astress response 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptional activation 2aAcetylation 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxgenetics 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA-Binding Proteins 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aHeat-Shock Proteins 2aHeat-Shock Responsexgenetics 2aHistone Chaperonesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHistonesxmetabolism 2aLysinexmetabolism 2aMutationxgenetics 2aNucleosomesxmetabolism 2aOxidative Stressxgenetics 2aPlant Proteins 2aProtein Binding 2aTrans-Activatorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription Factors 2aTranscriptional Activationxgenetics1 aYang, Yue,1 aFENG, HAIYANG1 aPAN, ZONGDE1 aSHEN, WEN‐HUI1 aZhu, Yan,1 aDONG, AIWU0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2014 Sept., v. 37, no. 9 p.2128-2138dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0140-77917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.122993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245013100159300001600290500002000306520151700326592002801843650001101871650001201882650001501894650001001909650001001919650001101929700005801940700006001998700002402058700002202082773011902104856007302223852000902296655001202305IND60649070920221120025135.0190702e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064907092DNAL7 a10.1111/vsu.131712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNylund, Adam M.10aEvaluation of a resorbable self‐locking ligation device for performing peripheral lung biopsies in a caprine cadaveric model  ap. 845-849.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: To compare airway leak pressures after sealing peripheral lung biopsy sites with a resorbable ligation device (LigaTie) or thoracoabdominal (TA) staples. STUDY DESIGN: Ex vivo study. ANIMALS: Four normal caprine cadavers. METHODS: Twelve lung lobes were harvested from 4 goats immediately after euthanasia. Each lobe was inflated to 20 cm H₂O to test for leaks prior to biopsy. Pressure was then maintained at 10 cm H₂O. Biopsy samples were obtained 3 cm from the periphery with a resorbable ligation device or a TA stapler (n = 6 per group). After biopsy, inflation pressure was slowly increased to 40 cm H₂O while lungs were submerged in water. The pressure at which bubbles were first seen was recorded as the airway leak pressure. The length, width, volume, and weight were recorded for each biopsy sample. RESULTS: Five of 6 LigaTie biopsy sites sustained the maximum pressure of 40 cm H₂O without leaking. One site leaked at 24 cm H₂O. The TA‐stapled sites sustained airway pressure to median 25.5 cm H₂O (interquartile range, 23.5–26 cm H₂O), and none of them reached the maximum pressure (P = .015). There were no differences in biopsy length, volume, or weight between groups. CONCLUSION: Biopsy sites sealed with LigaTie withstood higher airway pressure without leaking compared with TA‐stapled biopsy sites in normal cadaveric specimens. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The LigaTie may be an alternative technique for sealing peripheral lung biopsy sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopsy 3abubbles 3aeuthanasia 3agoats 3alungs 3amodels1 aChen, Chi‐Ya1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6085-98271 aHöglund, Odd V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0978-836X1 aCampbell, Bonnie G.1 aFransson, Boel A.0 tVeterinary surgery.g2019 July, v. 48, no. 5 p.845-849dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl10192x0161-34997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vsu.131713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03168naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245014200161300001600303506011700319506007600436520120800512592002801720506003701748650003001785650001701815650001201832650001501844650001001859650001601869650001901885650002001904650001201924650000901936650001301945650001901958650001101977653000901988653002801997653001402025653001902039653002202058700001302080700001602093700001402109700001802123700001902141700001802160700001502178700001502193700001502208700001802223700001402241700001902255700001702274773016102291856008102452852000902533655001202542IND60745289520221207135830.0220402e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074528952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cj.2021.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Shuqi14aThe osmolyte-producing endophyte Streptomyces albidoflavus OsiLf-2 induces drought and salt tolerance in rice via a multi-level mechanism  ap. 375-386.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDrought and salinity are major environmental stresses that impair crop growth and productivity worldwide. Improving drought and salt tolerance of crops with microbial mutualists is an effective and environmentally sound strategy to meet the demands of the ever-growing world population. In the present study, we found that the Streptomyces albidoflavus OsiLf-2, a moderately salt-tolerant endophytic actinomycete, produced abundant osmolytes, including proline, polysaccharides, and ectoine. Inoculation with OsiLf-2 increased the osmotic-adjustment ability of the rice host by increasing the proline content (by 250.3% and 49.4%) and soluble sugar (by 20.9% and 49.4%) in rice under drought and salt conditions, relative to the uninoculated control. OsiLf-2 increased stress responses in the rice host at the physiological and biochemical levels (photosynthesis efficiency, osmolytes and antioxidant content), and the gene level (osmolytes synthesis, stress-responsive and ion-transport related genes), raising rice yields under both greenhouse and saline–alkaline soil conditions. The use of endophytic actinomycetes offers a promising biotechnological approach to developing stress-tolerant plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStreptomyces albidoflavus 3aantioxidants 3adrought 3aendophytes 3agenes 3agreenhouses 3aphotosynthesis 3apolysaccharides 3aproline 3arice 3asalinity 3asalt tolerance 3asugars 0aRice 0aEndophytic actinomycete 0aOsmolytes 0aSalt tolerance 0aDrought tolerance1 aGao, Yan1 aZi, Huixian1 aLiu, Ying1 aLiu, Xuanming1 aXiong, Xianqiu1 aYao, Qingqing1 aQin, Ziwei1 aChen, Ning1 aGuo, Liang1 aYang, Yuanzhu1 aQin, Peng1 aLin, Jianzhong1 aZhu, Yonghua0 tcrop journal.g2022 Apr., v. 10, no. 2 p.375-386dElsevier B.V.aCrop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop SciencewJournal:23202x2214-51417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cj.2021.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03019naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245008300172300001300255520154000268592002801808650002001836650001801856650002501874650001701899650002001916650001701936650002301953650001401976650001501990650001502005650001702020650002102037650001202058650001002070650001602080651000902096653001902105653002602124653002002150653002502170653003902195700002102234700002402255700002202279773011502301856008802416852000902504655001202513IND60590496920221118072828.0190318e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059049692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2017.12.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchulz, Lee L.10aEconomic impact of university veterinary diagnostic laboratories: A case study  ap. 5-12.  aVeterinary diagnostic laboratories (VDLs) play a significant role in the prevention and mitigation of endemic animal diseases and serve an important role in surveillance of, and the response to, outbreaks of transboundary and emerging animal diseases. They also allow for business continuity in livestock operations and help improve human health. Despite these critical societal roles, there is no academic literature on the economic impact of VDLs. We present a case study on the economic impact of the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ISUVDL). We use economic contribution analysis coupled with a stakeholder survey to estimate the impact. Results suggest that the ISUVDL is responsible for $2,162.46 million in direct output, $2,832.45 million in total output, $1,158.19 million in total value added, and $31.79 million in state taxes in normal years. In an animal health emergency this increases to $8,446.21 million in direct output, $11,063.06 million in total output, $4,523.70 million in total value added, and $124.15 million in state taxes. The ISUVDL receives $4 million annually as a direct state government appropriation for operating purposes. The $31.79 million in state taxes in normal years and the $124.15 million in state taxes in an animal health emergency equates to a 795% and 3104% return on investment, respectively. Estimates of the economic impact of the ISUVDL provide information to scientists, administrators, and policymakers regarding the efficacy and return on investment of VDLs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal diseases 3aanimal health 3abusiness enterprises 3acase studies 3aeconomic impact 3ahuman health 3aindigenous species 3alivestock 3amonitoring 3ascientists 3astakeholders 3astate government 3asurveys 3ataxes 3avalue added 3aIowa 0aAnimal disease 0aEconomic contribution 0aEconomic impact 0aReturn on investment 0aVeterinary diagnostic laboratories1 aHayes, Dermot J.1 aHoltkamp, Derald J.1 aSwenson, David A.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 151 p.5-12dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2017.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02113naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245009700169300002000266500001900286520083800305592002801143650003401171650002101205650001901226650001101245650001801256700001701274700001201291700001601303700002001319700001301339700001601352700001401368700005401382700006001436773012301496856008701619852000901706655001201715IND60713671420221118065106.0201023e20200903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071367142DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c023492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Fuxiang12aA High-Quality Monoclinic Nickel Hexacyanoferrate for Aqueous Zinc–Sodium Hybrid Batteries  ap. 13104-13110.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAqueous rechargeable batteries (ARBs) are expected to be used in future energy storage systems (ESSs) because of their nontoxicity, nonflammability, and ultrahigh ionic conductivity. However, their low energy density and poor cycle stability are two main drawbacks restricting their application. In this work, we synthesized a highly crystalline monoclinic nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) and used it in aqueous zinc–sodium hybrid batteries. Because of its low Fe(CN)₆ vacancy amount and low water content, the monoclinic NiHCF exhibits high specific capacity and excellent cycle and rate performance. The assembled AZSHBs show excellent electrochemical performance, with an average operating voltage up to 1.464 V, high energy density of 99.1 Wh kg–¹, and good cycling stability with 91% capacity retention after 1000 cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy density 3anickel 3awater content1 aYuan, Xinhai1 aXu, Tao1 aZhou, Shiyu1 aXiong, Xiaosong1 aZhou, Qi1 aYu, Nengfei1 aYe, Jilei1 aWu, Yuping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0833-12051 aVan Ree, Teunis,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0126-67970 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Sept. 03, v. 34, no. 10 p.13104-13110dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c023493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03407naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010500164300001600269520184900285592002802134650000802162650001102170650001102181650001202192650002302204650002502227650001502252650002502267650001102292650002002303650001102323650002202334650002202356650002402378650001902402650001002421650002102431651001402452653001902466653001602485653001902501653002702520653002602547653002502573653002102598700001902619700001702638773011802655856008302773852000902856655001202865IND60532623020221119135604.0190415s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053262302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2015.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Brenda10aUnderstanding the potential loss and inequities of green space distribution with urban densification  ap. 952-958.  aUrban population growth is leading to growing concerns about land use change, green infrastructure, and the loss of beneficial ecosystem services. Human and environmental health is supported by services such as climate regulation, air filtration, and flood mitigation. However, maintaining these services within cities requires the preservation and equitable distribution of green infrastructure near where people live. Sydney, Australia, where the population is expected to grow from 4.3million to 5.6million by 2031, is undergoing an urban transformation. This study investigates the spatial distribution of green infrastructure within Sydney to determine how patterns of green infrastructure vary according to land use, residential density, and socio-economic variation. More than half of urban Sydney is comprised of residential land use, representing the single largest contribution to Sydney's green infrastructure. Two types of green infrastructure are examined in this study, public green space represented by parkland area and tree canopy cover and private green space represented by residential area and tree canopy cover. Results show that with greater dwelling density, both types of green infrastructure decrease. Availability of private versus public green infrastructure, however, differs according to socio-economic advantage. Suburbs of higher socio-economic advantage have significantly more private green cover, but slightly less public green cover than suburbs of greater disadvantage. These findings highlight that urban densification can lead to a general loss of two important reservoirs of urban green infrastructure (public parkland and residential tree cover). Disadvantaged communities may have a greater reliance on public green infrastructure in the form of parkland due to a lack of private residential tree cover.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acanopy 3acities 3aclimate 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental health 3afiltration 3agreen infrastructure 3ahumans 3aland use change 3apeople 3apopulation growth 3aresidential areas 3aresidential density 3asocioeconomics 3atrees 3aurban population 3aAustralia 0aUrban planning 0aUrban trees 0aRemote sensing 0aSocio-economic indices 0aEnvironmental justice 0aGreen infrastructure 0aSocial inclusion1 aMeyers, Jacqui1 aBarnett, Guy0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2015, v. 14, no. 4 p.952-958dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2015.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245009100164300001800255520135400273592002801627650001701655650001601672650002301688650002001711700001301731700001801744700001701762773012001779856008201899852000901981655001201990IND60565664820221119035509.0170325e20170309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056566482DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b098612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Li-Yuan10aPressure Profile for an Associating Lennard-Jones Fluid Confined in a Spherical Cavity  ap. 2142-2152.  aWe present the pressure tensor of an associating Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid confined in a spherical cavity of hard wall, where a high-order density correlation has been taken into account. To give the two-body association potential for calculating the pressure tensor, an angle-average of site–site attraction over all orientations of two particles is performed. Furthermore, the classical density functional theory is employed to obtain the density profile of the confined fluid, by which the normal and tangential pressure profiles are illustrated under various conditions to show the dependence of the pressure tensor on the association strength, number of associating sites, radius of cavity, and bulk density. As an application, the corresponding surface tension is calculated. It is shown that under a strong association interaction (both association strength and the number of associating sites are large), the pressure profiles are depleted from the wall of the cavity instead of the oscillatory behavior under a weak association interaction. Such a tendency is mainly determined by the competition between association interaction and excluded volume interaction. Therefore, the aggregation state and related properties of an associating LJ fluid within a confinement of nanoscale can be efficiently regulated by the association interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk density 3amethodology 3aphysical chemistry 3asurface tension1 aGu, Fang1 aWang, Hai-Jun1 aSun, Zong-Li0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 Mar. 09, v. 121, no. 9 p.2142-2152dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.6b098613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245019000160300001800350520133200368592002801700650001701728650002301745650001401768650001901782650002101801650000701822650002101829650001901850650001701869650001201886700001901898700002001917700002501937700002301962700002101985773010502006856007502111852000902186655001202195IND60577843820180713000000.0170810e20130813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057784382DNAL7 a10.1021/ma401070k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaduc, Isabelle10aEffect of the pH on the RAFT Polymerization of Acrylic Acid in Water. Application to the Synthesis of Poly(acrylic acid)-Stabilized Polystyrene Particles by RAFT Emulsion Polymerization  ap. 6013-6023.  aThe reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of acrylic acid (AA) in water was studied in detail at different pHs using 4-cyano-4-thiothiopropylsulfanyl pentanoic acid (CTPPA) as a control agent and 4,4′-azobis(4-cyanopentanoic acid) (ACPA) as an initiator. Well-defined hydrophilic macromolecular RAFT agents (PAA-CTPPA) were obtained and further used directly in water for the polymerization of styrene. The corresponding polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) process was evaluated at different pHs and it was shown that working in acidic conditions (pH = 2.5) led to well-defined amphiphilic block copolymer particles (Đ < 1.4) of small size (below 50 nm). When the pH increased, the control over the growth of the polystyrene (PS) block was gradually lost. Chain extension experiments of PAA-CTPPA with N-acryloylmorpholine (NAM), a hydrosoluble and non-pH sensitive monomer, performed at different pHs showed that the very first addition–fragmentation steps that occurred in water were impeded when PAA was ionized leading to partial consumption of PAA-CTPPA and thus to PS molar masses higher than expected. Varying the PAA-CTPPA concentration at pH = 2.5 led in all cases to stable particles composed of well-defined block copolymers with PS segments of different molar masses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylic acid 3acomposite polymers 3aemulsions 3ahydrophilicity 3amolecular weight 3apH 3apolyacrylic acid 3apolymerization 3apolystyrenes 3astyrene1 aCrepet, Agnès1 aBoyron, Olivier1 aCharleux, Bernadette1 aD’Agosto, Franck1 aLansalot, Muriel0 tMacromolecules.g2013 Aug. 13, v. 46, no. 15 p.6013-6023dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma401070k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01755naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245009600162300001600258520083300274592002801107650001601135650003801151650001501189650002101204700002101225773014001246856008201386852000901468655001201477IND4515787920221120191105.0200928e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451578792DNAL7 a10.1007/s12272-012-0511-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyu, Ji Yoon10aSolid state of a new PDE-5 inhibitor DA-8159: Characterization, dissolution, transformation  ap. 861-866.  aThe polymorphic forms of a new PDE-5 inhibitor DA-8159 were prepared and characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray diffractometry (PXRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TG).

Zn–In spinel-type sorbents exhibited excellent mercury removal performance, and ZnIn₂S₄ sorbent showed Hg⁰ removal efficiency of 96.2% at 125 °C. The effects of flue gas components were examined, and it was found that the presence of SO₂ and H₂O has little effect on Hg⁰ capture. ZnIn₂S₄ has an excellent SO₂- and H₂O-resistance for Hg⁰ capture. O₂ can promote Hg⁰ adsorption over the ZnIn₂S₄ sorbent. The adsorption capacity of the synthesized ZnIn₂S₄ sorbent is as high as 1526 μg·g–¹. Temperature-programmed decomposition desorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses demonstrate that the adsorbed mercury can be transformed into HgS with the sulfur sites of the surface, and the adsorption of elemental mercury on ZnIn₂S₄ sorbent occurs by chemisorption. Density functional theory calculations were carried out to reveal the interactions between the Hg⁰ atom and the ZnIn₂S₄ (110) surface. The results show that the mercury transformation reaction pathway over ZnIn₂S₄ sorbent occurs through two steps: Hg⁰ → HgS(ads) → HgS. The theoretical calculations support the experimental observation that it is difficult for the captured Hg to be released from the sorbent surface. Considering the excellent Hg⁰ removal performance and SO₂- and H₂O-resistance, Zn–In spinel sorbents can serve as a promising material for mercury removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3adensity functional theory 3adesorption 3aenergy 3aflue gas 3amercury 3asorbents 3asulfur1 aYang, Yingju1 aLiu, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6520-96121 aWang, Zhen1 aDing, Junyan0 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Sept. 03, v. 34, no. 10 p.12853-12859dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c023663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245013900157300001600296500002000312520148900332592002801821650002201849650001901871650001301890650002701903650001301930650001101943650001301954650001601967650001801983650001902001650001602020700001902036700001502055700001702070773012302087856007202210852000902282655001202291IND60588175620221120092322.0180103e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058817562DNAL7 a10.1002/ird.21062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Rongjiang10aCalibration and Sensitivity Analysis of Sahysmod for Modeling Field Soil and Groundwater Salinity Dynamics in Coastal Rainfed Farmland  ap. 411-427.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUnderstanding water and salt balances in salt‐affected farming areas is becoming increasingly important because of the growing public interest in controlling salinization. An integrated spatial‐agro‐hydro‐salinity model (SahysMod) was used to model field soil and groundwater salinity dynamics in coastal rainfed farmland, and calibration, error analysis, and sensitivity analysis were performed for the SahysMod model. Results indicated that a leaching efficiency ranging between 0.4 and 0.7 in the root zone, hydraulic conductivity of 0.2 m day⁻¹ and leaching efficiency of 1.2 in the aquifer produced model results best matching the measured data. The predicted root zone soil salinity, average groundwater salinity and level data showed agreement with the observed values when using the determined parameters. Leaching efficiency of the root zone, hydraulic conductivity and leaching efficiency of the aquifer were the most sensitive parameters for soil salinity, groundwater table and groundwater salinity, respectively. Soil and groundwater salinity were moderately sensitive to effective porosity of the root zone and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer, whereas groundwater level was not sensitive to the leaching efficiency of soil and aquifer. It could be concluded that the SahysMod model can be used as a successful tool to model field water and salt balances in soil and aquifers in a coastal rainfed agroecosystem.

An early investigation of the Canadian outbreak suspected that the probable source of the virus was contaminated feed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of feed and other possible factors in the early phase of the PED outbreak in Canadian swine herds. The study period of interest for this case-control study was January 22nd to March 1st, 2014. A case herd was defined as a swine herd with a confirmed positive laboratory diagnostic test (RT-PCR) results for PED virus, along with pigs exhibiting typical clinical signs at the herd level during the study period.A questionnaire was administered to participating producers from the 22 Canadian swine herds enrolled (n = 9 case and n = 13 control herds). Case herd producers were asked to provide information from the initial day of onset of clinical signs and 30 days prior to that day. Control herds were matched to a case herd on the basis of province, herd type and approximate size. The period of interest for a control herd was matched to the initial day of clinical signs of PED for the case herd, along with the 30 days prior to this day. The questionnaire questions focused on herd demographics, biosecurity protocols, live animal movements onto and off sites, deadstock movements, feed and people movements for both the case and control herds. The questionnaire for control herds were based on their matched case’s period of interest, and together with case herds formed a matched stratum. Multivariable exact conditional logistic regression and mixed multivariable logistic regression models, with the matched stratum as a random effect, were used to assess the association between various risk factors and the odds of PED introduction into a herd. After adjusting for biosecurity practices, the odds of a PED occurrence was 38.1 (95% CI: 2.7–531.3) times greater for herds receiving feed from a single feed company that provided potentially contaminated feed (P = 0.007) than herds that did not. The number of live pigs delivered onto sites, semen deliveries and the frequency of deadstock pickups were not associated with PED status during the initial phase of the outbreak in univariable analyses. This study supports the role of potentially contaminated feed from a single feed company as a significant risk factor for PED viral introduction during the early phase of the Canadian outbreak.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosecurity 3acase-control studies 3ademographic statistics 3adiarrhea 3afeed contamination 3aherds 3apeople 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arisk factors 3asemen 3aswine 3aOntario 3aUnited States 0aFC1 0aHPU 0aPED 0aPEDV 0aRT-PCR 0aSDPP 0aCase-control 0aPorcine epidemic diarrhea 0aFeed 0aAnimal movement 0aBiosecurity 0aSwine1 aPoljak, Zvonimir1 aDewey, Cate1 aHarding, John C.S.1 aO’Sullivan, Terri L.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2018 Feb. 01, v. 150 p.101-109dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2017.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01694naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245017500175300001600350520036600366592002800732650002900760650002600789650002800815650001300843650001800856650001400874650001900888653001900907653001800926653001800944653001100962653001500973700001700988700001701005700002101022700001801043773012901061856008501190852000901275655001201284IND60627677620221119092114.0190128e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062767762DNAL7 a10.1080/09583157.2018.15400312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, Arvind Kumar10aSemiochemical footprints of the predaceous coccinellid beetle, Menochilus sexmaculatus, deter Zygogramma bicolorata (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) from feeding on Parthenium  ap. 201-205.  aPresent study assessed if semiochemical cues left by an aphidophagous beetle, M. sexmaculatus influenced foraging behaviour of a phytophagous beetle, Z. bicolorata on noxious weed, P. hysterophorus.

Mycoses vary greatly in severity, there are long-term skin (ringworm), nail or hair infections (tinea capitis), recurrent like vaginal candidiasis or severe, life-threatening systemic, multiorgan infections. In the last few years, increasing importance is attached to the health and economic problems caused by fungal pathogens. There is a growing need for improvement of the availability of antifungal drugs, decreasing their prices and reducing side effects. Searching for novel approaches in this respect, amino acid and protein biosynthesis pathways appear to be competitive. The route that leads from amino acid biosynthesis to protein folding and its activation is rich in enzymes that are descriptive of fungi. Blocking the action of those enzymes often leads to avirulence or growth inhibition. In this review, we want to trace the principal processes of fungi vitality. We present the data of genes encoding enzymes involved in amino acid and protein biosynthesis, potential molecular targets in antifungal chemotherapy, and describe the impact of inhibitors on fungal organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aantifungal agents 3abiosynthesis 3acandidiasis 3adeath 3adrug therapy 3afungi 3agrowth retardation 3apeople 3aprotein synthesis 3aringworm1 aRząd, Kamila1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6209-60820 tAmino acids.g2021 July, v. 53, no. 7 p.961-991dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl52832x0939-44517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-021-03007-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03476naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245008500174520138000259583077101639592002802410650002502438650001702463650002202480650001602502650002202518650002102540653003002561653002202591653003102613653003002644653003602674700002202710700006302732700002102795700002102816700002202837773011302859856008502972852000903057655001203066IND60747429720221118185235.0210911e20211010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074742972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1284742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDin Dar, Mehraj U.10aRETRACTED: Blue Green infrastructure as a tool for sustainable urban development  aThe exponential growth of urban areas is putting a strain on urban land and water resources, besides has serious implications on the urban environment. Blue-Green infrastructure (BGI) is an emerging solution for sustainable urban planning and efficient management of urban spaces. This article highlights the benefits offered by BGI and the available BGI technologies based on available scientific works. The relationship between environmental well-being, human health, and BGI has been examined from several recent literature reviews. The performance of various available BGI techniques and the models available have also been rigorously reviewed by consulting publications, peer-reviewed journal papers, documents, and books published by various sources. A major gap in performance evaluation of different BGI technologies has been attempted to be bridged by discussing in detail the available modelling tools. This review article discusses different BGI programs, strategies, benefits, and the drivers associated with the successful implementation. It will enable urban planners to select the best available BGI technologies based on goal-oriented applications, especially for land and water management. It would also serve to establish and popularize BGI techniques and designs among researchers, planners, and policy makers for application in their respective countries.  aRetracted: October 2021, v.318, p.128474 ; 10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128474zThe article duplicates significant parts of a paper that had already appeared in [Frontiers of Architectural Research, volume 9 (2020), pages 191-202.

In this study, we evaluate the potential of high temporal resolution time‐lapse photography for mapping the dynamics of saturation areas (i.e., areas where water is visually ponding on the surface) on the hillslope scale during natural rainfall. We take 1 image per minute over a 100 × 15 m² depression area on an agricultural field in the Hydrological Open Air Laboratory, Austria. The images are georectified and classified by an automated procedure, using grey intensity as a threshold to identify saturation area. The optimum threshold T is obtained by comparing saturation areas from the automated analysis with the manual analysis of 149 images. T is found to be highly correlated with an image brightness characteristic defined as the greyscale image histogram mode M (Pearson correlation r = 0.91). We estimate T as T = M + C where C is a calibration parameter assumed to be constant during each event. The automated procedure estimates the total saturation area close to the manual analysis with mean normalized root mean square error of 9% and 21% if C is calibrated for each event and taken constant for all events, respectively. The spatial patterns of saturation are estimated with a geometric mean accuracy index of 94% as compared to the manual analysis of the same photos. The patterns are tested against field observations for one date as a preliminary demonstration, which yields a root mean square error of the shortest distance between the measured boundary points and the automatically classified boundary as 23 cm. The usefulness of the patterns is illustrated by exploring run‐off generation processes of an example event. Overall, the proposed classification method based on grey intensity is found to process images with highly varying brightnesses well. It is more efficient than the manual tracing for a large number of images, which allows the exploration of surface flow processes at high temporal resolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageometry 3ahills 3aoverland flow 3aphotography 3arain 3arunoff 3aAustria1 aParajka, Juraj1 aRessl, Camillo1 aStrauss, Peter1 aBlöschl, Günter0 tHydrological processes.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 31, no. 21 p.3610-3627dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.112723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245012900206520117000335592002801505650002401533650001401557650001801571650001001589650001101599650001201610650001701622650002601639650001401665653002501679653000901704653001401713653001001727653001401737653001101751700001601762700001501778700001601793700001601809700001901825700001701844700001601861700001201877700001801889773010301907856008602010852000902096655001202105IND60791615620221121095802.0220921e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079161562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2022.1057442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Junlei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3939-238210aContribution of prgH gene for Salmonella Pullorum to virulence and the expression of NLRP3, Caspase-1 and IL-1β in chickens  aType III secretion system 1 (T3SS1) encoded by Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1) is associated with invasion of host cells by Salmonella, PrgH encoded by prgH gene is an important component of T3SS1. This study aimed to explore the contribution of prgH gene for Salmonella Pullorum to virulence and the expression of NLRP3, Caspase-1 and IL-1β in chickens. A prgH gene deletion mutant (C79-13ΔprgH) was firstly generated, and the result of LD₅₀ showed that deletion of prgH significantly decreased the virulence of Salmonella Pullorum in one-day-old HY-line white chickens, and the colonization also decreased in chickens after loss of prgH. Next, the expressions of NLRP3, Caspase-1, and IL-1β were detected in acute infection model of chickens by qRT-PCR and/or ELISA, respectively, and the results showed that the mutant strain C79-13ΔprgH reduced the expression levels of NLRP3, Caspase-1, and IL-1β in chickens compared to the group infected with the wild type strain C79-13. Taken together, all of these findings indicated that prgH promotes the virulence and the expression of NLRP3, Caspase-1, and IL-1β for Salmonella Pullorum in chickens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella Pullorum 3acaspase-1 3agene deletion 3agenes 3amodels 3amutants 3apathogenesis 3apathogenicity islands 3avirulence 0aSallmonella pullorum 0aprgH 0aVirulence 0aNLRP3 0aCaspase-1 0aIL-1β1 aCheng, Zhao1 aXu, Zhenyu1 aZhi, Lijuan1 aZhang, Yige1 aYuan, Xinzhong1 aPan, Pengtao1 aSun, Weiwei1 aYu, Tao1 aLiu, Tiantian0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2022 Oct., v. 171 p.105744-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2022.1057443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02374naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245006700209300001600276520128700292592002801579650002501607650001701632650001301649650001101662650002301673650001401696650001701710650002001727700002801747700001701775700001601792700002401808773008701832856008401919852000902003655001202012IND60592944120221121035616.0180413e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059294412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2016.09.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAng, Elisa Y.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5596-505110aFree-standing graphene slit membrane for enhanced desalination  ap. 350-355.  aThis study considers two novel ideas to further explore and enhance the graphene membrane for desalination. Firstly, while earlier molecular dynamics (MD) simulations studies have used frozen membranes, free-standing membrane is considered here. Since 2D membranes are usually embedded on porous support in the experimental reverse osmosis (RO) process, the free-standing membrane can more accurately model the behavior expected during operation. This study showed, using MD simulations, that a free-standing nanoporous graphene membrane can provide a higher salt rejection, but lower water permeability as compared to frozen membrane. Secondly, the performance of a slit membrane as compared to a membrane with circular pore is studied. At a pressure of 268 MPa, the critical diameter of circular pore that can maintain perfect salt rejection is found to be 5 Å and the critical size for a slit is determined to be 2.28 Å. It is shown that a slit membrane at its critical size can achieve water flux 3.5 times higher than a membrane with circular pore at its critical radius. This finding highlights the importance of slits over circular pores which can potentially widen the options for the design and fabrication of 2D graphene membranes for experimental verification of RO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3adesalination 3agraphene 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3ananopores 3apermeability 3areverse osmosis1 aNg, T.

In the Solanaceae, each haplotype encodes a single ribonuclease (S‐RNase) and multiple S‐locus F‐box proteins (SLFs), which function as the pistil and pollen SI determinants, respectively. S‐RNase is cytotoxic to self‐pollen, whereas SLFs are thought to collaboratively recognize non‐self S‐RNases in cross‐pollen and detoxify them via the ubiquitination pathway. However, the actual mechanism of detoxification remains unknown. Here we isolate the components of a SCFSᴸF(SCF = SKP1‐CUL1‐F‐box‐RBX1) from Petunia pollen. The SCFSᴸFpolyubiquitinates a subset of non‐self S‐RNases in vitro. The polyubiquitinated S‐RNases are degraded in the pollen extract, which is attenuated by a proteasome inhibitor. Our findings suggest that multiple SCFSᴸFcomplexes in cross‐pollen polyubiquitinate non‐self S‐RNases, resulting in their degradation by the proteasome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPetunia 3ahaplotypes 3aloci 3apistil 3apollen 3aproteins 3aribonucleases 3aubiquitination1 aKubo, Ken‐ichi1 aIsogai, Shin1 aFukao, Yoichiro1 aShirakawa, Masahiro1 aIsogai, Akira1 aTakayama, Seiji0 tplant journal.g2014 June, v. 78, no. 6 p.1014-1021dBlackwell Scientific Publishers and BIOS Scientific Publishers in association with the Society for Experimental Biologyx0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.125283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005200148245019100200300001600391520130000407592002801707650000801735650001901743650001801762650002101780650001101801650001601812650001501828653001601843653001901859653000801878653000901886653002901895700001801924700001501942700005301957700005502010700001802065700005502083773012402138856008302262852000902345655001202354IND60683427820221119063208.0201202e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068342782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.01.0912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Sen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7880-322313aAn organometallic chemistry-assisted strategy for modification of zinc oxide nanoparticles by tin oxide nanoparticles: Formation of n-n heterojunction and boosting NO2 sensing properties  ap. 328-338.  aHere, we report an organometallic chemistry-assisted method for modification of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles by tin oxide (SnO₂) nanoparticles, providing a novel and efficient approach for preparation of metal oxides-based heterojunction. The SnO₂/ZnO heterojunctions were prepared by modification of ZnO nanoparticles with (CH₃)₂SnCl₂ through organometallic chemistry reaction firstly, and subsequently thermal treatment in air atmosphere. The combined characterizations indicate the successful formation of ZnO/SnO₂ heterojunctions with controllable surface oxygen vacancy concentrations by optimizing organometallic chemistry reactions. Most importantly, ZnO-Sn-0.75-based NO₂ sensor delivers the response of 14.3 toward 0.5 ppm NO₂ at 190 °C with response time of 100 s and recovery time of 101 s. It is also found that ZnO-Sn-0.75 sample exhibits better NO₂ sensing performances than ZnO nanoparticles and other ZnO-Sn samples (ZnO-Sn-0.50, and ZnO-Sn-1.0). The excellent sensing performances of ZnO-Sn-0.75 are attributed to the synergistic effect n-n heterojunction and controllable surface oxygen species. The present work opens a generalized avenue for facile, cheap and mass production of transition metal oxides-based heterojunctions for various applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aheat treatment 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen dioxide 3aoxygen 3atin dioxide 3azinc oxide 0aNO2 sensors 0aHeterojunction 0aZnO 0aSnO2 0aOrganometallic chemistry1 aZhang, Yaqing1 aGao, Shang1 aFei, Teng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6571-82701 aZhang, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0118-18491 aZheng, Xuejun1 aZhang, Tong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2690-859X0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 May 01, v. 567 p.328-338dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.01.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03349naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001100149245012000160300001200280520192800292592002802220650000802248650002802256650003402284650001502318650001002333650002002343650001302363650002002376650001802396653001102414653001502425653001302440653001302453653001302466653001202479700001602491700001902507700001602526700001302542700001902555700002102574700001402595700005602609773009802665856008302763852000902846655001202855IND60529704520221117191029.0160717e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052970452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2016.06.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yi10aComparison of different sequencing and assembly strategies for a repeat-rich fungal genome, Ophiocordyceps sinensis  ap. 1-6.  aOphiocordyceps sinensis is one of the most expensive medicinal fungi world-wide, and has been used as a traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. In a recent report, the genome of this fungus was found to be expanded by extensive repetitive elements after assembly of Roche 454 (223Mb) and Illumina HiSeq (10.6Gb) sequencing data, producing a genome of 87.7Mb with an N50 scaffold length of 12kb and 6972 predicted genes. To test whether the assembly could be improved by deeper sequencing and to assess the amount of data needed for optimal assembly, genomic sequencing was run several times on genomic DNA extractions of a single ascospore isolate (strain 1229) on an Illumina HiSeq platform (25Gb total data). Assemblies were produced using different data types (raw vs. trimmed) and data amounts, and using three freely available assembly programs (ABySS, SOAP and Velvet). In nearly all cases, trimming the data for low quality base calls did not provide assemblies with higher N50 values compared to the non-trimmed data, and increasing the amount of input data (i.e. sequence reads) did not always lead to higher N50 values. Depending on the assembly program and data type, the maximal N50 was reached with between 50% to 90% of the total read data, equivalent to 100× to 200× coverage. The draft genome assembly was improved over the previously published version resulting in a 114Mb assembly, scaffold N50 of 70kb and 9610 predicted genes. Among the predicted genes, 9213 were validated by RNA-Seq analysis in this study, of which 8896 were found to be singletons. Evidence from genome and transcriptome analyses indicated that species assemblies could be improved with defined input material (e.g. haploid mono-ascospore isolate) without the requirement of multiple sequencing technologies, multiple library sizes or data trimming for low quality base calls, and with genome coverages between 100× and 200×.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aOphiocordyceps sinensis 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aascospores 3agenes 3agenome assembly 3ahaploidy 3amedicinal fungi 3atranscriptome 0aGenome 0aSequencing 0aAssembly 0aCoverage 0aTrimming 0aRNA-Seq1 aHsiang, Tom1 aYang, Rui-Heng1 aHu, Xiao-Di1 aWang, Ke1 aWang, Wen-Jing1 aWang, Xiao-Liang1 aJiao, Lei1 aYao, Yi-Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7158-29630 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2016 Sept., v. 128 p.1-6dElsevier B.V.x0167-70127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2016.06.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02195naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245010100209300002000310520086700330592002801197653001601225653003001241653001401271653001401285700002501299700001901324700001701343700002701360700002001387700002101407700001801428700001901446700002201465700001701487773019301504856007901697852000901776655001201785IND60517958520221120065123.0160406e20151006xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051795852DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.15105161122doi7 aPMC46034872pmcid7 a263249132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalinowska, Kamila10aArabidopsis ALIX is required for the endosomal localization of the deubiquitinating enzyme AMSH3  ap.

The removal of plasma membrane proteins can occur via the endocytic protein degradation pathway, in which posttranslational modification by ubiquitin plays a key role. The activity of ubiquitinating and deubiquitinating enzymes can determine the ubiquitination status of a given target protein, and it has been shown that both classes of enzymes have important physiological roles. However, how these enzymes themselves are regulated at the molecular level has not yet been completely understood. In this study, we report a possible mechanism by which the deubiquitinating enzyme AMSH3 is regulated by its interacting protein, apoptosis-linked gene-2 interacting protein X (ALIX), in Arabidopsis .  aPublisher supplied data 0aArabidopsis 0aintracellular trafficking 0aubiquitin 0aESCRT-III1 aNagel, Marie-Kristin1 aGoodman, Kaija1 aCuyas, Laura1 aAnzenberger, Franziska1 aAlkofer, Angela1 aPaz-Ares, Javier1 aBraun, Pascal1 aRubio, Vicente1 aOtegui, Marisa S.1 aIsono, Erika0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Oct. 6, v. 112, no. 40 p.E5543-E5551dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.15105161123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01274naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012700169300001500296500001500311520042000326592002800746650000900774650001900783650001200802650001000814653001500824773008800839856004800927852000900975655001200984IND50058790420221120031959.0121003e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005879042DNAL7 a10.1134/S20790961120200592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerkusheva, M.

Among songbirds, individuals are known to alter song type form and usage patterns in contest and mating situations, but studies have not examined how song choice improves signal efficacy during broadcast song. For this study we investigated rock wren Salpinctes obsoletus song type use rates during natural singing bouts. We tested three hypotheses for adaptive song use during broadcast song: 1) birds improve signal content by increasing the use of high quality songs, 2) birds optimize for signal propagation by preferentially using songs that transmit well, and 3) birds maintain energy by reducing the use of costly songs. The study included 19 058 songs sung by 12 individuals, each of which had a measured song repertoire of between 52 and 117 song types which were produced at highly variable rates. Results indicated that rock wrens did not preferentially sing song types with shorter durations or fewer frequency switches, as would be expected if they selected song types to minimize delivery costs. They also did not favor songs with more rapid trills or more frequency switches, as would be expected if they adjusted song use primarily to indicate quality. Focal birds did preferentially sing significantly longer songs with lower bandwidths, lower frequencies, and slower trill rates. Results suggest that natural broadcast singing patterns are shaped more by the benefits of long distance transmission than by the benefits of advertising performance ability or the costs of song production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTroglodytidae 3aanimal communication 3aenergy 3asongbirds1 aWarning, Nathanial0 tJournal of avian biology.g2017 Sept., v. 48, no. 9 p.1254-1262dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0908-88577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.013573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011400161300001800275500002000293520160200313592002801915650001601943650002001959650001501979650002101994650001502015650001102030650001202041650001402053650002202067700003302089700002502122773011102147856007302258852000902331655001202340IND60580546820221119160221.0170921e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058054682DNAL7 a10.1111/jav.013412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Connor, Ryan S.10aDiurnal body temperature patterns in free‐ranging populations of two southern African arid‐zone nightjars  ap. 1195-1204.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEndotherms allocate large amounts of energy and water to the regulation of a precise body temperature (Tb), but can potentially reduce thermoregulatory costs by allowing Tb to deviate from normothermic levels. Many data on heterothermy at low air temperatures (Tₐ) exist for caprimulgids, whereas data on thermoregulation at high Tₐ are largely absent, despite members of this taxon frequently roosting and nesting in sites exposed to high operative temperatures. We investigated thermoregulation in free‐ranging rufous‐cheeked nightjars Caprimulgus rufigena and freckled nightjars Caprimulgus tristigma in the southern African arid zone. Individuals of both species showed labile Tb fluctuating around a single modal Tb (Tb‐ₘₒd). Average Tb‐ₘₒd was 39.7°C for rufous‐cheeked nightjars and 39.0°C for freckled nightjars. In both species, diurnal Tb increased with increasing Tₐ. At Tₐ ≥ 38°C, rufous‐cheeked nightjar mean Tb increased to 42°C, equivalent to 2.3°C above Tb‐ₘₒd. Under similar conditions, freckled nightjar Tb was on average only 1.1°C above Tb‐ₘₒd, with a mean Tb of 40.0°C. Freckled nightjars are one of the most heterothermic caprimulgids investigated to date, but our data suggest that during hot conditions this species maintains Tb within a narrow range above Tb‐ₘₒd, possibly reflecting an evolutionary tradeoff between decreased thermal sensitivity to lower Tb but increased sensitivity to high Tb. These findings reveal how general thermoregulatory patterns at similar Tₐ can vary even among closely related species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaprimulgus 3aair temperature 3aarid zones 3abody temperature 3aendothermy 3aenergy 3anesting 3aorganisms 3aroosting behavior1 aBrigham, Robert Mark,d1960-1 aMcKechnie, Andrew E.0 tJournal of avian biology.g2017 Sept., v. 48, no. 9 p.1195-1204dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0908-88577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.013413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02207naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010000169300001600269520117100285592002801456650001501484650001001499650002601509650001501535650001301550650002301563650002201586650001601608700001901624700002001643700001401663773008701677856008401764852000901848655001201857IND60592944620221121050905.0180413e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059294462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2016.09.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Zhen-Long10aElectronic and optical properties of boron and nitrogen pair co-doped 6,6,12-graphyne nanosheet  ap. 313-320.  aWe investigate the electronic and optical properties of boron-nitrogen pair co-doped 6,6,12-graphyne nanosheets using first-principles calculations. For the electronic band structure, we find the band gap exhibits an even-odd effect with an increase in doping concentration. Exploring the optical properties, we calculate the dielectric function, reflectivity, and absorption coefficient under both parallel and perpendicular polarizations. Remarkably, the co-doped 6,6,12-graphyne shows a broad frequency photo-response. Under parallel polarizations, co-doping leads to a reduced static dielectric constant in the long wavelength limit. Furthermore, the reflectivity and absorption spectra show that the co-doped 6,6,12-graphyne nanosheets are highly sensitive to light from the infrared to the ultraviolet regimes. When doping concentration increases, the maximum reflectivity coefficient increases after an initial decrease under the longitudinal parallel polarization, in contrast to its oscillating behavior under the transverse parallel polarization. For all polarizations, the maximum absorption coefficient varies non-monotonically with doping concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aboron 3adielectric properties 3ananosheets 3anitrogen 3aoptical properties 3aspectral analysis 3awavelengths1 aShao, Zhi-Gang1 aWang, Cang-Long1 aYang, Lei0 tCarbon.g2016 Dec., v. 110 p.313-320dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2016.09.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03849naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245011900164300001400283520200300297592002802300650002202328650002102350650001102371650001402382650001302396650001702409650001302426650001902439650002002458650003502478650002002513650003102533650002102564650001802585650000902603650001302612650002602625650003702651650001302688650001702701650001402718650004302732650002402775650003702799653002802836653002602864653003502890653003102925653001802956700001202974700001602986700001303002700001403015700001803029773008303047856008403130852000903214655001203223IND60581528020221118132851.0171005e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058152802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2017.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Libo10aSpiroplasma eriocheiris induces mouse 3T6-Swiss albino cell apoptosis that associated with the infection mechanism  ap. 75-85.  aSpiroplasma eriocheiris is a novel pathogen similar to the Spiroplasma mirum and also had an ability to infect the newborn mice and caused cataract. Our study was designed to study how S. eriocheiris infects mouse 3T6-Swiss albino cells and to elucidate the cellular molecular pathogenesis of Spiroplasma. FCM analysis and MTT analysis clearly shown that S. eriocheiris could induce 3T6 cell apoptosis and cause cell viability decreased seriously. Immunofluorescence experiments and TEM analysis shown that S. eriocheiris can invade 3T6 cells and form typical inclusion bodies and exhibit vacuolization in vitro. S. eriocheiris-oxytetracycline protection assay show that the infective bacteria already were detected at 1h post infection, and sharply increased at 12h after the bacteria infection. To further study the infection mechanism of S. eriocheiris, global mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling were analyzed after the cells infected with the bacteria. A total of 619 non-redundant annotated transcripts (183 up-regulated and 436 down-regulated) and 22 miRNAs (8 up-regulated and 14 down-regulated) were differential expression after 6h S. eriocheiris infection compared to control group. Integrated analysis shown that homologous genes from differential expression miRNA targets and the differential expression genes of the mRNA microarray were major focused on two important pathways focal adhesion and MAPK signaling pathway. To validate the results of microarray, eight focal adhesion (β-Catenin, Parvin, Grb2 and ERK) and MAPK signaling pathway (FGFR, Grb2, ERK, MKK3, p38 and JNK) genes and the housekeeping gene GAPDH were assayed by qPCR and Western blot to confirm the results. Eight miRNAs (miR-143-3p, miR-214-5p, miR-322-3p, miR-328-5p, miR-351-5p, miR-466h-5p, miR-503-5p and miR-30c-1-3p) and the housekeeping gene U6 miRNA were assayed by qPCR to confirm the results of microarray. All the results help us better understand the infection mechanism of S. eriocheiris.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpiroplasma mirum 3aWestern blotting 3aalbino 3aapoptosis 3abacteria 3abeta catenin 3acataract 3acell viability 3aessential genes 3afluorescent antibody technique 3afocal adhesions 3agene expression regulation 3ainclusion bodies 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amicroRNA 3amicroarray technology 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aneonates 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aSpiroplasma eriocheiris 0a3T6-Swiss albino cell 0aS. eriocheiris-oxytetracycline 0amRNA and microRNA analysis 0aKEGG analysis1 aGu, Wei1 aZhu, Huanxi1 aYao, Wei1 aWang, Wen1 aMeng, Qingguo0 tMolecular Immunology.g2017 Nov., v. 91 p.75-85dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2017.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245012600207500001900333520151400352592002801866650002601894650002101920650002001941650001401961650003001975650001502005650002602020653004102046653002202087653002502109700001702134700001502151700001702166773010102183856008602284852000902370655001202379IND60704602920221118031121.0200831e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070460292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1067332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Yundong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3663-417114aThe landscape of academic articles in environmental footprint family research: A bibliometric analysis during 1996–2018  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResearch on environmental footprint family is useful and meaningful for evaluating environmental performance, which has aroused the increasing attentions of the public, policymakers, and researchers in recent years. Unlike previous studies regarding as a single indicator, the present paper covers various footprint indicators to investigate the overview of the environmental footprint family field using a bibliometric analysis. Two datasets, including all articles and top-cited articles, from the Web of Science Core Collection database between 1996 and 2018 were reviewed. These 668 top-cited articles were considered to analyse four important aspects of the EFF publication performance including journals, authors, institutions, and countries/regions by introducing some quantitative indicators both in quantity and quality. The present study shows the top 16 journals, top 15 scholars, 19 most productive institutions, and 15 most influential countries/regions. Moreover, the present paper analyses the hot issues, research fronts, and future research in the field of environmental footprint family based on all 6680 articles. Using keywords of these publications, we can conclude that life cycle assessment and carbon footprint are the most important topics in this field. The related results of bibliometric analysis will provide a current state and systemic overview of this field, which is helpful for the future researchers to promote the development of the environmental footprint family research.  aPublisher supplied data 3abibliometric analysis 3acarbon footprint 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aenvironmental performance 3alandscapes 3alife cycle assessment 0aEnvironmental footprint family (EFF) 0aAcademic articles 0aEcological footprint1 aLi, Xingchen1 aHu, Xiaoli1 aHu, Xianfeng0 tEcological indicators.g2020 Nov., v. 118 p.106733-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1067333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01757naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245010800207300001600315520072100331592002801052650001501080650001301095650001701108650002101125650001001146650002601156700006001182700002101242773008701263856008401350852000901434655001201443IND60592944720221121050920.0180413e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059294472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2016.09.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRivero, Pablo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7353-550310aSurface properties of hydrogenated diamond in the presence of adsorbates: A hybrid functional DFT study  ap. 469-479.  aWe use an ab initio B3LYP approximation to perform a quantitative analysis of the electronic and structural properties of hydrogen terminated (100), (110), and (111) diamond surfaces.

An example of this phenomenon is the monitoring of the formation and dynamics of seabird colonies; one of the reasons for colony failure is disturbances caused by the presence of researchers or conservation managers during data collection. In this study, an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) was used throughout the breeding period to monitor the temporal and spatial dynamics of a black‐headed gull colony in the interior of a difficult‐to‐access island. This methodology permitted weekly visits to the colony without disturbance, which allowed for the continuous collection of spatial and temporal data on the process of colony formation. We obtained detailed information about nesting success and its relation with the distance to the nearest incubating neighbour, as well as the colony boundary along breeding season. Thus, we successfully monitored the dynamics of a bird colony and identified factors affecting individual decision making in colony formation using a UAS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarus ridibundus 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3adata collection 3adecision making 3ahumans 3amanagers 3amonitoring 3anesting 3aseabirds 3aunmanned aerial vehicles1 aBota, Gerard1 aPadilla, Núria1 aBrotons, Lluis1 aSardà, Francesc0 tJournal of avian biology.g2017 Sept., v. 48, no. 9 p.1273-1280dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0908-88577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.015353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03636naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245012800173520198600301592002802287650002102315650002502336650003002361650001802391650002402409650001302433650002002446650001402466650001302480650002902493650002002522650001502542650001702557650001302574650001402587650001602601650001802617650001102635650001402646650001002660653001302670653001202683653001802695653001302713653001802726653002302744700002202767700002402789700001902813700002402832773011802856856008702974852000903061655001203070IND60773023820221123022151.0220621e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077302382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2022.1043952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinto, Ciro P.G.10aProteotranscriptomics reveals the secretory dynamics of teratocytes, regulators of parasitization by an endoparasitoid wasp  aParasitoid wasps have evolved sophisticated mechanisms of host regulation that establish a favorable environment for the development of immature parasitoids. While maternal venom and symbiotic virus-like particles are well-known mechanisms of host regulation, another less-studied mechanism is the secretion of host regulation factors by cells called teratocytes, extra-embryonic cells released during parasitoid larval eclosion. Consequently, identification and characterization of teratocyte secretory products has not been reported in detail for any parasitoid wasp. We aimed to analyze teratocyte secretory products released into hemolymph of the larval sugarcane borer Diatraea saccharalis (Fabricius, 1794) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) by its biological control agent, the koinobiont endoparasitoid wasp Cotesia flavipes Cameron, 1891 (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). Teratocytes were released upon eclosion of parasitoid larvae four days after parasitization (DAP) and increased in number and size until six DAP. Total D. saccharalis hemocyte viability was reduced immediately after parasitization until DAP 2, while total hemocyte count was lower from the third DAP, and phenoloxidase and lysozyme activity were disrupted compared to non-parasitized controls. To examine the secretory products of teratocytes, we generated a teratocyte transcriptome and compared its in silico translated open reading frames to mass spectra obtained from hemolymph from parasitized and unparasitized hosts. This led to the identification of 57 polypeptides secreted by teratocytes, the abundance of which we tracked over 0–10 DAP. Abundant teratocyte products included proteins similar to bracovirus proteins and multiple disulfide-rich peptides. Most teratocyte products accumulated in hemolymph, reaching their highest concentrations immediately before parasitoid pupation. Our results provide insights into host regulation by teratocytes and reveal molecules that may be useful in biotechnology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCotesia flavipes 3aDiatraea saccharalis 3abiological control agents 3abiotechnology 3acomputer simulation 3aeclosion 3aendoparasitoids 3ahemocytes 3alysozyme 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3aparasitic wasps 3aparasitism 3apolypeptides 3apupation 3asecretion 3ateratocytes 3atranscriptome 3avenoms 3aviability 3awasps 0aDefensin 0aPeptide 0aPhenoloxidase 0aLysozyme 0aImmune system 0aBiological control1 aWalker, Andrew A.1 aRobinson, Samuel D.1 aKing, Glenn F.1 aRossi, Guilherme D.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2022 May,  June, v. 139 p.104395-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45772x0022-19107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2022.1043953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016600167520132700333592002801660650002301688650001101711650001001722650002001732650001001752650004101762650001301803650002301816650001601839650001001855650003101865650001001896653001601906653003801922653001201960700005801972700006302030773011202093856008102205852000902286655001202295IND60670262220221120213437.0191002e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067026222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1086652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRusinek, Robert10aApplication of an electronic nose with novel method for generation of smellprints for testing the suitability for consumption of wheat bread during 4-day storage  aThe paper presents application of an Agrinose with novel three-parameter method for generation of smellprints to test the suitability of bread for consumption during four-day storage. Gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the headspace was applied to describe the volatile metabolite contents. The CIE L*a*b* colour scale was used to identify changes in the colour during storage and the puncture and penetration tests were used to describe the hardness and staling, as a reference methods for testing bread. The process of bread staling in aerobic conditions was correlated with changes in the crumb colour, hardness, and emission of volatile substances. The analysis of volatile compounds emitted from bread stored in quasi-anaerobic conditions demonstrated a relationship between the responses of resistance sensors and the quantity and quality of groups of volatile substances in the general aroma. The highest sensitivity to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) generated by spoiled bread were noted in the case of sensors for food tests, i.e. AS-MLV-P2 and TGS2603. The Agrinose coupled with three-parameters method could accurately predict the fungal grow on bread stored in quasi-anaerobic conditions and can be used as a rapid and non-destructive tool for early detection of fungal infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerobic conditions 3abreads 3acolor 3aelectronic nose 3afungi 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahardness 3aheadspace analysis 3ametabolites 3aodors 3avolatile organic compounds 3awheat 0aWheat bread 0aVolatile organic compounds (VOCs) 0aStaling1 aGancarz, Marek1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4719-29541 aNawrocka, Agnieszka1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8618-20920 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Jan., v. 117dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1086653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245013400179300001600313520117700329592002801506650002201534650001501556650001901571650002501590650001401615650001301629650001501642650002101657650001801678650001501696650001401711650001401725650001701739650001101756650001301767650001901780700002301799700002301822700003101845773008701876856008401963852000902047655001202056IND60592944920221121050834.0180413e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059294492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2016.09.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarpeta-Kaczmarek, Julia10aEffects of short-term exposure of Acheta domesticus to nanodiamonds in food: DNA damage but no histological alteration in tissues  ap. 458-468.  aThe aim of this work is to evaluate toxicity of nanodiamonds (ND, 20 and 200 mg g⁻¹ food) to Acheta domesticus after short-term exposure (10 days) in food. Catalase (CAT), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), stress protein level (HSP70) and DNA damage to hemocytes were monitored every two days. On day 2 and 10, the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), apoptosis (annexin V and multicaspase tests), cell cycle and DNA damage to the gut were examined. The ultrastructure of the gut epithelium and testis was assessed on day 10 of the experiment. CAT, TAC, HSP70 in hemolymph, and histological morphology of gut and testis did not indicate ND toxicity. In the gut we observed a transient increase in CAT activity on day 2,4 and 6; and an increase in HSP70 level on day 6, 8 and 10. TAC level in the gut did not increase until day 10. ND did not influence ROS level in cells and the cell cycle. Yet, we observed a moderate increase in apoptosis, particularly at the higher ND concentration. ND induced dose-dependent DNA damage. We can conclude that short-term, occasional exposure to trace amounts of ND, like in medical applications, is probably safe for organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcheta domesticus 3aDNA damage 3aacute exposure 3aantioxidant activity 3aapoptosis 3acatalase 3acell cycle 3adigestive system 3adose response 3aepithelium 3ahemocytes 3ahistology 3ananodiamonds 3atestes 3atoxicity 3aultrastructure1 aDziewięcka, Marta1 aAugustyniak, Maria1 aRost-Roszkowska, Magdalena0 tCarbon.g2016 Dec., v. 110 p.458-468dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2016.09.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02318naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008100171300001400252520116300266592002801429650002501457650001501482650002001497650001701517650002801534650002701562650001301589653001901602653001601621653002601637653001901663653001501682700001901697700002001716773010101736856008601837852000901923655001201932IND60537851320221116175547.0190408e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053785132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2013.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlignaut, James10aRestoration of natural capital: A key strategy on the path to sustainability  ap. 54-61.  aThree intertwining braids or strategies to enable transition towards sustainability can be identified, namely: (i) appropriate sustainable technologies, (ii) revising behaviour including reproduction and consumption patterns, and (iii) investment in the restoration of natural capital (RNC). Less explored than the first two, “RNC-thinking” might be the game-changer. Recent evidence suggests that not only is restoration urgently required from a biophysical perspective, but also that it makes eminently good economic sense to make that investment. The alternative to this triple approach is the prevailing paradigm that treats the world as if it were a “business in liquidation”, as pathfinder economist Herman Daly put it. Not only is the restoration of natural capital both ecologically and economically beneficial, as indicated herein with benefit–cost ratios varying between (on average) 0.4 (for coastal systems) and 110 (for coastal wetlands including mangroves) with the majority of ecosystems recording an average of an BC-ratio of about 10, it also holds an important key to unlock future sustainable growth and development trajectories.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aecosystems 3anatural capital 3areproduction 3asustainable development 3asustainable technology 3awetlands 0aSustainability 0aRestoration 0aRestoration economics 0aCost–benefit 0aEcosystems1 aAronson, James1 aGroot, Dolf de,0 tEcological engineering.g2014 Apr., v. 65 p.54-61dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2013.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03339naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006900147245015400216500002200370520148900392592002801881650002001909650002301929650001301952650001001965650002401975650002201999650004102021650002302062650002802085650001902113650001802132650001002150650003102160650002302191650003202214650001202246650001602258650002302274650001202297650001102309653002002320653005202340653003102392653003402423700005302457700002902510700002802539700001802567773011002585856008102695852000902776655001202785IND60670262320221120213342.0191002e20190922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067026232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1086662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlenyorege, Evans Adingba1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2418-913810aEffect of sequential multi-frequency ultrasound washing processes on quality attributes and volatile compounds profiling of fresh-cut Chinese cabbage  aPre-press version  aThe objective of the current investigation was to assess the microbial quality, physicochemical parameters, volatiles profile and sensory quality of fresh-cut Chinese cabbage samples exposed to dual frequency ultrasound (DFU1: 20–40 kHz; DFU2: 20–60 kHz; and DFU3: 40–60 kHz) and triple frequency ultrasound (TFU: 20–40–60 kHz) washing processes. The natural microbiota (total bacteria, yeasts and molds), physicochemical quality (instrumental colour, texture, electrolyte leakage, and microstructure), volatile compounds and sensorial quality (texture, colour, odour, appearance and general acceptability) were determined. Counts of total bacteria, yeast and molds were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) with TFU, which in general reduced 3.1 and 2.8 decades respectively. However, the results indicated that TFU washing of Chinese cabbage brought about undesirable changes in physicochemical and volatile compounds attributes whereas the DFU preserved or enhanced these attributes. Forty-three (43) volatile compounds were identified and quantified by HS-SPME-GC-MS analysis, six (6) of which had odour activity values greater than 1 (OAVs > 1) and were considered as aroma active compounds (AACs) contributing substantially to the core aroma profile of the Chinese cabbage. Finally, DFU washing according to an affective sensory tests on treated samples, presented positive sensory characteristics with better general acceptability compared to TFU washing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese cabbage 3aactive ingredients 3abacteria 3acolor 3aelectrolyte leakage 3afresh-cut produce 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheadspace analysis 3amicrobiological quality 3amicrostructure 3amolds (fungi) 3aodors 3aphysicochemical properties 3asensory evaluation 3asolid phase microextraction 3atexture 3aultrasonics 3avolatile compounds 3awashing 3ayeasts 0aUltrasonication 0aHeadspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) 0aOdour activity value (OAV) 0aAroma active compounds (AACs)1 aMa, Haile1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7783-499X1 aAheto, Joshua Harrington1 aAgyekum, Akwasi Akomeah1 aZhou, Cunshan0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2019 Sept. 22, dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1086663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02097naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245010300156300001800259500002000277520105200297592002801349650001001377650001301387650002001400650002401420650001301444650001101457650003001468650001301498650002001511700002301531773011101554856007301665852000901738655001201747IND60580547220221119155945.0170921e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058054722DNAL7 a10.1111/jav.012672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarve, Sahas10aElevational replacement of two Himalayan titmice: interspecific competition or habitat preference?  ap. 1189-1194.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aElevational species replacement is a widely documented pattern in montane species. Although interspecific competition has been shown to be important in setting species elevational limits in tropical habitats, its effect in species of temperate regions is poorly studied. We tested the role of interspecific competition for space in the breeding season and for food in the non‐breeding season in mediating the distribution of two resident titmice species in the Himalayas. We show that high elevation green‐backed tits Parus monticolus are behaviourally dominant over low elevation cinereous tits Parus cinereus in both song playback and feeder trials. Despite being subordinate, at their elevational upper limit, cinereous tits occur in sympatry in human modified habitats. Our study suggests that the loss of natural habitats in the sympatric zone, not interspecific competition, might be limiting the distribution of the high‐elevation green‐backed tits and facilitating an upward range shift through human association in cinereous tits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParus 3aaltitude 3abreeding season 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3ainterspecific competition 3asympatry 3atemperate zones1 aDhondt, André A.,0 tJournal of avian biology.g2017 Sept., v. 48, no. 9 p.1189-1194dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0908-88577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.012673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003800151245008400189520171500273592002801988650002202016650001702038650001502055650001102070650002502081650001702106651001102123653002402134653001102158653002202169653002102191653001602212653003502228700002802263700002802291773011302319856008602432852000902518655001202527IND60747430720221119215458.0220706e20211010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074743072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1285452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWerderits Silva, Dayana Elizabeth10aPrevention of food waste and alternative destinations for unused food in Brazil  aFood loss and waste (FLW) result in significant social, economic, and environmental costs. Although FLW occurs at different levels of food supply chains, retailers can play a key role in the fight against this issue. Food loss (FL) is a decrease in the quantity or quality of food resulting from decisions and actions by food suppliers in the chain, while food waste (FW) refers to the result of decisions and actions by retailers, food service providers, and consumers. Various public policies aimed at fighting FLW and determining alternative destinations for unused food have been implemented around the world. Brazil has established the National Policy on Solid Waste and passed legislation addressing the fight against hunger. These measures have made retailers seek ways to minimize FW and find destination alternatives. This paper introduces the description of an FW in retail supermarkets and strategies for the prevention of FW and alternative destination for unused food that have been adopted (or can be adopted) in Brazil. This is a multi-case study, with data collected through bibliographic and document research and interviews with managers. The results showed that the food categories with greater perishability (fruits, vegetables, butchery, and bakery) also have a higher percentage of loss. The main reasons for these losses were operational breakdowns (management failures) and internal and external theft. A greater number of prevention strategies were observed in regional networks compared to local and independent companies. For all cases, the sale of recyclable goods and proper disposal in landfills were pointed out as the main strategies for alternative destinations of unused food.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood availability 3afood service 3afood waste 3ahunger 3alaws and regulations 3asolid wastes 3aBrazil 0aFood loss and waste 0aRetail 0aFood supply chain 0aWaste management 0aSolid waste 0aNational policy on solid waste1 ada Silva César, Aldara1 aConejero, Marco Antonio0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Oct. 10, v. 318 p.128545-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1285453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03404naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072001700166072001700183072001700200100002100217245011900238300001800357520144300375650001801818650001001836650002001846650002101866650001101887650001801898650002601916650002201942650004301964650001902007650000802026650002002034650002202054650001402076650002702090650001802117650005202135650003002187650001602217650001902233650002002252650002402272650001302296650002602309650003502335650002002370700002502390700001802415700002402433700001902457700002502476773007602501852000902577856008702586930003302673945002502706946001102731655001202742IND4413557520221119223012.0081210e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441355752DNAL7 a191935672pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/28.12.18412doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aFernandes, Pedro10aCryopreservation of Quercus suber somatic embryos by encapsulation-dehydration and evaluation of genetic stability  ap. 1841-1850.  aWe describe an encapsulation and dehydration procedure for the cryopreservation of cork oak (Quercus suber L.) somatic embryos that resulted in at least 90% survival. Genetic stability of the regenerated material was assessed by flow cytometry (FCM), amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and simple sequence repeats (SSR). Cryopreservation of embryogenic clusters involved encapsulation of each cluster in an alginate bead, followed by a 3-day culture in 0.7 M sucrose and subsequent desiccation to 25 or 35% water content (WC), followed by freezing in liquid nitrogen. Thawed, cryopreserved somatic embryos had high viability and exhibited long-term survival. No morphological differences were observed between somatic embryos desiccated to 25 and 35% WC. Analysis of DNA ploidy stability of control (i.e., encapsulated and dehydrated but not frozen) and cryopreserved material by flow cytometry showed no significant differences. Similarly, DNA-marker analyses (AFLPs and SSR) revealed no significant differences between control and cryopreserved samples at the DNA-sequence level. Nonetheless, because polymorphisms were found between control material and samples cryopreserved and desiccated to 25% WC, the 35% WC method is recommended for cryopreservation of this tissue type. Cryopreservation of Q. suber somatic embryos by this encapsulation-dehydration procedure has potential for use in long-term conservation programs. 3aQuercus suber 3atrees 3asomatic embryos 3acryopreservation 3adrying 3aencapsulation 3asomatic embryogenesis 3agenetic stability 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aflow cytometry 3aDNA 3agenetic markers 3asequence analysis 3aviability 3agermplasm conservation 3atree breeding 2aAmplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis 2aCryopreservationxmethods 2aDesiccation 2aFlow Cytometry 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenomic Instability 2aPloidies 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aQuercusxembryologyxgenetics. 2aSeedsxgenetics1 aRodríguez, Eleazar.1 aPinto, Gloria1 aRoldan-Ruiz, Isabel1 aLoose, Marc de1 aSantos, Conceição.0 tTree physiology.g2008 Dec., v. 28, no. 12 p.1841-1850x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/28.12.18413Available from publisher's Web site  a20081217b20090206c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/12/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02931naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001900172245007800191300001600269500002400285520147500309650002001784650002001804650002001824650001601844650001801860650001401878650001501892650002801907650001401935650001001949650002501959650002101984650001502005651001402020651001002034653001802044700001602062700001502078700001902093700002002112773012202132852000902254856006902263930003302332945002502365946001102390655001202401IND4384237120221119223007.0061011e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438423712DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-005-1654-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF110 0aF200 0aF6001 aKaruniawan, A.10aVigna vexillata (L.) A. Rich. Cultivated as a Root Crop in Bali and Timor  ap. 213-217.  aIncludes references  aVigna vexillata is considered as a pantropical distributed wild species closely related to the cowpea (Vigna uniculata) and adapted to infertile soils. The species is occasionally used for its storage roots as well as forage and erosion control plant. The objective of this study was to pursue personal communications that V. vexillata has be transformed into a cultivar in Indonesia. Seven Indonesian islands were visited (Java, Bali, Sumba, Flores, Timor, Kalimantan and Sulawesi). Wild V. vexillata was found in Java, Bali, Sumba, Flores and Timor, occasionally used as wild 'forest food', and cultivated V. vexillata was found in Bali and Timor, Seven cultivars were collected and two of these were made available for the National Botanic Garden of Belgium. The cultivars were primarily cultivated for their storage roots, propagated by seeds, required no scarified seeds for good germination and formed non-dehiscent pods. On-farm root yields of 18-30 t ha-1 and seed yields of 0.7-1.2 t ha-1 were estimated. A brief discussion about the common names of wild V. vexillata is given and it is proposed to use the name 'tuber cowpea' for V. vexillata accessions which are cultivated for their storage roots. The material may be of interest for regions, where the growing season is too short or the rainfall too low for sweet potato and cassava as well as to incorporate cultivar characteristics into wild V. vexillata accessions which are used for their storage roots. 3aVigna vexillata 3aroot vegetables 3avegetable crops 3awild plants 3adomestication 3acultivars 3awild foods 3aplant genetic resources 3anew crops 3aseeds 3aseed crop production 3aseed germination 3acrop yield 3aIndonesia 3aTimor 0atuber cowpeas1 aIswandi, A.1 aKale, P.R.1 aHeinzemann, J.1 aGruneberg, W.J.0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2006 Feb., v. 53, no. 1 p.213-217dKluwer Academic Publishersx0925-98647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-005-1654-53electronic resource  a20061208b20070102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02532naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245011300167300001600280520110800296650001701404650001201421650001301433650001101446650002201457650003501479650000901514650001601523650002201539650001301561650000901574650002201583650003501605653002201640653001901662700001501681700001701696700001401713700001301727700001301740700001301753700001501766773011201781852000901893856009201902930003301994946001102027655001202038IND4429204720221119222943.0091127e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442920472DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0523.2009.01639.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKomori, T.10aIsolation and functional analysis of the gene controlling the stub-spreading trait in rice (Oryza sativa L.)  ap. 568-575.  aThe stub-spreading trait, also designated as 'tiller angle', is one of the components that determine the plant type. In rice, the trait is quite important because of its close relationship to the yield performance. The Spk(t) gene is a major determinant of the trait in the cross of 'Kasalath' (indica) and 'Nipponbare' (japonica). In this study, the Spk(t) gene was isolated by a map-based cloning strategy. Sequence analysis of the cDNA clones from the locus revealed that the Spk(t) transcripts and the spk(t) transcripts encode identical 259-aa proteins of unknown function; however, the structure of the 3′-untranslated region of each allele is quite different. Additional transgenic experiments in rice demonstrated that the difference is caused by a single-nucleotide polymorphism at the 3′-splicing site specific to the Spk(t) allele which thereby plays a critical role in the phenotypic expression. In addition to revealing the molecular mechanism underlying the allele differentiation at the Spk(t) locus, the information presented here should be useful for breeding of this trait in rice. 3aOryza sativa 3aalleles 3abreeding 3aclones 3acomplementary DNA 3agenetically modified organisms 3aloci 3amajor genes 3amolecular cloning 3aproteins 3arice 3asequence analysis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0amap-based cloning 0astub-spreading1 aMiyata, M.1 aYamamoto, T.1 aNitta, N.1 aHiei, Y.1 aYano, M.1 aUeki, J.1 aKomari, T.0 tPlant breeding.g2009 Dec., v. 128, no. 6 p.568-575dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0523.2009.01639.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091127b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02616naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008100126300001600207500014300223500002400366520128100390650001901671650001301690650002101703650001201724650001001736650002401746650001001770650002301780650001201803650001301815650001401828650003001842650001601872650001401888650002201902650002201924700001301946773014001959852000902099856008602108655001202194IND4468500920221119222621.0130607s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446850092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrens, F.A.10aGenomic tools and prospects for new breeding techniques in flower bulb crops  ap. 139-147.  aPaper presented at the II Genetically Modified Organisms in Horticulture Symposium, held September 11-15, 2011, White River, South Africa.  aIncludes references  aFor many of the new breeding techniques sequence information is of the utmost importance. In addition to current breeding techniques, such as marker-assisted selection (MAS) and genetic modification (GM), new breeding techniques such as zinc finger nucleases, oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis, RNAi and cisgenesis are totally dependent on knowing gene or allele sequences. Many plant species have been fully sequenced, but none of them represents an ornamental crop, let alone a member of the monocotyledonous, bulbiferous geophyte order, such as the Liliales. For a limited number of these flower bulb species, some EST-libraries have been generated and a similarly low number of promoters and genes have been isolated, characterized, or used for transformation. Most of the functional analyses and applications in genetically modified crops were ectopic, i.e., not in flower bulb crops themselves. Genes and promoters originating from other organisms have been used in GM of flower bulbs aiming for the introduction of disease resistance or the modification of flower traits. In order to enhance consumer acceptance of transgenic GM flower bulbs and to facilitate obtaining EU approval for cultivation and market introduction, the marker-free technology is being tested. 3aEuropean Union 3aLiliales 3aRNA interference 3aalleles 3abulbs 3aconsumer acceptance 3acrops 3adisease resistance 3aflowers 3agenomics 3ageophytes 3amarker-assisted selection 3amutagenesis 3anucleases 3atransgenic plants 3azinc finger motif1 aKamo, K.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Feb., , no. 974 p.139-147dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/974/974_16.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02438naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245013300125300001400258500014300272500002400415520099100439650001901430650001401449650002301463650002601486650001601512650001201528650003101540650001001571650002901581650002201610651001101632651001801643700001701661700001601678700002101694700001501715700001501730700001401745700001901759773012001778852000901898856008501907655001201992IND4468499920221119222618.0130607s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446849992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScorza, R.10a'HoneySweet' - a transgenic Plum pox virus resistant plum - from laboratory and experimental field plots, to regulatory approval  ap. 57-63.  aPaper presented at the II Genetically Modified Organisms in Horticulture Symposium, held September 11-15, 2011, White River, South Africa.  aIncludes references  aOver the past 20 years an intensive international research project has focused on the development of GE resistance to Plum pox virus (PPV), the causative agent of Sharka, one of the most destructive diseases of plum and other stone fruits. A result of this effort has been the development of 'HoneySweet' plum, a GE cultivar that has proven to be highly resistant to PPV, as demonstrated in over 15 years of study and field testing in the US and Europe. The efficacy and safety of 'HoneySweet' demonstrated in many laboratory, greenhouse and field studies have been validated through the successful regulatory approval of this PPV resistant GE plum cultivar in the US. The international collaborative program that produced 'HoneySweet' demonstrates the potential for publicly-fund research and development to provide safe, efficacious GE products for the benefit of growers and consumers. 'HoneySweet' plum represents a valuable genetic resource for PPV control in the US and in Europe. 3aPlum pox virus 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3afield experimentation 3agreenhouses 3agrowers 3alaboratory experimentation 3aplums 3aresearch and development 3atransgenic plants 3aEurope 3aUnited States1 aCallahan, A.1 aDardick, C.1 aRavelonandro, M.1 aCambra, M.1 aZagrai, I.1 aPolak, J.1 aMalinowski, T.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Feb., , no. 974 p.57-63dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/974/974_6.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02265naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007900125300001600204500018800220500002400408520100000432650002201432650002001454650001801474650001101492650002401503650002501527650001901552650001601571650001501587650001601602650001201618700002301630700002101653773012201674852000901796856008601805655001201891IND4468502920221119222742.0130607s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446850292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoubol, J.10aMicrobiology and quality of fresh-cut 'Kimju' guava treated with hot water  ap. 135-138.  aPaper presented at the I International Conference on Postharvest Pest and Disease Management in Exporting Horticultural Crops - PPDM2012, held February 21-24, 2012, Bangkok, Thailand.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of hot water treatment at 40-60°C for 10-30 min on microbial populations and quality of fresh-cut 'Kimju' guava during storage at 10°C were studied.

A significant 1-1.5 log reduction in total microbial count, coliforms, and lactic acid bacteria of fresh-cut guava treated with hot water at 50-60°C for 10-30 min was found during storage at 10°C. Fungal counts on fresh-cut guava were undetectable after immersion in hot water. A slight decrease in fungal counts during storage was found when fruit had been treated with hot water at all temperatures. Hot water treatment at 50°C for 10 and 30 min was found to be capable of reducing microbial populations on fresh-cut guava without changes in texture or increasing disorders. However, browning was observed in fresh-cut guava treated with hot water at 60°C.

The role of increased mineral intake associated with diabetic hyperphagia on tissue trace element accumulation was evaluated by feeding control and diabetic rats high-carbohydrate (HC) diets which varied in Zn, Cu, Mn, and Mg concentrations. Diabetic rats were hyperphagic and had lower plasma Mg, and higher liver Zn, Cu, and Mn concentrations than control rats, regardless of dietary mineral intake. In a second study, diabetic hyperphagia was reduced by feeding control and diabetic rats a HC, high-fat (HF), or high-protein (HP) diet; the effects of altering diabetic metabolism on trace element status was studied. Liver Mn and Zn concentrations of diabetic rats fed the HF diet were lower than diabetic rats fed the HC diet and HP diet, and were simliar to control rats. Liver Cu concentrations of diabetic rats fed the HF and HP diets were lower than diabetic rats fed the HC diet and were similar to control rats. While diabetic rats, in general, had higher plasma glucagon concentrations and lower percent body fat than control rats, diabetic rats fed the HF diet had slmilar plasma glucagon and percent body fat to control rats. These data suggest that tissue-specitic biochemical needs, such as the need for metals as cofactors for enzymes, rather than hyperphagia per se, may drive the accumulatlon of trace elements in the diabetic animal. 3adietary carbohydrate 3adietary minerals 3azinc 3acopper 3amanganese 3amagnesium 3adietary protein 3aenergy metabolism 3aovereating 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aBody Composition 2aBody Weight 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxmetabolism 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aGlucagonxblood 2aHematocrit 2aHyperphagiaxmetabolism 2aInsulinxblood 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMagnesiumxblood 2aMale 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aTrace Elementsxmetabolism 0aexperimental diabetes1 aUriu-Hare, J.Y.1 aTrapp, C.L.1 aStern, J.S.1 aKeen, C.L.0 tProceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.g1994 Oct., v. 207, no. 1 p.67-75x0037-97277nnas  aDNAL  a19950203b19950222c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02137naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245005900190300001400249520102900263650001501292650001501307650001501322650001601337650003801353650001101391650002801402650002301430650002501453653001901478700001701497773010401514852000901618856009201627930003301719946001101752655001201763IND4421384720221119222605.0090605e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442138472DNAL7 a195151402pmid7 a10.1111/j.1600-0463.2009.02477.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKARPMAN, DIANA14aThe contact/kinin and complement systems in vasculitis  ap. 48-54.  aVasculitides are a group of conditions with marked inflammation in and around vessel walls and vascular leakage. These conditions may involve the presence of auto-antibodies such as ANCA or may be mediated by other autoimmune or pathogenic mechanisms. Regardless of the primary trigger, vasculitides entail activation of the complement system as well as the contact/kinin system. In vivo and in vitro data support the involvement of these systems showing activation of the alternative, classical and lectin complement pathways as well as release of bradykinin at sites of vascular inflammation. This short review will summarize some of the data regarding the participation of these systems and the interplay between the complement and kinin systems as well as their interaction with the endothelium and neutrophils. Although these systems do not play a primary role in induction of vasculitis, the peptides released contribute to inflammation and vascular leakage and may thus be identified as potential therapeutic targets. 3acomplement 3abradykinin 3avasculitis 3aendothelium 2aComplement Activationxphysiology 2aHumans 2aKallikreinsxphysiology 2aKininsxphysiology 2aVasculitisxetiology 0acontact system1 aKahn, Robin.0 tAPMIS.g2009 June, v. 117, no. s127 p.48-54dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0903-46417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0463.2009.02477.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090605b20090703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03171naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245004700145300001600192500001500208520138400223650002301607650001001630650002301640650001601663650001501679650002201694650000901716650001601725650001601741650001201757650003001769650005801799650004901857650003701906650001101943650001501954650003401969650004102003650000902044650002902053650004002082650003102122650002902153650004402182650000902226650002502235650002402260653002502284700001502309700002202324700001602346700001702362773012302379852000902502939003302511946001302544655001202557IND9303891820221119223054.0930629e199303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930389182DNAL7 a76797952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPorter, J.K.10aNeurotransmitters in rats fed fumonisin B1  ap. 360-364.  a2019-12-05  aFumonisin B1, a toxin produced by Fusarium moniliforme, has been associated with a neurotoxic syndrome in horses known as equine leukoencephlomalacia. Previous investigations showed that F. moniliforme cultured on corn and incorporated into rat chow increased brain 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA) and 5HIAA: serotonin (5HT) ratios in these animals. Therefore, this study was undertaken to determine whether fumonisin B1 would produce related neurochemical effects in the brain and pineal gland of male and female rats. Rats were fed fumonisin B1 at 15, 50, and 150 ppm for 4 weeks. No differences occurred in brain concentrations of norepinephrine, dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-methoxytyramine, homovanillic acid, 5HT, 5HIAA, and the 5HIAA to 5HT ratios in either male or female rats, nor where there differences between the sexes. When compared across sexes, the norepinephrine to dopamine ratios were decreased (P < 0.05) in the 150-ppm-treated animals. This may suggest a fumonisin B1-induced imbalance in brain norepinephrine and/or dopamine. No differences were observed in pineal norepinephrine, 5HT, 5HIAA, and the 5HIAA to 5HT ratios. Since fumonisin B1 failed to duplicate the effects of the F. moniliforme-induced imbalances in 5HT and 5HIAA metabolism in the brains of rats, other mycotoxins from F. moniliforme may be responsible for these effects. 3afood contamination 3abrain 3aFusarium fujikuroi 3aneurotoxins 3amycotoxins 3aneurotransmitters 3arats 3apineal body 3ametabolites 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aBrainxanatomy & histologyxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aDopaminexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aFumonisins 2aHomovanillic Acidxmetabolism 2aHydroxyindoleacetic Acidxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMycotoxinsxpharmacology 2aNeurotransmitter Agentsxmetabolism 2aNorepinephrinexmetabolism 2aOrgan Sizexdrug effects 2aPineal Glandxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSex Characteristics 0aGibberella fujikuroi1 aVoss, K.A.1 aChamberlain, W.J.1 aBacon, C.W.1 aNorred, W.P.0 tProceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.g1993 Mar., v. 202, no. 3 p.360-364x0037-97277nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03305naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009400125300001400219500018800233500002400421520146500445650001501910650002001925650001501945650001301960650002701973650001902000650000802019650002702027650001302054650001902067650001202086650001202098650001402110650001002124650000902134650001602143650002402159650002402183650001102207650001902218650001702237650001902254650001402273650003002287650002602317650001502343650001202358650001802370650001602388650001002404650001102414650001002425650001602435650001402451773012002465852000902585856008502594655001202679IND4468501620221119222901.0130607s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446850162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHara, A.H.10aHeat as a sustainable postharvest disinfestation treatment for export horticultural crops  ap. 45-54.  aPaper presented at the I International Conference on Postharvest Pest and Disease Management in Exporting Horticultural Crops - PPDM2012, held February 21-24, 2012, Bangkok, Thailand.  aIncludes references  aHeat, in the form of hot water, was first used as a disinfestation treatment to treat seed potatoes for late blight in 1882. Heat treatment has been used to control fungal, bacterial and viral diseases, plant-parasitic nematodes, and insect pests, but was shelved for about 50 years with the advent of nerve poisons (DDT, diazinon) and chemical fumigants (methyl bromide). Heat treatments not only control pests and diseases, but are a benefit to certain plants by increasing rooting, budding, and vase life. Plants, sensitive to heat injury, can also be conditioned to tolerate heat treatments. Hot water treatment for 45 to 49°C for 10 to 15 min disinfests flowers, foliage, potted plants, propagative cuttings, and media of many pests of quarantine significance, including ants, aphids, mealybugs, scale insects, plant-parasitic nematodes, snails, and slugs. Hot water dips of tropical propagative cuttings can be used to disinfest cuttings of insects, nematodes, and pathogens with the side benefit of increase in rooting. Hot air at 40°C conditions plants, foliage, and flowers to tolerate hot water, and at 44°C controls thrips and other insects. Use of steam to pasteurize (65°C for >30 min) or sterilize (85°C for >30 min) plant media will disinfest the media of fungal and bacterial pathogens and plant-parasitic nematodes. Heat is an effective and sustainable postharvest pest and disease disinfestation treatment for export horticultural crops. 3aAphidoidea 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aFormicidae 3aNematoda 3aPhytophthora infestans 3aPseudococcidae 3aair 3acontainer-grown plants 3adiazinon 3adisinfestation 3aexports 3aflowers 3afumigants 3afungi 3aheat 3aheat injury 3ahorticultural crops 3ahot water treatment 3aleaves 3amethyl bromide 3anerve tissue 3apasteurization 3apathogens 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3apostharvest treatment 3aquarantine 3arooting 3ascale insects 3aseed tubers 3aslugs 3asnails 3asteam 3asterilizing 3avase life0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Jan., , no. 973 p.45-54dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/973/973_4.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01432naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100001600117245007700133300001400210520066400224650001300888650002200901650001100923650001100934650001200945650001700957653002000974773009800994852000901092939003301101945000801134655001201142991570617960742620221119222842.0771001e197607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7799109702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaley, W.J.13aAn empirical investigation into price adjustments in the cherry industry  ap. 57-63.  aExtract: An inventory adjustment model with two modes of adjustment has been put forward as a suggested method of short run prediction. the model was confronted with data from the U.S. frozen cherry market and the adaptive expectations hypothesis was found to be empirically superior to the rational expections hypothesis. neither mode of adjustment could be rejected on a priori theoretical grounds, since the theoretical predictions were confirmed in both adjustment mechanisms. throughout, the substitue price was assumed to be exogenous. it is recognized that this may not be the case and accordingly the parameter estimates should be viewed with caution. 3acherries 3acosts and returns 3amodels 3aprices 3astorage 3afrozen foods 0aInventory model0 tCanadian journal of agricultural economics.g1976 July, v. 24, no. 2 p.57-63x0008-39767nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19771001c00000000  aAGE 7aarticle02255naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012600128300001600254500018800270500002400458520098700482650000801469650001701477650004301494650001201537650002501549650002601574650002201600650001901622651001301641700001301654700002101667773012201688852000901810856008601819655001201905IND4468504320221119222922.0130607s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446850432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKingsakul, S.10aGenetic polymorphism of glutinous rice (oryza sativa l.) using an amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique  ap. 225-229.  aPaper presented at the I International Conference on Postharvest Pest and Disease Management in Exporting Horticultural Crops - PPDM2012, held February 21-24, 2012, Bangkok, Thailand.  aIncludes references  aGlutinous rice, the most commonly consumed in the Northeast region of Thailand, contains relatively high genetic diversity, and the identification of varieties based on morphology is still limited. This study aimed to use the Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) technique for characterizing the genetic differences of six varieties of glutinous rice including 'RD6', 'Dawmakham', 'Dawbaipai', 'Dawbunmah', 'Dawhi', and 'Leenok'. The embryonic extracted DNA from each variety was selected by using specific restricted EcoRI/MseI enzymes, and a PCR technique was used to amplify the selected DNA using 40 restricted specific pair primers. The results showed that 14 primer pairs can distinguish the genetic polymorphism of all the studied varieties, and 125 polymorphic positions were generated. Therefore, the results of this study can be used as a supportive technique for variety identification and for studying the genetic relationship among varieties of glutinous rice. 3aDNA 3aOryza sativa 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aenzymes 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3aglutinous rice 3aThailand1 aAoki, S.1 aDechakhamphu, A.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Jan., , no. 973 p.225-229dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/973/973_31.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01522naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100001800117245010900135300001400244520073100258650001200989650002501001650001701026650001601043650001601059653002101075700001601096773007001112852000901182939003301191945000801224655001201232991570617890742620221119222918.0771001e197702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7799108922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPollock, R.L.14aThe effect of shifting the property tax base from improvement value to land value: an empirical estimate  ap. 67-77.  aExtract: The purpose of the present study is to estimate the effect on capital intensity of urban land development of a reduction in the tax rate on improvements accompanied by an increase in the tax rate on land value, with total property tax revenues held constant. first, we briefly develop a model of investor decision making, which predicts the impact of land and improvement taxes on capital intensity of urban land development. then we describe the sample of buildings which serves as the data base to estimate the parameters of the model. finally, we predict the impact that a reduction in the property tax rate on improvements would have on the optimal capital investment in improvements for the sample of properties. 3acapital 3aproduction functions 3aproperty tax 3aurban areas 3aland values 0aland improvement1 aShoup, D.C.0 tLand economics.g1977 Feb., v. 53, no. 1 p.67-77x0023-76397nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19771001c00000000  aAGE 7aarticle02232naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002600150245008900176300001600265500002400281520111200305650001201417650001301429650001101442650001401453650001801467650003101485650001101516650001401527650001501541700002301556700002401579773007801603852000901681856009001690856009001780655001201870IND4468507120221119222848.0130607s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446850712DNAL7 a10.1080/1065657X.2012.107370502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBüyüksönmez, Fatih10aDevelopment of a Model to Predict Runoff Water Headloss Through Compost Filter Berms  ap. 207-214.  aIncludes references  aAs a part of a larger study designed to develop compost filter berms i.e., an unsupported mound of compost that intercepts surface runoff from a site, suitable for removing nutrients and sediment from agricultural operations, we evaluated the hydraulic behavior of compost buffers with different masses and particle size distributions subjected to varying water flow rates using flume experiments. For each berm combination, the maximum flow rate the compost berm could sustain before a structural failure occurs was determined for different compost particle sizes. These data were used to develop models to predict headloss through a compost berm as a function of the flow rate per unit width, the median particle size of the compost media, and the buffer dimensions. The developed models perform well with R2 values ranging from 0.64 to 0.97 with the majority of values greater than 0.9. The effect of presence of sediments in the flow was also quantified. The results show that headloss increased by 1-2 cm as a result of sediment removal, ranging from 5 to 35%, taking up pore space in the compost berm. 3abuffers 3acomposts 3amodels 3anutrients 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3arunoff 3asediments 3awater flow1 aNaranjo, Sergio A.1 aBeighley, R.

  1 aFusaro, Marc Anthony14aThe rank, stock, order and epidemic effects of technology adoption: an empirical study of bounce protection programs  ap. 24-42.  a2019-12-04  aKarshenas and Stoneman (RAND J Econ 24(4):503-528, 1993) gathered four theories of technology adoption: the rank, stock, order and epidemic effects. Tests of these four effects reveal support for rank and epidemic but not the stock or order effects. Since then numerous other studies have tried to find evidence in support of the stock and order effects. But evidence has been elusive, until now. Further, a survey by Frame and White (J Econ Lit 42:116-144, 2004) concludes that much more work is needed into financial innovation. This paper accomplishes three goals: (1) evidence is found to support certain technology adoption theories (the order effects and possibly the stock effects), (2) since the technology under consideration is a financial innovation called bounce protection, the paper answers Frame and White's call for papers, and (3) refinements are made to the Karshenas and Stoneman methodology and found to be superior to the original empirical model. 3amathematical models 3ainnovation adoption 0anew technology 0atechnology0 tJournal of technology transfer.g2009 Feb., v. 34, no. 1 p.24-42dBoston : Springer USx0892-99127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10961-007-9062-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090112b20090206c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/01/12  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03484naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002200193245012400215300001600339506007600355520148000431506003701911650002901948650001901977650001001996650001502006650002002021650001602041650001002057650000902067650001902076650002402095650002102119650001102140650002302151650002002174650001402194650006702208650001202275650003902287650001402326650003002340650001102370650003202381650002602413650002602439653001302465653002002478700001902498700002302517700001702540700002102557773012302578852000902701856009202710930003302802946001102835655001202846IND4425993620221207082127.0090918e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442599362DNAL7 a197321532pmid7 aPMC28104442pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01680.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoehsler, Martina10aAcanthamoeba castellanii : growth on human cell layers reactivates attenuated properties after prolonged axenic culture  ap. 121-127.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe free-living, but potentially pathogenic, bacteriovorous amoebae of the genus Acanthamoeba can be easily grown axenically in a laboratory culture. This, however, often leads to considerable losses in virulence, and encystment capacity, and to changes in drug susceptibility. We evaluated potential options for a reactivation of a number of physiological properties, attenuated by prolonged axenic laboratory culture, including encystment potential, protease activity, heat resistance, growth rates and drug susceptibility against N-chlorotaurine (NCT). Toward this end, a strain that had been grown axenically for 10 years was repeatedly passaged on human HEp-2 cell monolayers or treated with 5'-azacytidine (AzaC), a methyltransferase inhibitor, and trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, in order to uplift epigenetic gene regulation. Culture on human cell monolayers resulted in significantly enhanced encystment potentials and protease activities, and higher susceptibility against NCT, whereas the resistance against heat shock was not altered. Treatment with AzaC/TSA resulted in increased encystment rates and protease activities, indicating the participation of epigenetic mechanisms. However, lowered resistances against heat shock indicate that possible stress responses to AzaC/TSA have to be taken into account. Repeated growth on human cell monolayers appears to be a potential method to reactivate attenuated characteristics in Acanthamoeba.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcanthamoeba castellanii 3aaxenic culture 3adrugs 3aencystment 3aenzyme activity 3aepigenetics 3agenes 3aheat 3aheat tolerance 3ahistone deacetylase 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3amethyltransferases 3astress response 3avirulence 2aAcanthamoeba castellaniixgrowth & developmentxpathogenicity. 2aAnimals 2aAntiprotozoal Agentsxpharmacology 2aCell Line 2aHepatocytesxparasitology 2aHumans 2aParasitic Sensitivity Tests 2aParasitologyxmethods 2aStress, Physiological 0aprotease 0aN-chlorotaurine1 aLeitsch, David1 aDuchêne, Michael.1 aNagl, Markus1 aWalochnik, Julia0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2009 Oct., v. 299, no. 2 p.121-127dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01680.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090918b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03877naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002200150245009700172300001600269500002400285520202300309650002102332650002702353650002302380650002502403650002102428650001202449650001402461650001302475650001902488650001302507650001202520650002102532650001402553650001302567650001102580650001402591650001402605650002102619650001302640650001402653650001902667650001502686650002702701650001302728650001402741650001102755650001402766650001102780650001302791650003202804650001002836650002602846650002202872650001502894700001802909700002102927773007802948852000903026856009003035856009003125655001203215IND4468506720221119222637.0130607s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446850672DNAL7 a10.1080/1065657X.2012.107370432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJarecki, Marek K.10aEvaluation of Compost Leachate for Growing Nursery Trees on a Waste-Rehabilitated Field Site  ap. 171-180.  aIncludes references  aCompost run-off leachates are potential sources of irrigation water and nutrients. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare growth response between nursery tree species irrigated with pond-collected compost leachate. Leachate was deficient in nitrogen (NO3-N < 0.02 mg L-1) and phosphorus (0.40 mg P L-1) and excess in potassium (316 mg K L-1) also slight to moderate excess in sodium( 138 mg Na L-1. One- or two-year-old seedling whips of black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.), Carolina poplar (Populus x canadensis Moench), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica March), hybrid poplar [Populus angulata x nigra L. var. plantierensis (Simon-Louis) Schneid.)] and silver maple (Acer saccharinum L.), and 2-year-old whips of hybrid poplar grown from hardwood cuttings, were planted in a field site rehabilitated with various organic wastes (wood chips, corrugated cardboard, and spent mushroom substrate-derived compost.) During each of two growing seasons (1998 and 1999), the leachates were applied 2-3 times weekly at two rates: Irrig I -fulfill crop water requirements with a 5% leaching fraction, i.e. about 12 L m-2, and Irrig II with a leaching fraction of 20%, i.e. 17 L m-2. There were also unirrigated (control) plots. All plots were fertilized with two levels of combined N and P fertilizer, 100 kg N+ 44 kg P ha-1 (1 NP) and 200 kg N + 88 kg P ha-1 (2 NP). Trunk diameter of all taxa and height of some taxa increased due to wastewater irrigation but there was no influence to application rates. With few exceptions, trunk diameter and tree height were larger with the higher NP application. Sodium accumulated consistently in leaves of all taxa due to irrigation treatments but the highest concentrations of 1.25 mg g-1 were below recommended toxic values (<2.5 mg g-1). Other foliar nutrients (N, P, K, Ca and Mg) showed inconsistent, little, or no accumulation, due to leachate irrigation and/or NP fertilizer. Throughout the study, there was no visual sign of nutrient toxicity or deficiency. 3aAcer saccharinum 3aFraxinus pennsylvanica 3aPopulus canadensis 3aRobinia pseudoacacia 3aapplication rate 3acalcium 3acardboard 3acomposts 3agrowing season 3ahardwood 3ahybrids 3airrigation water 3aleachates 3aleaching 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3amushrooms 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aorganic wastes 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aplanting 3apotassium 3arunoff 3aseedlings 3asodium 3atoxicity 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3awastewater irrigation 3awater requirement 3awood chips1 aChong, Calvin1 aVoroney, R.

The tested SMCs were collected from factory-like mushroom production systems that produced major mushrooms, such as Agaricus bisporus, Flammulina velutipes, Pleurotus eryngii, Hipsizigus marmoreus, Grifola frondosa and Pholiota nameko. We used SMCs discharged from factory-like mushroom production systems because of their year-round uniformity in composition. SMC uniformity is critical for plant growing media used in transplant production that requires highly sophisticated control of edaphic environments. The six tested SMCs had a higher nutrient content than the commercial medium and the bunasimezi SMC had the highest bulk density. The pH and EC of the white button mushroom SMC were higher than those of other SMCs. Lettuce transplants grown in the white button mushroom SMC had a high seed germination and early growth, similar to results obtained with commercial medium. The use of bunasimezi SMC resulted in the smallest percentage of germination and retarded early growth. 3aAgaricus bisporus 3aFlammulina velutipes 3aGrifola frondosa 3aPholiota microspora 3aPleurotus eryngii 3abulk density 3agrowing media 3alettuce 3amushroom growing 3amushrooms 3anutrient content 3apH 3aproduction technology 3aseed germination 3aspent mushroom compost 3atransplant production1 aSong, J.H.1 aShinohara, Y.1 aMaruo, T.1 aChun, C.0 tCompost science & utilization.g2012 Spring, v. 20, no. 2 p.92-967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1065657X.2012.107370313Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1065657X.2012.107370313Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02852naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245010800145300001600253300002100269500001500290520154300305650002501848650001501873650002401888650001701912650001101929650002001940650001601960650001301976650001201989650001002001650001102011650001402022653001202036653002102048653001502069653003602084653002502120653003202145700001902177700001802196700001502214773007402229852000902303939003302312946001302345655001202358IND9005076120221119222705.0901019e199007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900507612DNAL7 a166676002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamac, D.A.10aIsolation and characterization of the genes encoding basic and acidic chitinase in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 907-914.  ap. 907-914. ill.  a2019-12-05  aPlants synthesize a number of antimicrobial proteins in response to pathogen invasion and environmental stresses. These proteins include two classes of chitinases that have either basic or acidic isoelectric points and that are capable of degrading fungal cell wall chitin. We have cloned and determined the nucleotide sequence of the genes encoding the acidic and basic chitinases from Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Columbia wild type. Both chitinases are encoded by single copy genes that contain introns, a novel feature in chitinase genes. The basic chitinase has 73% amino acid sequence similarity to the basic chitinase from tobacco, and the acidic chitinase has 60% amino acid sequence similarity to the acidic chitinase from cucumber. Expression of the basic chitinase is organ-specific and age-dependent in Arabidopsis. A high constitutive level of expression was observed in roots with lower levels in leaves and flowering shoots. Exposure of plants to ethylene induced high levels of systemic expression of basic chitinase with expression increasing with plant age. Constitutive expression of basic chitinase was observed in roots of the ethylene insensitive mutant (etr) of Arabidopsis, demonstrating that root-specific expression is ethylene independent. Expression of the acidic chitinase gene was not observed in normal, untreated Arabidopsis plants or in plants treated with ethylene or salicylate. However, a transient expression assay indicated that the acidic chitinase promoter is active in Arabidopsis leaf tissue. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aprediction 3arestriction mapping 3agenetic code 3ashoots 3agene expression 3aamino acids 3agenomics 3aintrons 3aroots 3aleaves 3achitinase 0acloning 0aprotein analysis 0aregulation 0asouthern hybridization analysis 0anucleotide sequences 0adeduced amino acid sequence1 aHironaka, C.M.1 aYallaly, P.E.1 aShah, D.M.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 July, v. 93, no. 3 p.907-914x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01782naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120072001700138072001700155100002100172245006600193300001600259500002300275500001500298520060500313650001200918650002200930650002200952650002100974653002300995653003901018653001301057653001301070653005801083773008701141852000901228856007801237930003301315945002501348946001101373655001201384IND4413268020221119222624.0081201e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441326802DNAL7 a10.5558/tfc84648-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Clinical Findings-Abnormalities detected via clinicopathologic analyses included mild leukocytosis, heterophilia, and lymphopenia consistent with a stress leukogram. Previous fecal examinations failed to diagnose enteric parasite infestation. Results of a fecal flotation test with Sheather sugar solution revealed spirurid eggs (Spiruroidea). Coelomic radiography revealed a widened cardiohepatic waist with increased soft tissue opacity at the level of the hepatic silhouette. The caudal thoracic and abdominal air sacs bilaterally appeared compressed against the coleomic wall. The proventriculus was increased in diameter, with a proventriculus-to-keel ratio of 1.0. Coelomic ultrasonography and positive-contrast upper gastrointestinal radiography revealed severe thickening and irregularity of the proventricular wall. The animal was anesthetized for an endoscopic examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Intralesional nematodes were identified on histologic examination of biopsy specimens from the proventriculus. Treatment and Outcome-Effective fenbendazole treatment (15 mg/kg [6.8 mg/lb], PO, alternating between 5 days of treatment and 5 days of no treatment, which continued for 4 periods) was confirmed by repeated endoscopy and fecal examinations. The bird remained free of clinical signs 27 months after diagnosis and treatment. Clinical Relevance-Antemortem diagnosis of proventricular nematodiasis has not been reported in psittacines. Spirurid nematode eggs are shed intermittently, which may lead to false-negative results on a single routine fecal examination. In this patient, radiography, endoscopy, and histologic evaluation facilitated antemortem diagnosis. This is the first report of successful treatment of this condition in psittacines. 3aNematoda 3aair sacs 3abiopsy 3abirds 3aeggs 3aendoscopy 3afenbendazole 3agastrointestinal system 3aopacity 3aparasitoses 3apatients 3aproventriculus 3aradiography 3asugars 3aultrasonography 3aveterinary medicine 3awaist 3aGeorgia1 aDivers, Stephen J.1 aJiménez, David A.1 aAmbrose, Dana L.1 aRech, Raquel1 aGottdenker, Nicole L.1 aMayer, Jörg.0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g2013 Apr. 15, v. 242, no. 8 p.1122-1126x0003-14887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/javma.242.8.11223Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02569naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002000129245011700149300001600266300002100282500001500303520126000318650001601578650002701594650001801621650002601639650001701665650002001682650001301702650002001715650002401735650001301759650002101772650002701793650002001820653002601840653003601866653001701902653002601919700001101945700001401956773007401970852000902044939003302053946001302086655001202099IND9005071620221119222611.0901019e199007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900507162DNAL7 a166675932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayashimoto, A.12aA polyethylene glycol-mediated protoplast transformation system for production of fertile transgenic rice plants  ap. 857-863.  ap. 857-863. ill.  a2019-12-05  aWe have established an efficient procedure for protoplast transformation and regeneration of fertile transgenic plants of rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars Nipponbare and Taipei 309. Protoplasts were mixed with a plant-expressible hygromycin resistance gene and treated with 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol. Stringent selection of transformed colonies was applied to 14-day-old regenerated protoplasts in the presence of 95 micromolar of hygromycin B for 12 days. After selection, 450 and 200 resistant colonies were recovered per million treated Taipei 309 and Nipponbare protoplasts, respectively. Southern hybridization analysis of hygromycin-resistant cell lines and regenerated plants indicated that 1 to 10 copies of transferred DNA were integrated at 1 to 4 loci of the rice genome. Southern DNA analysis suggests that the introduced plasmid DNA may form concatemers by intermolecular recombination prior to integration. Four Taipei 309 and 39 Nipponbare transgenic rice plants were regenerated and grown to maturity in the greenhouse. Two Taipei 309 and 35 Nipponbare plants set viable seeds. Agronomic traits of Taipei 309 transgenic plants and inheritance of the hygromycin resistance trait by progeny of the selfed transgenic plants were analyzed. 3aprotoplasts 3agenetic transformation 3agene transfer 3aquantitative analysis 3aOryza sativa 3aplant fertility 3aplasmids 3agene expression 3apolyethylene glycol 3agenomics 3amicropropagation 3ainheritance (genetics) 3agenetic markers 0alaboratory techniques 0asouthern hybridization analysis 0aregeneration 0agenetic recombination1 aLi, Z.1 aMurai, N.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 July, v. 93, no. 3 p.857-863x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03361naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120072001700138072001700155100002100172245012000193300001600313500002300329500001500352520172700367650002302094650001802117650001902135650001702154650002502171650001802196650002402214650002202238650002302260650001102283650001702294650002302311651001202334653003302346653002302379653002602402653005802428653001902486700001902505700001602524700001802540700002102558773007202579852000902651856007802660930003302738945002502771946001102796655001202807IND4413268120221119220955.0081201e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441326812DNAL7 a10.5558/tfc84653-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMcPherson, Scott10aApplying research for enhanced productivity on the Canadian Ecology Centre -- Forestry Research Partnership forests  ap. 653-665.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aThe application of enhanced forest productivity (EFP) through intensive silviculture on designated forest areas is arguably one means to maintain or increase fibre supply and global market competitiveness. The Canadian Ecology Centre -- Forestry Research Partnership's (CEC-FRP) 10/10 objective (to increase sustainable fibre production by 10% in 10 years) has focused many years of forest research largely on the practical application of EFP. Large-scale implementation of this research, through a process of adaptive management, is incumbent on first identifying forests that are available and potentially suitable to implement EFP with more intensive silviculture on portions of the landbase. This paper describes forests in northeastern Ontario that were evaluated for EFP potential, and provides some of the rationale for their selection or rejection for this purpose. To date, the Gordon Cosens, Romeo Malette, Martel, and Nipissing forests are identified as potential CEC-FRP core forests in which research can be directed towards sustainable increases in forest production. These 4 forests are located in Ontario's boreal and Great Lakes-St. Lawrence regions and have the necessary tenure, potential productivity, protection from fire, insect and disease, and are managed under a suitably enabling planning and legislative environment. In addition, forest management planning teams for these forests are closely integrated with the CECFRP through core teams that are critical to identifying science priorities based on local operational issues, and moving subsequent research into practice. As such, it seems timely to move forward with EFP implementation through a process of adaptive management on these forests. 3aintensive forestry 3aforest policy 3aboreal forests 3aforest fires 3asustainable forestry 3atree diseases 3ainternational trade 3aforest management 3aforest plantations 3ayields 3aforest pests 3amarket competition 3aOntario 0aenhanced forest productivity 0aliterature reviews 0asilvicultural systems 0aCanadian Ecology Centre-Forestry Research Partnership 0aforest ecology1 aBell, F.

Three-week-old wheat seedlings (Triticum aestivum L. cv Caldwell) grown at 25 degrees C were transferred to cold temperature (10 degrees C) to induce fructan synthesis and then were transferred to continuous darkness at 25 degrees C after defoliation and fructan degradation monitored. The total fructan content increased significantly 1 day after transferring from 25 degrees C to 10 degrees C in both leaf blades and the remainder of the shoot tissue, 90% of which was leaf sheath tissue. Leaf sheaths contained higher concentrations of fructan and greater portions of high molecular weight fructan than did leaf blades. Fructan content in leaf sheaths declined rapidly and was gone completely within 48 hours following transfer to 25 degrees C in darkness. In leaf blades the invertase activity fluctuated during cold treatment. The activity of sucrose: sucrose fructosyl transferase increased markedly during cold treatment, while fructan hydrolase activity decreased slightly. In leaf sheaths, however, the activity of invertase decreased rapidly upon transfer to cold temperature and remained low. Trends in sucrose: sucrose fructosyl transferase and hydrolase activity in shealths were the same as those of leaf blades. Sheath invertase and hydrolase activity increased when plants were transferred back to darkness at 25 degrees C, while sucrose: sucrose fructosyl transferase activity decreased. These results indicate that changing leaf sheath temperture can be utilized to control the direction of fructan metabolism and thus provide a system in which the synthesis or degradation of fructan can be examined. 3achemical composition 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3asucrose 3aTriticum aestivum 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3afructose 3atemperature 3aenzyme activity 3atransferases 3acold 3aleaves 0asucrose fructosyl transferase 0adark 0acarbohydrates 0ahydrolases 0afructan hydrolase1 aHousley, T.L.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 July, v. 93, no. 3 p.902-906x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02413naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001300129245009500142300001600237300002100253520137400274650001801648650002201666650001001688650002901698650001101727650001601738650002201754650001501776650001701791650002201808653003501830653001501865700001801880773007401898852000901972939003301981946001302014655001202027IND9005071920221119221042.0901019e199007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900507192DNAL7 a166675962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOh, S.H.10aAnalysis of the state of posttranslational calmodulin methylation in developing pea plants  ap. 880-887.  ap. 880-887. ill.  aA specific calmodulin-N-methyltransferase was used in a radiometric assay to analyze the degree of methylation of lysine-115 in pea (Pisum sativum) plants. Calmodulin was isolated from dissected segments of developing roots of young etiolated and green pea plants and was tested for its ability to be methylated by incubation with the calmodulin methyltransferase in the presence of [3H]methyl-S-adenosylmethionine. By this approach, the presence of unmethylated calmodulins were demonstrated in pea tissues, and the levels of methylation varied depending on the developmental state of the tissue tested. Calmodulin methylation levels were lower in apical root segments of both etiolated and green plants, and in the young lateral roots compared with the mature, differentiated root tissues. The incorporation of methyl groups into these calmodulin samples appears to be specific for position 115 since site-directed mutants of calmodulin with substitutions at this position competitively inhibited methyl group incorporation. The present findings, combined with previous data showing differences in the ability of methylated and unmethylated calmodulins to activate pea NAD kinase (DM Roberts et al. [1986] J Biol Chem 261: 1491-1494) raise the possibility that posttranslational methylation of calmodulin could be another mechanism for regulating calmodulin activity. 3aPisum sativum 3aplant development 3aroots 3acalcium-binding proteins 3alysine 3amethylation 3achemical analysis 3aradiometry 3atransferases 3aenzyme inhibitors 0acalmodulin-n-methyltransferase 0alysine-1151 aRoberts, D.M.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 July, v. 93, no. 3 p.880-887x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02945naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100002500144245013100169300001800300500002400318500001500342520182100357650001302178650001702191650002802208650000902236650001502245650001702260651001702277653001702294700001902311700002202330700002002352773011802372852000902490856008402499655001202583IND4468508820221119220930.0130609s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446850882DNAL7 a10.2460/javma.242.8.11042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaite, Angharad H.K.10aLymphoma in cats treated with a weekly cyclophosphamide-, vincristine-, and prednisone-based protocol: 114 cases (1998–2008)  ap. 1104-1109.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aObjective-To evaluate the clinical response rate, progression-free survival time, overall survival time, and possible prognostic factors associated with a cyclophosphamide-, vincristine-, and prednisone (COP)-based chemotherapy protocol in cats with lymphoma. Design-Retrospective case series. Animals-114 cats with lymphoma. Procedures-Medical records of cats receiving a weekly COP-based chemotherapy protocol from 1998 to 2008 at the Matthew J. Ryan Veterinary Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were evaluated for information regarding signalment, anatomic site of involvement, cell morphology, treatment, and outcome. Retroviral status, baseline weight, substage, anatomic location, dose delays, dose reductions, and response to treatment were evaluated for prognostic importance. Results-The majority of cases (94 [82.4%]) were substage b, and the most common anatomic site was the gastrointestinal tract (57 [50%]). Clinical response rate after the first chemotherapy cycle was 47.4%. Response to treatment was significantly associated with progression-free survival time and overall survival time, whereas substage was significantly associated with progression-free survival time. The median progression-free survival time and overall survival time were 65.5 and 108 days, respectively. Compared with nonresponders, responders had significantly longer median progression-free survival time (364 vs 31 days) and median overall survival time (591 vs 73 days). Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Clinical response after 1 cycle of COP-based chemotherapy was predictive for progression-free survival time and overall survival time in cats with lymphoma; therefore, response after 1 cycle of chemotherapy could be used to guide decisions about further treatment. No new prognostic factors were identified. 3alymphoma 3adrug therapy 3agastrointestinal system 3acats 3aprednisone 3acell biology 3aPennsylvania 0achemotherapy1 aJackson, Karen1 aGregor, Thomas P.1 aKrick, Erika L.0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g2013 Apr. 15, v. 242, no. 8 p.1104-1109x0003-14887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/javma.242.8.11043Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04238naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100001900193245014500212300001600357520188100373650002502254650002002279650001702299650001802316650001002334650002502344650002902369650002502398650002002423650003602443650003002479650003202509650001102541650001902552650001102571650001702582650002202599650001702621650004402638650003402682650002402716650002602740650000902766650002902775650006102804650003502865650003502900650004202935653002302977653002903000700001503029700001903044700001503063700001703078700001803095700001703113700001703130700001403147700001803161700001603179700001703195773013503212852000903347856009203356930003303448946001103481655001203492IND4423541620221119221034.0090724e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442354162DNAL7 a196641522pmid7 aPMC27450382pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.03981.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaumgart, D.C.10aExaggerated inflammatory response of primary human myeloid dendritic cells to lipopolysaccharide in patients with inflammatory bowel disease  ap. 423-436.  aInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) results from a breakdown of tolerance towards the indigenous flora in genetically susceptible hosts. Failure of dendritic cells (DC) to interpret molecular microbial patterns appropriately when directing innate and adaptive immune responses is conceivable. Primary (conventional, non-monocyte generated) CD1c⁺CD11c⁺CD14⁻CD16⁻CD19⁻ myeloid blood or mucosal dendritic cells (mDC) from 76 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) in remission, during flare-ups (FU) and 76 healthy or non-IBD controls were analysed by fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) flow cytometry and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cytokine secretion of freshly isolated, cultured and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated highly purified mDC (purity >95%) was assessed using cytometric bead arrays (CBA). More cultured and stimulated circulating mDC express CD40 in IBD patients. Stimulated circulating mDC from IBD patients secrete significantly more tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-8. Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 expression by mDC was higher in remission and increased significantly in flaring UC and CD patients compared with remission (P < 0·05) and controls (P < 0·001). Fluorochrome-labelled LPS uptake by mDC was evaluated at different time-points over 24 h by measuring mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). Circulating mDC from IBD patients take up more LPS and the uptake begins earlier compared with controls (P < 0·05 in CD-FU and UC-FU at 24 h). The frequency of mucosal mDC (P < 0·05) and the number of CD40 expressing mucosal mDC is significantly greater in UC and CD compared with non-IBD controls (P < 0·001 versus P < 0·01, respectively). Our data suggest an aberrant LPS response of mDC in IBD patients, resulting in an inflammatory phenotype and possibly intestinal homing in acute flares. 3aantigen presentation 3adendritic cells 3ainflammation 2aAcute Disease 2aAdult 2aAntigen Presentation 2aCD40 Antigensxanalysis. 2aCase-Control Studies 2aCells, Cultured 2aColitis, Ulcerativeximmunology 2aCrohn Diseaseximmunology 2aDendritic Cellsximmunology 2aFemale 2aFlow Cytometry 2aHumans 2aImmunization 2aImmunophenotyping 2aInflammation 2aInflammatory Bowel Diseasesximmunology 2aIntestinal Mucosaximmunology 2aLipopolysaccharides 2aLymphocyte Activation 2aMale 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aToll-Like Receptor 2xgenetics 2aToll-Like Receptor 4xgenetics 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxanalysis 0alipopolysaccharide 0aToll-like receptor (TLR)1 aThomas, S.1 aPrzesdzing, I.1 aMetzke, D.1 aBielecki, C.1 aLehmann, S.M.1 aLehnardt, S.1 aDörffel, Y.1 aSturm, A.1 aScheffold, A.1 aSchmitz, J.1 aRadbruch, A.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2009 Sept., v. 157, no. 3 p.423-436dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.03981.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090724b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01681naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001200158245005300170300001600223500002400239520069600263650001100959650001400970650001600984650002501000650001701025700001201042700001601054773011001070852000901180856007301189930003301262945002501295946001101320655001201331IND4384247620221119220956.0061012e20050315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438424762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2004.06.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aPal, S.10aCationic starch: an effective flocculating agent  ap. 417-423.  aIncludes references  aA series of cationic starches (Cat St) have been developed by incorporating a cationic moiety N-(3-Chloro-2-hydroxypropyl) trimethyl ammonium chloride (CHPTAC) onto the backbone of starch in presence of NaOH.

Municipal solid waste compost has been the subject of most of the research done so far. Farm compost (FC) has a different composition. It is made of varying ingredients available on the farm, e.g., wood chips and bark, manure, straw, crop residues and surplus grass and soil. Information is currently lacking on the agronomic value and environmental impact of FC. Therefore, a long-term field experiment was established to quantify the effect of FC application on crop performance and soil quality in a crop rotation of potatoes, fodder beet, forage maize and Brussels sprouts. This paper presents the results of the first four years of the ongoing field trial. In the fourth year of the experiment, the annual FC amendment resulted in a significant increase in dry matter yield for all four crops. Our results suggested that the positive effect of continual FC application was based on a combination of a slow release of nitrogen and providing better growing opportunities to the crops. Results on the effect of FC on the residual nitrate content in the soil, disease suppression and DM content of the crops are not yet decisive. 3apotatoes 3afield experimentation 3abeets 3asustainable agriculture 3aBrussels sprouts 3afarms 3adry matter accumulation 3aforage 3aingredients 3agrasses 3acomposts 3asoil quality 3amunicipal solid waste 3acorn 3adisease control 3asoil 3awood chips 3astraw 3acrop rotation 3anitrogen 3aenvironmental impact 3abark 3anitrates 0acrops1 aCougnon, M.1 aVliegher, A. de1 aWillekens, K.1 aBockstaele, E. van1 aReheul, D.0 tCompost science & utilization.g2012 Winter, v. 20, no. 1 p.49-567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1065657X.2012.107370223Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1065657X.2012.107370223Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03671naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001300150245010700163300001600270500002400286520210600310650002402416650003202440650002502472650001802497650001102515650002902526650001402555650001502569650001302584650001702597650001702614650001002631650001102641650001902652650001302671650001202684650001202696650001902708650001002727650002002737700001802757700001202775700001502787700002402802700002002826700001602846773007802862852000902940856009002949856009003039655001203129IND4468507520221119221044.0130607s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446850752DNAL7 a10.1080/1065657X.2012.107370542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaha, N.10aApplication of Highly Efficient Lignocellulolytic Fungi In Cocomposting of Paddy Straw Amended Poultry  ap. 239-244.  aIncludes references  aA two-step composting process for the generation of humus-rich manure from paddy straw amended with poultry droppings was investigated in this study. The composting technique consists of two distinct steps. The first step is decomposition of lignocellulosic constituent of paddy straw by white rot fungi Polyporus versicolor (Pv), Phanerochaete chrysosporium (Pc) and Pleurotus sajor caju (Psc) for five weeks. The second step is the intensive humus synthetic stage of another five weeks. Fresh poultry droppings and decomposing paddy straw at 1:1 ratio (W/W) was incorporated in the second step instead of incorporating at the beginning like in the traditional composting. Analytical results showed maximum degradation of lignin and cellulose was in Pc inoculated composts (13.9%) followed by those of Psc (11.3%), Pv (8.9%) inoculation and uninoculated control (Uc-5.4%) at the end of first step in two-step composting. Similar pattern of decomposition of lignin and cellulose but in lower magnitude was also observed during the end of first 5 weeks in traditional composting. The content of humic substances (both humic and fulvic acids) in both two- step and traditional composting, was in agreement with the lignin/cellulose degradation rate of those composting systems by respective inoculation. However, the cation-exchange-capacity (CEC) and the content of humic substances were much higher in composts produced in two-step composting than traditional composting. Carbon turnover was remarkable in traditional composting in all inoculated compost series. Two-step composting as compared to traditional composting maintained the C: N ratio of matured compost in a suitable limit. In this regard Pc inoculated composted series proved to be better. Higher loss in lignin and cellulose and increase in CEC and humic substances as well as better nitrogen conservation in two-step composting, especially with Pc inoculation, were attained. Thus, in this study the effectiveness of this biotechnology in accelerating decomposition as well as humification of lignocellulosic resources was established. 3aCoriolus versicolor 3aPhanerochaete chrysosporium 3aPleurotus sajor-caju 3abiotechnology 3acarbon 3acation exchange capacity 3acellulose 3acomposting 3acomposts 3afulvic acids 3ahumification 3ahumus 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3anitrogen 3apaddies 3apoultry 3apoultry manure 3astraw 3awhite-rot fungi1 aMukherjee, D.1 aSen, S.1 aSarkar, A.1 aBhattacharaya, K.K.1 aMukhopadyay, N.1 aPatra, P.K.0 tCompost science & utilization.g2012 Autumn, v. 20, no. 4 p.239-2447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1065657X.2012.107370543Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1065657X.2012.107370543Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02606naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001400158245014200172300001600314500002400330500001500354520136300369650001901732650002001751650001601771650001401787650001801801650002301819650002101842650001901863653002301882700001401905700001601919773011001935852000902045856007302054930003302127945002502160946001102185655001202196IND4384248520221119221108.0061012e20050315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438424852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2004.11.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5001 aLin, J.H.10aChange of granular and molecular structures of waxy maize and potato starches after treated in alcohols with or without hydrochloric acid  ap. 507-515.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aStarches from waxy maize and potato were treated in methanol and 2-propanol either with or without 0.36% hydrochloric acid at 65 °C for 1 h. The granule morphology, molecular structure and pasting properties of the starches were determined and the effects of treatments on the granule and molecular structures of starch were investigated. Starch treated in alcohols without acid showed loss of native order through the hilum of granules, and no obvious molecular degradation was found. However, acid-alcohol treated starch showed many cracks inside granules, and both waxy maize and potato starches showed obvious molecular degradation after treated. Furthermore, the amylose chains and long chains of amylopectin of starch were more easily degraded with acid-alcohol treatment. The pasting viscosity of acid-alcohol treated starches were also obviously less than that of their counterpart native starch and starch after alcohol treatment. The extent of degradation of molecules and the decrease of pasting viscosity on potato starch after acid-alcohol treated were more obvious than that of waxy maize starch. The result indicates that the degradation preferentially occur in the amorphous region when starch treated by acid-alcohol, and the degradation of starch molecules enhances the amorphous excretion and the occurrence of cracks inside the granules. 3amicrostructure 3astarch granules 3acorn starch 3awaxy corn 3apotato starch 3apasting properties 3amolecular weight 3aacid treatment 0achemical treatment1 aLii, C.Y.1 aChang, Y.H.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2005 Mar. 15, v. 59, no. 4 p.507-515dApplied Science Publishersx0144-86177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2004.11.0233electronic resource  a20061107b20061202c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/11/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03464naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245009900188300001600287520135700303650002401660650000801684650001601692650002701708650001801735650001701753650002701770650001601797650001601813650000901829650001001838650002201848650002301870650002101893650001701914650001401931650003701945650007801982650003302060650003402093650002702127650003702154650002802191650001402219650005002233650002702283650004302310651001402353651001602367653001702383653002502400653003402425653003702459700001502496700001802511773012802529852000902657856009202666930003302758946001102791655001202802IND4427413520221119220929.0091016e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442741352DNAL7 a197809662pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2009.02711.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarcos, M.S.10aAromatic hydrocarbon degradation genes from chronically polluted Subantarctic marine sediments  ap. 602-608.  aThe goal of this study was to identify functional targets to detect polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-degrading bacterial populations in cold marine ecosystems. We designed a degenerate primer set targeting genes encoding the α subunit of PAH-dioxygenases from Gram-positive bacteria. This primer set was used to amplify gene fragments from metagenomic DNA isolated from Subantarctic marine sediments (Ushuaia Bay, Argentina). These gene fragments were cloned and sequenced. We identified 14 distinct groups of genes, most of them showing significant relatedness with dioxygenases from Gram-positive bacteria of the genera Rhodococcus, Mycobacterium, Nocardioides, Terrabacter and Bacillus. The level of identity with these genes, however, was low to moderate (33-62% at the amino acid level). These results indicate the presence of a high diversity of hitherto unidentified dioxygenase genes in this cold polluted environment. Subantarctic marine ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to hydrocarbon pollution, and the development of environmental restoration strategies for these environments is pressing. The information obtained in this work will be the starting point for the design of quantitative molecular tools to analyse the abundance and dynamics of these aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial populations in the marine environment. 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aDNA 3aDNA primers 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aMycobacterium 3aNocardioides 3aRhodococcus (bacteria) 3aTerrabacter 3aamino acids 3acold 3agenes 3amarine ecosystems 3amarine environment 3amarine sediments 3ametagenomics 3apollution 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aDioxygenasesxgenetics 2aGeologic Sedimentsxmicrobiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxmetabolism. 2aSeawaterxmicrobiology 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxmetabolism 3aArgentina 0aAntarctica. 0adioxygenases 0aintertidal sediments 0aring-hydroxylating oxygenases 0aSubantarctic marine environments1 aLozada, M.1 aDionisi, H.M.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2009 Nov., v. 49, no. 5 p.602-608dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2009.02711.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091016b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02336naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245011700170300001300287520121800300650001801518650000801536650001301544650002201557650000901579650001501588650002501603651001801628653002601646653002601672700002201698773011601720852000901836856008501845930003301930946001101963655001201974IND4429625620221119220935.0091207e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442962562DNAL7 a10.1007/s10546-009-9449-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMirocha, Jeffrey D. 12aA Large-Eddy Simulation Study of the Influence of Subsidence on the Stably Stratified Atmospheric Boundary Layer  ap. 1-21.  aThe influence of the large-scale subsidence rate, S, on the stably stratified atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) over the Arctic Ocean snow/ice pack during clear-sky, winter conditions is investigated using a large-eddy simulation model. Simulations of two 24-h periods are conducted while varying S between 0, 0.001 and 0.002 ms⁻¹, and the resulting quasi-equilibrium ABL structures and evolutions are examined. Simulations conducted with S = 0 yield a boundary layer that is deeper, more strongly mixed and cools more rapidly than the observations. Simulations conducted with S > 0 yield improved agreement with the observations in the ABL height, potential temperature gradients and bulk heating rates. We also demonstrate that S > 0 limits the continuous growth of the ABL observed during quasi-steady conditions, leading to the formation of a nearly steady ABL of approximately uniform depth and temperature. Subsidence reduces the magnitudes of the stresses, as well as the implied eddy-diffusivity coefficients for momentum and heat, while increasing the vertical heat fluxes considerably. Subsidence is also observed to increases the Richardson number to values in excess of unity well below the ABL top. 3aheat transfer 3aice 3amomentum 3asimulation models 3asnow 3asubsidence 3atemperature profiles 3aArctic region 0aLarge-eddy simulation 0aStable boundary layer1 aKosović, Branko 0 tBoundary-layer meteorology.g2010 Jan., v. 134, no. 1 p.1-21dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0006-83147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10546-009-9449-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20091207b20100101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03982naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160072000900169072000900178100001600187245013400203300001600337500002400353500001500377520188500392650001902277650002502296650001202321650001402333650001902347650002302366650001702389650002002406650003102426650002202457650001302479650001502492650001102507650002202518650002502540651001402565651001202579651001102591651001802602653004802620653002302668653002302691653003702714653004002751653002502791653005202816653001502868700002202883700002002905700002302925700002202948700002102970773012202991852000903113856009103122930003303213945002503246946001303271655001203284IND4438677220221119221042.0100618e20100715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443867722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2010.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aF600 0aX150 0aB2001 aYang, Wenze12aA clumped-foliage canopy radiative transfer model for a Global Dynamic Terrestrial Ecosystem Model II: Comparison to measurements  ap. 895-907.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn a previous paper, we developed an analytical clumped two-stream model (ACTS) of canopy radiative transfer from an analytical geometric-optical and radiative transfer (GORT) scheme (). The ACTS model accounts for clumping of foliage and the influence of trunks in vegetation canopies for modeling of photosynthesis, radiative fluxes and surface albedo in dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), and particularly for the Ent Dynamic Global Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (DGTEM). This study evaluates the gap probability and transmittance estimates from the ACTS model by comparing the modeled results with ground-based data, as well as with the original full GORT model and a layered Beer's law scheme. The ground data used in this study include vertical profile measurements of incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in (1) mixed deciduous forests in Morgan-Monroe State Forest, IN, USA, (2) coniferous forests in central Canada, (3) mixed deciduous forests in Harvard Forest, MA, and (4) ground lidar measurements of the canopy gap fraction in woodland in Australia. The model comparisons with these measurements demonstrate that the ACTS model achieves better or similar performance compared to the full GORT and the layered Beer's law schemes with regard to agreements with field measurements and computational cost. The ACTS model has excellent accuracy and flexibility to model the canopy gap probability and transmittance for various forest scenarios. Also, it has advantages relative to the currently widely used two-stream scheme through better radiation estimation for photosynthesis by accounting for the impact of both vertical and horizontal structure heterogeneity of complex vegetation on radiative transfer. Currently the ACTS is being implemented in Ent and will be further tested for how it improves surface energy balance and carbon flux estimates. 3adynamic models 3aspatial distribution 3aforests 3awoodlands 3aphotosynthesis 3atemporal variation 3aplant growth 3asolar radiation 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aspatial variation 3aaccuracy 3aprediction 3acanopy 3aplant communities 3aalbedo (reflectance) 3aAustralia 3aIndiana 3aCanada 3aMassachusetts 0aglobal dynamic terrestrial ecosystem models 0aoptical properties 0aradiative transfer 0adynamic global vegetation models 0aanalytical clumped two-stream model 0avegetation structure 0aclumped-foliage canopy radiative transfer model 0avegetation1 aNi-Meister, Wenge1 aKiang, Nancy Y.1 aMoorcroft, Paul R.1 aStrahler, Alan H.1 aOliphant, Andrew0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2010 July 15, v. 150, no. 7-8 p.895-907dElsevier Science Ltd.x0168-19237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2010.02.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20100911b20101001c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/07/30  aOther US 7aarticle02466naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002700152245010300179300001800282520112400300650001201424650001301436650001401449650001301463650000901476650001101485650002501496650001601521650002501537653003401562653001801596653002701614653001801641653002001659700003901679700003201718773014901750852000901899856009201908930003302000946001102033655001202044IND4422042020221119221144.0090619e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442204202DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2009.01958.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMariani, Viviana Cocco10aEstimation of apparent thermal conductivity of carrot purée during freezing using inverse problem  ap. 1292-1303.  aThis article presents an inverse problem to determine the apparent thermal conductivity of carrot purée during the freezing process. The heat diffusion equation with the enthalpy model is solved to estimate the thermal conductivity. A modern meta-heuristic of evolutionary computation field called Differential Evolution (DE) is applied for the solution of inverse problem. Experiments were performed to estimate the thermal conductivity of the carrot purée as a function of temperature, using two piecewise functions. A best least square fitting between the experimental and predicted temperature curves during freezing conditions is obtained using DE. Statistical analysis are considered with Gaussian error of 0.05 and zero mean showing than the results for one piecewise function are more stable than with another piecewise function. Good agreement between the reported and estimated temperature curves was obtained. The apparent thermal conductivity was observed to decrease asymptotically with temperature in the range [-40 °C, 0 °C] and stay approximately a constant value for temperatures bigger than 0 °C. 3acarrots 3aenthalpy 3aequations 3afreezing 3aheat 3amodels 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3athermal conductivity 0aApparent thermal conductivity 0acarrot purée 0adifferential evolution 0afood freezing 0ainverse problem1 ado Amarante, Álvaro Cesar Camargo1 aCoelho, Leandro dos Santos.0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2009 July, v. 44, no. 7 p.1292-1303dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2009.01958.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090619b20090703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03984naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160072000900169100001400178245006400192300001800256500002400274500001500298520226300313650002202576650002702598650002002625650001702645650002002662650000902682650002202691650002302713650001802736650002102754650001902775650001302794650001302807651001902820651001202839653001502851653001802866700002102884700002102905700001802926700001402944700001702958700001702975700002102992700001903013700001603032700001503048773012403063852000903187856009103196930003303287945002503320946001303345655001203358IND4438676420140725000000.0100618e20100715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443867642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2010.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aF300 0aX1001 aTrnka, M.10aSimple snow cover model for agrometeorological applications  ap. 1115-1127.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study was aimed to develop, test and provide access to a snow cover model for agrometeorological use (snowMAUS) that would rely strictly on the weather data used by all crop simulation models, i.e., diurnal temperature extremes and total daily precipitation. Such snow model can easily be used to preprocess input data in order to account for the presence or absence of snow cover whenever required by the crop modeler, without necessitating the acquisition of additional data. The snow cover model was tested across 65 sites across Austria with considerable variability in elevation (155-3111m a.s.l.). In addition 7 sites in the Czech Republic were used to evaluate snowMAUS reliability in assessing frost damage to winter wheat crop. For illustration a case study documenting the benefit of coupling snowMAUS with process based crop model (STICS) was also included in the study. The presented work complements previous snow cover modeling studies with its focus on the development of a simple snow cover model for areas under intensive agricultural use (mostly lowlands) with 65% of stations providing weather data being located at altitudes below 800m. The presented results proved that SnowMAUS can estimate with reasonable precision snow cover presence/absence, and to a large extent snow cover depth. The model also accurately represented seasonal variations in the number of snow days or in the volume of precipitation in the form of snow. The simplicity of the model and the fact that it relies only on the daily data is a great advantage. We have demonstrated that in areas with a high probability of winter temperatures dropping below frost-tolerance thresholds and that tend to have considerable snow cover (e.g., Central Europe), the information about snow cover presence/absence is essential for estimating potential frost damage to winter crops. The snow cover model tested in this study could be easily implemented in most crop growth models and would enhance their performance in the Central European region.

To establish a sustainable production system, the evaluation of native (nontransgenic) resistance in maize cultivars is essential. 3 This review emphasizes the future challenges involved in the research of native resistance breeding in maize against the insect. 3aDiabrotica virgifera virgifera 3abreeding 3acorn 3acultivars 3ainsects 3apests 3aEurope 3aUnited States 0anative resistance1 aRaspudić, Emilija1 aBrmež, Mirjana1 aMajić, Ivana1 aBrkić, Ivan1 aTollefson, Jon J.1 aBohn, Martin1 aHibbard, Bruce E.1 aŠimić, Domagoj0 tAgricultural and forest entomology.g2009 Aug., v. 11, no. 3 p.307-311dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1461-95557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-9563.2009.00434.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090718b20090801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04781naa a2200949 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164072001700182072001700199100001600216245021800232300001600450506007600466520182400542506003702366650002202403650001102425650002402436650001402460650002402474650001602498650002002514650001502534650001602549650001102565650001902576650001602595650001702611650001702628650001602645650002302661650002202684650001802706650002202724650001002746650005602756650002602812650003602838650001802874650002402892650003702916650001102953650002202964650001102986650002302997650005003020650002403070650002403094650001103118650000903129650003303138650001603171650005503187650002103242650002403263651001003287653003703297653001503334700001603349700002003365700001603385700001703401700001503418700001703433700002403450700001803474700001503492700002203507700001803529773011103547852000903658856008103667930003303748945002503781946001303806655001203819IND4413936820221207082042.0081219e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441393682DNAL7 a190566612pmid7 aPMC26462162pmcid7 a10.3945/jn.108.0913892doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, factorial trial was conducted to compare the ability of 3 treatments to retard the development of precancerous gastric lesions in 3411 subjects. The treatments were: 1) anti-H. pylori treatment with amoxicillin and omeprazole; 2) 7.3-y supplementation with aged garlic and steam-distilled garlic oil; and 3) 7.3-y supplementation with vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium. All 3 treatments were given in a 2³ factorial design to subjects seropositive for H. pylori infection; only the garlic supplement and vitamin and selenium supplement were given in a 2² factorial design to the other subjects. Thirty-four subjects were randomly selected from each of the 12 treatment strata. Sera were analyzed after 7.3 y to measure effects on folate, vitamin B-12, homocysteine, and glutathione concentrations. Regression analyses adjusted for age, gender, and smoking indicated an increase of 10.2% (95%CI: 2.9-18.1%) in serum folate after garlic supplementation and an increase of 13.4% (95%CI: 5.3-22.2%) in serum glutathione after vitamin and selenium supplementation. The vitamin and selenium supplement did not affect other analytes and the amoxicillin and omeprazole therapy did not affect any of the variables tested. In this rural Chinese population, 7.3 y of garlic supplementation increased the serum folate concentration and the vitamin and selenium supplement increased that of glutathione, but neither affected serum concentrations of vitamin B-12 or homocysteine.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3along term effects 3agarlic 3adietary supplements 3anutrients 3aHelicobacter pylori 3ablood serum 3ablood chemistry 3afolic acid 3aglutathione 3ahumans 3aChinese people 3avitamin B12 3ahomocysteine 3arural health 3aamoxicillin 3anutritional status 3anutrient reserves 3apeptic ulcers 3aprotective effect 2aAdult 2aAmoxicillinxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aAnti-Bacterial Agents 2aAnti-Ulcer Agentsxpharmacology 2aAsian People. 2aDietary Supplements 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aFolic Acidxblood 2aGarlic 2aGlutathionexblood 2aHelicobacter Infectionsxprevention & control 2aHelicobacter pylori 2aHomocysteinexblood 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMicronutrientsxpharmacology 2aMiddle Aged 2aOmeprazolexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aRural Population 2aVitamin B 12xblood 3aChina 0aanti-Helicobacter pylori therapy 0aomeprazole1 aZhang, Lian1 aMoslehi, Roxana1 aMa, Junling1 aPan, Kaifeng1 aZhou, Tong1 aLiu, Weidong1 aBrown, Linda Morris1 aHu, Yuangreng1 aPee, David1 aGail, Mitchell H.1 aYou, Weicheng0 tJournal of nutrition.g2009 Jan., v. 139, no. 1 p.106-112dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/jn.108.0913893Available from publisher's Web site  a20090316b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/03/05  aOther US 7aarticle02986naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245013900148300001600287520171400303650002202017650002002039650001202059650002102071650002602092650001302118650001502131650001002146650000902156650002302165650002902188650004402217650001102261650001102272650002602283650000902309650001602318650003702334650001402371773010002385852000902485939003302494946001302527655001202540IND9305364420221119221135.0930916e199306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930536442DNAL7 a83473812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosenlund, B.L.10aEffects of insulin on free amino acids in plasma and the role of the amino acid metabolism in the etiology of diabetic microangiopathy  ap. 375-391.  aTo investigate if alterations of the amino acid metabolism may play a more important role in the etiology of diabetic microangiopathy than hitherto recognized, free amino acids in plasma were measured by means of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in healthy individuals (REF) and patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Isoleucine and leucine in IDDM were within normal limits, whereas they were significantly higher in NIDDM (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively). This was not due to age differences. In order to evaluate the impact of insulin on amino acid metabolism, amino acids were also measured in pregnant women (PREG) undergoing glucose tolerance tests as a screening for pregnancy diabetes and in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO) undergoing euglycemic insulin clamp tests. Insulin considerably reduced the amino acid concentration. Isoleucine and leucine were particularly depressed. On the whole there was strong covariance between the three branched-chain amino acids, isoleucine, leucine, and valine (P < 0.0001). There was no covariance between amino acid and glucose or HbAlc concentrations. A protein meal strongly stimulated insulin production (+ 55 mIU/liter), whereas a galactose meal revealed only a minor increase in insulin response (+ 12 mIU/liter) in contrast to a tolerance test with the same amount of glucose (+ 67 mIU/liter). It is concluded that disturbed amino acid metabolism may be a more important causative factor in the etiology of diabetic microangiopathy than hitherto recognized and, in addition, that this may affect the therapeutic approach in both IDDM and NIDDM patients. 3adiabetes mellitus 3amicroangiopathy 3ainsulin 3afree amino acids 3aamino acid metabolism 3aetiology 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAmino Acidsxblood 2aDiabetes Mellitusxblood 2aDiabetic Angiopathiesxbloodxetiology. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInsulinxpharmacology 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPolycystic Ovary Syndromexblood 2aPregnancy0 tBiochemical medicine and metabolic biology.g1993 June, v. 49, no. 3 p.375-391x0885-45057nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02430naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100002200167245010600189300001600295500002400311520109700335650001801432650002001450650002701470650001701497650002001514650001601534650001801550650002801568650002101596650001301617700001301630700001901643700001701662700001801679700001801697773009001715852000901805856008901814930003301903945002501936946001101961655001201972IND4438686020140725000000.0100618e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443868602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2010.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ100 0aQ5001 aPrimo-Martín, C.10aPerformance of cellulose derivatives in deep-fried battered snacks: Oil barrier and crispy properties  ap. 702-708.  aIncludes references  aThe performance of batters containing cellulose derivatives (methyl cellulose (A4M), three hydroxypropylmethyl celluloses (E4M, F4M and K4M) with different degree of hydroxypropyl and/or methyl substitution and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)) to produce crispy deep-fried snacks crusts was studied by using a deep-fried crust model. Their performance was compared in terms of their ability to retain moisture content, to decrease oil content and the effect on crispness. Thermogelation properties of the cellulose derivatives depended on the type and degree of substitution. All increased the water content and decreased the oil content of the deep-fried crusts, except for CMC, which does not thermogelate and did not increase the amount of water retained in the crust, although a decrease in the oil content was found. The highest oil reduction and the lowest water retention were found for the cellulose with the lowest level of methyl substitution (K4M). The sound emitted during fracture of K4M crusts had higher intensity than the other cellulose derivatives indicating a crispier crust. 3awater content 3amethylcellulose 3acarbohydrate structure 3acoated foods 3adeep fat frying 3asnack foods 3alipid content 3afood processing quality 3afood composition 3ahardness1 aSanz, T.1 aSteringa, D.W.1 aSalvador, A.1 aFiszman, S.M.1 avan Vliet, T.0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2010 , v. 24, no. 8 p.702-708dElsevier Sciencex0268-005X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2010.04.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20110609b20110701c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/07/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02828naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100002200158245012200180300001600302500002400318500001500342520132700357650001401684650002201698650002301720650001801743650000901761650002701770650001701797650002301814650001901837650002401856653002401880653001701904700001601921700001901937700002101956700002001977700002401997700002202021700002202043773009002065852000902155856008902164930003302253945002502286946001102311655001202322IND4438685820140725000000.0100618e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443868582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2010.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5011 aMossaz, Stéphane10aMeasuring and predicting the spreading of dairy products in the mouth: sensory, instrumental and modelling approaches  ap. 681-688.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn order to understand the mechanisms whereby the molecules responsible for sensory stimuli are released in the mouth, the aim of this study was to characterise and predict the spreading of semi-solid dairy products between tongue and palate using four complementary approaches, namely sensory analysis, instrumental measurement and analytical and numerical modelling. The products studied were dairy gels, whose physical representation is a yield-stress fluid. In the instrumental approach, spreading in mouth was simulated by a test in which a constant volume of sample was squeezed between two plates. It was performed in two phases, the first phase with a prescribed speed and the second with a prescribed force. The influence of product rheology, interface conditions, forces involved and kinematics of displacement on spreading area were studied by combining the instrumental and modelling approaches. For the dairy gels studied in this work, the consistency K was the most influent parameter on the spreading area. Also worth noting were the good correlations between the results obtained by the sensory, instrumental and modelling approaches. The approach adopted in this study could be used to predict spreading in the mouth of food products or boluses with a rheological behaviour of the yield-stress fluid type. 3amouthfeel 3asimulation models 3asensory evaluation 3afood analysis 3agels 3arheological properties 3apalatability 3aanalytical methods 3adairy products 3ainterface phenomena 0amathematical models 0afood quality1 aJay, Pascal1 aMagnin, Albert1 aPanouillé, Maud1 aSaint-Eve, Anne1 aDéléris, Isabelle1 aJuteau, Alexandre1 aSouchon, Isabelle0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2010 , v. 24, no. 8 p.681-688dElsevier Sciencex0268-005X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2010.03.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20110609b20110701c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/07/30  aNon-US 7aarticle03452naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001500166245011100181300001600292500002400308500001500332520172000347650002002067650001602087650002102103650001702124650002002141650002602161650002802187650002302215650003502238650001602273650002702289650001402316650001702330650002302347650001102370650002402381650002002405650001102425650002202436650002202458650002502480653002402505653001602529700001502545700001702560700001602577773009102593852000902684856008802693930003302781945002502814946001102839655001202850IND4438683920221119221135.0100618e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443868392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2010.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aF2001 aMann, R.S.10aRelative abundance and damage by target and non-target insects on Bollgard and BollgardII cotton cultivars  ap. 793-801.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBollgard® and BollgardII® cotton cultivars were evaluated for their efficacy for control of bollworms and their effects on sucking insects and the abundance of natural enemies under bollworm insecticide protected and non-insecticide protected field conditions during the 2004 and 2005 cropping seasons. Bollgard cultivars are genetic transforms that produce Cry1Ac toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) to control American bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera. Second generation BollgardII cultivars contain 2 toxins, Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab, and are more effective in controlling a broader range of caterpillar species. Bollgard cultivars were free of H. armigera damage until harvest under insecticide protected as well as non-protected conditions. Both BollgardII and Bollgard cultivars were infested with larvae of spotted bollworm, Earias vitella, and spiny bollworm, Earias insulana, at later crop growth stages. Neither BollgardII nor Bollgard cultivars were free of square (fruiting body), open boll and loculi damage. Bollworm damage did not reach economic threshold levels up to harvest. Densities of sucking insects (Amrasca biguttula biguttula, Bemisia tabaci, Aphis gossypi, and Thrips tabaci), of the foliage feeder Myllocerus undecimpustulatus and of predators (Chrysoperla spp., Orius spp., Coccinella spp., Brumus spp., Vespa spp., Lycosa spp., and Aranews spp.) were similar on Bollgard, BollgardII and conventional cultivars. The time of the first appearance of bollworms, sucking insects and predators on Bt cotton did not vary from conventional cotton varieties. Insecticidal protection based on economic threshold levels resulted in significant reductions in bollworm damage on conventional cultivars. 3aEarias vittella 3afiber crops 3acrystal proteins 3aplant damage 3aEarias insulana 3ainsecticidal proteins 3ainterspecific variation 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aplant-incorporated protectants 3aplant pests 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3acultivars 3ainsect pests 3aeconomic threshold 3alarvae 3anontarget organisms 3aadverse effects 3acotton 3apredatory insects 3atransgenic plants 3aHelicoverpa armigera 0aspecies differences 0aLepidoptera1 aGill, R.S.1 aDhawan, A.K.1 aShera, P.S.0 tCrop protection.g2010 Aug., v. 29, no. 8 p.793-801dElsevier Sciencex0261-21947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2010.04.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20100911b20101001c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/07/30  aNon-US 7aarticle03222naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198072001700215072001700232072001700249100001900266245009700285300001600382500001500398520112200413650002201535650002301557650002301580650001901603650001801622650001601640650002301656650001501679650004101694650002301735650002301758650002501781650002001806650001401826650001901840650001201859650001201871650002101883650001201904650001201916650003701928650001901965650001201984650002501996650001102021650002002032650001102052650004302063650002702106651001902133651001802152653002502170700001702195700001902212773008202231852000902313856008502322930003302407945002502440946001102465655001202476IND4413810720221119221310.0081215e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441381072DNAL7 a188368982pmid7 a10.1080/000716608022904162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Certified organic pullet producers were surveyed to gain a better understanding of the production environment, to identify the key constraints to organic pullet rearing and to identify factors that affected bird health. 2. Pullet rearers had been involved in organic production for between 1 and 12 years. 3. The number of pullets reared per annum ranged from 6 to 12 000 and the number of birds housed per unit from <50 to >1000. 4. The primary reason for being involved in organic production was given as 'commercial' with 'environmental' and 'welfare' being the next most popular categories. 5. Fewer than 50% of the respondents vaccinated their flocks and, for those that were protected, the diseases vaccinated against frequently were Newcastle disease, infectious bronchitis and Marek's disease. Annual mortality ranged from <2 to >7% with smothering accounting for 25% of all mortality. 6. Approximately 40% of respondents saw no constraints to rearing organic pullets while others identified a range of factors including capital, availability of land and inadequate margins as being the primary constraint. 3aanimal well-being 3apoultry production 3adisease prevention 3aeconomic costs 3aanimal health 3avaccination 3afarm profitability 3amotivation 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3afarmers' attitudes 3aorganic production 3apsychosocial factors 3acontrol methods 3amortality 3aquestionnaires 3arearing 3afarmers 3apoultry diseases 3asurveys 3apullets 2aAgriculturexeconomicsxmethods. 2aAnimal Welfare 2aAnimals 2aChickensxphysiology 2aFemale 2aHousing, Animal 2aHumans 2aPoultry Diseasesxprevention & control 2aSocioeconomic Factors. 3aUnited Kingdom 0aGreat Britain 0aproduction economics1 aConroy, M.A.1 aSandilands, V.0 tBritish poultry science.g2008 Sept., v. 49, no. 5 p.525-532x0007-16687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/000716608022904163Available from publisher's Web site  a20090218b20090301c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/01/21  aNon-US 7aarticle03004naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162072001700179072001700196100002000213245006100233300001600294520182300310650001002133650001802143650002502161650001502186650002402201650002302225650001202248651001902260653001802279700002302297700002102320773007802341852000902419856008502428930003302513945002502546946001102571655001202582IND4413808520221119221116.0081215s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441380852DNAL7 a10.1108/000707008109066062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAlonso, Abel D.10aImportance of tasting rooms for Canary Islands' wineries  ap. 977-988.  aPurpose -- The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of the tasting room for wineries from a re-developing Spanish wine region, and identify the challenges winery owners currently face in their pursuit to market their wines through the tasting room. Design/methodology/approach -- Between May and June of 2007 a total of 23 winery owners, managers and wine makers located in the Canary Islands were interviewed from a sample of 61 wineries identified in Tenerife and La Palma islands. Findings -- The findings confirm the vital importance of the tasting room as a marketing, branding, and educative vehicle for the wine product. Overall, wineries focus on the tasting room as a way to advertise and present their wines to visitors and passers by as part of a long-term strategy, rather than as a way to make direct wine sales. Research limitations/implications -- It is acknowledged that the sample of only 23 participating businesses may not be enough to make generalisations about the impact of the tasting room on wineries of the Canary Islands. However, the sample does provide useful insights into the benefits, issues and challenges of the tasting room in this context. Practical implications -- The findings demonstrate the innovative and proactive spirit of winery management, including the push for quality and educating visitors, as key to survival and success in this very competitive industry. In this process, the role of the tasting room becomes critical to achieve those objectives. Originality/value -- The study provides new insights into the role of the tasting room in a Spanish wine region that has received very limited attention. The exploratory nature of this study also provides an avenue for future studies into an industry that is growing around a region's main income magnet: tourism. 3ataste 3awine industry 3amarketing strategies 3awinemaking 3abrand name products 3aconsumer education 3atourism 3aCanary Islands 0atasting rooms1 aSheridan, Lynnaire1 aScherrer, Pascal0 tBritish food journal.g2008, v. 110, no. 10-11 p.977-988x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1108/000707008109066063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090225b20090301c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/01/15  aNon-US 7aarticle01992naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245010700167300001600274500002400290520090700314650001501221650002501236650002501261650001601286650000901302650001101311650001401322650002601336650001101362650001701373650001001390650002301400650001701423700002001440773008901460852000901549856004801558655001201606IND4416976420221119221157.0090228e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441697642DNAL7 a10.1007/s10709-008-9277-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiles, Cecelia M.10aLife history trade-offs and response to selection on egg size in the polychaete worm Hydroides elegans  ap. 289-298.  aIncludes references  aIn order to examine the genetic relationships among life-history traits in a hermaphroditic species we used artificial selection for increased egg size and measured correlated responses across the life cycle of the serpulid polychaete Hydroides elegans, a protandrous sequential hermaphrodite. We recorded sex ratios across generations, and measured egg size, egg energy, larval volume at two time points, juvenile tube length, adult dry weight and fecundity after selection. Selection for larger eggs produced positive correlated responses in egg energy, fecundity and larval size at competence. Selection for increased egg size was also manifested by earlier sex change and this resulted in selected individuals spending less time as males relative to controls. We propose that egg size is negatively correlated with duration of andromorphy, that is, that female fitness trades off with male fitness. 3aPolychaeta 3aartificial selection 3acorrelated responses 3acorrelation 3aeggs 3aenergy 3afecundity 3agenetic relationships 3alarvae 3alife history 3amales 3aselection response 3asex reversal1 aWayne, Marta L.0 tGenetica.g2009 Apr., v. 135, no. 3 p.289-298dSpringer Netherlandsx0016-67077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10709-008-9277-3 7aarticle03788naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245007400172300001600246520237400262650002902636650001402665650002102679650001102700650002002711650001302731650001202744650003402756650001302790650001302803650003202816650003102848650001002879650001702889650001002906650001402916650002002930650001102950650001302961650001402974700003202988700002103020700002103041773018003062856005503242852000903297655001203306IND60620242120221119221153.0181107s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062024212DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1095-8312.2003.00181.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJokela, Jukka10aGenetic variation in sexual and clonal lineages of a freshwater snail  ap. 165-181.  aSexual reproduction within natural populations of most plants and animals continues to remain an enigma in evolutionary biology. That the enigma persists is not for lack of testable hypotheses but rather because of the lack of suitable study systems in which sexual and asexual females coexist. Here we review our studies on one such organism, the freshwater snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray). We also present new data that bear on hypotheses for the maintenance of sex and its relationship to clonal diversity. We have found that sexual populations of the snail are composed of diploid females and males, while clonal populations are composed of a high diversity of triploid apomictic females. Sexual and asexual individuals coexist in stable frequencies in many ‘mixed’ populations; genetic data indicate that clones from these mixed populations originated from the local population of sexual individuals without interspecific hybridization. Field data show that clonal and sexual snails have completely overlapping life histories, but individual clonal genotypes are less variable than individuals from the sympatric sexual population. Field data also show segregation of clones among depth-specific habitat zones within a lake, but clonal diversity remains high even within habitats. A new laboratory experiment revealed extensive clonal variation in reproductive rate, a result which suggests that clonal diversity would be low in nature without some form of frequency-dependent selection. New results from a long-term field study of a natural, asexual population reveal that clonal diversity remained nearly constant over a 10-year period. Nonetheless, clonal turnover occurs, and it occurs in a manner that is consistent with parasite-mediated, frequency-dependent selection. Reciprocal cross-infection experiments have further shown that parasites are more infective to sympatric host snails than to allopatric snails, and that they are also more infective to common clones than rare clones within asexual host populations. Hence we suggest that sexual reproduction in these snails may be maintained, at least in part, by locally adapted parasites. Parasite-mediated selection possibly also contributes to the maintenance of local clonal diversity within habitats, while clonal selection may be responsible for the distribution of clones among habitats. 3aPotamopyrgus antipodarum 3aallopatry 3aclonal variation 3aclones 3across infection 3adiploidy 3afemales 3afrequency dependent selection 3agenotype 3ahabitats 3ainterspecific hybridization 3alaboratory experimentation 3alakes 3alife history 3amales 3aparasites 3aplants (botany) 3asnails 3asympatry 3atriploidy1 aLively, C.

The plants were grown in modified Hoagland nutrient solution containing Fe in chemical form of Fe(III)-citrate or Fe(III)-EDTA, as well as the heavy metal contaminants, each in concentration of 10 micromolar. In the roots the larger part of Pb was found in the apoplasm, while Ni and Cd were mostly in the symplasm. In the leaves however, about 50-60% of the Pb content and practically the total amount of Cd were detected in the symplasm. About 30-40% of the translocated Ni remained in the apoplasm of the leaves. The Cd-, Ni- and Pb-treatments resulted in higher total concentration of Fe in the roots, however, the relative amount of Fe in the symplasm decreased in all cases. In the leaves of the control plants the larger part (60-80%) of Fe occurs in the symplasm. Due to the heavy metal effects, the relative amount of Fe in the symplasm decreased except in the Pb-contaminated plants, where in the presence of Fe(III)-EDTA, the Pb treatment resulted in a moderate increment of Fe concentration in the symplasm. 3aCucumis sativus 3aheavy metals1 aZaray, G.1 aFodor, F.0 tJournal of inorganic biochemistry.g2002 Apr. 10, v. 89, no. 1/2 p.149-154x0162-01347nnas  aDNAL  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle01312naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245005700171300001600228520041700244650001100661650002100672650001100693650002200704650001200726700002100738700001900759773018000778856005500958852000901013655001201022IND60620242320221119221216.0181107s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062024232DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1095-8312.2003.00189.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLushai, Gugs14aThe dynamic clonal genome and its adaptive potential  ap. 193-208.  aPopulations of clonal organisms are often represented as being evolutionary inert with persistent genetic fidelity.

A recent investigation of the relevant copper(II)-amino acid equilibria reconciled these conflicting data, confirming that the reliability of computer models crucially depends on the data on which they are based. Since then, however, some of the constants of the copper-serine system used in that study have been suspected to be overestimated. This work thus reports the redetermination of copper-serine and copper-histidine-serine formation constants under physiological conditions. In addition, serine being close to asparagine in Neumann and Sass-Kortsak's classification, copper-asparagine and copper-histidine-asparagine equilibria have also been reinvestigated. For asparagine complexes, former constants have been basically confirmed. In contrast, all constants relative to serine have effectively been found lower than the previous ones. The effects of these new data on the stimulated distribution of plasma copper are only minor, but a better agreement is observed relative to Neumann and Sass-Kortsak's models in reconstituted serum. 3acopper 3aserine 3ahistidine 3aasparagine 3achemical speciation 3ablood plasma 3asimulation models 2aAsparaginexbloodxchemistry. 2aComputer Simulation 2aCopperxbloodxchemistry. 2aHistidinexbloodxchemistry. 2aKinetics 2aModels, Biological 2aModels, Chemical 2aSerinexbloodxchemistry. 0acomputer simulation 0aequilibrium 0ainteractions 0achemical complexes1 aAlliey, N.1 aBerthon, G.0 tJournal of inorganic biochemistry.g1993 Dec., v. 52, no. 4 p.287-296x0162-01347nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03169naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245010600145300001600251520183700267650001302104650001302117650000902130650001502139650002302154650001202177650002802189650003602217650004402253650005802297650001102355650001402366650003502380650003502415650000902450650002502459653001102484700001402495700001402509700001702523773009102540852000902631930003302640945001302673946001302686655001202699IND2203472920221119221026.0000330e199908  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220347292DNAL7 a106120632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVittori, D.10aMorphologic and functional alterations of erythroid cells induced by long-term ingestion of aluminium  ap. 113-120.  aAnaemia has been associated with aluminium (Al) accumulation in plasma and/or bone tissue in patients with chronic renal insufficiency. Nevertheless, in previous works, we have found shortened red-cell life span, increased osmotic resistance and inhibition of colony-forming units-erythroid (CFU-E) development in Al-overloaded rats with normal renal function. To elucidate further the action of Al on in vivo erythropoiesis, aluminium citrate was provided to Sprague Dawley rats (n = 18) in the drinking water for 8 months. Significant decreases in haematocrit (38.8 +/- 4.29 versus 43.1 +/- 3.58%, p < 0.05) and blood haemoglobin concentration (137 +/- 10.1 versus 148 +/- 8.5 g/l, p < 0.05), reticulocytosis (1.8/1.3-4.2 versus 1.2/0.4-3.7%, p < 0.05), and severe inhibition of CFU-E growth (670/120-950 versus 1530/810-2440 CFU-E/2 x 10(5) cells, p < 0.005) were found. Anysocytosis, poikilocytosis and schistocytosis were detected in peripheral blood stained films. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the presence of erythrocytes with abnormal shape, including crenated and target cells. Aluminium was localised specially inside the schistocytes by EDAX analysis. Decreased haptoglobin concentration (107/83-127 versus 139/89-169 mg/l, p < 0.05) supports the assumption of haemolytic nature of the anaemia. Rats were not iron depleted, as plasma iron concentration and total iron binding capacity were found in the range of control values, and sideroblasts and haemosiderin deposits were observed in bone marrow smears. Total (59)Fe uptake and (59)Fe incorporated to haem by the bone marrow cells were found decreased. In conclusion, the erythropoiesis impairment induced by Al may be a combined effect of direct action on circulating erythrocytes and interference with the cellular iron metabolism in erythroid progenitors. 3aaluminum 3atoxicity 3airon 3aabsorption 2aAluminumxtoxicity 2aAnimals 2aBiological Availability 2aBone Marrow Cellsxdrug effects 2aErythrocyte Deformabilityxdrug effects 2aErythrocytesxcytologyxdrug effectsxultrastructure. 2aFemale 2aHemolysis 2aIronxbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 0auptake1 aNesse, A.1 aPerez, G.1 aGarbossa, G.0 tJournal of inorganic biochemistry.g1999 Aug., v. 76, no. 2 p.113-120x0162-01347nnas  aDNAL  a20000602b20000608c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle01932naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002500110245009100135300001400226520115800240650001401398700002201412700001901434700001601453700002301469773009401492852000901586930003301595945001301628946001301641655001201654IND2332677220221119221119.0030521e20020410nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233267722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDendrinou-Samara, C.10a15-MC-5 manganese metallacrowns hosting herbicide complexes.

The crystal structure contains a neutral 15-membered metallacrown ring of the type [15-MCMn(III)N(shi)-5]. The metallacrown core consists of five Mn(III) and five shi-3 ligands. The 15-membered metallacrown ring is formed by the succession of five structural moieties of the type [Mn(III)-N-O]. The diversity in the configuration (planar or propeller) for the ring Mn(III) ions gives to the metallacrown core flexibility and simultaneously allows the encapsulation of the sixth Mn(II). The encapsulated Mn(II) is seven-coordinate and is bound to the five hydroximate oxygen donors provided by the metallacrown core, and two oxygen atoms from the carboxylate herbicide ligands. Antibacterial screening data showed that among all the compounds tested, manganese metallacrowns are more active than the simple manganese herbicide or carboxylate complexes while an increase in the efficiency of [15-MCMn(III)N(shi)-5] towards the analogous [12-MCMn(III)N(shi)-4] can be observed. 3asynthesis1 aAlevizopoulou, L.1 aIordanidis, L.1 aSamaras, E.1 aKessissoglou, D.P.0 tJournal of inorganic biochemistry.g2002 Apr. 10, v. 89, no. 1/2 p.89-96x0162-01347nnas  aDNAL  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle04035naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148100002400157245011100181300001600292500002400308520257100332650001902903650001602922650001602938650001502954650002402969650002302993650002103016650001103037650001903048650001903067650001703086650002503103650001003128650002703138650001303165653001503178653001703193700001903210700002303229700002003252773009103272852000903363856008803372930003303460945002503493946001103518655001203529IND4438684720221119221044.0100618e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443868472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2010.04.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aH0001 avan Zyl, Sybrand A.10aEffects of adjuvants on deposition efficiency of fenhexamid sprays applied to Chardonnay grapevine foliage  ap. 843-852.  aIncludes references  aAdequate spray deposition on susceptible grapevine tissue is an essential requirement for effective chemical control of economically important diseases, such as grey mould, powdery mildew and downy mildew. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of some agricultural adjuvants to improve foliar spray deposition. Deposition quantity and quality was assessed by means of a spray assessment protocol using fluorometry, photomicrography and digital image analyses. The visual droplet rating technique developed by G Furness, Australia, was also included in initial assessments. Both assessment protocols showed that spray deposition quantity increased with increasing spray volume applications of 27lha⁻¹ to 581lha⁻¹ with a motorised backpack mistblower, but decreased at 698lha⁻¹, possibly due to run-off. Addition of selected spray adjuvants at 526lha⁻¹ volume demonstrated improved deposition quantity and quality. Agral 90 (ethoxylated alkylphenol), BB5 (acidifier), Nu-film-P (terpene oil), and Solitaire (silicone/plant oil) significantly improved deposition on upper and lower leaf surfaces compared with the fenhexamid-only and water sprayed control. Break-thru S240 (organosilicone) and Villa 51 (alkylpolyethylene glycol ether) did not improve deposition quantity, although remarkably better deposition quality was obtained. An adjuvant concentration effect (within the registered concentration range) was evident at spray volumes of 502lha⁻¹, especially those retained on the upper leaf surfaces. Agral 90 and Nu-film-P effected significant improvement of spray deposition at the higher concentrations (18ml and 50mlhl⁻¹, respectively), but not at the lower concentrations (6ml and 20mlhl⁻¹, respectively). Solitaire improved deposition at the lower concentration tested (50mlhl⁻¹), whereas reduced deposition at the higher concentration (100ml per hl⁻¹) was attributed to excessive spray run-off. No significant improvement of spray deposition was observed for both concentrations tested with Villa 51 (50 and 100mlhl⁻¹). Spray mixtures with adjuvants Agral 90 and Solitaire yielded similar deposition values at 500lha⁻¹ compared with the fenhexamid-only control at 720lha⁻¹, but reduced deposition at the higher spray volume, possibly due to spray run-off. This study clearly demonstrated the potential of adjuvants to improve deposition quantity and quality, but highlights the necessity to match adjuvant concentrations and application volumes on the spray target to achieve maximum spray deposition. 3aVitis vinifera 3awine grapes 3afruit crops 3afungicides 3apesticide adjuvants 3afoliar application 3aspray deposition 3aleaves 3aimage analysis 3adigital images 3aspray volume 3aspatial distribution 3awater 3achemical concentration 3asurfaces 0afenhexamid 0aspray runoff1 aBrink, Jan-Cor1 aCalitz, Frikkie J.1 aFourie, Paul H.0 tCrop protection.g2010 Aug., v. 29, no. 8 p.843-852dElsevier Sciencex0261-21947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2010.04.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20100911b20101001c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/07/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02032naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245008700129300001600216520125800232650002501490650001201515650002701527653002301554700001601577773009301593852000901686930003301695945001301728946001301741655001201754IND2332802920221119220806.0030529e200104  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233280292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNedoluzhko, A.10aOrdered association of tobacco mosaic virus in the presence of divalent metal ions  ap. 233-240.  aThe formation of ordered aggregates of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in the presence of divalent metal ions has been studied in concentrated (1-25 mg/ml) solutions of the virus. The divalent metal cations Cd(2+), Zn(2+), Pb(2+), Cu(2+), and Ni(2+) have been found to promote TMV precipitation from solution at a critical concentration Ccrit, which for a given metal depends on the pH and the ionic strength of the solution, but is largely independent of the virus concentration. The TMV precipitate behaves as a nematic liquid crystal and on drying at a glass surface produces highly ordered, optically birefringent films. However, precipitation is not observed with alkali-earth metals such as Ca(2+) and Mg(2+). The experimental data suggest that, apart from two 'internal' metal-binding sites in each TMV subunit, the virus contains metal-binding sites of a lower affinity which promote cross-linking of TMV rods via metal bridges. The latter seem to be responsible for the precipitation of TMV in the presence of divalent cations at neutral pH. We propose that the metal-induced cross-linking may be the predominant mechanism to account for the limited solubility of a variety of proteins in solution containing metal cations with valence 2 and higher. 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3acations 3achemical precipitation 0aprotein solubility1 aDouglas, T.0 tJournal of inorganic biochemistry.g2001 Apr., v. 84, no. 3/4 p.233-240x0162-01347nnas  aDNAL  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle03751naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245007500148300001600223520194200239650002202181650001802203650002102221650000902242650001102251650000902262650002302271650001002294650001202304650004102316650003202357650003302389650004702422650002902469650003702498650004702535650002302582650002402605650003402629650006402663650005002727650003602777653001702813653001502830653001302845700001502858700001702873700001802890700001602908700002002924700001802944700001602962773009102978852000903069930003303078945001303111946001303124655001203137IND2050990020221119220903.0960425e199512  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205099002DNAL7 a85309232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, R.R.10aChelating agent inhibition of Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes in vitro  ap. 277-288.  aA number of chelating agents and some of their derivatives are as effective as, or superior to, benznidazole, the compound currently in clinical use, in the suppression of the reproduction of epimastigotes of Trypanosoma cruzi, the protozoa that causes Chagas' disease. All compounds were examined at a culture concentration of 5 microgram/mL. The most effective compounds included N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine, sodium diethylamine-N-carbodithioate, piperidine-N-carbodithioate and several of its analogs, a number of other carbodithioates with two nonpolar groups on the nitrogen, and tetraethylthiuram disulfide, a prodrug of sodium diethylamine-N-carbodithioate and widely used in the treatment of alcoholism. The introduction of additional ionic or nonionic polar groups on the chelating molecule generally results in a loss of tyrpanocidal activity. Common commercially available chelating agents which exhibited no activity included D-penicillamine, meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid, and triethylenetetramine tetrahydrochloride. Dose-response data on the culture indicated that some of these compounds exhibited inhibition of Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes at concentrations as low as 0.625 microgram/mL. It is proposed that the mechanism of action of these compounds is based on their ability to interfere with the essential metal metabolism at intracellular sites of the epimastigote involving iron, copper, or zinc. The results also indicate that a certain degree of hydrophobicity may be necessary for the groups attached to the literal metal-bonding structure if the compounds are to successfully inhibit the epimastigotes of Trypanosoma cruzi. The development of antiprotozoal drugs which are chelating agents specifically designed to selectively disrupt the essential metal metabolism of Trypanosoma cruzi should furnish a new generation of drugs which can be used in the treatment of Chagas' disease. 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3aepimastigotes 3achelating agents 3airon 3acopper 3azinc 3amineral metabolism 3adrugs 2aAnimals 2aCarbamatesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aCell Divisionxdrug effects 2aChagas Diseasexdrug therapy 2aChelating Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aDisulfidesxpharmacology 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEthylenediaminesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aMetalsxmetabolism 2aMolecular Structure 2aNitroimidazolesxpharmacology 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aTrypanocidal Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aTrypanosoma cruzixdrug effects 0abenznidazole 0ainhibition 0ain vitro1 aLane, J.E.1 aCarter, C.E.1 aBogitsh, B.J.1 aSingh, P.K.1 aZimmerman, L.J.1 aMolenda, J.J.1 aJones, M.M.0 tJournal of inorganic biochemistry.g1995 Dec., v. 60, no. 4 p.277-288x0162-01347nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02357naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245008500142300001600227520118500243650000901428650002101437650001201458650002201470650004701492650003101539650004101570650001301611650002401624650001601648650002601664650003201690653001201722653001201734653001501746700001401761773009201775852000901867930003301876945001301909946001301922655001201935IND2043804620221119221003.0941221e199409  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204380462DNAL7 a79647162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, J.H.10aStudies of the substrate binding to xanthine oxidase using a spin-labeled analog  ap. 295-303.  aA spin-labeled adenine derivative [N6-(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-oxypiperidin-4-yl)adenine; SLAD] is found to be a very slow substrate of xanthine oxidase based on the observed reduction of enzyme by SLAD under anaerobic conditions. A room-temperature EPR spectrum of SLAD in the presence of oxidized xanthine oxidase shows the appearance of "wings" on the three-line spectrum of the free spin-label, indicating formation of an E.SLAD complex. This spectrum can be obtained on a timescale that is short compared to catalysis. Using this spectral change as an experimental probe, the room-temperature Kd's of SLAD binding to oxidized xanthine oxidase at various pH's have been determined. Obtained Kd values are 1.5 +/- 0.3 mM, and 1.6 +/- 0.3 mM, and 1.5 +/- 0.3 mM at pH 10.0, 8.5, and 7.0, respectively, indicating no significant difference in the equilibrium dissociation of SLAD from enzyme upon pH change. These results are consistent with the calculated equilibrium dissociation constant for substrate binding to oxidized molybdenum center based on Kd to reduced enzyme and the perturbation of Mo(VI)/Mo(V) and Mo(V)/Mo(IV) reduction potentials by product and substrate analogs. 3amilk 3axanthine oxidase 3aadenine 3aspectral analysis 2aAdeninexanalogs & derivativesxchemistry. 2aCyclic N-Oxidesxchemistry 2aElectron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy 2aKinetics 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aSpin Labels 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aXanthine Oxidasexchemistry 0aanalogs 0abinding 0asubstrates1 aHille, R.0 tJournal of inorganic biochemistry.g1994 Sept., v. 55, no. 4 p.295-303x0162-01347nnas  aDNAL  a19950110b19950113c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01126naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245006700131300001400198300001900212520037400231650001100605650002000616650002100636650001700657650001800674773008100692852000900773939003300782945000800815946001300823655001200836991570584890742620221119220858.0840308e198301  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840044242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMans, Jack.10aKumiss Manufacturing meeting strong consumer demand for yogurt  ap. 78-80.  ap. 78-80. ill.  aConsumer emphasis on natural and health foods has increased the demand for yogurt more than 1300% in the last 20 years.

To better define the prevalence of infectious diseases and micronutrient deficiencies, assess immunological status, and evaluate associations between nutritional status and infection, we performed a cross-sectional study of elderly Ecuadorians in a low-income peri-urban community in Quito, Ecuador. Culturally adapted questionnaires, delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin response, micronutrient, and immunological assays were performed in randomly selected Ecuadorians aged greater-than-or-equal65 y. Multiple linear and logistic regression models were developed to assess relationships between micronutrient concentrations and history of infection, DTH, and immune function. Participants (n = 352; mean age ± SD, 74.4 ± 6.4 y) recalled recent episodes of colds/influenza-like syndromes (62.8%), cough (61.0%), urinary tract infection (37.9%), diarrhea (32.2%), fever (24.1%), and pneumonia (3.5%). A prospective substudy of respiratory infections (RI) in 203 elderly revealed similar findings. Colds and pneumonia occurred in 42.8 and 7.9% of participants, respectively, during 737 person-weeks of observation (3.6 ± 1.1 wk per person). Anemia and micronutrient deficiencies, especially for vitamins C, D, B-6, and B-12 and folic acid and zinc, were common. Plasma vitamin C was associated with interferon-γ (IFNγ) (P < 0.01) and zinc with IFNγ and interleukin-2 (each P < 0.0001). RI history was associated with any micronutrient deficiency (P < 0.001). The burden of infectious diseases, micronutrient deficiencies, and anemia was substantial in this elderly Ecuadorian population. Deficiencies of essential vitamins and minerals place these elderly adults at risk for infections through their negative impact on immune function.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3anutrient deficiencies 3aimmune response 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aelderly 3aelderly nutrition 3anutritional status 3ainfection 3across-sectional studies 3ahypersensitivity 3anutrition assessment 3aquestionnaires 3adeficiency diseases 3aascorbic acid 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aData Collection 2aDiarrheaxcomplications 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHypersensitivity, Delayedxepidemiologyximmunology. 2aImmunity, Innate 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aMalnutrition 2aMicronutrientsxbloodxdeficiency. 2aOdds Ratio 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRespiratory Tract Infectionsxcomplicationsxepidemiologyximmunology. 2aSkin Tests 3aEcuador 0aEcuador1 aSempértegui, Fernando1 aEstrella, Bertha1 aTucker, Katherine L.1 aRodríguez, Alicia.1 aEgas, Josefina1 aDallal, Gerard E.1 aSelhub, Jacob1 aGriffiths, Jeffrey K.1 aMeydani, Simin Nikbin0 tJournal of nutrition.g2009 Jan., v. 139, no. 1 p.113-119dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/jn.108.0950913Available from publisher's Web site  a20090316b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/03/05  aOther US 7aarticle03744naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245010400145300001600249500001500265520190300280650002302183650001102206650002902217650002302246650001002269650002302279650002502302650001202327650002502339650001402364650003502378650002602413650001502439650002202454650002102476650001602497650001502513650001202528650002202540650002402562650003502586650001502621650002102636650000902657650001702666650003802683650002602721653001502747653002302762653002002785653002202805700001502827700001602842700001702858700001602875773012302891852000903014930003303023945001303056946001303069655001203082IND2051991320221119221130.0960705e199603  mau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205199132DNAL7 a86331092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchedl, H.P.10aEffects of dietary calcium and phosphorus on vitamin D metabolism and calcium absorption in hamster  ap. 281-286.  a2019-12-05  aWe studied the following responses to restriction of dietary calcium and phosphorus in the growing hamster: (i) serum concentrations of calcium, inorganic phosphorus, magnesium, and vitamin D metabolites; and (ii) calcium transport by ileum. Diets fed were normal calcium with normal or low phosphorus or low calcium with normal or low phosphorus. We found serum 1 alpha,25-dihydroxycalciferol (1,25-[OH]2D) concentration did not differ significantly among the diet groups. Calcium absorption, measured as serosal/mucosal calcium concentration ratio produced by everted ileal sac, was greater in the low calcium, normal phosphorus group than in all other groups. The other groups did not differ from one another in calcium absorption. Feeding the low calcium, normal phosphorus diet increased inorganic phosphorus and magnesium but decreased calcium concentration in serum in comparison with the other three diets. Both low phosphorus diets were without effect on serum calcium, but the low calcium, low phosphorus diet increased serum inorganic phosphorus and magnesium above that of the normal calcium, low phosphorus diet. Ileal calcium absorption in hamster (i) was independent of serum 1,25-(OH)2D concentration; (ii) increased in response to low dietary calcium if dietary phosphorus was normal; and (iii) was independent of dietary calcium, it dietary phosphorus was low. Despite increased calcium absorption, serum calcium was decreased in the low calcium-normal phosphorus group as compared with all other groups. Feeding low calcium diets increased serum inorganic phosphorus and magnesium as compared with feeding the corresponding normal calcium diets (i.e., independently of whether dietary phosphorus content was normal or low). These studies demonstrate that the interrelationships between calcium absorption and vitamin D and mineral metabolism in hamster differ from other mammals. 3avitamin metabolism 3aserosa 3a25-hydroxyergocalciferol 3amineral metabolism 3aileum 3anutrient transport 3aMesocricetus auratus 3acalcium 3ainorganic phosphorus 3amagnesium 3a24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol 3aintestinal absorption 3acalcitriol 3aintestinal mucosa 3adietary minerals 3ametabolites 2aAbsorption 2aAnimals 2aCalcitriolxblood 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCalcium, Dietaryxpharmacology 2aCricetinae 2aMagnesiumxblood 2aMale 2aMesocricetus 2aPhosphorus, Dietaryxpharmacology 2aVitamin Dxmetabolism 0ametabolism 0acalcium absorption 0agolden hamsters 0acalcium transport1 aConway, T.1 aHorst, R.L.1 aMiller, D.L.1 aBrown, C.K.0 tProceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.g1996 Mar., v. 211, no. 3 p.281-286x0037-97277nnas  aDNAL  a19960801b19960808c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02005naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245007500148300001400223520069000237650001100927650002400938650001200962650001800974650004600992650001101038650002301049650002401072650002801096650003801124650005201162650005601214650002401270700001301294700001501307700001801322700001501340700001701355700001801372773008901390852000901479930003301488945001301521946001301534655001201547IND2057568520221119220938.0970609e199704  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205756852DNAL7 a90769702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCbruscinska, E.10aBinding ability of Cu2+ ions by opiate-like fragments of bovine casein  ap. 19-22.  aThe coordination modes of Cu(II) to alpha-casein (90-95) and alpha-casein (90-96) peptides with opioid activity isolated from pepsin hydrolisates of alpha-casein were investigated by means of electron paramagnetic resonance, absorption, and circular dichroism spectroscopy and potentiometry.

  1 aO'Brien, Diane M.10aRed blood cell δ¹⁵N: a novel biomarker of dietary eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid intake  ap. 913-919.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The long-chain omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids derived from fish, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and other chronic diseases. Study of the associations between EPA and DHA intake and disease requires a valid biomarker of dietary intake; however, the direct measurement of tissue fatty acid concentrations is expensive and time consuming. OBJECTIVE: Because the nitrogen stable isotope ratio (¹⁵N/¹⁴N, expressed as δ¹⁵N) is elevated in fish, we investigated whether δ¹⁵N is a valid alternative biomarker of EPA and DHA intake. DESIGN: We examined the relation between red blood cell (RBC) δ¹⁵N and RBC EPA and DHA in a community-based sample of 496 Yup'ik Eskimos with widely varying intake of n-3 fatty acids. We also assessed the correlation between δ¹⁵N and dietary EPA and DHA intake based on 24-h dietary recalls and 3-d food records completed by a subset of 221 participants. RESULTS: RBC δ¹⁵N was strongly correlated with RBC EPA and DHA (r = 0.83 and 0.75, respectively). These correlations differed only modestly by sex and age class. RBC δ¹⁵N also correlated with dietary EPA and DHA intake (r = 0.47 and 0.46, respectively) and did not differ by sex and age. CONCLUSIONS: The results strongly support the validity of RBC δ¹⁵N as a biomarker of EPA and DHA intake. Because the analysis of RBC δ¹⁵N is rapid and inexpensive, this method could facilitate wide-scale assessment of EPA and DHA intake in clinical and epidemiologic studies.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aerythrocytes 3abiomarkers 3anutrition assessment 3anutritional adequacy 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3afat intake 3aEskimos 3afood records 3adietary fat 3arapid methods 0ared blood cell delta(15)N1 aKristal, Alan R.1 aJeannet, M.

  1 aCorder, Kirsten10aIs it possible to assess free-living physical activity and energy expenditure in young people by self-report?  ap. 862-870.  aBACKGROUND: It is unclear whether it is possible to accurately estimate physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) by self-report in youth. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the validity and reliability of 4 self-reports to assess PAEE and time spent at moderate and vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) over the previous week in British young people between 4 and 17 y of age. DESIGN: PAEE and MVPA were derived from the Children's Physical Activity Questionnaire, Youth Physical Activity Questionnaire, and Swedish Adolescent Physical Activity Questionnaire; a lifestyle score indicative of habitual activity was derived from the Child Heart and Health Study in England Questionnaire. These data were compared with criterion methods, PAEE, and MVPA derived from simultaneous measurements by doubly labeled water and accelerometry in 3 age groups: 4-5 y (n = 27), 12-13 y (n = 25), and 16-17 y (n = 24). Validity was assessed by using Spearman correlations and the Bland-Altman method, and reliability was assessed by using intraclass correlation coefficients. RESULTS: The strength of association between questionnaire and criterion methods varied (r = 0.09 to r = 0.46). Some questionnaires were able to accurately assess group-level PAEE and MVPA for some age groups, but the error was large for individual-level estimates throughout. Reliability of the Youth Physical Activity Questionnaire and Child Heart and Health Study in England Questionnaire was good (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.64-0.92). CONCLUSIONS: Absolute PAEE and MVPA estimated from these self-reports were not valid on an individual level in young people, although some questionnaires appeared to rank individuals accurately. Age (the outcome of interest) and whether individual or group-level estimates are necessary will influence the best choice of self-report method when assessing physical activity in youth. 3achild nutrition 3achildren 3aadolescent nutrition 3aadolescents 3ayouth 3alifestyle 3aphysical activity 3aenergy expenditure 3aquestionnaires 3areliability 2aAdolescent 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMotor Activity 2aSurveys and Questionnairesxstandards. 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSelf Disclosure 3aEngland 3aSweden 0aYouth Physical Activity Questionnaire 0aChild Heart and Health Study in England Questionnaire1 avan Sluijs, Esther MF1 aWright, Antony1 aWhincup, Peter1 aWareham, Nicholas J.1 aEkelund, Ulf0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2009 Mar., v. 89, no. 3 p.862-870dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2008.267393Available from publisher's Web site  a20110625b20110701c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/04/16  aOther US 7aarticle03505naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092024002200126024001900148040001800167072001700185072001700202072001700219100002200236245007100258300001800329500013200347500001500479506007600494520178100570506003702351650001702388650001702405650001202422650001802434650002102452650002302473650003102496650002302527650001202550651001502562653001502577700002302592700001402615700002202629700002102651773013902672852000902811856008402820930003302904945002502937946001302962655001202975IND4416592720221207093532.0090220e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441659272DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.2008.26692E2doi7 aPMC27143992pmcid7 a191767292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Black.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Depressive disorders are a major source of disability among low-income mothers in developing countries. OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to examine the association of maternal depressive symptoms and infant growth among infants in rural Bangladesh and to examine how the relation is affected by infant irritability and caregiving practices. DESIGN: Infant growth was measured among 221 infants at 6 and 12 mo. Mothers reported their depressive symptoms and perceptions of their infant's temperament, and a home observation of caregiving was conducted. RESULTS: At 6 mo, 18% of infants were stunted (length-for-age <-2 z scores). At 12 mo, 36.9% of infants were stunted; infants of mothers with depressive symptoms had a 2.17 higher odds of being stunted (95% CI: 1.24, 3.81; P = 0.007) than did infants of mothers with few symptoms (45.3% compared with 27.6%). In a multivariate regression analysis, maternal depressive symptoms were associated with 12-mo length-for-age, adjusted for 6-mo length-for-age, maternal education, infant sex, birth order, receipt of iron and zinc, months breastfed, maternal perception of infant temperament, and caregiving observations. Maternal depressive symptoms were not related to 12-mo weight-for-length. The relation between depressive symptoms and infant growth was not moderated by maternal perceptions of infant temperament, but was partially mediated by caregiving. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that infants of mothers with depressive symptoms in Bangladesh experience poor linear growth may extend to other low-income countries with high rates of food insecurity. Interventions to promote growth in infants should include prevention or treatment of maternal depressive disorders and strategies to ensure adequate food security.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3arural health 3amalnutrition 3amothers 3ainfant growth 3ainfant nutrition 3amaternal nutrition 3amother-child relationships 3agrowth retardation 3ainfants 3aBangladesh 0adepression1 aBaqui, Abdullah H.1 aZaman, K.1 aArifeen, Shams El1 aBlack, Robert E.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2009 Mar., v. 89, no. 3 p.951S-957SdAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2008.26692E3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090506b20090608c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/04/16  aOther US 7aarticle01685naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007500126300001600201520086900217650002401086650002201110650001701132650001401149650001601163653001801179653001701197700001701214773009901231852000901330939003301339946001101372655001201383IND9205458420221119220712.0920901e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920545842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukatsu, T.10aSynthesis and localization of symbionin, an aphid endosymbiont protein  ap. 167-174.  aIn an effort to know the function of symbionin, an aphid endosymbiont-specific protein homologous to Escherichia coli GroEL protein, its synthesis and localization in the host insect were investigated. Microautoradiography of the tissue sections revealed that symbionin is synthesized and localized exclusively in the bacteriocyte. Immunohistochemistry with anti-symbionin antiserum suggested also that symbionin is present only in the bacteriocyte, especially concentrated in the endosymbiont. Immunohistochemistry of the semi-ultrathin tissue sections demonstrated that symbionin is localized in the endosymbiont and not detected in the cytoplasm of the bacteriocyte. These results indicated that symbionin is synthesized, localized, and functions in the endosymbiont, suggesting that it functions for the endosymbiont's own sake rather than for the host insect. 3aAcyrthosiphon pisum 3aprotein synthesis 3ainsect pests 3asymbiosis 3achaperonins 0aendosymbiosis 0abacteriocyte1 aIshikawa, H.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g1992 Mar., v. 22, no. 2 p.167-174x0020-17907nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02370naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092024002200126024001900148040001800167072001700185072001700202072001700219100002500236245004400261300001800305500009600323500001500419506007600434520083600510506003701346650001101383650003501394650001901429650001301448650001301461650001201474650001601486650001601502650001901518653002301537653002501560773013901585852000901724856008401733930003301817945002501850946001301875655001201888IND4416593120221207095024.0090220e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441659312DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.2008.26788B2doi7 aPMC26676542pmcid7 a191900712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Leptin is a peptide hormone secreted by adipose tissue and regulates adipose tissue mass and energy balance. Recessive mutations in the leptin gene are associated with massive obesity in mice and in some humans, which establishes a genetic basis for obesity. Leptin circulates in blood and acts on the brain to regulate food intake and energy expenditure. When fat mass decreases, plasma leptin concentrations decrease, which stimulates appetite and suppresses energy expenditure until fat mass is restored. When fat mass increases, leptin concentrations increase, which suppresses appetite until weight is lost. This system maintains homeostatic control of adipose tissue mass.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aleptin 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3aadipose tissue 3aappetite 3amutation 3aobesity 3aadolescents 3ahomeostasis 3aenergy balance 0aliterature reviews 0anutrition physiology0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2009 Mar., v. 89, no. 3 p.973S-979SdAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2008.26788B3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090507b20090608c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/04/16  aOther US 7aarticle04913naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194072001700211100002000228245010100248300001800349500001500367520252300382650001502905650001202920650002002932650002402952650002002976650001302996650001203009650002603021650001603047650001403063650001103077650001903088650001503107650001803122650002303140650002003163650002303183650001803206650004103224650001203265650002403277650003403301650004603335650002103381650002303402650001103425650002603436650002203462650000903484650002903493650002103522650002203543650001203565650001603577650001703593650002803610653002303638653001803661653002203679700001903701700001903720700001603739700001603755700001803771773012103789852000903910856008103919930003304000945002504033946001304058655001204071IND4416597820221119220712.0090220e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441659782DNAL7 a190288592pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2008-09772doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The experiment was conducted over 5 consecutive winters. In each year, plots (1 ha each, 4 per treatment) were harvested for hay in August, fertilized in September, and forage was allowed to accumulate until grazing was initiated in early December. Each year, 48 Angus-cross tester cattle (4 per plot) were given a daily allotment of forage, under strip-grazing (frontal grazing) management, with a target residual height of 5 cm. Steers were used the first year, and heifers were used in subsequent years. The grazing periods for determination of pasture ADG were 86 d (yr 1), 70 d (yr 2), 86 d (yr 3), 72 d (yr 4), and 56 d (yr 5). Pasture ADG of cattle did not differ among treatments (P = 0.13) and were 0.51, 0.59, and 0.56 kg/d (SEM 0.03) for E+, E-, and EN, respectively. Serum prolactin concentrations of heifers grazing E+ were less (P < 0.05) than those grazing E- and EN during all years except yr 2. In yr 2, E+ and E- did not differ (P = 0.11). Serum prolactin of heifers grazing E- and EN did not differ (P > 0.20) except in yr 4. During yr 4, serum prolactin of heifers grazing E- was greater (P = 0.05) than that of heifers grazing EN. Serum urea-N concentrations (SUN) tended to differ among treatments (P = 0.10) and there was a treatment x year interaction (P = 0.05). During yr 1 through 3, SUN did not differ (P > 0.15) among treatments. However, as the stands aged, E- had a greater invasion of other plant species, which increased the CP content of the sward, thus causing heifers grazing E- during yr 5 to have greater (P < 0.01) SUN than heifers grazing E+ and EN, which did not differ (P = 0.89). Forage disappearance (DM basis) did not differ (P = 0.75) among treatments and was 4.7, 4.7, and 5.0 kg/animal daily (SEM 0.27) for E+, E-, and EN, respectively. Body weight gain per hectare was greater (P = 0.04) for E+ (257 kg) than for E- (220 kg) or EN (228 kg). In most years, animal grazing days on E+ were greater than those on E- or EN. However, in yr 5, animal grazing days did not differ (P > 0.20) among treatments. The use of stockpiled E+ as a source of low-cost winter feed is a viable option for producers, whereas grazing of EN may be more beneficial during the spring and fall, when more severe negative effects of ergot alkaloids have been observed. 3aendophytes 3aheifers 3aergot alkaloids 3aFestuca arundinacea 3ablood chemistry 3apastures 3agrazing 3abotanical composition 3abeef cattle 3aprolactin 3asteers 3aforage grasses 3amycotoxins 3acrude protein 3agrazing management 3aliveweight gain 3aseasonal variation 3aurea nitrogen 2aAnimal Feedxanalysisxmicrobiology. 2aAnimals 2aBlood Urea Nitrogen 2aBody Constitutionxphysiology 2aCattlexgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aDietxveterinary 2aEatingxphysiology 2aFemale 2aFestucaxmicrobiology 2aFood Microbiology 2aMale 2aNeotyphodiumxphysiology 2aProlactinxblood 2aRandom Allocation 2aSeasons 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 2aWeight Gainxphysiology 0atemporal variation 0astrip-grazing 0aintensive grazing1 aOliphant, E.J.1 aMarshall, B.T.1 aPoore, M.H.1 aGreen, J.T.1 aHockett, M.E.0 tJournal of animal science.g2009 Mar., v. 87, no. 3 p.1034-1041dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2008-09773Available from publisher's Web site  a20090520b20090608c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/04/24  aOther US 7aarticle04172naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002200193245015200215300001600367520196600383650002402349650001202373650001102385650004702396650003102443650002402474650002202498650002802520650003102548650004702579650000902626650002402635650001902659650004702678650004402725650006102769650004602830650006602876650004202942650001402984650002902998653002803027653002703055653003303082700002103115700002503136700001903161700002003180700002403200700001803224700002503242773013403267852000903401856009203410930003303502946001103535655001203546IND4421668220221119220709.0090612e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442166822DNAL7 a196597792pmid7 aPMC27106012pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.03923.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguilar León, D.10aMycobacterium bovis with different genotypes and from different hosts induce dissimilar immunopathological lesions in a mouse model of tuberculosis  ap. 139-147.  aWith the hypothesis that genetic variability of Mycobacterium bovis could influence virulence and immunopathology, five M. bovis strains were selected from an epidemiological study in Argentina on the basis of their prevalence in cattle and occurrence in other species. We then determined the virulence and the immunopathology evoked by these strains in a well-characterized mouse model of progressive pulmonary tuberculosis. The reference strain AN5 was used as a control. BALB/c mice infected with this M. bovis reference strain showed 50% survival after 4 months of infection, with moderate bacillary counts in the lung. Two weeks after inoculation, it induced a strong inflammatory response with numerous granulomas and progressive pneumonia. In contrast, strain 04-303, isolated from a wild boar, was the most lethal and its most striking feature was sudden pneumonia with extensive necrosis. Strain 04-302, also isolated from wild boar but with a different spoligotype, induced similar pathology but to a lesser extent. In contrast, strains 534, V2 (both from cattle) and 02-2B (from human) were less virulent, permitting higher survival after 4 months of infection and limited tissue damage. Strain AN5 and the cattle and human isolates induced rapid, high and stable expression of interferon (IFN)-γ and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). In contrast, the more virulent strains induced lower expression of IFN-γ, tumour necrosis factor-α and iNOS. Interestingly, these more virulent strains induced very low expression of murine beta defensin 4 (mBD-4); whereas, the control strain AN5 induced progressive expression of this anti-microbial peptide, peaking at day 120. The less virulent strains induced high mBD-4 expression during early infection. Thus, as reported with clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis, M. bovis also showed variable virulence. This variability can be attributed to the induction of a different pattern of immune response. 3aMycobacterium bovis 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aColony-Forming Units Assay 2aDisease Progression 2aGenetic Variation 2aGranulomaxmicrobiology 2aInterferon-gammaxgenetics 2aLungximmunologyxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aModels, Animal 2aMycobacterium bovisxgeneticsximmunology. 2aNitric Oxide Synthase Type IIxgenetics 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSwine Diseasesximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aTuberculosis, Pulmonaryximmunologyxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxgenetics 2aVirulence 2abeta-Defensinsxgenetics 0amycobacterial virulence 0apulmonary tuberculosis 0atuberculosis immunopathology1 aZumárraga, M.J.1 aJiménez Oropeza, R.1 aGioffré, A.K.1 aBernardelli, A.1 aOrozco Estévez, H.1 aCataldi, A.A.1 aHernández Pando, R.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2009 July, v. 157, no. 1 p.139-147dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.03923.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090612b20090703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02910naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245011800174300001600292520142200308650002601730650002301756650001801779650001401797650002001811650002601831650001501857650001501872650001601887650002201903650001301925650002701938650001001965650001601975650001801991653001402009653002902023653001502052653001402067653003302081700001902114700002002133773011802153852000902271856009202280930003302372946001102405655001202416IND4425782520221119220735.0090911e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442578252DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2311.2009.01105.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYOUNGINGER, BRETT10aInteractive effects of mycorrhizal fungi, salt stress, and competition on the herbivores of Baccharis halimifolia  ap. 580-587.  a1. Plant stress and association with mycorrhizal fungi have been shown to significantly influence plant quality, yet their roles in influencing plant-insect interactions remain unclear. Even less is known about how these factors might interact with or be modified by within-trophic level interactions. 2. In the present study, the results of a factorial field experiment are reported in which the effects of within-trophic-level interactions, plant stress, and mycorrhizae on three herbivores of Baccharis halimifolia were examined. 3. Plant stress was increased by adding salt to the soil, and availability of mycorrhizal fungi was increased by inoculating plant roots. These treatments were applied to plants with either low or high densities of a competitor (Trirhabda baccharidis). 4. For the two leaf miners, Amauromyza maculosa and Liriomyza trifolii, increased soil salinity and high densities of the competitor Trirhabdabaccharidis resulted in significant decreases in density. Neither of these treatments affected the gall maker Neolasioptera lathami. 5. Mycorrhizal fungi increased the densities of all three herbivores, possibly by increasing foliar nitrogen levels. For the two leaf miners, there was also evidence that mycorrhizae ameliorated the negative effects of salt stress. There was also evidence that high levels of competition dampened the positive effects of mycorrhizae on the two leaf miners. 3aBaccharis halimifolia 3aLiriomyza trifolii 3aNeolasioptera 3aTrirhabda 3aadverse effects 3afield experimentation 3aherbivores 3aleafminers 3amycorrhizae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anitrogen 3aplant-insect relations 3aroots 3asalt stress 3asoil salinity 0aBottom-up 0aexploitative competition 0agall maker 0aleafminer 0awithin-trophic-level effects1 aBARNOUTI, JWAN1 aMOON, DANIEL C.0 tEcological entomology.g2009 Oct., v. 34, no. 5 p.580-587dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2009.01105.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02511naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245013200170300001600302520118600318650001101504650001601515650000901531650002201540650002001562650001901582650002001601650001901621650002801640650001101668650001801679650001101697653002901708653002201737653001901759700001501778700001701793773012201810852000901932856009201941930003302033946001102066655001202077IND4424217320221119220732.0090807e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442421732DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2494.2009.00688.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRustas, B.-O.10aEffect of stage of maturity of whole-crop barley on intake and liveweight gain by dairy steers differing in initial live weight  ap. 227-235.  aThe effect of maturity at harvest of whole-crop barley for ensiling on intake and liveweight gain of dairy steers differing in initial live weight (LW) was evaluated in an experiment over two years. Light (104-120 kg) and heavy (402-419 kg) dairy steers were fed diets containing predominantly whole-crop barley silage harvested at the milk stage [dry matter (DM) content of 284 g kg⁻¹ and neutral-detergent fibre (NDF) concentration of 526 g kg⁻¹ DM] or the dough stage of maturity (DM content of 328 g kg⁻¹ and NDF concentration of 445 g kg⁻¹ DM) and supplemented with up to 1 kg of concentrate. Dry matter intake (g kg⁻¹ LW) was higher for whole-crop barley harvested at the dough stage than at the milk stage of maturity and the difference was greater in heavy than in light steers (P < 0·001). Liveweight gain was higher and feed conversion ratio was lower for dough-stage compared with milk-stage silage (P < 0·05) but there was no interaction with size of steer. Whole-crop barley harvested at the dough stage of maturity promoted higher liveweight gains in dairy steers compared with whole-crop barley harvested at the milk stage due to a higher DM intake. 3abarley 3abody weight 3adiet 3adry matter intake 3afeed conversion 3afilling period 3aliveweight gain 3amaturity stage 3aneutral detergent fiber 3asilage 3asilage making 3asteers 0awhole-crop cereal silage 0astage of maturity 0agrowing cattle1 aNadeau, E.1 aJohnsson, S.0 tGrass and forage science.g2009 Sept., v. 64, no. 3 p.227-235dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0142-52427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2494.2009.00688.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090808b20091002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03278naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003200132040001800164100001300182245009900195300001800294506007600312520118300388506003701571650002901608650001701637650001301654650001201667650003501679650002901714650002401743650002001767650003301787650003201820650003101852650004001883650003701923650002901960650002301989650001302012650004602025650002502071650004402096650003102140650003002171650004102201650005002242650003902292653001102331653001302342700001702355773014202372852000902514856008202523930003302605945001302638946001302651655001202664IND2328170920221207081500.0020723e20020416dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232817092DNAL7 a119599962pmid7 aPMC1227832pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.0826826992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, W.12aA Los1p-independent pathway for nuclear export of intronless tRNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 5412-5417.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLos1p, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae exportin-t homologue, binds tRNA and functions in pre-tRNA splicing and export of mature tRNA from the nucleus to the cytosol. Because LOS1 is unessential in yeast, other pathways for tRNA nuclear export must exist. We report that Cca1p, which adds nucleotides C, C, and A to the 3' end of tRNAs, is a multicopy suppressor of the defect in tRNA nuclear export caused by los1 null mutations. Mes1p, methionyl-tRNA synthetase, also suppresses the defect in nuclear export of tRNA(Met) in los1 cells. Thus, Cca1p and Mes1p seem to function in a Los1p-independent tRNA nuclear export pathway. Heterokaryon analysis indicates that Cca1p is a nucleus/cytosol-shuttling protein, providing the potential for Cca1p to function as an exporter or an adapter in this tRNA nuclear export pathway. In yeast, most mutations that affect tRNA nuclear export also cause defects in pre-tRNA splicing leading to tight coupling of the splicing and export processes. In contrast, we show that overexpressed Cca1p corrects the nuclear export, but not the pre-tRNA-splicing defects of los1::Kan(r) cells, thereby uncoupling pre-tRNA splicing and tRNA nuclear export.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3atransfer RNA 3aproteins 3amutants 2aActive Transport, Cell Nucleus 2aCell Nucleusxmetabolism 2aCytosolxmetabolism 2aDNAxmetabolism 2aEscherichia colixmetabolism 2aFungal Proteinsxmetabolism 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteins 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence 2aLuminescent Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aModels, Biological 2aMutation 2aNuclear Pore Complex Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPlasmidsxmetabolism 2aRNA Nucleotidyltransferasesxmetabolism 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aRNA, Transferxmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSchizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins 0anuclei 0atransfer1 aHopper, A.K.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2002 Apr. 16, v. 99, no. 8 p.5412-5417x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0826826993Available from publisher's Web site  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03124naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162100001600179245012800195300001400323520115400337650001601491650001701507650002001524650001401544650002501558650002101583650001301604650000901617650002101626650003201647650000801679650002301687650002301710650001001733650003401743650002401777650002201801650001101823650004501834650002801879650000901907650004401916650002801960650002101988650003002009650001602039650003802055653003002093700001502123700001402138700001502152700001702167773009402184852000902278856008302287930003302370945002502403946001102428990002302439655001202462IND4416492920221119220901.0090219e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441649292DNAL7 a178821412pmid7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16028992doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Subjects: Fourteen healthy, regularly exercising men aged 22-33 years with a baseline zinc intake between 11.9 and 23.2 mg day-1 prior to the study. Results: Supplementation of ZMA significantly increased serum zinc (P=0.031) and urinary zinc excretion (P=0.035). Urinary pH (P=0.011) and urine flow (P=0.045) were also elevated in the subjects using ZMA. No significant changes in serum total and serum free testosterone were observed in response to ZMA use. Also, the urinary excretion pattern of testosterone metabolites was not significantly altered in ZMA users. Conclusions: The present data suggest that the use of ZMA has no significant effects regarding serum testosterone levels and the metabolism of testosterone in subjects who consume a zinc-sufficient diet. 3ablood serum 3atestosterone 3ablood chemistry 3aurination 3anutrition physiology 3asteroid hormones 3amegadose 3azinc 3adietary minerals 3adietary mineral supplements 3amen 3amineral metabolism 3ahormone metabolism 2aAdult 2aAndrogensxbloodxmetabolism. 2aDietary Supplements 2aDrug Combinations 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentrationxdrug effects 2aMagnesiumxpharmacology 2aMale 2aTestosteronexbloodxmetabolismxurine. 2aUrinationxdrug effects 2aUrinexchemistry 2aVitamin B 6xpharmacology 2aYoung Adult 2aZincxbloodxpharmacologyxurine. 0ahigh-dose zinc supplement1 aParr, M.K.1 aGeyer, H.1 aMester, J.1 aSchanzer, W.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2009 Jan., v. 63, no. 1 p.65-70x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16028993Available from publisher's Web site  a20090408b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/03/18  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02432naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003200132040001800164100002500182245009400207300001800301500001500319506007600334520061000410506003701020650001901057650001201076650002001088650001301108650001001121650002701131650002401158650002401182650002701206650001201233650003301245650001901278650004101297650002501338650001001363650001201373650003501385650002101420650002801441650003201469653002401501700001501525700002201540773014201562852000901704856008201713930003301795945001301828946001301841655001201854IND2328170320221207090904.0020723e20020416dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232817032DNAL7 a119599642pmid7 aPMC1227382pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.0726588992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLakshminarayanan, R.10aInvestigation of the role of ansocalcin in the biomineralization in goose eggshell matrix  ap. 5155-5159.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe role of proteins in biomineralization and the mechanism of eggshell formation are not well understood. We have isolated and purified the major protein, ansocalcin from goose eggshell matrix. The amino acid sequence study indicates that ansocalcin is homologous to the chicken eggshell protein, ovocleidin 17, and C-type lectins. Ansocalcin nucleates polycrystalline aggregates of calcite crystals in in vitro mineralization experiments. The polycrystalline aggregates obtained at higher concentration of ansocalcin appears to be similar to the crystals observed at the mamillary layer of the eggshell.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amineralization 3acalcite 3aanimal proteins 3acrystals 3ageese 3aamino acid composition 3aegg shell formation 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAmino Acidsxchemistry 2aAnimals 2aCalcium Carbonatexchemistry 2aChromatography 2aEgg Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aEgg Shellxchemistry 2aGeese 2aLectins 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aModels, Chemical 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 0aprotein composition1 aKini, R.M.1 aValiyaveettil, S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2002 Apr. 16, v. 99, no. 8 p.5155-5159x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0726588993Available from publisher's Web site  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02011naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245013800142300001600280520062500296650001600921650001300937650002700950650001300977650000900990650001400999650002501013650002201038650002401060650002701084650004101111650002701152650001201179650002801191650001401219650002501233650001001258653001201268653002201280653002701302700001501329700001401344773009101358852000901449930003301458945001301491946001301504655001201517IND2040406420221119221250.0940621e199312  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204040642DNAL7 a81205322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDessi, A.10aEPR investigation of the oxovanadium (IV) complexes formed by the tripeptide glutathione and some related ligands in aqueous solution  ap. 275-286.  aComplex formation between oxovanadium(IV) and glutathione (gamma-L-glutamyl-L-cysteinylglycine, GSH) was investigated in aqueous solution by EPR and electron absorption spectroscopy to identify the complexed species that were reported to form upon reduction of exogenous vanadium(V) in cellular systems.

Given the importance of defining reliable nutrient reference values, there is a need for an explicit, objective, and transparent process to set these values. The Tufts Medical Center Evidence-based Practice Center assembled a group of nutrition experts from academic institutions and federal government agencies, led participants in discussions, conducted exercises in formulating questions and evidence review criteria that would be amenable to systematic reviews of the scientific literature, performed a literature search on the questions to identify potentially relevant publications, and identified challenges and limitations of applying this method to support the development of nutrient reference values using vitamin A as an example. The workgroup concluded that the systematic review approach could be productively used to inform the development of reference values. Challenges identified in this exercise include prioritizing and defining research questions when the volume of literature is large, relying on intermediate (surrogate) outcomes when few or no studies directly linking nutrient intake with clinical outcomes are available, and determining reliable nutrient biomarkers. Ultimately, an objective, unbiased systematic review of a defined question could be useful, not only in helping to set nutrient reference values, but also for increasing the transparency of the decision making process.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3anutrient intake 3apublic health 3adecision making 3abiomarkers 3avitamin A 3aDietary Reference Intakes 3anutrition research 2aHumans 2aNutrition Policy 2aReview Literature as Topic 2aVitamin Axadministration & dosage 0aliterature reviews 0ahuman nutrition1 aChung, Mei1 aBalk, Ethan M.1 aAtkinson, Stephanie1 aGiovannucci, Edward L.1 aIp, Stanley1 aLichtenstein, Alice H.1 aMayne, Susan Taylor1 aRaman, Gowri1 aRoss, A.

Current records show little long term dietary change in the general population. This review examined evidence for long term successful dietary changes in the daily intake of fat, fruit, vegetables and fibre. Eight randomized control trials with 17 intervention arms were included. There were 62,565 participants (89% women) randomized to intervention or active control group. Participants in most of the intervention groups were able to make changes in the daily intake of fat (reduction range: 1.6-13.7%) fruit and vegetables (increase range: 0.2-4.6 svgs/day) and fibre (increase range: 0.9-13.5g/day) as measured at 12 months. The magnitude of these changes diminished thereafter with each consecutive year following intervention with the exception of Polyp Prevention Trial where the changes were maintained for 4 years of trial duration. A well designed intervention motivated participants to make and maintain successful dietary changes in terms of reduction of daily fat intake and increased intake of fruit, vegetables and fibre over the course of 12 months. The differences in dietary intake as compared with baseline diminished steadily with each subsequent year of intervention unless the intervention programme remained highly intensive. 3anutrient intake 3afood intake 3adietary fiber 3ahumans 3aoptimal nutrition 3anutritional intervention 3anutritional adequacy 3afood choices 3abehavior change 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aDiet 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosage 2aFemale 2aFruit 2aHealth Behavior 2aHealth Promotion 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPatient Compliancexstatistics & numerical data 2aRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic 2aTime Factors 0adiet 0aeating habits 0aliterature reviews0 tAppetite.g2010 June, v. 54, no. 3 p.433-441dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2010.01.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20100907b20101001c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/07/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02449naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245010400168300001600272520106200288650003001350650002501380650001801405650001901423650002301442650001101465650001401476650001001490650002101500650001401521650001401535650003001549650002001579650002201599653002301621653001301644653002501657653001601682700001501698700001801713773011001731852000901841856008501850930003301935946001101968655001201979IND4429312120221119221022.0091127e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442931212DNAL7 a10.1007/s10535-009-0116-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnbazhagan, V.

GUS-histochemical analysis revealed that, 50 µM acetosyringone treatments during Agrobacterium infection and 3 d co-cultivation with Agrobacterium showed enhanced transformation efficiency. Percentage of GUS positive callus increased rapidly as the subculture time proceeded on selection medium containing 100 mg dm⁻³ kanamycin. Kanamycin resistant somatic embryos were formed from embryogenic callus after cultivation with 11.35 µM abscisic acid (ABA) for 3 weeks and then on hormone-free selection medium. Somatic embryos were germinated and converted into plantlets on medium containing 2.89 µM gibberellic acid (GA₃). The integration of GUS and NPT II gene into transgenic plants was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and Southern analysis. 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aPodophyllum peltatum 3aabscisic acid 3aacetosyringone 3abeta-glucuronidase 3acallus 3acoculture 3agenes 3agibberellic acid 3akanamycin 3aplantlets 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asomatic embryos 3atransgenic plants 0aembryogenic callus 0aGUS gene 0akanamycin resistance 0aNPT II gene1 aKim, Y.

Difference spectrophotometry substantiates the involvement of tyrosyl residues in iron binding, and confirms the specific binding of two equivalents of iron per molecule. The far-UV CD spectrum also indicates a secondary structure with marked similarity to those of vertebrate transferring. EPR studies show a dependence of iron binding on (bi)carbonate, consistent with the absolute requirement of transferring for a synergistic anion in binding iron. Continuous wave (CW) and pulsed EPR studies of the cupric complex of the protein implicate a histidyl nitrogen ligand in metal coordination, as in human transferrin. Additional studies establish that the pH-dependent release of iron is similar to that of human serum transferrin. The present data confirm cockroach transferrin as an authentic member of the transferrin superfamily, thereby suggesting an ancestral relationship of insect to vertebrate transferring. 3aBlaberus discoidalis 3atransferrin 3airon 3apH 3aspectral analysis 3atyrosine 3ahistidine 3abicarbonates 3acopper 3ametal ions 3amammals 2aAnimals 2aCircular Dichroism 2aCockroachesxchemistry 2aElectron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFemale 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aInsect Proteinsxchemistry 2aMetalsxchemistry 2aProtein Binding 2aSpectrophotometryxmethods 2aTransferrinxchemistry 2aVertebratesxmetabolism 0acomparisons 0abinding1 aLaw, J.H.1 aBender, C.J.1 aAisen, P.0 tJournal of inorganic biochemistry.g1996 Dec., v. 64, no. 4 p.247-258x0162-01347nnas  aDNAL  a19970203b19970210c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02818naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245008100145300001600226500001500242520110600257650001801363650002201381650001701403650002601420650001101446650003801457650001201495650001801507650002901525650002401554650003301578650002101611650004101632650004001673650001101713650002801724650001301752650003001765650009401795650002101889650002201910650002601932653001701958653003801975653001502013700001802028700001602046700001702062773009302079852000902172930003302181945001302214946001302227655001202240IND2044411720221119221146.0950202e19941101nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204441172DNAL7 a77988942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarter, S.R.10aPurification and active-site characterization of equine plasma amine oxidase  ap. 127-141.  a2019-12-05  aAn improved purification scheme for an amine oxidase from equine plasma (EPAO), a nonruminant source, is described and the protein's active-site is characterized. EPAO is dimeric and contains one Type-2 Cu(II) ion per monomer. The EPAO Cu(II) site is spectroscopically very similar to the Cu(II) sites in other amine oxidases. Unlike the extensively investigated nonruminant amine oxidase from porcine plasma, EPAO does not display half-of-the-sites reactivity; titrations with p-nitrophenylhydrazine and phenylhydrazine indicate two active cofactors per dimer. This cofactor is determined to be the same as that of other copper-containing amine oxidases, 6-hydroxydopa quinone (topa quinone). Upon anaerobic reduction with substrate at ambient temperature, the EPR spectrum of EPAO exhibits a sharp signal at g approximately equal to 2, attributable to the topa semiquinone. Equine plasma amine oxidase possesses novel in vitro substrate specificity; while other mammalian amine oxidases oxidize norepinephrine only slowly or not at all, EPAO displays significant activity toward this biogenic amine. 3abinding sites 3aspectral analysis 3ablood plasma 3aprimary-amine oxidase 3ahorses 2aAmine Oxidase (Copper-Containing) 2aAnimals 2aBinding Sites 2aChromatography, Affinity 2aChromatography, Gel 2aChromatography, Ion Exchange 2aCopperxanalysis 2aElectron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aHorses 2aIndicators and Reagents 2aKinetics 2aMacromolecular Substances 2aOxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donorsxbloodxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aPhenylhydrazines 2aSpectrophotometry 2aSubstrate Specificity 0apurification 0aamine oxidase (copper-containing) 0asubstrates1 aMcGuirl, M.A.1 aBrown, D.E.1 aDooley, D.M.0 tJournal of inorganic biochemistry.g1994 Nov. 1, v. 56, no. 2 p.127-141x0162-01347nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03996naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162072001700179100001500196245010000211300001600311500001500327520192300342650000802265650001002273650002002283650002902303650001802332650001002350650001002360650001202370650001102382650001902393650001802412650002002430650001902450650001002469650000902479650003102488650004202519650001002561650005102571650004302622650004602665650001102711650001102722650001202733650000902745650001602754650001602770653001502786653002002801653002302821700002002844700001902864700001802883700002402901700002402925700002502949773013702974852000903111856008303120930003303203945002503236946001303261655001203274IND4416590020221119221104.0090220e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441659002DNAL7 a191447342pmid7 a10.3945/ajcn.2008.267082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Lupin kernel flour is high in protein and fiber and low in carbohydrate. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the effects on blood pressure of a diet moderately higher in dietary protein and fiber achieved by substituting lupin kernel flour for wheat flour in bread. DESIGN: Overweight and obese men and women (n = 88) were recruited to a 16-wk parallel-design study. Participants were randomly assigned to replace 15-20% of their usual daily energy intake with white bread (control) or lupin kernel flour-enriched bread (lupin). Measurements, including 24-h ambulatory blood pressure, were taken at baseline and 16 wk. RESULTS: Seventy-four participants (37 per group) completed the intervention. Baseline mean (±SD) systolic/diastolic blood pressures were 122.1 ± 9.6/70.8 ± 7.2 mm Hg (control) and 120.1 ± 9.5/71.2 ± 5.9 mm Hg (lupin). For lupin relative to control, the estimated mean (95% CI) net differences in protein, fiber, and carbohydrate intakes during the intervention were 13.7 g/d (95% CI: 2.3, 25.0 g/d), 12.5 g/d (95% CI: 8.8, 16.2 g/d), and -19.9 g/d (95% CI: -45.2, 5.5 g/d), respectively. Differences in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, and heart rate were -3.0 mm Hg (95% CI: -5.6, -0.3 mm Hg; P = 0.03), 0.6 mm Hg (95% CI: -1.0, 2.2 mm Hg; P = 0.47), -3.5 mm Hg (95% CI: -5.3, -1.8 mm Hg; P < 0.001), and 0.0 beats/min (95% CI: -1.7, 1.7 beats/min; P = 0.99), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing protein and fiber in bread with lupin kernel flour may be a simple dietary approach to help reduce blood pressure and cardiovascular risk.

The role of the alternative (valt) and cytochrome (vcyt) pathways on drought stress-induced suppression of photosynthesis and during photosynthetic recovery was examined in the Nicotiana sylvestris wild type (WT) and the complex I-deficient CMSII mutant. Although photosynthetic traits, including net photosynthesis (AN), stomatal (gs) and mesophyll conductances (gm), as well as respiration (vcyt and valt) differed between well-watered CMSII and WT, similar reductions of AN, gs, and gm were observed during severe drought stress. However, total respiration (Vt) remained slightly higher in CMSII due to the still increased vcyt (to match ATP demand). valt and maximum carboxylation rates remained almost unaltered in both genotypes, while in CMSII, changes in photosynthetic light harvesting (i.e. Chl a/b ratio) were detected. In both genotypes, photosynthesis and respiration were restored after 2 d of rewatering, predominantly limited by a delayed stomatal response. Despite complex I dysfunction and hence altered redox balance, the CMSII mutant seems to be able to adjust its photosynthetic machinery during and after drought stress to reduce photo-oxidation and to maintain the cell redox state and the ATP level.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNicotiana sylvestris 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acarboxylation 3adrought 3agenotype 3aharvesting 3ain vivo studies 3amesophyll 3amutants 3aphotosynthesis 3astomatal movement 3awater stress 2aBlotting, Western 2aCell Respiration 2aCytochromesxmetabolism 2aDroughts 2aElectron Transport Complex Ixdeficiencyxmetabolism. 2aGasesxmetabolism 2aMetabolic Networks and Pathways 2aMitochondriaxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aMitochondrial Proteins 2aMutationxgenetics 2aOxidoreductasesxmetabolism 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiology 2aPigments, Biologicalxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 2aSolubility 2aStress, Physiological 2aTobaccoxenzymologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aWaterxphysiology1 aFlorez-Sarasa, Igor1 aThameur, Afwa1 ade Paepe, Rosine1 aFlexas, Jaume1 aRibas-Carbo, Miquel0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2010 Mar., v. 61, no. 3 p.765-775dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erp3443Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02530naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245013200148300001600280520131700296650003101613650003001644650002301674650004101697650001101738650003401749650003101783650003001814650003501844700001901879700001901898700001601917700001601933700002101949773009401970852000902064930003302073945001302106946001302119655001202132IND2057976220221119221136.0970624e19970215nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205797622DNAL7 a90252692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVassiliev, V.B.10aCopper depletion/repletion of human ceruloplasmin is followed by the changes in its spectral features and functional properties  ap. 167-174.  aCopper ions of different types were gradually eliminated from ceruloplasmin (CP-1; ferro-O2-oxidoreductase, EC 1.16.3.1.) by dialyzing the enzyme against KCN. Protein was sampled 2, 4, 6, 22, and 28 h after the dialysis started. Atomic absorption allowed us to estimate the amount of copper atoms per CP molecule. Light absorption in the UV- and visible regions along with fluorescence and EPR spectra were also registered. Oxidase and dismutase activities of the enzyme were measured at each step. The combination of the data thus obtained allowed us to trace the sequence of CP depletion of certain copper ions. The same methods were applied in reconstitution studies to detect the return of different types of Cu2+. The experiments were performed on CP samples differing in the amount of copper still bound after CN- treatment. It is shown that the oxidase activity is efficiently brought back to CP if after the dialysis against cyanide, the catalytic center had preserved its type 3 Cu2+. Dismutase activity of CP did not depend greatly on the presence or absence of type 1 and type 2 copper ions. The results obtained allow a more precise evaluation of the role of different types Cu2+ in the assembly of the complex catalytic center of CP and in the accomplishment by the enzyme of its multiple functions. 3aphysicochemical properties 2aCeruloplasminxmetabolism 2aCopperxmetabolism 2aElectron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy 2aHumans 2aPotassium Cyanidexmetabolism 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescence 2aSpectrophotometry, Atomic 2aSpectrophotometry, Ultraviolet1 aKachurin, A.M.1 aBeltramini, M.1 aRocco, G.P.1 aSalvato, B.1 aGaitskhoki, V.S.0 tJournal of inorganic biochemistry.g1997 Feb. 15, v. 65, no. 3 p.167-174x0162-01347nnas  aDNAL  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle04113naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162072001700179100001700196245014600213300001600359500001500375520165400390650002502044650001302069650003102082650001402113650002202127650002302149650002102172650001202193650003102205650002702236650001302263650001602276650001902292650001902311650002402330650001502354650001002369650004002379650003002419650003302449650003002482650003802512650006202550650004602612650003802658650001102696650002002707650001102727650001902738650001802757650000902775650001602784650000802800650004502808650002502853650001602878650001602894653000902910653002902919653001502948653001802963700003802981773013703019852000903156856008303165930003303248945002503281946001303306655001203319IND4416590820221119221134.0090220e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441659082DNAL7 a191767332pmid7 a10.3945/ajcn.2008.270432doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of a green tea-caffeine mixture added to a high-protein (HP) diet on weight maintenance (WM) after body weight loss in moderately obese subjects. DESIGN: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel trial was conducted in 80 overweight and moderately obese subjects [age (mean ± SD): 44 ± 2 y; body mass index (BMI; in kg/m²): 29.6 ± 2.0] matched for sex, age, BMI, height, body mass, and with a habitually low caffeine intake. A very-low-energy diet intervention during 4 wk was followed by 3 mo of WM; during the WM period, the subjects received a green tea-caffeine mixture (270 mg epigallocatechin gallate + 150 mg caffeine/d) or placebo, both in addition to an adequate protein (AP) diet (50-60 g protein/d) or an HP diet (100-120 g protein/d). RESULTS: Subjects lost 7.0 ± 1.6 kg, or 8.2 ± 2.0%, body weight (P < 0.001). During the WM phase, WM, resting energy expenditure, and fat-free mass (FFM) increased relatively in both the HP groups and in the AP + green tea-caffeine mixture group (P < 0.05), whereas respiratory quotient and body fat mass decreased, all compared with the AP + placebo group. Satiety increased only in both HP groups (P < 0.05). The green tea-caffeine mixture was only effective with the AP diet. CONCLUSION: The green tea-caffeine mixture, as well as the HP diet, improved WM independently through thermogenesis, fat oxidation, sparing FFM, and, for the HP diet, satiety; a possible synergistic effect failed to appear. 3arespiratory quotient 3acaffeine 3aresting energy expenditure 3agreen tea 3ahigh protein diet 3amiddle-aged adults 3aepigallocatechin 3aobesity 3arandomized clinical trials 3athermic effect of food 3acatechin 3aweight loss 3aweight control 3alean body mass 3adietary supplements 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAppetitexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aBody Compositionxphysiology 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aCaffeinexadministration & dosage 2aCatechinxadministration & dosagexanalogs & derivatives. 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aFemale 2aGlycerolxblood 2aHumans 2aInsulinxblood 2aLeptinxblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aTea 2aThermogenesisxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aTriglyceridesxblood 2aWeight Loss 2aYoung Adult 0adiet 0aepigallocatechin gallate 0aoverweight 0afat free mass1 aWesterterp-Plantenga, Margriet S.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2009 Mar., v. 89, no. 3 p.822-830dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2008.270433Available from publisher's Web site  a20110625b20110701c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/04/16  aOther US 7aarticle02618naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245012700175300001600302520144700318650001801765650001501783650001401798650001101812650000801823650001101831650001101842650001201853650001701865650001001882650001201892650001501904650001101919650001201930650001001942700002301952773018101975856005502156852000902211655001202220IND60620240020221119215500.0181107s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062024002DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1095-8312.2003.00192.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarden, James H.10aRowing locomotion by a stonefly that possesses the ancestral pterygote condition of co-occurring wings and abdominal gills  ap. 341-349.  aA leading hypothesis for the origin of insect wings is that they evolved from thoracic gills that were serial homologues of the abdominal gills present in fossil pterygotes and in the nymphs of some modern mayflies, damselflies and stoneflies. Co-occurrence of thoracic wings and abdominal gills is the primitive condition for fossil pterygote insects, whereas the winged stage of modern insects almost exclusively lacks abdominal gills. Here we examine the locomotor behaviour and gill morphology of a stonefly, Diamphipnopsis samali (Plecoptera), which retains abdominal gills in the winged adult stage. This species can fly, but also uses its forewings as oars to accomplish rowing locomotion along the surface of water. The abdominal gills are in contact with both air and water during rowing, and their elaborately folded surface suggests an ability to contribute to gas-exchange. D. samali nymphs also have behaviours that place them in locations where their gills are exposed to air; they forage at night at the stream margin and within bubble curtains in rapids. These traits may exemplify an early pterygote condition in which gill and protowing function overlapped in an amphibious setting during a transition from aquatic to aerial locomotion and gas exchange. Rowing locomotion provides a novel and mechanically intermediate stage for the wings-from-gills and surface-skimming hypotheses for the origin of insect wings and flight. 3aEphemeroptera 3aPlecoptera 3aZygoptera 3aadults 3aair 3aflight 3aforage 3afossils 3agas exchange 3agills 3ainsects 3alocomotion 3anymphs 3astreams 3awings1 aThomas, Michael A.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2003 June, v. 79, no. 2 p.341-349dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1095-8312.2003.00192.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03604naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137072001700155072001700172072001700189100001800206245011400224300001600338500001500354520171200369650001402081650001702095650000902112650001802121650002702139650001402166650002202180650001402202650002102216650001702237650002402254650002302278650000902301650001402310650003802324650001202362650002602374650002402400650002702424650000902451650001902460650002602479650001402505650002302519650002202542653002102564653003202585700003002617700002202647700002102669773009602690852000902786856007602795930003302871945002502904946001302929655001202942IND4416472720221119215336.0090218e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441647272DNAL7 a187129492pmid7 a10.1897/08-210.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Apart from a natural silty sediment, six commercial food supplements were examined: an omega-6 PUFA enriched Spirulina-based dry powder, Sera micron; a shrimp-based pellet food; an omega-3 PUFA enriched algal paste, Rotiselco-ALG; an omega-6 PUFA enriched algal dry powder, AlgaMac-ARA (arachidonic acid); flaxseed meal; and an omega-3 PUFA enriched dry powder, Frippak. We have previously established that M. plumulosa cultures perform poorly and eventually decline if provided with silty sediment alone, but will thrive if supplemented with Sera micron. Conversely, if the amphipods are cultured on a nutrient-depleted sand substrate, Sera micron alone does not constitute an adequate feed. The major difference in the fatty acid composition of M. plumulosa cultured on silty sediment compared to amphipods cultured on a sand substrate and both fed Sera micron was an increase in the ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 PUFAs, indicating that the silty sediment provides additional food sources rich in omega-3 PUFAs. Furthermore, amphipods cultured in sand and fed any of the three algal-based foods or the Frippak powder as the sole food source had poor survival rates, although Sera micron maintained the best survival--this was attributed to it containing high amounts of β-carotene and terpenoids. Melita plumulosa fed a mixture of Sera micron in conjunction with the omega-3 PUFA enriched Rotiselco-ALG and cultured on a silty substrate were found to have good fecundity with low variability. 3aSpirulina 3alaboratories 3adiet 3aecotoxicology 3afatty acid composition 3afecundity 3abenthic organisms 3aAmphipoda 3aarachidonic acid 3alinseed meal 3aestuarine sediments 3aaquatic arthropods 3asand 3amortality 2aAmphipodaxchemistryxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aCarotenoidsxanalysis 2aChromatography, Gas 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aDiet 2aEsterification 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aFertility 2aGeologic Sediments 2aMass Spectrometry 0aMelita plumulosa 0apolyunsaturated fatty acids1 aSánchez-Bayo, Francisco.1 aJohnston, Emma L.1 aMann, Reinier M.0 tEnvironmental toxicology and chemistry.g2009 Jan., v. 28, no. 1 p.123-132x0730-72687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1897/08-210.13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100319b20100403c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/03/19  aOther US 7aarticle03530naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137072001700155072001700172072001700189072001700206100002000223245010800243300001600351520167400367650003402041650003502075650002402110650002102134650001002155650002002165650001702185650001702202650001702219650001202236650004202248650003502290650002102325650002102346650002402367650001002391650002102401650003002422650004102452651001002493700001902503700002502522700002102547700001602568700002002584700002702604700002102631773009602652852000902748856007602757930003302833945002502866946001302891655001202904IND4416474520221119215410.0090218e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441647452DNAL7 a187176192pmid7 a10.1897/08-191.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aOrrego, Rodrigo10aPulp and paper mill effluent treatments have differential endocrine-disrupting effects on rainbow trout  ap. 181-188.  aEndocrine disruption (ED) effects due to pulp and paper mill effluents extracts involving different industrial procedures and effluent treatments (nontreated, primary, and secondary treated) were evaluated using immature triploid rainbow trout in a pulse-exposure toxicity experiment. The protocol involved the use of intraperitoneal injection of mill extracts (solid-phase extraction [SPE]) corrected for individual fish weight and included several laboratory standards (steroidal hormones and phytosterols). Biological endpoints at two different levels of biological organization were analyzed (molecular and individual organism). Results indicated that nonsignificant changes were observed in the individual physiological indices represented by condition factor, liver somatic index, and gonad somatic index during the experiment. Significant induction of liver ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity was observed between different effluent treatments and experimental controls. Significant endocrine-disrupting effects at the reproductive level were observed in all effluent treatments involving significant increments in plasma vitellogenin (VTG) levels. Fish exposed to untreated effluent extracts had significantly higher VTG levels compared to fish exposed to primary and secondary treatment effluent extracts, indicating a decrease of the estrogenic effect due to the effluent treatment. The present study has shown that for the Chilean pulp and paper mill SPE extracts evaluated, an endocrine disruption effect was induced in immature triploid rainbow, reaffirming the significant estrogenic effects demonstrated previously in laboratory and field experiments. 3apulp and paper mill effluents 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3atoxicity testing 3aliver 3aenzyme activity 3avitellogenin 3ablood plasma 3alaboratories 2aAnimals 2aCytochrome P-450 CYP1A1xbiosynthesis 2aEndocrine Disruptorsxtoxicity 2aEnzyme Induction 2aIndustrial Waste 2aOncorhynchus mykiss 2aPaper 2aTextile Industry 2aVitellogeninsxmetabolism 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity 3aChile1 aGuchardi, John1 aHernández, Víctor.1 aKrause, Rachelle1 aRoti, Lucia1 aArmour, Jeffrey1 aGaneshakumar, Mathumai1 aHoldway, Douglas0 tEnvironmental toxicology and chemistry.g2009 Jan., v. 28, no. 1 p.181-188x0730-72687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1897/08-191.13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100319b20100403c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/03/19  aOther US 7aarticle03252naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137072001700155072001700172072001700189072001700206100002600223245013000249300001600379500001500395520166700410650002002077650002202097650001802119650002002137650000902157650002002166650001202186650002102198650002102219650001202240650001602252650003002268650001002298650000902308650004902317650002702366653002702393700002102420700001702441773009602458852000902554856007602563930003302639945002502672946001302697655001202710IND4416475620221119215246.0090218e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441647562DNAL7 a187129452pmid7 a10.1897/08-136.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A three-compartment pharmacokinetic model was constructed and revealed metal- and exposure route-dependent accumulation profiles. Under the tested exposure conditions in water (0.1 μM Cd and 1 μM Zn), only 0.1 and 0.07%, respectively, of the total Cd and Zn load that passed the branchial surfaces was accumulated by the carp. In contrast, the carp accumulated 20 and 29% of the total ingested Cd and Zn load (mean concentrations in food of newly accumulated metals were 2.24 ± 0.29 and 19.91 ± 2.89 nmol/g wet weight, respectively). However, the contribution of the waterborne metals to the whole-body metal accumulation was higher than the metal uptake from food. The constructed model was used to simulate the effect of variable assimilation efficiency (AE) values on the relative importance of dietary Cd and Zn exposure to the overall metal accumulation in common carp. This simulation was performed under a realistic exposure scenario and with Cd and Zn AE values ranging from 5 to 95%. Dissolved Zn levels were higher and Cd levels lower compared to the laboratory experiments. Levels in the midge larvae were much higher. The results show that under these conditions, even at the lowest Cd and Zn AEs, almost 40% of the total body Cd and Zn concentrations originated from dietary Cd and Zn exposure. Taking into account the Cd and Zn AE of the laboratory experiments, respectively, 31 and 55%, more than 85% of the total body Cd and Zn was taken up from the food. 3awater pollution 3asimulation models 3aradionuclides 3abioaccumulation 3azinc 3aCyprinus carpio 3acadmium 3adietary exposure 3apharmacokinetics 2aAnimals 2aBody Burden 2aCadmiumxpharmacokinetics 2aCarps 2aDiet 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxpharmacokinetics 2aZincxpharmacokinetics 0aenvironmental exposure1 aBervoets, Lieven1 aBlust, Ronny0 tEnvironmental toxicology and chemistry.g2009 Jan., v. 28, no. 1 p.209-219x0730-72687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1897/08-136.13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100323b20100403c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/03/19  aOther US 7aarticle03841naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100001400147245016500161300001800326500002400344500001500368520182200383650001402205650002302219650001102242650002002253650002302273650001402296650002902310650001502339650002402354650001502378650004302393650001202436650007302448650005202521650005602573650004202629650005302671650004102724650001102765650004202776650004002818650001502858650002202873650001702895653001202912653001402924700001802938700001902956700001502975700001302990773012003003852000903123930003303132945002503165946001303190655001203203IND4393401420221119215410.0070722e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439340142DNAL7 a176389652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT200 0aX3801 aMasco, L.10aIn Vitro Assessment of the Gastrointestinal Transit Tolerance of Taxonomic Reference Strains from Human Origin and Probiotic Product Isolates of Bifidobacterium  ap. 3572-3578.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aNext to health promoting effects, the functional aspect of probiotic strains also involves their capacity to reach the colon as viable metabolically active cells. The present study aimed to assess the potential of 24 probiotic product isolates and 42 human reference strains of Bifidobacterium to survive gastrointestinal transit under in vitro conditions. The survival capacity of exponential and stationary phase cultures upon exposure to gastric and small intestinal juices was determined using a recently developed microplate-based assay in combination with the LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability kit. All 66 strains tested displayed a considerable loss in viability during exposure to an acidic pepsin containing solution (pH 2.0). Among the 10 taxa tested, cultures of B. animalis ssp. lactis appeared to be most capable to survive gastric transit. Although to a lesser extent, the presence of bile salts also affected the viability of most of the strains tested. Except for 3 strains, all 66 strains showed bile salt hydrolase activity using an agar-based assay. In contrast, the bifidobacterial strains used in this study appeared to possess a natural ability to survive the presence of pancreatin (pH 8.0). Although the effect was not significant, a slightly enhanced tolerance to gastrointestinal transit was observed when cells were in the stationary phase, especially when exposed to acid, compared with cells being in the exponential phase. Survival in the gastrointestinal tract appeared to be largely strain-dependent and hence implies that different strains will likely display a different behavior in functionality. The assay used in this study allows an initial assessment of strains for use as probiotic cultures prior to selecting potential candidate strains for further investigation in vivo. 3aviability 3ain vitro digestion 3ahumans 3aBifidobacterium 3astrain differences 3abioassays 3agastrointestinal transit 3aprobiotics 3areference standards 3apancreatin 2aAmidohydrolasesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aBifidobacteriumxdrug effectsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aBile Acids and Saltsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aGastric Juicexchemistryxenzymologyxmicrobiology. 2aGastrointestinal Agentsxpharmacology 2aGastrointestinal Tractxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aGastrointestinal Transitxphysiology 2aHumans 2aPancreatinxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aPepsin Axmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aProbiotics 2aSurvival Analysis 2aTime Factors 0astrains 0aisolation1 aCrockaert, C.1 aVan Hoorde, K.1 aSwings, J.1 aHuys, G.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Aug., v. 90, no. 8 p.3572-3578dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20071108b20071210c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/10/21  aOther US 7aarticle02471naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245012400173300001600297520140600313650002301719650001301742650001601755650002201771650001401793650001201807650001301819700002201832700001701854700002901871773018101900856005502081852000902136655001202145IND60620239120221119215157.0181107s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062023912DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1095-8312.2003.00198.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClaude, Julien12aA geometric morphometric assessment of the effects of environment and cladogenesis on the evolution of the turtle shell  ap. 485-501.  aIn the largest group of extant turtles, the Testudinoidea, the acquisition of an aquatic or terrestrial way of life has occurred within two clades, allowing the study of homoplasy linked to environment (commonly named convergence). Here we appraise the respective importance of two sources of morphological variation: a major cladogenetic event and a major environmental shift (aquatic vs. terrestrial). The repeatability of the same evolutionary process (environmental change) allows an assessment of the weights of both natural selection and phylogenetic constraints on several morphological features of the shell. These sources of morphological variance on the complex shell structure were studied using geometric morphometrics. We depict the morphological variation of three parts of the turtle shell: epidermal carapace, bony carapace, and plastron. In the three structures, we found that both phylogeny and environment were significant sources of morphological variation, and geometric morphometrics allowed the pattern of morphological variation due to each effect to be assessed. The assessment of the homoplasy due to environment and of the pattern of morphological variability suggests that the carapace has undergone similar morphological changes between aquatic and terrestrial environments within the two clades. The radiation of the Testudinoidea is interpreted as an adaptive radiation. 3aadaptive radiation 3ageometry 3amorphometry 3anatural selection 3aphylogeny 3aturtles 3avariance1 aParadis, Emmanuel1 aTong, Haiyan1 aAuffray, Jean-Christophe0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2003 July, v. 79, no. 3 p.485-501dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1095-8312.2003.00198.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03417naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003200132040001800164100001500182245010400197300001800301500001500319506007600334520118900410506003701599650001801636650002201654650002501676650002001701650001501721650002501736650002001761650001201781650001801793650002201811650002301833650002301856650003501879650003301914650001801947650001101965650001201976650002901988650002002017650002802037650002902065650002002094650002002114650004102134650003502175650001602210650001702226653001402243653003502257653002802292653001002320653002502330653001402355700001702369700001702386773014202403852000902545856008202554930003302636945001302669946001302682655001202695IND2327097420221207094644.0020517e20020219dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232709742DNAL7 a118421942pmid7 aPMC1223832pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.0424484992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhtani, K.10aSensitivity to Alternaria alternata toxin in citrus because of altered mitochondrial RNA processing  ap. 2439-2444.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSpecificity in the interaction between rough lemon (Citrus jambhiri Lush.) and the fungal pathogen Alternaria alternata rough lemon pathotype is determined by a host-selective toxin, ACR-toxin. Mitochondria from rough lemon are sensitive to ACR-toxin whereas mitochondria from resistant plants, including other citrus species, are resistant. We have identified a C. jambhiri mitochondrial DNA sequence, designated ACRS (ACR-toxin sensitivity gene), that confers toxin sensitivity to Escherichia coli. ACRS is located in the group II intron of the mitochondrial tRNA-Ala and is translated into a SDS-resistant oligomeric protein in C. jambhiri mitochondria but is not translated in the toxin-insensitive mitochondria. ACRS is present in the mitochondrial genome of both toxin-sensitive and -insensitive citrus. However, in mitochondria of toxin-insensitive plants, the transcripts from ACRS are shorter than those in mitochondria of sensitive plants. These results demonstrate that sensitivity to ACR-toxin and hence specificity of the interaction between A. alternata rough lemon pathotype and C. jambhiri is due to differential posttranscriptional processing of a mitochondrial gene.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aphytotoxicity 3amitochondrial DNA 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3amycotoxins 3aAlternaria alternata 3aCitrus jambhiri 3aintrons 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Western 2aCitrusxmetabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxmetabolism 2aEscherichia colixmetabolism 2aGene Deletion 2aGenome 2aIntrons 2aMitochondriaxmetabolism 2aModels, Genetic 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMycotoxinsxpharmacology 2aProtein Binding 2aRNAxmetabolism 2aRNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional 2aRNA, Transfer, Alaxmetabolism 2aSphingosine 2aTime Factors 0aacr-toxin 0aposttranscriptional processing 0amolecular sequence data 0agenes 0anucleotide sequences 0aacrs gene1 aYamamoto, H.1 aAkimitsu, K.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2002 Feb. 19, v. 99, no. 4 p.2439-2444x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0424484993Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02279naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100002700154245009000181300001600271500002400287500001500311520099600326650001501322650002701337650002401364650002301388650002101411650001301432650002701445651001101472653003001483653002101513700002301534700003201557773010501589852000901694856008501703930003301788945002501821946001101846655001201857IND4393317320221119215413.0070722e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439331732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-006-9054-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM3101 aBortolini, José Luis 10aOn the presence of the Australian redclaw crayfish, Cherax quadricarinatus, in Mexico  ap. 615-620.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe first reports of wild caught Australian redclaw crayfish from Mexico, in the states of Morelos and Tamaulipas, are presented. Redclaw crayfish were first brought to Mexico in 1995 to initiate experimental cultures at several research centers. In the following years a number of private ventures started commercial cultures, several of which in the states of Morelos and Tamaulipas are thought to have been the sources for the wild populations recorded in this study. The farms that acted as the original sources have not been operating for at least 2 years. In Morelos, high densities and all size classes of redclaws, including ovigerous females, were captured in natural waterways; whereas in Tamaulipas they were found at four sites occurring in irrigation canals in an agricultural district. The size attained by the wild redclaws, the abiotic conditions in which they were found and the potential for spread within the drainage systems of the Balsas and Tamesi Rivers are discussed. 3afreshwater 3aCherax quadricarinatus 3aecological invasion 3aintroduced species 3acrayfish culture 3acrayfish 3anew geographic records 3aMexico 0ageographical distribution 0awild populations1 aAlvarez, Fernando 1 aRodríguez-Almaraz, Gabino 0 tBiological invasions.g2007 July, v. 9, no. 5 p.615-620dKluwer Academic Publishersx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-006-9054-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20070904b20071002c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/09/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02648naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100002500181245005000206300001600256500002400272520129200296650002301588650001401611650002101625650001901646650001601665650002301681650002501704651001101729653001801740653002201758653001901780700002701799700002301826700002901849700002001878773010501898852000902003856008502012930003302097945002502130946001102155655001202166IND4393317120221119215154.0070722e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439331712DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-006-9045-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL300 0aL001 0aP0001 aMessing, Russell H. 10aInvasive aphids attack native Hawaiian plants  ap. 601-607.  aIncludes references  aInvasive species have had devastating impacts on the fauna and flora of the Hawaiian Islands. While the negative effects of some invasive species are obvious, other species are less visible, though no less important. Aphids (Homoptera: Aphididae) are not native to Hawai'i but have thoroughly invaded the Island chain, largely as a result of anthropogenic influences. As aphids cause both direct plant feeding damage and transmit numerous pathogenic viruses, it is important to document aphid distributions and ranges throughout the archipelago. On the basis of an extensive survey of aphid diversity on the five largest Hawaiian Islands (Hawai'i, Kaua'i, O'ahu, Maui, and Moloka'i), we provide the first evidence that invasive aphids feed not just on agricultural crops, but also on native Hawaiian plants. To date, aphids have been observed feeding and reproducing on 64 native Hawaiian plants (16 indigenous species and 48 endemic species) in 32 families. As the majority of these plants are endangered, invasive aphids may have profound impacts on the island flora. To help protect unique island ecosystems, we propose that border vigilance be enhanced to prevent the incursion of new aphids, and that biological control efforts be renewed to mitigate the impact of existing species. 3aindigenous species 3aAphididae 3ainvasive species 3ainsect surveys 3ahost plants 3aendangered species 3aenvironmental impact 3aHawaii 0anative plants 0aindigenous plants 0aendemic plants1 aTremblay, Michelle N. 1 aMondor, Edward B. 1 aFoottit, R.q(Robert G.)1 aPike, Keith S. 0 tBiological invasions.g2007 July, v. 9, no. 5 p.601-607dKluwer Academic Publishersx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-006-9045-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20070904b20071002c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/09/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03361naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100001700190245015400207300001600361500002400377500001500401520171300416650003002129650001202159650001802171650001002189650003302199650002102232650001302253650002602266650002102292650001902313650002602332650001102358651001302369651001002382651001402392651001402406651001502420653002702435653001302462653002502475700001502500773010502515852000902620856008502629930003302714945002502747946001102772655001202783IND4393316720221119215215.0070722e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439331672DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-006-9058-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF900 0aM001 0aF700 0aF200 0aF4001 aMoody, M.

A comprehensive survey of watermilfoil populations was conducted in five Minnesota lakes, three of which were suspected a priori to contain hybrid watermilfoil. DNA sequence data verified that hybrid plants between the nonindigenous M. spicatum L. and indigenous M. sibiricum Kom. occurred in three of the five lakes sampled. Myriophyllum spicatum was not detected in lakes where hybrids were prevalent. Further sampling of lakes in Idaho, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Washington identified 30 additional hybrid watermilfoil populations. In only three of these populations the hybrid watermilfoil was found to co-occur with M. spicatum. To facilitate the field identification of the two parental species and their hybrid, morphological data from watermilfoil specimens collected across the United States were evaluated. We determined that leaf segment/leaf length measurements can effectively distinguish M. spicatum and M. sibiricum; however, hybrids are intermediate for these characters and such measurements frequently overlap with respect to their parental taxa. By incorporating a combined molecular and morphological approach to identifying watermilfoils, the hybrids can be identified readily and their distributions elucidated both within and between lakes. Because hybrids may respond differently to local ecological conditions than their parents, information on their presence and distribution should be of particular importance to management and conservation programs. 3ageographical distribution 3ahybrids 3aaquatic weeds 3alakes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aplant morphology 3agenotype 3amolecular systematics 3ainvasive species 3aplant taxonomy 3aMyriophyllum spicatum 3aleaves 3aMichigan 3aIdaho 3aMinnesota 3aWisconsin 0aWashington 0aMyriophyllum sibiricum 0ataxonomy 0anucleotide sequences1 aLes, D.

Strain 2-79 produces the antibiotic phenazine-1-carboxylate, which is active in vitro against G. graminis var. tritici and other fungal root pathogens. Mutants defective in phenazine synthesis (Phz-) were generated by Tn5 insertion and then compared with the parental strain to determine the importance of the antibiotic in take-all suppression on wheat roots. Six independent, prototrophic Phz- mutants were noninhibitory to G. graminis var. tritici in vitro and provided significantly less control of take-all than strain 2-79 on wheat s eedlings. Antibiotic synthesis, fungal inhibition in vitro, and suppression of take-all on wheat were coordinately restored in two mutants complemented with cloned DNA from a 2-79 genomic library. These mutants contained Tn5 insertions in adjacent EcoRI fragments in the 2-79 genome, and the restriction maps of the region flanking the insertions and the complementary DNA were colinear. These results indicate that sequences required for phenazine production were present in the cloned DNA and support the importance of the phenazine antibiotic in disease suppression in the rhizosphere. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aGaeumannomyces graminis var. graminis 3abiological control agents 3adisease control 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aantibiotics 2aAntifungal Agentsxbiosynthesisxpharmacology. 2aAscomycotaxdrug effects 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aMutation 2aNucleic Acid Hybridization 2aPhenazinesxbiosynthesisxpharmacology. 2aPlant Diseases 2aPseudomonas fluorescensxgenetics1 aWeller, D.M.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1988 Aug., v. 170, no. 8 p.3499-3508x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02407naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100002200163245012500185300001400310500002400324520108800348650002001436650001201456650001901468650002701487650001801514650002201532650002001554650001101574650002501585650002201610653001101632700002601643700002001669773012101689852000901810856008501819930003301904945002501937946001101962655001201973IND4393263420221119215212.0070722e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439326342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-007-9258-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF6001 aBellucci, Michele10aZeolin is a recombinant storage protein that can be used to produce value-added proteins in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)  ap. 85-91.  aIncludes references  aThe specific features of plants make them particularly suitable for the production of recombinant proteins and alfalfa is one of the recommended plant production systems. We have transformed alfalfa with a gene coding for a chimaeric protein made previously by fusing phaseolin to the N-terminal region of γ-zein and have analyzed the accumulation of this fusion protein, named zeolin. Zeolin was expressed both in T0 Regen SY alfalfa plants and in the progeny resulting from the sexual cross between Regen SY transformants and alfalfa cv. Adriana plants. In some alfalfa plants a 95 kDa zeolin glycosylated polypeptide is the most abundant polypeptide detected by Western-blot analysis, whereas in tobacco the most abundant zeolin polypeptide has a molecular mass around 60 kDa, expected for intact zeolin. Zeolin has been stably accumulated in alfalfa leaves because it forms endoplasmic reticulum-located protein bodies in the cell. As regards zeolin quantisation, in the progeny alfalfa plants a value of about 0.22-0.28 mg of zeolin / g of fresh leaf weight has been estimated. 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3aplant breeding 3agenetic transformation 3agene transfer 3atransgenic plants 3agene expression 3aleaves 3arecombinant proteins 3aprotein synthesis 0azeolin1 aDe Marchis, Francesca1 aArcioni, Sergio0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2007 July, v. 90, no. 1 p.85-91dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-007-9258-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20071020b20071102c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/10/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02592naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245006800165300001800233300002300251500001500274520127000289650002301559650001501582650001201597650002101609650002301630650002701653650002501680650001801705650003001723650002101753650002401774650001301798650005901811650002701870650002601897653002701923700001601950700001701966773008401983852000902067939003302076946001302109655001202122IND8803781520221119215340.0880908e198808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880378152DNAL7 a28412842pmid7 aPMC2113072pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFinan, T.M.10aMutants of Rhizobium meliloti defective in succinate metabolism  ap. 3396-3403.  ap. 3396-3403. ill.  a2019-12-05  aWe characterized mutants of Rhizobium meliloti SU47 that were unable to grow on succinate as the carbon source. The mutants fell into five groups based on complementation of the succinate mutations by individual recombinant plasmids isolated from a R. meliloti clone bank. Enzyme analysis showed that mutants in the following groups lacked the indicated common enzyme activities: group II, enolase (Eno); group III, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck); group IV, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gap), and 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk). Mutants in groups I and V lacked C4-dicarboxylate transport (Dct-) activity. Wild-type cells grown on succinate as the carbon source had high Pck activity, whereas no Pck activity was detected in cells that were grown on glucose as the carbon source. It was found that in free-living cells, Pck is required for the synthesis of phosphoenolpyruvate during gluconeogenesis. In addition, the enzymes of the lower half of the Embden-Meyerhoff-Parnas pathway were absolutely required for gluconeogenesis. Eno, Gap, Pck, and one of the Dct loci (ntrA) mapped to different regions of the chromosome; the other Dct locus was tightly linked to a previously mapped thi locus, which was located on the megaplasmid pRmeSU47b. 3adicarboxylic acids 3ametabolism 3amutants 3aEnsifer meliloti 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Bacterial 2aConjugation, Genetic 2aCulture Media 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aMutation 2aRhizobiumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSuccinatesxmetabolism 2aTransduction, Genetic 0aSinorhizobium meliloti1 aOresnik, I.1 aBottacin, A.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1988 Aug., v. 170, no. 8 p.3396-3403x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880908c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02173naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100002700163245008300190300001400273500002400287500001500311520049300326650001100819650001400830650001500844650002100859650002600880650001700906650002300923650002200946650001600968650002600984650001901010650001901029650003601048650001701084650001301101650001701114653001901131653002301150700002501173700002601198700002501224700002101249700002001270700002101290773012101311852000901432856008501441930003301526945002501559946001101584655001201595IND4393262620140724000000.0070722e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439326262DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-007-9243-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF2001 aKouakou, Tanoh Hilaire10aPhenolic compounds and somatic embryogenesis in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)  ap. 25-29.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aStudies of phenolic compounds were performed during cell suspension cultures in relation with the induction of embryogenic structures in two cultivars of cotton.

The embryogenic competence of flowers was compared to that of anthers and ovaries, the most widely used explant types, for five grapevine cultivars. Both the genotype and the explant source affected the differentiation of somatic embryos. The highest percentages of embryogenesis were obtained in ovary-derived calli from all cultivars tested with the exception of Brachetto a grappolo lungo. Whole flowers proved to be suitable material for initiating embryogenic cultures for most tested cultivars, and for 110 R, Chardonnay, and Grignolino they gave similar or better results than anthers. Collection of whole flowers from the inflorescence is easier and faster than excision of anthers and ovaries from the flower itself; it can be done without the use of a stereomicroscope and damage to the explant is unlikely. No morphological difference was noted among embryogenic cultures originated from ovaries, flowers, or anthers. 3acultivars 3agrapes 3agynoecium 3aanthers 3agenetic variation 3aexplants 3aflowers 3asomatic embryogenesis 3amicropropagation 3aVitis vinifera 3ain vitro regeneration 3aculture media 0ain vitro culture 0amethodology1 aRuffa, Paola1 aVallania, Rosalina1 aGribaudo, Ivana0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2007 July, v. 90, no. 1 p.79-83dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-007-9256-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071020b20071102c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/10/20  aNon-US 7aarticle05026naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100002400147245016600171300001800337500002400355520288300379650002903262650001203291650001303303650001503316650001803331650002303349650001403372650001803386650001303404650002303417650001503440650001703455650002603472650004703498650001203545650002303557650002103580650002403601650001903625650004303644650003903687650001103726650005203737650001403789650001403803650004103817650002003858650005303878650002203931650003203953700001903985700001904004700001604023700001904039700001604058700002304074700001904097773012004116852000904236930003304245945002504278946001304303655001204316IND4393403920221119215427.0070722e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439340392DNAL7 a176389902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aQ5011 aCruz-Hernández, C.10aEvaluating the Conjugated Linoleic Acid and Trans 18:1 Isomers in Milk Fat of Dairy Cows Fed Increasing Amounts of Sunflower Oil and a Constant Level of Fish Oil  ap. 3786-3801.  aIncludes references  aThe objective was to evaluate different levels of sun-flower oil (SFO) in dairy rations to increase vaccenic (trans-11-18:1) and rumenic acids (cis-9,trans-11-18:2) in milk fat, and assess the content and composition of other trans-octadecenoic (trans-18:1) and conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) isomers. Eighty lactating Holstein cows were fed control diets for 4 wk and then placed on 4 diets for 38 d; milk fat was analyzed after 10 and 38 d. The treatments were: control, 1.5% SFO plus 0.5% fish oil (FO), 3% SFO plus 0.5% FO, and 4.5% SFO plus 0.5% FO. The forage-to-concentrate ratio was 50:50 and consisted of barley/alfalfa/hay silage and corn/barley grain concentrate. There were no differences in milk production. Supplementation of SFO/FO reduced milk fat compared with respective pretreatment periods, but milk protein and lactose levels were not affected. There was a linear decrease in all short- and medium-chain saturated fatty acids (SFA) in milk fat after 10 d (25.5, 24.1, 20.2, and 16.7%) and a corresponding linear increase in total trans-18:1 (5.2, 9.1, 14.1, and 21.3%) and total CLA (0.7, 1.9, 2.4, and 3.9%). The other FA in milk fat were not affected. Separation of trans-18:1 isomers was achieved by combination of gas chromatography (GC; 100-m highly polar capillary column) and prior separation of trans FA by silver ion-thin layer chromatography followed by GC. The CLA isomers were resolved by a combination of GC and silver ion-HPLC. The trans-11- and trans-10-18:1 isomers accounted for approximately 50% of the total trans-18:1 increase when SFO/FO diets were fed. On continued feeding to 38 d, trans-11-18:1 increased with 1.5% SFO/FO, stayed the same with 3%, and declined with 4.5% SFO/FO. Rumenic acid showed a similar pattern on continued feeding as trans- 11-18:2; levels increased to 0.43, 1.5, 1.9, and 3.4% at 10 d and to 0.42, 2.15, 2.09, and 2.78% at 38 d. Rumenic acid was the major CLA isomer in all 4 diets: 66, 77, 78 and 85%. The CLA isomers trans-7,cis-9-, trans-9,cis-11-, trans-10,cis-12-, trans-11,trans-13-, and trans-9,trans-11-/trans-10,trans-12-18:2 also increased from 0.18 (control) to 0.52% (4.5% SFO/FO). Milk fat produced from 3% SFO/FO appeared most promising: trans-11-18:1 and cis-9,trans-11-18:2 increased 4.5-fold, total SFA reduced 18%, and moderate levels of trans-10-18:1 (3.2%), other trans-18:1 (6.6%) and CLA isomers (0.5%) were observed, and that composition remained unchanged to 38 d. The 4.5% SFO/FO diet produced higher levels of trans-11-18:1 and cis-9,trans-11-18:2, a 28% reduction in SFA, and similar levels of other trans-18:1 (9.2%) and CLA isomers (0.52%), but the higher levels of trans-11-18:1 and cis-9,trans-11-18:2 were not sustained.

Multivariate analyses of data on over 8,000 households revealed that living with coresident adults increased the participation of Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Asian single mothers, and enabled all mothers of young children and all foreign-born mothers to enter the labor market. In a separate analysis of extended households, the proportions of elderly and employed coresident adults increased women's labor force participation, while the proportion of coresident adults who reported child care/family responsibilities as their reason for not being in the labor force decreased women's paid labor activity. Our findings suggest that coresident adults serve different functions within the household, which in turn influence women's labor force decisions in various ways. 3aemployed women 3ahouseholds 3aextended families 3amothers 3aNew York1 aGilbertson, G.0 tJournal of marriage and the family.g1995 Feb., v. 57, no. 1 p.243-249x0022-24457nnas  aDNAL  a19950501b19950505c00000000  aINDdJVS  aOther US 7aarticle01315naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001100110245007000121300001600191520062500207650002100832650001300853650001200866651001100878773009200889852000900981930003300990945001301023946001301036655001201049IND2045495520221119215224.0950410e199502  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204549552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Z.14aThe stability of cohabitation relationships: the role of children  ap. 231-241.  aOur review of the existing evidence on the effects of children on marital stability led us to propose that the presence of children in a cohabitation relationship is very likely to inhibit the cohabiting couple from terminating their relationship.

We analyzed 89 S. aureus isolates including 37 MRSA isolates (41.6%) recovered from 89 adult patients with BSI from 4 hospitals in Zhejiang province, eastern China. Thirty-five (94.6%) of MRSA isolates and 4 (7.7%) of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) isolates were resistant to multiple antimicrobials. All isolates harbored at least 2 of 22 possible virulence genes, including sdrC (92.1%), icaA (89.9%), hla (80.9%), clf (69.7%), sea (68.5%), sdrD (67.4%), hlb (67.4%), sdrE (65.2%), sei (51.7%), seg (50.6%), and cna (50.6%). Forty-four (49.4%) of all S. aureus BSI isolates, including 23 (62.2%) of MRSA isolates, harbored ≥10 of the virulence genes evaluated in this study. Sixteen (43.2%) MRSA isolates and 5 (9.6%) MSSA isolates harbored the gene encoding Panton–Valentine leukocidin (PVL). Collective genes for pvl, sdrE, sed, seg, and sei among MRSA isolates were significantly more frequent relative to MSSA isolates (P < 0.05). A total of 22 sequence types (STs), including novel ST2184, ST2199, and ST2200, and 33 spa types, including novel spa types t9530 and t9532, were identified among S. aureus BSI isolates, among which ST188 (15.7%) and ST7 (15.7%), and t091 (12.4%) and t189 (12.4%), seldom noted for Chinese isolates previously, were major STs and spa types, respectively. In contrast to previous reports, no predominant clones were found in the present study. Among the MRSA isolates, although ST239-MRSA-SCCmecIII, predominant clone in China, still represented the most common clone, it only accounted for 18.9%. However, ST188-MRSA- SCCmecIV seldom reported before accounted for 10.8%. Among the MSSA isolates, ST7-MSSA represented the most common clone (23.1%), followed by ST188-MSSA and ST630-MSSA (9.6% each). In conclusion, simultaneous carriage of multiple virulence genes and genetically considerable diversity were common among S. aureus BSI isolates. Furthermore, MRSA isolates exhibited more frequent carriage of superantigen genes and pvl relative to MSSA isolates. Taken together, there are distinctive virulence gene profiling and molecular characteristic among S. aureus isolates associated with bloodstream infection in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aadults 3aanti-infective agents 3ablood flow 3aclones 3agenes 3ahospitals 3apatients 3avirulence 3aChina1 aLi, Tingjian1 aHuang, Xiaoying1 aXie, Juan1 aXu, Yuanyuan1 aTu, Jinjing1 aQin, Zhiqiang1 aParsons, Chris1 aWang, Jinwei1 aHu, Longhua1 aWang, Liangxing0 tDiagnostic microbiology & infectious disease.g2012 Dec., v. 74, no. 4 p.363-368dElsevier Inc.x0732-88937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2012.08.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02101naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245010700159300001600266520110400282592002801386650001101414650001201425650001801437650001701455650000901472650001201481650001501493650001801508650001301526773015001539856007701689852000901766655001201775IND60521371420221119145456.0160529e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052137142DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1971-04012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDvorák, P.10aBindung von Thallium(I) durch Hexacyanoferrate(II) / Binding by Hexacyanoferrates (II) of Thallium (I)  ap. 277-281.  aThe salts of Feᴵᴵᴵ, Coᴵᴵ, and Niᴵᴵᴵ form precipitates with Na₄- or K₄ [Feᴵᴵ(CN)₆], the so-called mixed hexacyanoferrates (II) (HCF). Experiments with radioactive tracers (²⁴Na, ⁴²K, ⁵⁹Feᴵᴵᴵ, ⁶⁰Coᴵᴵ, ⁵⁹Feᴵᴵ(CN),⁴⊖, and ²⁰⁴Tlᴵ) have shown that the composition of HCF depends on the nature as well as on the initial concentration of the metal ions involved and can be described by the general formula ExMzR·n E Y. Ε stands for univalent cations (e.g. H⨁, Na⨁, K⨁, Tl⨁, and others more), M for a heavy metal ion, R for Fe(CN)₆⁴⊖, and Y for anions (e. g. Cl⊖, SO₄²⊖, OH®). The mixed HCF are cation- and anion-exchangers, the equilibrium between solid and liquid phase depending on the nature and concentration of cations and anions in both phases. The binding stability of cations increases proportionally to the effective ionic radius: H⊕<Na⊕<K⊕<Tl⊕. Because of its favourable ionic radius, Tl⊕ exhibits a high affinity towards the mixed HCF and can be separated from solution with a high efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3acations 3aferrocyanides 3aheavy metals 3airon 3aliquids 3ametal ions 3aradiolabeling 3athallium0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 26, no. 4 p.277-281dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1971-04013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02557naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245014900165300001800314520154300332592002801875650002201903650002101925650001501946650001201961650002001973650001701993650002402010700002302034773010202057856007502159852000902234655001202243IND60530965920161014000000.0160723e20120522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053096592DNAL7 a10.1021/bi300352x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBüllesbach, Erika E.10aReplacement of Disulfides by Amide Bonds in the Relaxin-like Factor (RLF/INSL3) Reveals a Role for the A11–B10 Link in Transmembrane Signaling  ap. 4198-4205.  aThe relaxin-like factor (RLF) also named insulin-like 3 (INSL3) consists of two polypeptide chains linked by two interchain and one intrachain disulfide bond. RLF binds to its receptor (LGR8 also named RXFP2) through the B chain and initiates transmembrane communication by activating the adenylate cyclase through the N-terminal region of both chains. Cystine A11–B10 occupies a unique position on the molecular surface just outside the binding region and between the two signaling ports. We have synthesized an RLF analogue in which the disulfide A11–B10 was replaced by a peptide bond and found that cAMP production ceased while receptor binding was not affected. In contrast, replacing the disulfide A24–B22 by a peptide bond reduced potency proportional to the binding affinity and lowered efficacy to 65%, while replacing disulfide A10–A15 by a peptide bond reduced binding affinity to 32% and lowered potency to 7% but maintained 100% efficacy. The exceptional properties of the derivative bearing an A11–B10 isopeptide cross-link suggests that the disulfide has a special role in signal transduction. We propose that disulfide A11–B10 serves as an insulator between the two ports, whereas the amide functionality disturbs the signal transmission complex likely due to changes in polarity. The clear separation between receptor binding and signal activation sites within this small protein permits one to study how the relaxin-like factor initiates the signal on the receptor that induces intracellular cAMP production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenylate cyclase 3abinding capacity 3acyclic AMP 3acystine 3adisulfide bonds 3apolypeptides 3asignal transduction1 aSchwabe, Christian0 tBiochemistry.g2012 May 22, v. 51, no. 20 p.4198-4205dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi300352x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04192naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245015800168300001600326520296200342592002803304650002303332650001603355650001503371650000903386650001803395650001003413650000903423650001203432650001403444650001103458650001903469650001503488650001103503700001903514700002703533773010503560856008503665990002303750852000903773655001203782IND60093570720221119141118.0141103e20120905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009357072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemgeo.2012.04.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlimm, Kevin14aThe dissolution mechanism of sulphur in hydrous silicate melts. II: Solubility and speciation of sulphur in hydrous silicate melts as a function of fO₂  ap. 250-267.  aRaman and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES) measurements on a series of experimentally synthesised, sulphur (S)-bearing, hydrous silicate glasses were used to determine the S-speciation and S-oxidation state as a function of glass composition and oxygen fugacity (fO₂) and to decipher the dissolution mechanism of S in silicate melts. Synthesised glasses include soda-lime (SLG), K₂Si₄O₉ (KSG), albite and trondhjemite (TROND) compositions. A series of SLG and KSG glasses, doped with small quantities of Fe, was also studied in order to determine the effect of Fe/S on the S solubility. The experiments were performed in internally heated (IHPV) and cold seal (CSPV) pressure vessels at 200MPa, 1000 and 850°C and a range of fO₂ from log fO₂=QFM−2.35 to QFM+4 (QFM is quartz–fayalite–magnetite oxygen buffer). The systematic correlation of features in Raman and XANES spectra allows the identification of at least four different S-species in the glasses depending on fO₂ and Fe/S of the system. In XANES spectra of Fe-free glasses SH⁻, H₂S and SO₄ ²⁻ are visible as peaks at 2466, 2471.8 and 2482eV, respectively. In Raman spectra peaks at 2574 and 990cm⁻¹ indicate the presence of HS bonds and SO₄ ²⁻, respectively, but SH⁻ and H₂S can not be distinguished using a Raman spectroscopy. In Fe-bearing glasses FeS bonding is identified at 2469eV in the case of XANES and at 298, 372 and 420cm⁻¹ in the case of Raman spectra. The intensities of peaks related to SH bonding systematically decrease and the intensities of peaks related to FeS bonding systematically increase with increasing Fe/S in both the XANES and the Raman spectra indicating that in the presence of Fe, FeS bonding is preferred over SH bonding. The total S solubility at sulphur saturation in the Fe-free melts is a function of the degree of melt polymerisation and it increases with increasing NBO/T (from 0.03 to 1.91wt.% S). The S²⁻ species are more soluble than the S⁶⁺ species in contrast to previously studied Fe-bearing “natural” compositions. The change from S²⁻ to S⁶⁺ is observed at log fO₂=QFM−1 to QFM+1 which is ~1.5 log unit lower than the range of fO₂ previously reported for Fe-rich compositions indicating that Fe influences not only the speciation but also the oxidation state of S in silicate melts at given redox conditions. The natural implications are that S⁶⁺ in Fe-poor magmas can be stable at lower fO₂ than previously predicted and, hence, S⁶⁺ may act as an oxidising agent in the mantle wedge by successively oxidising Fe²⁺ to Fe³⁺ via the reaction H₂SO₄+9FeO=FeS+4Fe₂O₃+H₂O. For the silicate melt generated in the mantle wedge and containing about 10wt.% total FeO, the change in the Fe³⁺/ΣFe ratio from 0.1 to 0.2 will correspond to an increase in the log fO₂ from QFM−0.5 to QFM+1.5 and will require only 1000–3000ppm S extracted from subducted slab.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3aabsorption 3acold 3aferrous oxide 3aglass 3airon 3amelting 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apolymerization 3asolubility 3asulfur1 aKohn, Simon C.1 aBotcharnikov, Roman E.0 tChemical geology.g2012 Sept. 5, v. 322-323 p.250-267dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11673x0009-25417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2012.04.0283Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02070naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245010500174300001500279520099900294592002801293653002401321653002901345653002001374653001501394653002801409653003301437653002401470653001501494700002301509773011701532856008601649852000901735655001201744IND60609945220221119112657.0180824e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060994522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2017.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDagilis, Vytautas10aAnalysis of lubricity and cavitation problem of oil and refrigerant mixture for hermetic compressors  ap. 99-107.  aThe study is based on the results of experimental and theoretical research, the aim of which was to reveal the potential for the decrease of friction losses in the refrigerator's compressors. Lower viscosity oils as well as decreasing crankshaft diameters should lower the said losses. However, these measures can cause an adverse effect, if hydrodynamic lubrication regime transforms into boundary one, and the bearing eccentricity ratio reaches unity. The main objective of the study is to explain why the almost ideal surfaces of shaft and bush do wear when the carrying capacity of lubricating film theoretically exceeds real loads at eccentricity ratio 0.9 or even less. This disagreement, which also is presented in the study, can be explained by cavitation only partially. This study makes an assumption that the boundary value, i.e. oil film height, at which cavitation is starting, depends on a minimum height of the lubricating oil film, i.e. minimum clearance between shaft and bush.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHermetic compressor 0aHydrodynamic lubrication 0aFriction losses 0aCavitation 0aCompresseur hermétique 0aLubrification hydrodynamique 0aPertes par friction 0aCavitation1 aVaitkus, Liutauras0 tInternational journal of refrigeration.g2017 Nov., v. 83 p.99-107dElsevier LtdwJournal:26758x0140-70077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2017.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02132naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245009500171300001400266520098500280592002801265650001701293650001301310650001701323650001101340650002901351650001701380651001101397653002101408653002401429653002201453653002201475653002501497700002101522700001801543773009201561856008401653852000901737655001201746IND60597352820221120171039.0200128e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059735282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHentschel, Moritz10aRenewable energy cooperatives: Facilitating the energy transition at the Port of Rotterdam  ap. 61-69.  aRenewable energy cooperatives (RECs) are an important element of the European energy transition.

We investigate how a REC could be designed to increase renewable energy deployment at the Port of Rotterdam. Based on a progressive case study conducted among a wide array of stakeholders at the Port and across Europe, we have found 14 specific characteristics a REC should embody to facilitate the energy transition at the Port. Based on these results, we present an action plan with concrete recommendations on how a successful cooperative could be launched at the Port.

Aphids, for example, are known to receive protection against natural enemies from both heritable bacterial symbionts as well as ants, which tend aphids in exchange for sugary honeydew excretions. Little is known, however, about how ant attendance might influence interactions between aphids and their protective bacteria. Assuming costs to infection, we hypothesized that protective symbiont prevalence would decrease in the presence of ants, because of duplication of services. We surveyed natural aphid populations and found Hamiltonella defensa, a bacterium that provides resistance to aphids against parasitoid wasps in laboratory settings, among several aphid species, including Obtusicauda frigidae (Oestlund 1886). We excluded ants from protecting O. frigidae aggregations and measured the effect of ant absence on the frequency of parasitoid attack and H. defensa infection in aphid groups. Ant presence did not reduce H. defensa frequency in aphids, likely because ants and H. defensa did not significantly lower parasitoid wasp attack rates. Metabolic costs likely control H. defensa prevalence more than the effect of ant-tending.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHamiltonella defensa 0aFormica obscuripes 0aObtusicauda frigidae 0asymbiosis 0adefensive mutualism1 aWood, Elizabeth A.1 aOliver, Kerry M.1 aBillick, Ian1 aAbbot, Patrick0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2012 May, v. 105, no. 3 p.447-453dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2FAN111763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03672naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002600180245013900206300001800345506007600363520205900439592002802498506003702526650002702563650001702590650002002607650001502627650001802642650001302660650001702673650002302690650001402713650002702727650002202754650001302776650002402789650001802813650002702831650002102858650001102879650001002890700002102900700002502921700002202946773010202968856007503070852000903145655001203154IND60530966120221207085904.0160723e20120522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053096612DNAL7 a10.1021/bi300386m2doi7 aPMC33584662pmcid7 a225246242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoblirsch, Brandon
R.10aCrystal Structures of Xanthomonas campestris OleA Reveal Features That Promote Head-to-Head Condensation of Two Long-Chain Fatty Acids  ap. 4138-4146.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOleA is a thiolase superfamily enzyme that has been shown to catalyze the condensation of two long-chain fatty acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) substrates. The enzyme is part of a larger gene cluster responsible for generating long-chain olefin products, a potential biofuel precursor. In thiolase superfamily enzymes, catalysis is achieved via a ping-pong mechanism. The first substrate forms a covalent intermediate with an active site cysteine that is followed by reaction with the second substrate. For OleA, this conjugation proceeds by a nondecarboxylative Claisen condensation. The OleA from Xanthomonas campestris has been crystallized and its structure determined, along with inhibitor-bound and xenon-derivatized structures, to improve our understanding of substrate positioning in the context of enzyme turnover. OleA is the first characterized thiolase superfamily member that has two long-chain alkyl substrates that need to be bound simultaneously and therefore uniquely requires an additional alkyl binding channel. The location of the fatty acid biosynthesis inhibitor, cerulenin, that possesses an alkyl chain length in the range of known OleA substrates, in conjunction with a single xenon binding site, leads to the putative assignment of this novel alkyl binding channel. Structural overlays between the OleA homologues, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) synthase and the fatty acid biosynthesis enzyme FabH, allow assignment of the two remaining channels: one for the thioester-containing pantetheinate arm and the second for the alkyl group of one substrate. A short β-hairpin region is ordered in only one of the crystal forms, and that may suggest open and closed states relevant for substrate binding. Cys143 is the conserved catalytic cysteine within the superfamily, and the site of alkylation by cerulenin. The alkylated structure suggests that a glutamic acid residue (Glu117β) likely promotes Claisen condensation by acting as the catalytic base. Unexpectedly, Glu117β comes from the other monomer of the physiological dimer.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aXanthomonas campestris 3aactive sites 3aacyl coenzyme A 3aalkylation 3abinding sites 3abiofuels 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3acerulenin 3acondensation reactions 3acrystal structure 3acysteine 3afatty-acid synthase 3aglutamic acid 3along chain fatty acids 3amultigene family 3aolefin 3axenon1 aFrias, Janice A.1 aWackett, Lawrence P.1 aWilmot, Carrie M.0 tBiochemistry.g2012 May 22, v. 51, no. 20 p.4138-4146dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi300386m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01602naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245016400161300001600325520062500341592002800966650001400994650001701008650001201025650001301037650001101050700001501061773015001076856007701226852000901303655001201312IND60521371820221119145508.0160529e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052137182DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1971-04052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoffmann, E.,10aZum Mechanismus der Chelatbildung von Ni2⊕-ionen mit α- und β-Hydroxyglutarsäure / Formation Mechanism of Ni- (II) -α- and -β-hydroxyglutarate-Complexes  ap. 299-304.  aThe kinetics of the formation and dissociation of Ni- (II) -complexes of glutarate, 2-hydroxyglutarate, and 3-hydroxyglutarate were investigated by a pressure jump method.

Climate scenarios predict an increased frequency of severe drought events in the future, which is supposed to cause a decline of beech forests even towards the northern edge. Whether the management has the potential to mitigate the negative effects of climate warming has not been fully addressed yet. In order to fill the knowledge gap, we compiled data from 29 long-term research plots (LTRP) at 8 sites across the western Carpathian Mountains (Eastern Europe). The LTRP were established in 1958–84 and measured every 4–5 years till 2015. Development of forest stand attributes including top height (htop), mean quadratic diameter (dq), mean annual tree volume increment (iv̅), periodic annual volume increment (PAIV), mean annual basal area increment (BAI), and total yield production (TY) was compared with the simulations by the Slovakian yield models developed in the 1980s based on data from the period before recent climate change. Results were additionally confronted with the growth of beech forests in a larger Central European region. Results showed an increase of TY since the 1960s compared to the simulated TY, starting from the same value, ranging from 5% to 40% and mainly depending on site quality and average annual temperature. The largest increase was found on less productive sites, which was in line with the previous findings in recent literature. Interestingly, beech TY in the Western Carpathians was found to be lower by −11% on average compared to beech forests in Central Europe (Germany). Moreover, while an increase in the BAI continues in unmanaged forests, it has recently slowed down in forests managed by “free crown thinning” and it even started to decrease in less productive forests where heavy thinning from below was applied. Finally, our results showed that the responses of beech BAI to climate variation significantly depended on tree class.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica subsp. sylvatica 3adecline 3amodels 3adrought 3aforest stands 3atrees 3aglobal warming 3atemperature 3astand basal area 3aadverse effects 3aclimate 3aforests 3aCentral European region 3aGermany 3aEastern European region 3aCarpathian region 0aClimate response 0aClimate change 0aTotal yield 0aGrowth dynamics 0abasal area 0aSilviculture 0aBasal area increment1 aŠtefančík, Igor1 aPetráš, Rudolf1 aVacek, Stanislav0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2016 May 28, v. 222 p.21-31dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2016.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03765naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245014800168520232600316592002802642650002502670650002002695650001702715650001202732650001102744650002002755650001702775650001402792650002002806650002402826650002402850650000702874650001502881650001402896650001402910650001402924650000902938650002002947650001602967700002302983700002103006700002003027700002503047773012103072856008103193852000903274655001203283IND60702093320221122041155.0200717e20200507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070209332DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy100506602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaletnik, Bogdan 10aBiochar and Ash Fertilization Alter the Chemical Properties of Basket Willow (Salix viminalis L.) and Giant Miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus)  aThis article presents the results of a two-year study investigating the effects of the fertilization of soil, with biochar and ash from plant biomass, on selected properties of the pyrolysis products obtained from basket willow (Salix viminalis L.) and giant miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus). The study was designed to determine whether soil enrichment through the use of organic fertilizers (ash added at the rate of 1.5 t ha⁻¹, biochar added at the rate of 11.5 t ha⁻¹ and a combination of them) in the cultivation of energy crops would affect the quality of pyrolysates obtained from these plants. The research goal was to use biochar and biomass ash to produce high-quality pyrolysates with fertilizing potential. The aboveground parts of the plants were subjected to the pyrolysis process, which was carried out in constant conditions, i.e., a temperature of 500 °C and duration of 10 min. The pyrolysates obtained were examined for their pH value, the content of absorbable forms of phosphorus (P₂O₅), potassium (K₂O) and magnesium (Mg), as well as total carbon and the total content of selected macro- and micro-elements. The results of the current study show the beneficial effects of these soil fertilizers, reflected by the high quality and enhanced mineral contents of the biochars obtained. The highest total increase in the contents of absorbable forms of P, K and Mg was found in the pyrolysis products from basket willow fertilized with ash alone, amounting to 21.6% in relation to the pyrolysates from the control sample. As for the pyrolysates from the biomass of giant miscanthus, the greatest total increase in the contents of the elements, amounting to 44.4%, was identified when biochar and ash were used in combination. Soil amendments such as biochar and ash used for growing bioenergy crops can alter the aboveground plant quality. The subsequent pyrolysates created from these plants may be enriched and can be an alternative to mineral fertilizers. Natural amendment, such as high-quality pyrolysates, can be used in the cultivation of many plants. Additionally, conversion of plant biomass into pyrolysates is important for the environment, affecting the balance of carbon in the atmosphere through its capture and storage in a stable form outside the atmosphere, e.g., in soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiscanthus giganteus 3aSalix viminalis 3aaerial parts 3abiochar 3acarbon 3acrop production 3aenergy crops 3amagnesium 3amineral content 3amineral fertilizers 3aorganic fertilizers 3apH 3aphosphorus 3aphytomass 3apotassium 3apyrolysis 3asoil 3asoil amendments 3atemperature1 aZaguła, Grzegorz 1 aSaletnik, Aneta 1 aBajcar, Marcin 1 aPuchalski, Czesław 0 tAgronomy.g2020 May 07, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy100506603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245009500163300001400258520161600272592002801888650002201916650001201938650001901950650001101969650001401980650001101994650001602005700001802021700001902039773010302058856008502161990002302246852000902269655001202278IND60093571320221119141139.0141103e20120905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009357132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemgeo.2012.04.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jie10aCalcite dissolution kinetics in view of Gibbs free energy, dislocation density, and pCO₂  ap. 11-18.  aThe dissolution of calcite in a full range of saturation conditions is investigated to explore the kinetic effect of Gibbs free energy, dislocation density, and the presence of atmospheric pCO₂. Experiments are carried out in a mixed-flow reactor at room temperature (25°C) in both closed and open (to air) settings, and calcite samples are prepared by fragmentation and milling to generate different defect densities. Experimental observations show a highly nonlinear dependence of the dissolution rates on the Gibbs free energy; however, the kinetics does not seem to be affected by the samples' dislocation density, nor the presence of atmospheric pCO₂ at any saturation condition. Fitting the conventional transition state model (TST) to the observed rate - free energy relationship indicates that, though the TST rate equation is sufficient to describe the dissolution kinetics near and far from equilibrium, it clearly overestimates the dissolution rate when the system sits in between. These results suggest that: (i) the classic TST model may not be sufficient to depict the relation between dissolution rate and Gibbs free energy once solution saturation falls from its extrema. (ii) The steps associated with increased crystal defects may be overwhelmed by those regenerated at corners and edges of calcite particles through layer-by-layer dissolution along the cleavage directions. (iii) The presence of CO₂ in ambient environments bears little importance to calcite dissolution possibly due to the slow response of aqueous HCO₃ ⁻ to pCO₂ change at low CO₂ partial pressure conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3acalcite 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3aequations 3amodels 3atemperature1 aFan, Chunfang1 aTeng, H.

We investigated the within-tree distribution of nest sites and foraging areas of individual ant colonies on emergent trees. The ant species composition on trees occupied by C. difformis was significantly different from that on conspecific trees without C. difformis. The species richness of ants inhabiting emergent trees, colony abundance of ants that nested and foraged in the crowns, and colony abundance of ants that nested on and in the ground but foraged in the crowns were all significantly lower on trees occupied by C. difformis than on conspecific trees without C. difformis. These results suggest that C. difformis suppresses the distribution of other ant species on emergent trees by excluding them from C. difformis territories and that a single ant species can affect the structure of the entire ant assemblage in the canopy of tropical rainforests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrematogaster 3aant colonies 3acanopy 3aforaging 3anesting sites 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3atropical rain forests 0aepiphytes 0amyrmecophytes 0acompetitive exclusion 0aforest canopy 0aSouth-East Asian tropics1 aYamane, S.1 aItioka, T.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2012 July, v. 105, no. 4 p.592-598dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2FAN111493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02020naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245009700167300001600264520086600280592002801146653003601174653002901210653002101239653001401260653005401274653006601328653002601394653001601420700001701436700001601453773011801469856008601587852000901673655001201682IND60609942120221119112751.0180824e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060994212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2017.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRezaei, M.10aNumerical investigation of real gas effects on a two-stage pulse tube cryocooler performance  ap. 106-118.  aIn this paper, a one-dimensional CFD code was developed to simulate a two-stage pulse tube cryocooler.

We examine this context using a comparative socioecological analysis of resistance management in Australia, Brazil, India, and the United States. We find that a shared understanding of resistance risks among government regulators, growers, and other actors is critical for effective governance. Furthermore, monitoring of grower compliance with resistance management requirements, surveillance of resistance, and mechanisms to support rapid implementation of remedial actions are essential to achieve desirable outcomes. Mandated resistance management measures, strong coordination between actors, and direct linkages between the group that appraises resistance risks and growers also appear to enhance prospects for effective governance. Our analysis highlights factors that could improve current governance systems and inform other initiatives to conserve susceptibility as a contribution to the cause of public good.  aPublisher supplied data  aDBI-1639145cNational Science Foundation  a2014-33522-22214cDepartment of Agriculture (USDA) Biotechnology Risk Assessment Grant  a#NC02520cUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture HATCH project0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3acollaborative management 3acompliance 3acrops 3agovernance 3agrowers 3amonitoring 3apests 3aresistance management 3arisk 3atransgenic plants 3aAustralia 3aBrazil 3aIndia 3aUnited States1 aBrown, Zachary S.1 aDownes, Sharon J.1 aGujar, Govind1 aEpstein, Graham1 aOmoto, Celso1 aStorer, Nicholas P.1 aMota-Sanchez, David1 aSøgaard Jørgensen, Peter1 aCarroll, Scott P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2094-93980 tAmbio.g2020 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.1-16dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl28633x0044-74477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-019-01167-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04876naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245015200167300002000319520277300339592002803112596009803140596009803238596009803336596009803434596009003532596010303622596008503725650001603810650001103826650003303837650002603870650002303896650002403919650002703943650001303970700001903983700001204002700001704014700005204031700005704083700005604140773011604196856008504312852000904397655001204406IND60790118520221121033819.0220824e20220810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079011852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c010902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Minghui10aVersatilely Manipulating the Mechanical Properties of Polymer Nanocomposites by Incorporating Porous Fillers: A Molecular Dynamics Simulation Study  ap. 10150-10161.  aPolymer nanocomposites (PNCs) have been attracting myriad scientific and technological attention due to their promising mechanical and functional properties. However, there remains a need for an efficient method that can further strengthen the mechanical performance of PNCs. Here, we propose a strategy to design and fabricate novel PNCs by incorporating porous fillers (PFs) such as metal–organic frameworks with ultrahigh specific surface areas and tunable nanospaces to polymer matrices via coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. Three important parameters─the polymer chain stiffness (k), the interaction strength between the PF center and the end functional groups of polymer chains (εcₑₙₜₑᵣ ₑₙd), and the PF weight fraction (w)─are systematically examined. First, attributed to the penetration of polymer chains into PFs at a strong εcₑₙₜₑᵣ ₑₙd, the dimension of polymer chains such as the radius of gyration and the end-to-end distance increases greatly as a function of k compared to the case of the neat polymer system. The penetration of polymer chains is validated by characterizing the radial distribution function between end functional groups and filler centers, as well as the visualization of the snapshots. Also, the dispersion state of PFs tends to be good because of the chain penetration. Then, the glass transition temperature ratio of PNCs to that of the neat systems exhibits a maximum in the case of k = 5ε, indicating that the strongest interlocking between polymer chains and PFs occurs at intermediate chain stiffness. The polymer chain dynamics of PNCs decreases to a plateau at k = 5ε and then becomes stable, and the relative mobility to that of the neat system as well presents the same variation trend. Furthermore, the mechanical property under uniaxial deformation is thoroughly studied, and intermediates k, εcₑₙₜₑᵣ ₑₙd, and w can bring about the best mechanical property. This is because of the robust penetration and interaction, which is confirmed by calculating the stress of every component of PNCs with and without end functional groups and PF centers as well as the nonbonded interaction energy change between different components. Finally, the optimal condition (k = 5.36ε, εcₑₙₜₑᵣ ₑₙd = 5.29ε, and w = 6.54%) to design the PNC with superior mechanical behavior is predicted by Gaussian process regression, an active machine learning (ML) method. Overall, incorporating PFs greatly enhances the entanglements and interactions between polymer chains and nanofillers and brings effective mechanical reinforcements with lower filler weight fractions. We anticipate that this will provide new routes to the design of mechanically reinforced PNCs.  aPublisher supplied data  a21674010cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a51333004cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a51790502cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a51873006cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a171040cEducation Department of Henan Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004806  a2182053cNatural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipalitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004826  a52122311cNational Science Fund for Excellent Young Scholarsdhttps://doi.org/NA 3adeformation 3aenergy 3aglass transition temperature 3amechanical properties 3amolecular dynamics 3anormal distribution 3apolymer nanocomposites 3apolymers1 aHuang, Haifeng1 aLi, Sai1 aChen, Zhudan1 aLiu, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7369-18751 aZeng, Xiaofei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9010-00881 aZhang, Liqun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2103-62940 tLangmuir.g2022 Aug. 10, v. 38, no. 33 p.10150-10161dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c010903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245011100160300001600271520156600287592002801853650001701881650002001898650001501918650001301933650001301946650001101959650002201970650001601992650001502008700001902023773011102042856007102153852000902224655001202233IND60519139620221119155759.0160420e199608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051913962DNAL7 a10.2307/22694812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConroy, Michael J.10aMapping of Species Richness for Conservation of Biological Diversity: Conceptual and Methodological Issues  ap. 763-773.  aBiodiversity mapping (e.g., the Gap Analysis Program [GAP]), in which vegetative features and categories of land use are mapped at coarse spatial scales, has been proposed as a reliable tool for land use decisions (e.g., reserve identification, selection, and design). This implicitly assumes that species richness data collected at coarse spatio‐temporal scales provide a first‐order approximation to community and ecosystem representation and persistence. This assumption may be false because (1) species abundance distributions and species richness are poor surrogates for community/ecosystem processes, and are scale dependent; (2) species abundance and richness data are unreliable because of unequal and unknown sampling probabilities and species‐habitat models of doubtful reliability; (3) mapped species richness data may be inherently resistant to scaling up or scaling down: and (4) decision‐making based on mapped species richness patterns may be sensitive to errors from unreliable data and models, resulting in suboptimal conservation decisions. We suggest an approach in which mapped data are linked to management via demographic models, multiscale sampling, and decision theory. We use a numerical representation of a system in which vegetation data are assumed to be known and mapped without error, a simple model relating habitat to predicted species persistence, and statistical decision theory to illustrate use of mapped data in conservation decision‐making and the impacts of uncertainty in data or models on the decision outcome.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3adecision making 3aecosystems 3ahabitats 3aland use 3amodels 3aspecies diversity 3auncertainty 3avegetation1 aNoon, Barry R.0 tEcological applications.g1996 Aug., v. 6, no. 3 p.763-773dEcological Society of Americax1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/22694813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01998naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245008800163300001600251520102600267592002801293650001501321650001201336650002201348650001601370650000701386650001501393650002301408700001701431773015001448856007701598852000901675655001201684IND60521368720221120195544.0160529e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052136872DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1971-02132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrockman, R.

The area per molecule (extrapolated to zero pressure) for 9-cis retinal, all-trans retinal, and 13-cis retinal on 10⁻² ᴍ phosphate buffer at pH 6 is 56 Å², 54 Å² and 45 Å², respectively. Complexation was observed between 9-cis retinal (9-cis) and β-mercaptoethylamine (MEA) dissolved in the subphase; however, ʟ-lysine does not appear to form a complex wth 9-cis retinal. The area per molecule of the complex as a function of subphase concentration (MEA) was determined. The area per molecule for 9-cis is decreased to 49 Å² after irradiation with blue light. Irradiation does not appear to break the complex between 9-cis and MEA. The lower limit for the quantum yield for photoisomerization of 9-cis, on phosphate buffer, is 0.06. When 9-cis is complexed with MEA (5 × 10⁻⁶ ᴍ) the quantum yield for photoisomerization is lowered, e. g. at 5 × 10⁻⁶ ᴍ MEA the yield is 0.03.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablue light 3abuffers 3acis-trans isomers 3airradiation 3apH 3aphosphates 3aphotoisomerization1 aBrody, S.

The MeOH extracts of the fruits of the Paulownia tree yielded many small molecules capable of targeting PLpro. Five of these compounds were new geranylated flavonoids, tomentin A, tomentin B, tomentin C, tomentin D, tomentin E (1–5). Structure analysis of new compounds (1–5) by NMR showed that they all contain a 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran moiety. This chemotype is very rare and is derived from cyclization of a geranyl group with a phenol functionality. Most compounds (1–12) inhibited PLpro in a dose dependent manner with IC₅₀’s raging between 5.0 and 14.4μM. All new compounds having the dihydro-2H-pyran group showed better inhibition than their parent compounds (1 vs 11, 2 vs 9, 4 vs 12, 5 vs 6). In kinetic studies, 1–12 emerged to be reversible, mixed inhibitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPaulownia tomentosa 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3achemistry 3achemotypes 3aflavonoids 3afruits 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphenol 3aproteinases 3atrees 3avirus replication 2aMagnoliopsidaxchemistry. 2aAntiviral Agentsxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aCysteine Endopeptidasesxchemistry 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aFlavonoidsxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aFruitxchemistry 2aKinetics 2aPlant Extractsxchemistry 2aRecombinant Proteinsxchemistry 2aSevere acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirusxenzymology. 2aViral Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxchemistry.1 aCurtis-Long, Marcus J.1 aLee, Kon Ho1 aKim, Dae-Wook,1 aRyu, Hyung Won1 aYuk, Heung Joo1 aPark, Ki Hun0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry.g2013 June 1, v. 21, no. 11 p.3051-3057dElsevier Ltdx0968-08967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2013.03.0273Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001800186245007800204300001800282506007600300520144400376592002801820506003701848650001401885650001401899650001901913650002401932650002401956650001701980653002201997653003902019653002402058653001602082653003002098700002202128700002102150773019202171856007902363852000902442655001202451IND60230401820221207132022.0150614e20150421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023040182DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.15047141122doi7 aPMC44133282pmcid7 a258480142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Shi-Bo10aMimicking the magnetic properties of rare earth elements using superatoms  ap. 4941-4945.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRare earth elements (REs) consist of a very important group in the periodic table that is vital to many modern technologies. The mining process, however, is extremely damaging to the environment, making them low yield and very expensive. Therefore, mimicking the properties of REs in a superatom framework is especially valuable but at the same time, technically challenging and requiring advanced concepts about manipulating properties of atom/molecular complexes. Herein, by using photoelectron imaging spectroscopy, we provide original idea and direct experimental evidence that chosen boron-doped clusters could mimic the magnetic characteristics of REs. Specifically, the neutral LaB and NdB clusters are found to have similar unpaired electrons and magnetic moments as their isovalent REs (namely Nd and Eu, respectively), opening up the great possibility in accomplishing rare earth mimicry. Extension of the superatom concept into the rare earth group not only further shows the power and advance of this concept but also, will stimulate more efforts to explore new superatomic clusters to mimic the chemistry of these heavy atoms, which will be of great importance in designing novel building blocks in the application of cluster-assembled nanomaterials. Additionally, based on these experimental findings, a novel “magic boron” counting rule is proposed to estimate the numbers of unpaired electrons in diatomic LnB clusters.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achemistry 3aelectrons 3aimage analysis 3amagnetic properties 3arare earth elements 3aspectroscopy 0asuperatom concept 0aphotoelectron imaging spectroscopy 0arare earth elements 0aspin states 0amagic boron counting rule1 aBerkdemir, Cuneyt1 aCastleman, A.

Among them, compounds F8, F29, F33, F35, and F36 exhibited the IC₅₀ values under 5μM. The structure–activity relationship was discussed. Mechanistically, F35 and F36 dose-dependently prevented LPS-induced NF-κB and ERK activation. Finally, pretreatment with F35 and F36 significantly protected the C57B/L6 mice from LPS-induced septic death.

Nowadays, they are the subject of intensive research in different laboratories around the world, especially in Asia and the USA. The industrial application of this type of cooler is significantly limited by the high values of working pressure for pure nitrogen. Supplying the system with a mixture of nitrogen and hydrocarbons makes it possible to reduce the level of the working pressure down to that which is achieved by commercially available compressors produced for the refrigeration industry. A theoretical analysis of the performance of the cooler is presented, along with the experimental results for different mixtures. The described cooler is characterized by high reliability, simple construction in the low-temperature section, and relatively low manufacturing costs. The system produces about 10 W of cooling power at an approximate temperature of 90 K. The cooling power can be used to cool down high-temperature superconductor magnets, in nanotechnology, for cryomedical applications, and to liquefy small amounts of nitrogen, argon, oxygen, or methane.  aPublisher supplied data 0aJoule–Thomson cryocooler 0aGas mixtures 0aRefrigeration components 0aNitrogen liquefier 0aCryorefroidisseur Joule-Thomson 0aMélanges de gaz 0aComposants frigorifiques 0aLiquéfacteur d'azote1 aChorowski, Maciej1 aPiotrowska, Agnieszka0 tInternational journal of refrigeration.g2017 Oct., v. 82 p.252-261dElsevier LtdwJournal:26758x0140-70077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2017.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03234naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245024300166520152300409592002801932650002201960650002501982650002102007650001002028650001202038650001602050650001102066650001102077650001102088650000902099650002102108650001102129650001402140650001402154650001902168650000902187650001602196650001602212650001902228650001302247650001802260650000902278700002402287700001902311700002102330700002402351700002202375700002102397700002102418700001902439773012102458856008002579852000902659655001202668IND60702086120221120085131.0200717e20200518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070208612DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy100507202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDobosy, Péter 10aEffect of Irrigation Water Containing Iodine on Plant Physiological Processes and Elemental Concentrations of Cabbage (<i>Brassica oleracea</i> L. var. capitata L.) and Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> L.) Cultivated in Different Soils  aIodine uptake and translocation was studied in cabbage and tomato cultivated on different soil types (sand, sandy silt, silt) by applying irrigation water containing iodine at concentrations of 0.1 and 0.5 mg/L. Iodine treatment at the concentrations applied did not significantly influence the photosynthetic efficiency and chlorophyll concentration of cabbage and tomato leaves. The growth of cabbage leaves cultivated on sand and sandy silt soil with iodine treatment was slightly stimulated, while, on silt soil, it remained unchanged; for tomato plant parts, independent of the soil-type, the dry mass values remained constant. It can be concluded that iodine treatment had no negative effect on the physiological characteristic of cabbage and tomato plants. Applying 0.5 mg/L in the irrigation water, the highest biofortification with iodine was achieved in plants cultivated in sandy soil and the iodine concentration calculated in the dry matter amounted to 10 and 3.6 mg/kg in the leaves and fruits of cabbage and tomato, respectively. Considering the iodine and moisture content of cabbage leaves and tomato fruits, the consumption of 100 g of fresh vegetable would cover about 80% and 15% of the recommended iodine intake, respectively. The presence of iodine resulted in a reduction in Fe and P concentrations in tomato fruits independent of the soil-type; however, the concentration of Mg, Cu, Mn, Zn, and B remained practically unchanged. However, for cabbage, no similar trend for Fe and P was observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica oleracea 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3abiofortification 3aboron 3acabbage 3achlorophyll 3acopper 3afruits 3aiodine 3airon 3airrigation water 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3aphotosynthesis 3asand 3asandy soils 3asilty soils 3asoil nutrients 3atomatoes 3awater content 3azinc1 aVetési, Viktória 1 aSandil, Sirat 1 aEndrédi, Anett 1 aKröpfl, Krisztina 1 aÓvári, Mihály 1 aTakács, Tünde 1 aRékási, Márk 1 aZáray, Gyula,0 tAgronomy.g2020 May 18, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy100507203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03138naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245006500178300002000243520192800263592002802191650002202219650001302241650001402254650001002268650002502278650001902303650001502322650001602337650002002353650001702373650000902390650002502399700006402424700005402488773011602542856008502658852000902743655001202752IND60790118820221121033842.0220824e20220809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079011882DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c011932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelahaije, Roy J. B. M.10aImpact of Particle Sedimentation in Pendant Drop Tensiometry  ap. 10183-10191.  aUnderstanding the interface-stabilizing properties of surface-active components is key in designing stable macroscopic multiphase systems, such as emulsions and foams. When poorly soluble materials are used as an interface stabilizer, the insoluble material may sediment and interfere with the analysis of interfacial properties in pendant (or hanging) drop tensiometry. Here, the impact of sedimentation of particles on the interfacial properties determined by pendant drop tensiometry was evaluated using a model system of whey protein isolate and (non surface-active) glass beads (2.2–34.7 μm). Although the glass beads did not adsorb to the air–water interface, a 1% (w/w) glass bead solution appeared to decrease the surface tension by nearly 12 mN/m after 3 h. A similar effect was shown for a mixture of whey proteins and glass beads: the addition of 1% (w/w) of glass beads led to an apparent surface tension decrease of 31 mN/m rather than the 20 mN/m observed for pure whey proteins. These effects are attributed to the sedimentation of particles near the apex of the droplet, leading to droplet shape changes, which are interpreted as a decrease in surface tension using tensiometer software. The droplet density at the apex increases due to sedimentation, and this density increase is not accounted for when fitting the droplet shape with the Young–Laplace equation. The result is the observed apparent decrease in surface tension. In contrast to the significant impact of sedimenting material on the surface tension measurements, the impact on the results of oscillatory deformations was limited. These findings show that the impact of sedimentation should be considered when studying the interface-stabilizing properties of materials with reduced solubility, such as certain plant protein extracts. The presence of such particles should be carefully considered when conducting pendant drop tensiometry.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3adroplets 3aequations 3aglass 3aliquid-air interface 3aplant proteins 3asolubility 3astabilizers 3asurface tension 3atensiometers 3awhey 3awhey protein isolate1 aSagis, Leonard M.

We investigated the role of the immune system of H. axyridis in its resistance to North American population of the hymenopteran parasitoid Dinocampus coccinellae Schrank. An ultrastructural study of adult H. axyridis hemocytes under electron and light microscopy identified five different cellular types: plasmatocytes, granular hemocytes I, granular hemocytes II, oenocytoids, and spherule cells. Only granular hemocytes II and plasmatocytes are involved in the nodulation of bacteria and encapsulation of parasitoid eggs. Injection of Sephadex beads in H. axyridis adults induces an innate immune response and results in complete encapsulation of ≈≈28% of the beads after 24 h and 81% after 5 d. When H. axyridis was parasitized by D. coccinellae, we observed a decrease in the encapsulation response, and this pattern was inversely related to the number of parasitoid eggs in the H. axyridis hemolymph. The injection of polydnaviruses by D. coccinellae females and the multiple target hypotheses could both explain the encapsulation rate decreasing with increasing parasitoid egg load. Our results suggest that the immune system of H. axyridis could favor its escape from internal developing natural enemies indigenous to North America.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDinocampus coccinellae 0aHarmonia axyridis 0aencapsulation 0ahemocyte 0aparasitoid1 aGirard, Pierre-Alain1 aBrehélin, Michel1 aCoderre, Daniel1 aBoivin, Guy0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2012 Mar., v. 105, no. 2 p.328-338dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2FAN110263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006200142245014500204500002000349520184000369592002802209650002902237650001602266650001502282650001602297650001502313650001302328650001302341650001702354650002102371650001802392650001902410651001102429651001002440700006102450773013102511856007702642852000902719655001202728IND60788132020221120081610.0220811e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078813202DNAL7 a10.1029/2019WR0260682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez, Rosario,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3012-540810aGroundwater Management in the Borderlands of Mexico and Texas: The Beauty of the Unknown, the Negligence of the Present, and the Way Forward  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOver the last decade, transboundary aquifers traversing the Mexico‐Texas border have generated growing interest of federal institutions on the Mexico side and state and federal institutions on the Texas side. Notwithstanding this, binational efforts to understand, assess, and manage shared groundwater resources remain limited and politically sensitive. On the Mexico side, long‐standing centralized groundwater governance structures have created institutional barriers at the local level to the expansion of knowledge and cooperation over these transboundary resources. On the Texas side, property rights related to groundwater resources limit the scope of options available for cooperative management of cross‐border aquifers. This paper examines stakeholders' perspectives on the borderland between Mexico and Texas through 44 surveys and personal interviews. Findings show that stakeholders appear to support a binational groundwater agreement as a means for assuring the sound long‐term management of transboundary groundwater resources in the border region; however, the majority of stakeholders also suggest that short‐term local or regional arrangements may be preferable over binational agreements as local/regional approaches may be more achievable or realistic. Second, participants identified leadership and individual personalities as key factors for success at the local level but noted that such influence had limited sustainability and limited regional‐systemic effects. Third, the stakeholders indicated that water quality, rather than water quantity, is the main driver of transboundary cooperation efforts in the region. Fourth, participants suggested that failures and successes in groundwater cooperation efforts are based more on fear and political lobbying than on understanding of scientific facts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acollaborative management 3afearfulness 3agovernance 3agroundwater 3aleadership 3apolitics 3aresearch 3astakeholders 3awater management 3awater quality 3awater quantity 3aMexico 3aTexas1 aEckstein, Gabriel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9393-23620 tWater resources research.g2020 Mar., v. 56, no. 3 p.e2019WR026068-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019WR0260683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245010800170300001600278500001500294520149500309592002801804650002301832650001101855650001101866650001901877650001501896650001101911650000901922650001501931650001801946651001001964653003301974653002302007653001802030653002502048653001802073700001302091700001802104700001402122700002302136700001802159773012202177856008702299852000902386655001202395IND60525545020221119144920.0190318e20160501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052554502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2016.01.1442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Jinnan10aModeling the effects of plant-interspace heterogeneity on water-energy balances in a semiarid ecosystem  ap. 189-206.  a2019-12-06  aClose interactions of water-energy conditions at plant cover and interspace are so far largely overlooked in water-energy modeling for dryland ecosystems. This study focused on (i) introducing the plant-interspace heterogeneity into water-energy modeling for a dryland ecosystem, and (ii) investigating the influences of such heterogeneity on the ecosystem water-energy budgets. The plant-interspace heterogeneity was described using a two dimensional scheme. The soil-vegetation-atmosphere transportation processes were integrated with horizontal exchanges of water and energy. The model was parameterized and validated by field observations (Yanchi, China). The modeled sensible and latent heat fluxes were stronger at the shrub cover (SCA) compared to interspace, but soil surface was cooler. Moreover, the water-energy advections between the interspace and SCA showed mixed effects on the simulated water-energy budget of the ecosystem. The aboveground advections significantly enhanced the evapotranspiration rate at SCA. The root uptake and horizontal inflows from the interspace amounted to over 40% of the annual water loss from SCA, resulting in a tight water budget at ecosystem level. These results emphasized the necessity of considering the plant-scale heterogeneities and horizontal processes in estimating water-energy balances in such ecosystems. Our model can serve as a tool to simulate the water-energy dynamics in sparse-vegetated ecosystems regarding such interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevapotranspiration 3aenergy 3ashrubs 3atransportation 3aarid lands 3amodels 3asoil 3aecosystems 3aheat transfer 3aChina 0aPlant-interspace interaction 0aSemiarid ecosystem 0aHeterogeneity 0aWater-energy balance 0awater balance1 aJia, Xin1 aZha, Tianshan1 aWang, Ben1 aKellomäki, Seppo,1 aPeltola, Heli0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2016 May 01, v. 221 p.189-206dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2016.01.1443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03207naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245007800169300001600247520216000263592002802423650001602451650002502467650001602492650001302508650001202521650001302533650001402546650002802560650002302588650002202611773015002633856007702783852000902860655001202869IND60521369020221120210657.0160529e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052136902DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1971-02162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrody, Seymour Steven10aInteractions of Chlorophyll Monolayers with Electron Donors and Acceptors  ap. 134-141.  aPhotoreactions and complexation reactions between monolayers of chloroplyll a, at a water-air interface, and various electron donors and acceptor in a Wilhelmy film balance.When phenazine methosulfate (PMS), ascorbate, benzyl viologen (BV), or dehydroascorbic acid are present in the aqueous subphase, the area/molecule increases with substrate concentration in accordance with a Langmuir- type adsorption isotherm. The increase in area is attributed to a reorientation of chlorophyll upon complex formation. The surface potentials and areas/molecule (at zero pressure) are 350 mV and 179 Å² for PMS + ascorbate in the subphase, 300 mV and 175 Å² for PMS, 310 mV and 146 Å² for BV, 310 mV and 156 Å² for ascorbate, 230 mV and 146 Å² for dehydroascorbic acid. The equilibrium constants are 170 × 10³ ᴍ⁻¹ for PMS + ascorbate, 64 × 10³ ᴍ⁻¹ for PMS, 41 × 10³ ᴍ⁻¹ for BV, and 3.9 × 10³ ᴍ⁻¹ for ascorbate. Formation of a complex decreases the slope of the isotherm, thereby giving the film a more liquid nature. Chlorophyll does not complex with oxidized PMS.Illumination of the chlorophyll · BV complex in a nitrogen atmosphere results in an oxidation of chlorophyll; the photoproduct (probably Chl⊕ · BV⊖) has a larger area/molecule, of 165 Å², and a lower surface potential, of 280 mV. Illumination of the chlorophyll · ascorbate complex or the chlorophyll · PMS · ascorbate complex results in a reduction of chlorophyll. The photoproduct of the former reaction (probably Chl⊖ · -oxidized ascorbate) has a larger area/molecule, of 169 Å², and a lower surface potential, of 290 mV. The photoproduct of the latter reaction (probably Chl⊖ · PMS · oxidized ascorbate) has a larger area/molecule, of 211 Å², and a larger surface potential, of 380 mV. No evidence is observed for a photoreaction with the Chl · PMS complex or the Chl · dehydroascorbic acid complex. A value of 0.03 is determined as a lower limit for the quantum yield of these reactions. In all cases the absorption spectrum of the chlorophyll recovered from surface after irradiation shows no significant differences from the control.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3adehydroascorbic acid 3airradiation 3alighting 3aliquids 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aphotochemical reactions 3asorption isotherms 3aspectral analysis0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 26, no. 2 p.134-141dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1971-02163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02133naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245006100168300001600229520092600245592002801171650001901199650002201218650002901240650001301269650002601282650001701308650001401325650000901339650001501348653000701363653000801370653000801378653000801386653000801394653000701402653002201409653000701431653000901438653001401447653002601461773009501487856008401582852000901666655001201675IND60597350520221120084430.0190725e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059735052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNewbery, David10aEvaluating the case for supporting renewable electricity  ap. 684-696.  aRenewable electricity, particularly solar PV and wind, creates external benefits of learning-by-doing that drive down costs and reduce CO2 emissions.

Given current costs and learning rates, accelerating the current rate of investment appears globally socially beneficial for solar PV in most but not all cases, less so for on-shore wind. The optimal trajectory appears to involve a gradually decreasing rate of growth of installed capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acollective action 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3alearning 3arenewable electricity 3asolar energy 3asubsidies 3awind 3awind power 0aC6 0aH23 0aH43 0aQ42 0aQ54 0aQ5 0aLearning-by-doing 0aPV 0aWind 0aSubsidies 0aCost-benefit analysis0 tEnergy policy.g2018 Sept., v. 120 p.684-696dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02225naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002000188245002400208300001800232520085500250592002801105650002301133650001101156650001801167650001501185650001301200650001901213650001601232650001201248650002401260650003801284650004201322650002601364650001101390650002901401650003001430650002501460650001601485650001801501700001801519773009301537856008101630990002301711852000901734655001201743IND60094010520221120075540.0141104e20130422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009401052DNAL7 a236186612pmid7 aPMC36851812pmcid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2013.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSengupta, Piali10aSensing temperature  ap.

Temperature varies across space and time, and this variation has dramatic effects on the physiology of living cells. It changes the rate and nature of chemical reactions, and it alters the configuration of the atoms that make up nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and other biomolecules, significantly affecting their activity. While life may have started in a “warm little pond”, as Charles Darwin mused, the organisms that surround us today have only made it this far by devising sophisticated systems for sensing and responding to variations in temperature, and by using these systems in ways that allow them to persist and thrive in the face of thermal fluctuation.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3alipids 3anucleic acids 3aphysiology 3aproteins 3aspace and time 3atemperature 2aAnimals 2aArchaeaxphysiology 2aBacterial Physiological Phenomena 2aCell Membranexchemistryxphysiology. 2aEukaryotaxphysiology 2aHumans 2aIon Channelsxphysiology 2aNucleic Acidsxphysiology 2aProtein Conformation 2aTemperature 2aThermosensing1 aGarrity, Paul0 tCurrent biology.g2013 Apr. 22, v. 23, no. 8 p.R304-R307dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2013.03.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03671naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245009600173300001400269520220900283592002802492650001402520650001102534650001202545650001202557650001202569650001502581650002102596650001802617650001302635650001102648650001402659650002202673650001802695650002102713650001402734650000902748700001802757700002002775700001702795700002302812700001702835700001902852700002002871700002102891700002402912773008802936856008503024990002303109852000903132655001203141IND60093568420221122224648.0141103e20120715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009356842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemgeo.2012.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJochum, K.

However, there are analytical problems associated with this method, such as molecular interferences, elemental fractionation, and mass-load-dependent matrix effects, when using NIST silicate reference glasses for calibration. Our study with a sector-field ICP-MS shows that many masses are affected by interferences, such as ²⁴Mg⁺ by ⁴⁸Ca⁺⁺ or ³¹P⁺ by ¹⁵N¹⁶O⁺. Elemental fractionation and mass-load-dependent matrix effects have been detected for both 213 and 193nm Nd:YAG lasers. They are small for refractory lithophile elements, in particular for the 193nm laser (<5%). For chalcophile/siderophile trace elements with low boiling points, however, these effects are large (up to 40% and 20% for the 213 and 193nm lasers, respectively), and variable for the NIST glasses and carbonates. In this paper, a protocol for precise and accurate LA-ICP-MS analysis of calcium carbonates is established. Isotopes for interference-free measurements at low (M/ΔM ~300) and medium (M/ΔM ~4000) mass resolution have been identified. The NIST glasses are suitable for calibration of refractory lithophile element concentrations. However, matrix-matched calibration with carbonate reference materials, such as USGS MACS-1 or MACS-3, is necessary for accurate analysis of chalcophile/siderophile elements with low boiling points. Analytical reproducibility (RSD) is a factor of ~2 better using the 193nm laser than the 213nm laser. As shown by the analysis of MACS-1 and MACS-3, LA-ICP-MS analyses yield results that agree with the reference values within relative uncertainties of ca. 5–10% at the 95% confidence level. We have applied LA-ICP-MS for the determination of trace element concentrations in calcite and aragonite layers of a stalagmite and found large variations for Mg, Zn, Sr, and U. In ostracod shells, the concentrations of some trace elements (e.g., Sr and Ba) vary significantly, indicating the potential for paleoclimate research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaragonite 3abarium 3aboiling 3acalcite 3acalcium 3acarbonates 3aclimatic factors 3afractionation 3aisotopes 3alasers 3amagnesium 3amass spectrometry 3anormal values 3apaleoclimatology 3astrontium 3azinc1 aScholz, Denis1 aStoll, Brigitte1 aWeis, Ulrike1 aWilson, Stephen A.1 aYang, Qichao1 aSchwalb, Antje1 aBörner, Nicole1 aJacob, Dorrit E.1 aAndreae, Meinrat O.0 tChemical geology.g2012 July 15, v. 318-319 p.31-44dElsevier B.V.x0009-25417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2012.05.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03573naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136100002400154245014900178300001800327500002400345500001500369520184900384650001602233650001902249650002302268650001602291650002702307650001202334650002402346650001202370650002202382650001002404650001702414650002102431650002502452650002202477650001702499650001002516650001202526650002802538650002902566650001102595650002102606650002302627650000902650650001002659650002402669650004302693651001202736653001002748700002302758773011802781852000902899856007502908655001202983IND4463059920221122022355.0120419s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446305992DNAL7 a222177632pmid7 a10.1603/EN111112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalusu, Rammohan R.10aHost Finding and Acceptance Preference of the Yellowmargined Leaf Beetle, Microtheca ochroloma (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), on Cruciferous Crops  ap. 1471-1477.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe yellowmargined leaf beetle, Microtheca ochroloma Stål (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is an introduced pest of cruciferous crops in the southern United States, and arguably the most damaging pest of organic crucifer vegetable production in the region. Studies were conducted in the greenhouse and laboratory to investigate host finding and acceptance preference of M. ochroloma on four commonly grown cruciferous crops: cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. variety capitata), collards (B. oleracea L. variety acephala), napa cabbage [B. pekinensis (Lour.)], and turnip (B. rapa L.) First, adult beetles were allowed to choose among the four plants in a multiple-choice greenhouse cage experiment and host preference was evaluated by using three parameters: number of beetles on each plant, number of larvae on each plant, and plant damage ratings. The results showed that M. ochroloma adults actively discriminated among the four host plants, with significantly higher numbers recorded on turnip and napa cabbage than on cabbage or collards. Significantly higher numbers of larvae also were recorded on turnip and napa cabbage starting on day 10. Similarly, higher damage ratings were recorded on turnip and napa cabbage than on the remaining two hosts. Results of four-choice olfactometer experiments, which compared attraction of M. ochroloma to headspace volatiles of the four host plants, demonstrated that host preference is mediated primarily by plant volatiles. Both sexes were significantly more attracted to napa cabbage than to the remaining treatments, with turnip being the second most attractive plant. These results confirm that turnip and napa cabbage are two preferred host plants of M. ochroloma, and may support the development of a trap crop system and attractant-based strategies for managing M. ochroloma in crucrfer production. 3agreenhouses 3acollard greens 3aheadspace analysis 3ahost plants 3aplant-insect relations 3acabbage 3afeeding preferences 3aturnips 3avegetable growing 3apests 3ahost seeking 3ahost preferences 3aMicrotheca ochroloma 3aBrassica oleracea 3aplant damage 3acages 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxphysiology. 2aBrassicaceaexmetabolism 2aFemale 2aFood Preferences 2aIntroduced Species 2aMale 2aSmell 2aSpecies Specificity 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxmetabolism 0aAlabama 0acrops1 aFadamiro, Henry Y.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2011 Dec., v. 40, no. 6 p.1471-1477dEntomological Society of Americax0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EN111113Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02650naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100002100197245015000218300001600368520117700384592002801561650002101589650001301610650002101623650002401644650002001668650001201688650001101700650001301711650004301724650003101767650001501798700002001813700001801833700001801851700001501869700002101884700001801905700001801923773011701941856009002058990002302148852000902171655001202180IND60094993720221119171511.0141104e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009499372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2012.08.0232doi7 aPMC71275172pmcid7 a230172572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGranados, Andrea10aUse of an improved quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay to determine differences in human rhinovirus viral loads in different populations  ap. 384-387.  aHuman rhinoviruses (HRV) frequently cause acute respiratory infections and chronic respiratory disease exacerbations. However, testing is not generally offered. We developed a modified HRV quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay to assess viral loads in the community and hospital patients. The assay had a lower limit of detection of 2 log₁₀ viral copies/mL and displayed linearity over 5 log₁₀ viral copies, with a lower limit of quantitation of 4 log₁₀ viral copies/mL. Mean viral loads (95% confidence interval) for hospitalized children, university students, and institutionalized elderly, were 7.08 log₁₀ viral copies/mL (6.7–7.5), 6.87 log₁₀ viral copies/mL (6.5–7.2), and 7.09 log₁₀ viral copies/mL (6.9–7.3), respectively (P = 0.67). Serial specimens of 14 university students showed a decrease of mean viral loads from 6.36 log₁₀ viral copies/mL on day 1 to 2.32 log₁₀ viral copies/mL 7 days past symptom onset (P < 0.001). Using an HRV qPCR, we showed that viral loads did not differ between the community and hospitalized populations and significantly decreased following symptoms onset in healthy individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman rhinovirus 3achildren 3acollege students 3aconfidence interval 3adetection limit 3aelderly 3ahumans 3apatients 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aviral load1 aLuinstra, Kathy1 aChong, Sylvia1 aGoodall, Emma1 aBanh, Lisa1 aMubareka, Samira1 aSmieja, Marek1 aMahony, James0 tDiagnostic microbiology & infectious disease.g2012 Dec., v. 74, no. 4 p.384-387dElsevier Inc.x0732-88937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2012.08.0233Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01916naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245010800156300001600264520096500280592002801245653002001273653001501293653001601308653001301324653001401337700002301351700001901374773013901393856007301532852000901605655001201614IND60126871920221123023519.0151108e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012687192DNAL7 a10.1603/AN110882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Ai-Ping10aRevision of the Spittlebug Genus Euryaulax Kirkaldy (Hemiptera: Cercopoidea: Cercopidae) from Australia  ap. 150-164.  aThe spittlebugs of the genus Euryaulax Kirkaldy 1906 (Hemiptera: Cercopoidea: Cercopidae) from Australia are revised to include six species: E. angustifasciatus sp. nov.

While biodegradation is believed to be enhanced in transient‐storage zones of rivers, it can also occur in the main channel. Photodegradation is restricted to the main channel and surface transient‐storage zones. In this study, we propose a transient‐storage model framework to address the transport and fate of micropollutants in different domains of a river. We fitted the model to nighttime and daytime measurements of a tracer and four pharmaceuticals in River Steinlach, Germany. We could separate the surface and subsurface fractions of the total transient‐storage zone by fitting fluorescein photodegradation at daytime versus conservative nighttime transport. In reactive transport, we tested two model variants, allowing biodegradation in the main channel or restricting it to the transient‐storage zones, obtaining similar model performances but different degradation rate coefficients. Carbamazepine is relatively conservative; photodegradation of metoprolol and venlafaxine can be quantitatively attributed to the main channel and surface transient‐storage zone; metoprolol, venlafaxine, and sulfamethoxazole undergo biodegradation. We projected a decrease of overall pollutant removal under higher flow conditions, regardless of attributing biodegradation to specific river compartments. Our study indicates that model‐based analysis of daytime and nighttime field experiments allows (1) distinguishing photodegradation and biodegradation, (2) reducing equifinality of surface and subsurface transient‐storage, and (3) estimating biodegradation in different domains under different assumptions. However, entirely reducing the equifinality of attributing biodegradation to different compartments is hardly possible in lowland rivers with only limited transient storage.  aPublisher supplied data  aGRK 1829cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)  aSFB 1253cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) 3abiodegradation 3afluorescein 3amodels 3aphotolysis 3apollutants 3apollution control 3aresearch 3ariver water 3arivers 3asulfamethoxazole 3aGermany1 aZarfl, C.1 aBasu, N. B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8867-85231 aCirpka, O. A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3509-41180 tWater resources research.g2020 Mar., v. 56, no. 3 p.e2019WR026100-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019WR0261003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03130naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245005400210300002000264520125900284592002801543596009101571596007101662596007101733596008801804650001501892650001201907650001501919650001901934650001101953650001701964650001301981650003701994700005202031700006402083700006502147700002302212700006202235700005502297700005502352700005502407773011602462856008502578852000902663655001202672IND60790119120221120160747.0220824e20220811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079011912DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c013682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubackic, Marija1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9037-828X10aα-Synuclein Interaction with Lipid Bilayer Discs  ap. 10216-10224.  aα-Synuclein (aSyn) is a 140 residue long protein present in presynaptic termini of nerve cells. The protein is associated with Parkinson’s disease, in which case it has been found to self-assemble into long amyloid fibrils forming intracellular inclusions that are also rich in lipids. Furthermore, its synaptic function is proposed to involve interaction with lipid membranes, and hence, it is of interest to understand aSyn–lipid membrane interactions in detail. In this paper we report on the interaction of aSyn with model membranes in the form of lipid bilayer discs. Using a combination of cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and small-angle neutron scattering, we show that circular discs undergo a significant shape transition after the adsorption of aSyn. When aSyn self-assembles into fibrils, aSyn molecules desorb from the bilayer discs, allowing them to recover to their original shape. Interestingly, the desorption process has an all-or-none character, resulting in a binary coexistence of circular bilayer discs with no adsorbed aSyn and deformed bilayer discs having a maximum amount of adsorbed protein. The observed coexistence is consistent with the recent finding of cooperative aSyn adsorption to anionic lipid bilayers.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016.0074cKnut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelsedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004063  a2014-03971cVetenskapsr?detdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004359  a2015-00143cVetenskapsr?detdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004359  aGSn15c, Stiftelsen f?r Strategisk Forskningdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100011751 3aadsorption 3aamyloid 3adesorption 3alipid bilayers 3alipids 3anerve tissue 3aneutrons 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aLiu, Yun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0944-31531 aKelley, Elizabeth G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6128-85171 aHetherington, Crispin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4905-99651 aHaertlein, Michael1 aDevos, Juliette M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5989-67941 aLinse, Sara1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9629-71091 aSparr, Emma1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8343-96571 aOlsson, Ulf1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2200-16050 tLangmuir.g2022 Aug. 11, v. 38, no. 33 p.10216-10224dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c013683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02115naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245004200173300001600215520088500231592002801116650001901144650001601163650001101179650001801190650001601208650001301224650001101237650001901248650001701267650001201284650001501296651002101311653002301332653001101355653001101366653001101377700001901388700001801407700001701425700002701442773009501469856008401564852000901648655001201657IND60597350720221120100758.0190725e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059735072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdiger, Volkan Ş.,10aTurkish public preferences for energy  ap. 492-502.  aPublic concern over energy supplies, prices, sustainability and efficiency has emerged as a major issue around the world.

This paper presents the results from the 2016 Turkish Public Preferences for Energy Survey, which included 1204 respondents and examined Turkish residents’ household energy consumption, energy policy preferences, and environmental concerns. The main findings were that Turkish citizens consider natural gas and electricity highly expensive, view dependence on imported energy as Turkey's most pressing energy challenge, and recognize the problem of climate change. This lends public support for wind and solar power, but, at the same time, energy issues and the environment policies of political parties do not affect voting choices and political preferences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3anatural gas 3apolitics 3aprices 3apublic opinion 3asolar energy 3asurveys 3awind power 3aTurkey (country) 0aPublic preferences 0aSurvey 0aEnergy 0aTurkey1 aKirkil, Gokhan1 aÇelebi, Emre1 aUcal, Meltem1 aKentmen-Çin, Çiğdem0 tEnergy policy.g2018 Sept., v. 120 p.492-502dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02055naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001600137245012000153300001600273520104200289592002801331653001601359653004501375653001501420653001601435700001701451700001701468700002001485773013901505856007301644961001501717852000901732655001201741IND60126872120221123013618.0151108e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012687212DNAL7 a10.1603/AN111002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarr, N.

The method fails to discern C. capitata from its close relative Ceratitis caetrata Munro, based on genetic distances, parsimony networks, or nucleotide diagnostic characters observed in the DNA barcode sequences. When treated as a single taxon, it is possible to discern the C. capitata + C. caetrata lineage from other Ceratitis species. Levels of intraspecific diversity vary within the genus Ceratitis and multiple copies of the mitochondrial gene are reported for Ceratitis cosyra (Walker). The DNA barcoding method based on genetic distance is compared with a molecular identification method using restriction fragment length polymorphism. The DNA barcode and restriction fragment-length polymorphism methods provide similar identification results, but the DNA sequence information is more suitable for quantitative analysis of the information.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDNA barcode 0arestriction fragment-length polymorphism 0adiagnostic 0aTephritidae1 aIslam, M.

Ceftriaxone, erythromycin, amoxicillin, and Augmentin produced significant decreases in both biofilm and planktonic viable cell populations collected from the effluent. Augmentin produced the greatest reduction in biofilm (2.5 orders of magnitude) and planktonic populations (4 orders of magnitude). However, the minimum biofilm eradication concentration was not reached within the concentration range tested (4–64 mg/L), despite demonstrable susceptibility in standard microdilution tests (minimum bactericidal concentrations [MBC] ≤0.06 mg/L). Antibiotic tolerance of M. catarrhalis biofilm populations was partly due to an inoculum effect and partly inherent. Amoxicillin had no effect against a β-lactamase–producing M. catarrhalis. Compared to batch-grown cells, planktonic cells recovered from the Sorbarod filter effluent were more resistant to the antibiotics tested (MBC ≤0.06 and >64 mg/L, respectively). Overall, the findings may explain the lack of response of some M. catarrhalis infections to antimicrobial therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMoraxella catarrhalis 3aamoxicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3abiofilm 3aceftriaxone 3adrug therapy 3aerythromycin 3ainoculum 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amodels1 aBremer, Phil J.1 aTompkins, Geoffrey R.1 aBrooks, Heather J.L.0 tDiagnostic microbiology & infectious disease.g2012 Dec., v. 74, no. 4 p.394-398dElsevier Inc.x0732-88937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2012.08.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009400168300001600262500001900278520097800297592002801275650001401303650001001317650001201327650001001339650001301349650001901362651002101381651001001402653001201412653001001424653001801434653001401452653001901466653001201485700002501497700002401522700002201546700002301568773012301591856008401714852000901798655001201807IND60736522220221121132554.0210510e20210427xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073652222DNAL7 a10.5252/zoosystema2021v43a112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaqbool, Amir10aNeotype designation and redescription of Sicus indicus Kröber, 1940 (Diptera: Conopidae)  ap. 197-203.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA neotype is designated for Sicus indicusKröber, 1940, the original type material of which is lost. This species is accepted as valid (rev. stat.) and is redescribed and illustrated from material collected in the Kashmir Valley of the Western Himalayas of India. Sicus indicus is distinguished from other Sicus Scopoli, 1763 species primarily by the shape and configuration of the female theca, and also by the long ventral setulae on the hind femur which are otherwise only shared with the very dissimilar S. ferrugineus (Linnaeus, 1761). Two other species with very similar-looking thecae in the female, i.e. S. abdominalisKröber, 1915 and S. ogumae (Matsumara, 1916), are distinguished by differences in colouration, dusting and setulation, the latter particularly with respect to the small sclerite at the inner hind edge of the hind coxa. Sicus indicus is the only species of the genus definitely recorded from India to date, and is confined to the Himalayan region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aConopidae 3acolor 3afemales 3afemur 3aneotypes 3aredescriptions 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia 0aDiptera 0aSicus 0aredescription 0aHimalayas 0arevised status 0aneotype1 aWachkoo, Aijaz Ahmad1 aStuke, Jens-Hermann1 aAkbar, Shahid Ali1 aClements, David K.0 tZoosystema.g2021 Apr. 27, v. 43, no. 11 p.197-203dNational Museum of Natural HistorywJournal:19767x1280-95517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5252/zoosystema2021v43a113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03351naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245011100181300001800292520122000310592002801530650002101558650001601579650001601595650001701611650001701628650001001645650001401655650001901669650001801688650001301706650003701719650001701756650001901773650001201792650002101804650003201825650002101857650002901878650002001907650003101927650003801958650001101996650002602007650004602033650002402079650002902103650003502132650003602167650006102203650003202264700002102296700001702317700001402334700002002348700001602368700001802384700001302402700001602415773010902431856008102540990002302621852000902644655001202653IND60090813220221119051047.0141102e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009081322DNAL7 a236018182pmid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2013.03.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Qiang10aNovel imidazole-functionalized cyclen cationic lipids: Synthesis and application as non-viral gene vectors  ap. 3105-3113.  aA series of novel 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecanes (cyclen)-based cationic lipids bearing histidine imidazole group 10a–10e were synthesized. These amphiphilic molecules have different hydrophobic tails (long chain, cholesterol or α-tocopherol) and various type of linking groups (ether, carbamate or ester). These molecules were used as non-viral gene delivery vectors, and their structure–activity relationships were investigated. As expected, the imidazole group could largely improve the buffering capabilities comparing to cyclen. The liposomes formed from 10 and dioleoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine (DOPE) could bind and condense plasmid DNA into nanoparticles with proper size and zeta-potentials. Comparing with Lipofectamine 2000, the formed lipoplexes gave lower transfected cells proportion, but higher fluorescence intensity, indicating their good intracellular delivering ability. Furthermore, results indicate that transfection efficiency of the cationic lipids is influenced by not only the hydrophobic tails but also the linking group. The cyclen-based cationic lipid with α-tocopherol hydrophobic tail and an ester linkage could give the highest transfection efficiency in the presence of serum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-tocopherol 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3aethanolamine 3afluorescence 3agenes 3ahistidine 3ahydrophobicity 3ananoparticles 3aplasmids 3astructure-activity relationships 3atransfection 3azeta potential 2aCations 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aFluorescent Dyes 2aGene Transfer Techniques 2aGenes, Reporter 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteins 2aHeterocyclic Compoundsxchemistry 2aHumans 2aImidazolesxchemistry 2aLipidsxchemical synthesisxpharmacology. 2aMolecular Structure 2aNanoparticlesxchemistry 2aPlasmidsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aSurface-Active Agentsxchemical synthesisxpharmacology. 2aalpha-Tocopherolxchemistry1 aJiang, Qian-Qian1 aYi, Wen-Jing1 aZhang, Ji1 aZhang, Xue-Chao1 aWu, Ming-Bo1 aZhang, Yi-Mei1 aZhu, Wen1 aYu, Xiao-Qi0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry.g2013 June 1, v. 21, no. 11 p.3105-3113dElsevier Ltdx0968-08967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2013.03.0483Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02150naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245015300165300001600318520096000334592002801294653003101322653003101353653002701384653002201411653004901433653003301482653002801515653002401543700001301567700001901580773011801599856008601717852000901803655001201812IND60609943020221119112658.0180824e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060994302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2017.06.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yi10aInvestigation of an ammonia-water combined power and cooling system driven by the jacket water and exhaust gas heat of an internal combustion engine  ap. 174-188.  aAn ammonia-water combined power and cooling system is proposed and investigated in this work, in which the waste heat contained in the jacket water and exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine can be recovered efficiently to generate power and cooling energy simultaneously. The proposed system was simulated, and its thermodynamic performance in the base case was calculated based on waste heat data from an actual gas engine with a rated power output of 300 kW. The equivalent heat-to-power efficiency of the combined system is 19.76%, and the total equivalent power output is as high as 92.86 kW. The exergy efficiency of the combined system reaches 33.69%. The effects of the turbine inlet pressure, generation pressure in the reboiler, exhaust gas temperature and cooling water temperature were studied to provide guidance for the system design. The results of an economic analysis indicate that the proposed system has good economic benefit.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCombined power and cooling 0aInternal combustion engine 0aThermodynamic analysis 0aEconomic analysis 0aCogénération d’électricité et de froid 0aMoteur à combustion interne 0aAnalyse thermodynamique 0aAnalyse économique1 aHan, Wei1 aJin, Hongguang0 tInternational journal of refrigeration.g2017 Oct., v. 82 p.174-188dElsevier LtdwJournal:26758x0140-70077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2017.06.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001700189245006100206300001400267500001100281506007600292520116700368592002801535596003401563506003701597650001901634650001801653650001101671650001701682650002201699650002001721650002601741650002801767700001801795700001901813773010101832856008201933852000902015655001202024IND60678139320221207124929.0191213e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067813932DNAL7 a10.1007/s13280-019-01177-y2doi7 aPMC68887982pmcid7 a310557932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClay, Nathan10aDairy intensification: Drivers, impacts and alternatives  ap. 35-48.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDairy production systems have rapidly intensified over the past several decades. Dairy farms in many world regions are larger and concentrated in fewer hands. Higher productivity can increase overall economic gains but also incurs site-specific social and environmental costs. In this paper, we review the drivers and impacts of dairy intensification. We identify in the literature four prominent concerns about dairy intensification: the environment, animal welfare, socioeconomic well-being, and human health. We then critically assess three frameworks—sustainable intensification, multifunctionality, and agroecology—which promise win–win solutions to these concerns. We call for research and policy approaches that can better account for synergies and trade-offs among the multiple dimensions of dairy impacts. Specifically, we suggest the need to (1) consider dairy system transitions within broader processes of social-environmental change and (2) investigate how certain framings and metrics may lead to uneven social-environmental outcomes. Such work can help visualize transformations towards more equitable, ethical, and sustainable food systems.  aPublisher supplied data  a205212/Z/16/ZcWellcome Trust0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal welfare 3adairy farming 3aethics 3ahuman health 3aissues and policy 3amilk production 3aproduction technology 3asustainable agriculture1 aGarnett, Tara1 aLorimer, Jamie0 tAmbio.g2020 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.35-48dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl28633x0044-74477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-019-01177-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04648naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245015200178300001200330520353700342592002803879650001303907650002103920650001303941650000903954650001103963650001603974650002303990650002104013650001104034700001704045700002204062773008504084856008504169990002304254852000904277655001204286IND60093568920221122224530.0141103e20120806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009356892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemgeo.2012.05.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCervini-Silva, Javiera10aSteady-state dissolution kinetics of mineral ferric phosphate in the presence of desferrioxamine-B and oxalate ligands at pH=4–6 and T=24±0.6°C  ap. 1-8.  aFerric phosphate (FePO₄·2H₂O) is one of the most common secondary phosphate minerals in the environment. Nevertheless, few studies address the biological dissolution mechanism(s) of FePO₄·2H₂O. This paper reports steady-state dissolution rates of synthetic FePO₄·2H₂O at 4≤pH₀≤6 by desferrioxamine-B (DFO-B) and oxalate (Ox) ligands. The composition of the influent solution was 10mM NaClO₄, 5mM MES buffer. The influent solution was adjusted to 4≤pH₀≤6 by adding aliquots of HNO₃ or NaOH stock solution. The initial concentrations of DFO-B and Ox, [DFO-B]₀ and [Ox]₀, ranged from 0 to 135μM, and 0 to 345μM. Geochemical thermodynamic equilibrium modeling was conducted using MINEQL⁺ (Schecher and McAvoy, 1998). Speciation calculations were based on thermodynamic formation constants at 298.17K, K₂₉₈ (infinite dilution reference state). Ligand-promoted dissolution rates were determined after steady-state values. Iron concentrations in the effluent solution were quantified (t>500h). Typical effluent-flow rate was maintained at 0.10±0.01mLmin⁻¹. The measured dissolution rate of FePO₄·2H₂O by DFO-B and Ox, RDFO–Oₓ ᴼᵇˢ, was compared to the sum of dissolution rates by DFO-B (RDFO₋B) or Ox (ROₓ), RDFO–Oₓ Sᵘᵐ (RDFO–Oₓ Sᵘᵐ=RDFO‐B+ROₓ). Results were analyzed using the t student test. Obtained data values with p≤0.05 (⁎) and ≤0.01 (⁎⁎) were considered to differ statistically from control experiments. Dissolution rates by DFO-B (RDFO₋B) increased with [DFOB]₀, and no evidence of surface masking became apparent. By contrast, dissolution rates by Ox (ROₓ) varied with [Ox]₀ and pH₀. The kinetics of dissolution by Ox was not explained by a first-order mineral dissolution behavior. Dissolution rates by DFO-B and Ox (RDFO–Oₓ ᴼᵇˢ) surpassed RDFO₋B or ROₓ, and increased with proton activity. Reacting FePO₄·2H₂O with DFO-B and high amounts of Ox resulted in higher values for RDFO–Oₓ ᴼᵇˢ relative to RDFO₋B. Observed (RDFO–Oₓ ᴼᵇˢ) to calculated (RDFO–Oₓ Sᵘᵐ=RDFO‐B+ROₓ) ratio was found to be highest at [DFOB]₀=50μM and [Ox]₀=49μM. Increases in the proton activity favors the dissolution of FePO₄·2H₂O by DFO-B and Ox, explained because the sequestration of Fe(III) at the surface vicinity in the form of adsorbed Fe(III)-oxalate complexes. A direct comparison between the dissolution behavior of FePO₄·2H₂O by DFO-B and Ox against those for goethite (α-FeOOH) and Al goethite (AlFeOOH) was conducted. The dissolution behavior was found to be a function of the mineral structure. RDFO₋B values for FePO₄·2H₂O by 22.5μM DFO-B surpassed those for α-FeOOH or α-AlFeOOH by 20μM DFO-B, namely, 37, and 11.6 and 3–5μmolkg⁻¹h⁻¹, respectively. ROₓ values for FePO₄·2H₂O by 49mM Ox surpassed that for α-FeOOH by 70μM Ox or α-AlFeOOH by 50μM Ox, namely, i.e., 12, and 0.7 and 0.1μmolkg⁻¹h⁻¹. The latter results agree with the idea of the inhibition of Fe release in goethite because its sequestration in the form of adsorbed Fe(III) oxalate complexes. In contrast, a different scenario holds true for dissolution by 50μM DFO-B and 49μM Ox. The dissolution rates for FePO₄·2H₂O, α-FeOOH, and α-AlFeOOH correspond to 50, and 39–42 and 71–129μmolkg⁻¹h⁻¹, respectively. The high extent of iron release from Al goethite is best explained because high-energy surface sites formed after Al substitution in goethite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aferric phosphate 3agoethite 3airon 3amodels 3anitric acid 3aphosphate minerals 3asodium hydroxide 3at-test1 aKearns, Josh1 aBanfield, Jillian0 tChemical geology.g2012 Aug. 6, v. 320-321 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.x0009-25417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2012.05.0223Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03396naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009000172300001400262520236900276592002802645650001502673650001102688650001402699650002202713651001302735651001002748700001802758700002402776700002202800700002002822773008702842856008502929990002303014852000903037655001203046IND60093569020221120095838.0141103e20120806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009356902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemgeo.2012.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNelson, Wendy R.10aOsHf isotopic insight into mantle plume dynamics beneath the East African Rift System  ap. 66-79.  aWe report new Os and Hf isotopic data on mafic lavas from several key portions of the East African Rift System (EARS) with the goal of determining how contributions from various source domains influence volcanism in the evolving rift system. Our study uses picrites and basalts associated with the Afar plume in NW Ethiopia and with prolonged extension in Turkana, N Kenya, as well as mafic lavas from Kivu and Rungwe in the Western Branch of the EARS. Basalts from NW Ethiopia and Turkana have low Os concentrations (9–22ppt) and display a range of ¹⁸⁷Os/¹⁸⁸Os (0.1239–0.4366). The 30Ma high-TiO₂ picrites from NW Ethiopia and 20–23Ma picrites from Turkana have higher Os concentrations (579–1120ppt) than associated basalts. Picrites from NW Ethiopia have initial ¹⁸⁷Os/¹⁸⁸Os=0.1239–0.1311 and εHf=12.0–13.4, consistent with derivation from a mantle source common to global OIB (i.e. “C”). In contrast, 20–23Ma Turkana picrites have more radiogenic initial ¹⁸⁷Os/¹⁸⁸Os (0.1450–0.1483). None of the picrites display convincing evidence for crustal or subcontinental lithospheric mantle input. Instead, the data are consistent with geochemical and geophysical models that demonstrate early evolution of the EARS was supported dynamically by geochemically distinct regions of mantle upwelling. Specifically, NW Ethiopian lavas are chemically analogous to the “C”-like Afar plume while Miocene Turkana lavas display HIMU-like geochemical features. The HIMU component in Turkana lavas can be generated by mixing ~30% ancient (1.7–2Ga) hydrothermally altered subducted oceanic crust with ~70% “C”-like mantle material (i.e. < 1Ga recycled hydrothermally altered oceanic crust). In contrast, Kivu and Rungwe lavas have low Os concentrations (3–87ppt) and more radiogenic ¹⁸⁷Os/¹⁸⁸Os (0.1615–0.3610) that appear to be dominated by contributions from metasomatized lithospheric mantle. Seismological observations indicate that there are thermochemical heterogeneities within the deep-seated African superplume; these heterogeneities are a plausible source for the ancient recycled oceanic crust contributing to Miocene volcanism in Turkana. We propose that mafic magmatism in both the Afar region and northern Kenya are derived from different portions of this long-lived thermochemical feature.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageophysics 3amodels 3arecycling 3avolcanic activity 3aEthiopia 3aKenya1 aFurman, Tanya1 avan Keken, Peter E.1 aShirey, Steven B.1 aHanan, Barry B.0 tChemical geology.g2012 Aug. 6, v. 320-321 p.66-79dElsevier B.V.x0009-25417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2012.05.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03295naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005800142245012600200500002000326520176700346592002802113650001802141650001702159650001902176650001202195650002502207650001102232650001402243650001002257650001102267650002202278650001302300650000902313650002002322650001702342650001002359650002102369650001502390651001802405700006302423700006002486700006302546773013002609856007702739852000902816655001202825IND60788132720221121175407.0220811e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078813272DNAL7 a10.1029/2019WR0264432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDenaro, Simona1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1370-176510aInsurance Portfolio Diversification Through Bundling for Competing Agents Exposed to Uncorrelated Drought and Flood Risks  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWorldwide, conflict over shared water resources is exacerbated by population growth, economic development, and climate change. In multipurpose water systems, stakeholders can face higher financial risks as a consequence of the higher costs or lower revenues arising from increased hydrological variability and recurrent extreme events. In this context, financial risk hedging tools able to bundle together the uncorrelated risks of wet and dry periods faced by different stakeholders may be an improved solution to both foster cooperation and manage the financial losses associated with extreme events. In this work, we explore the potential of risk diversification strategies, involving an index insurance contract solution, to simultaneously manage financial risk in a multipurpose water system prone to both drought and flood risk. Risk diversification can allow for reduced insurance premiums in situations in which the bundled risks are uncorrelated. Using an integrated operational and financial model, we characterize the financial risk associated with the water management policies and design a risk management strategy that bundles together the uncorrelated risk of drought and flood events. The approach is demonstrated using a case study on Lake Maggiore, a subalpine transboundary regulated lake whose management is controversial due to numerous and competing human activities. In particular, we focus on the ongoing conflict among the lake shore population, affected by flood risk, and the downstream farmers' districts, facing drought related losses. Results indicate that bundling uncorrelated risks from competing users is beneficial to both promoting insurance premium affordability and facilitating collaboration schemes at the catchment scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaffordability 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aeconomic development 3ahumans 3ainsurance 3alakes 3amodels 3apopulation growth 3aresearch 3arisk 3arisk management 3astakeholders 3awater 3awater management 3awatersheds 3aLake Maggiore1 aCastelletti, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7923-14981 aGiuliani, Matteo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4780-93471 aCharacklis, Gregory1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9882-90680 tWater resources research.g2020 May, v. 56, no. 5 p.e2019WR026443-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019WR0264433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007800169300001400247520169300261592002801954650002301982650001702005650001902022650001702041650003502058650001302093650001902106650002902125650001102154650000802165650001002173650001202183650001102195650001502206650001502221650001102236650001002247650001302257650001502270651001802285651001402303700002402317773008702341856008502428990002302513852000902536655001202545IND60093569120221120095710.0141103e20120806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009356912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemgeo.2012.05.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyu, Jong-Sik10aCO₂ evasion from the Greenland Ice Sheet: A new carbon-climate feedback  ap. 80-95.  aDecay of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) figures prominently in climate change predictions, but direct carbon cycle feedbacks are poorly constrained. Here, we show that melting of the GIS yields a previously unknown flux of CO₂ to the atmosphere, and we use a reactive-transport model to examine if, how, and to what extent this flux will change as the ice sheet decays in a warmer world. Water emerges from beneath the Isunnguata and Russell Glaciers in West Greenland with CO₂ partial pressures (pCO₂) 3 - 10× supersaturated with respect to atmospheric equilibrium. During downstream transport in the Akuliarusiarsuup Kuua River, mineral weathering sequesters 75% of the excess CO₂ as HCO₃ ⁻ – a carbon sink on human timescales – and the remaining 25% evades to the atmosphere. Scaled to all rivers draining the GIS, the evasion flux of 0.11±0.03 Tg C/year compares to fluxes reported for other rivers draining Precambrian shield crystalline rocks and having similar dissolved carbonate systematics. This flux is insufficient to influence modern-day atmospheric CO₂ levels, and we find that higher meltwater discharge alone will cause only moderate future increases. However, more substantial increases could occur if meltwaters intersect basal ice known to have elevated pCO₂ values. Worst-case model scenarios yield evasion fluxes of 100±20–170±40 Tg C/year by 2100. These atmospheric CO₂ inputs surpass those for Arctic Lakes and would augment by up to ~25% those predicted for permafrost thaw. Our findings suggest that positive feedbacks linking greenhouse gas emissions, Arctic climate change, and global warming may be stronger than previously realized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrecambrian shield 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sinks 3ageographic information systems 3aglaciers 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahumans 3aice 3alakes 3amelting 3amodels 3apermafrost 3aprediction 3arivers 3arocks 3asnowmelt 3aweathering 3aArctic region 3aGreenland1 aJacobson, Andrew D.0 tChemical geology.g2012 Aug. 6, v. 320-321 p.80-95dElsevier B.V.x0009-25417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2012.05.0243Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100006100189245008000250300001600330506007600346520102700422592002801449506003701477650002501514650002101539650002901560650001201589650001901601650001301620650000901633650001801642650001201660651001801672700002101690700002301711700002501734700002301759773010301782856008201885852000901967655001201976IND60678139720221207124920.0191213e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067813972DNAL7 a10.1007/s13280-018-01145-y2doi7 aPMC68887742pmcid7 a307712062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerlak, Andrea K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2198-667910aDams, Chinese investments, and EIAs: A race to the bottom in South America?  ap. 156-164.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe political economy of dam development in South America is changing as a result of a resurgence in water infrastructure investments. The arrival of Chinese-funded projects in the region has altered a context traditionally dominated by multilateral development banks. Tensions are escalating around new dam projects and the environmental impact assessment process is increasingly the site of politicization around water in the region. In this perspective, we examine the most recent surge in dam development in South America, the resulting environmental and social impacts, and the mobilization of civil society and environmental groups that have developed in response to these projects. In the absence of regionally shared standards for environmental assessment and regional mechanisms to mitigate the emerging conflicts—primarily occurring between companies, states, and civil society—we argue there is a risk of a race to the bottom to finance infrastructure projects with laxer environmental and social standards.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abusiness enterprises 3adams (hydrology) 3aenvironmental assessment 3afunding 3ainfrastructure 3apolitics 3arisk 3asocial impact 3asociety 3aSouth America1 aSaguier, Marcelo1 aMills-Novoa, Megan1 aFearnside, Philip M.1 aAlbrecht, Tamee R.0 tAmbio.g2020 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.156-164dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl28633x0044-74477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-018-01145-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006200142245011800204500002000322520164700342592002801989596003302017596007002050596005402120596005302174596005402227596003902281650001902320650001302339650001902352650001102371650001202382650001202394650001002406650001802416651001502434700007202449700006202521700003202583700005802615773013002673856007702803852000902880655001202889IND60788132920221120121850.0220811e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078813292DNAL7 a10.1029/2019WR0263032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGootman, Kaylyn S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7046-171610aSpatiotemporal Variability in Transport and Reactive Processes Across a First‐ to Fifth‐Order Fluvial Network  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFluvial networks integrate, transform, and transport constituents from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. To date, most research on water quality dynamics has focused on process understanding at individual streams, and, as a result, there is a lack of studies analyzing how physical and biogeochemical drivers scale across fluvial networks. We performed tracer tests in five stream orders of the Jemez River continuum in New Mexico, USA, to quantify reach‐scale hyporheic exchange during two different seasonal periods to address the following: How do hyporheic zone contributions to overall riverine processing change with space and time? And does the spatiotemporal variability of hyporheic exchange scale across fluvial networks? Combining conservative (i.e., bromide) and reactive (i.e., resazurin) tracer analyses with solute transport modeling, we found a dominance of reaction‐limited transport conditions and a decrease of the contributions of hyporheic processing across stream orders and flow regimes. Our field‐based findings suggest that achieving knowledge transferability of hyporheic processing within fluvial networks may be possible, especially when process variability is sampled across multiple stream orders and flow regimes. Therefore, we propose a shift in our traditional approach to investigating scaling patterns in transport processes, which currently relies on the interpretation of studies conducted in multiple sites (mainly in headwater streams) that are located in different fluvial networks, to a more cohesive, network‐centered investigation of processes using the same or readily comparable methods.  aPublisher supplied data  cCUAHSI Pathfinder Fellowship  aGrant Agreement 60881cEuropean Union's Seventh Framework Program  aRG 1407‐16cGeological Society of America (GSA)  aHRD‐1345169cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  aCBET‐1707042cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  cETH Zurich Postdoctoral Fellowship 3ahyporheic zone 3aresearch 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3asolutes 3astreams 3awater 3awater quality 3aNew Mexico1 aGonzález‐Pinzón, Ricardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9387-68851 aKnapp, Julia L.

In the European Union, the Regulation (EU) No. 517/2014 (F-gas Regulation) controls the use of HFCs in several applications. This paper reviews the recent investigations performed because of F-gas Regulation, with focus on lower global warming potential (GWP) synthetic alternatives. The GWP limit and the date of prohibition have an influence on the studies found for each application. The major relevance of the studies has been observed on mobile air conditioners for pure hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs), possibly caused by the earlier control. Additionally, a great number of studies have been found for stationary refrigeration systems using several mixtures and residential air conditioners using R32. An important number of articles investigate synthetic alternatives for domestic refrigerators given the flammability barriers for hydrocarbons in some countries. Despite higher GWP allowance on cascade supermarket systems, few articles are available on this topic. Given the extent of the current studies and the rate of new refrigerant developments, an increase in studies using the new synthetic mixture is expected in the coming years.  aPublisher supplied data 0aGlobal warming potential 0aHFO/HFC mixtures 0aRefrigeration 0aAir conditioning 0aF-gas regulation 0aPotentiel de réchauffement planétaire 0aMélanges HFO/HFC 0aFroid 0aConditionnement d’air 0aRèglementation F-gas1 aMakhnatch, Pavel1 aKhodabandeh, Rahmatollah0 tInternational journal of refrigeration.g2017 Oct., v. 82 p.288-301dElsevier LtdwJournal:26758x0140-70077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2017.06.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01502naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002200156245020200178300001600380520030600396592002800702650003100730650001300761650003400774650001700808700001700825700001900842700002700861700001900888700001800907773011700925856009001042990002301132852000901155655001201164IND60094994520221117213956.0141104e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009499452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2012.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoberts, Sally A.10aComparison of the MGIT TBc immunochromatographic assay with the Accuprobe Gen-Probe TB assay for identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex: results from a low-burden tuberculosis setting  ap. 415-416.  aWe compared the BD MPT64 TBc Antigen assay with the Gen-Probe TB assay for identifying Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) from liquid culture vials.

The reagent shows a differential behaviour towards mono- and di-saccharides. This phenomenon has been misinterpreted in the literature. Contrary to the facts, it has been reported that the DNS test is less sensitive for the estimation of cellobiose than it is for the estimation of glucose. This communication clarifies the concept.

The mechanisms of this regulation are not well understood. We observed that mutants that exhibited constitutively high rates of CEF also showed elevated production of H ₂O ₂. We thus tested the hypothesis that CEF can be activated by H ₂O ₂ in vivo. CEF was strongly increased by H ₂O ₂ both by infiltration or in situ production by chloroplast-localized glycolate oxidase, implying that H ₂O ₂ can activate CEF either directly by redox modulation of key enzymes, or indirectly by affecting other photosynthetic processes. CEF appeared with a half time of about 20 min after exposure to H ₂O ₂, suggesting activation of previously expressed CEF-related machinery. H ₂O ₂-dependent CEF was not sensitive to antimycin A or loss of PGR5, indicating that increased CEF probably does not involve the PGR5-PGRL1 associated pathway. In contrast, the rise in CEF was not observed in a mutant deficient in the chloroplast NADPH:PQ reductase (NDH), supporting the involvement of this complex in CEF activated by H ₂O ₂. We propose that H ₂O ₂ is a missing link between environmental stress, metabolism, and redox regulation of CEF in higher plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achloroplasts 3aenergy 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aphotosystem I 0acyclic electron flow 0aphotosynthesis 0areactive oxygen species 0astress 0ahydrogen peroxide1 aLivingston, Aaron K.1 aSatoh-Cruz, Mio1 aFroehlich, John E.1 aMaurino, Veronica G.1 aKramer, David M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Apr. 28, v. 112, no. 17 p.5539-5544dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14182231123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245012400163300001800287500001900305520122300324592002801547650001401575650002201589650001501611650001801626650002101644700002101665700002201686700002501708700001901733700002101752700001701773700002101790700002201811700001601833700007201849700006201921700002001983700005802003773014702061856007602208852000902284655001202293IND60688127020210423000000.0200408e20200314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068812702DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b136202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarges, Johannes10aRationally Designed Long-Wavelength Absorbing Ru(II) Polypyridyl Complexes as Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy  ap. 6578-6587.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe utilization of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of various types of cancer has gained increasing attention over the last decades. Despite the clinical success of approved photosensitizers (PSs), their application is sometimes limited due to poor water solubility, aggregation, photodegradation, and slow clearance from the body. To overcome these drawbacks, research efforts are devoted toward the development of metal complexes and especially Ru(II) polypyridine complexes based on their attractive photophysical and biological properties. Despite the recent research developments, the vast majority of complexes utilize blue or UV-A light to obtain a PDT effect, limiting the penetration depth inside tissues and, therefore, the possibility to treat deep-seated or large tumors. To circumvent these drawbacks, we present the first example of a DFT guided search for efficient PDT PSs with a substantial spectral red shift toward the biological spectral window. Thanks to this design, we have unveiled a Ru(II) polypyridine complex that causes phototoxicity in the very low micromolar to nanomolar range at clinically relevant 595 nm, in monolayer cells as well as in 3D multicellular tumor spheroids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aneoplasms 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotolysis 3aphototoxicity 3awater solubility1 aHeinemann, Franz1 aJakubaszek, Marta1 aMaschietto, Federica1 aSubecz, Chloé1 aDotou, Mazzarine1 aVinck, Robin1 aBlacque, Olivier1 aTharaud, Mickaël1 aGoud, Bruno1 aViñuelas Zahı́nos, Emilio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0634-18291 aSpingler, Bernhard1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3402-20161 aCiofini, Ilaria1 aGasser, Gilles1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4244-50970 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 Mar. 14, v. 142, no. 14 p.6578-6587dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b136203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01992naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245014500164300002000309520091700329592002801246650001201274650001801286650001401304650002301318650002501341650001701366650001201383650001401395700002101409700001701430773012401447856007401571852000901645655001201654IND60669001920221119143649.0190920e20150715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066900192DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra09671e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBagdi, Prasanta Ray10aSynthesis of 2-triazolyl-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine through a one-pot three-component reaction using a nano copper oxide assisted click-catalyst  ap. 61337-61344.  aThe syntheses of 2-triazolyl imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (8a–o) were accomplished through three component A³ coupling followed by 5-exo dig cyclisation by employing 1-alkyl-1,2,3-triazole-4-carbaldehyde, amidine and terminal alkynes using 5 mol% nanocopper oxide together with 10 mol% sodium ascorbate as a click-catalyst in ethanol at 70 °C. The present protocol was further utilized for the synthesis of 2-(2-triazolyl-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3-yl)ethanol (9a–e). In addition, the molecular structure of 8c possesses a C–H⋯π interaction (H17b⋯C10) along with a peculiar supramolecular layered structure architecture. This protocol features ready recyclability of the catalyst, good yields and wide substrate scope. Moreover, the syntheses of triazolyl precursors (1-alkyl-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methanol (4a–f) have also been achieved through a nano copper oxide mediated click-catalyst in water at 70 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3aascorbic acid 3acatalysts 3achemical structure 3acopper nanoparticles 3acupric oxide 3aethanol 3apyridines1 aBasha, R.

RHA 464, a newly released sunflower male fertility restorer line, is resistant to both of the most predominant and most virulent rust races identified in the Northern Great Plains of the USA. The gene conditioning rust resistance in RHA 464 originated from wild Helianthus annuus L., but has not been molecularly marked or determined to be independent from other rust loci. The objectives of this study are to identify molecular markers linked to the rust resistance gene and to investigate the allelism of this gene with the unmapped rust resistance genes present in HA-R6, HA-R8 and RHA 397. Virulence phenotypes of seedlings for the F₂ population and F₂:₃ families suggested that a single dominant gene confers rust resistance in RHA 464, and this gene was designated as R ₁₂ . Bulked segregant analysis identified ten markers polymorphic between resistant and susceptible bulks. In subsequent genetic mapping, the ten markers covered 33.4 cM of genetic distance on linkage group 11 of sunflower. A co-dominant marker CRT275-11 is the closest marker distal to R ₁₂ with a genetic distance of 1.0 cM, while ZVG53, a dominant marker linked in the repulsion phase, is proximal to R ₁₂ with a genetic distance of 9.6 cM. The allelism test demonstrated that R ₁₂ is not allelic to the rust resistance genes in HA-R6, HA-R8 and RHA 397, and it is also not linked to any previously mapped rust resistance genes. Discovery of the R ₁₂ novel rust resistance locus in sunflower and associated markers will potentially support the molecular marker-assisted introgression and pyramiding of R ₁₂ into sunflower breeding lines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3aPuccinia helianthi 3aallelism 3abreeding lines 3achromosome mapping 3adominant genes 3agenetic distance 3agenetic markers 3aintrogression 3alinkage groups 3aloci 3amale fertility 3aphenotype 3araces 3arestorer lines 3aseed quality 3aseed yield 3aseedlings 3avirulence 3aGreat Plains region 3aUnited States1 aHulke, B.

Micro-/nanobubbles (MNBs) as a novel strategy can effectively inhibit adhesion of pollutants during the treatment processes. The introduction of MNBs technology into membrane separation systems can be a worthy research topic for membrane antifouling. In the current study, it was found that the MNBs displayed significant effects on membrane permeability, rejection performance and especially antifouling performance. The experimental results confirmed that the MNBs effectively improved the permeability of membranes during the filtration processes. The separation tests showed that the MNBs can delay the flux attenuation and promote antifouling ability of 165.9%. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) results indicated that the pollutants tended to larger size particles which can be attributed to the agglomeration effect of MNBs. The MNBs served as a “gas bridge” between pollutants and membrane surface therefore can efficiently prevent the adhesions of pollutants. The MNBs technology with “gas bridge” effects can provides a novel strategy for membrane fouling control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aantifouling activities 3aenergy 3afiltration 3aindustry 3amembrane permeability 3ananoparticles 0aMicro-/nanobubble 0aMembrane fouling 0aAgglomeration effect 0aGas bridge 0aAntifouling1 aHuang, Zhengyi1 aLin, Hongjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0877-81891 aShen, Liguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9730-34511 aGao, Chuanyang1 aZhou, Guoqing1 aHu, Jun1 aYang, Haijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2921-78391 aXu, Faliang0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Nov. 20, v. 376 p.134331-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1343313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03285naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024002800134024002300162024004000185024002500225040001800250100006000268245008300328300001600411500002000427520158400447592002802031650002402059650004102083650003002124650001802154650001402172650001502186650001402201650001502215650002402230650001502254650001002269651001002279651001202289700001902301700006002320700006102380773012702441856011402568856007502682961001302757852000902770655001202779IND60701981020221214223514.0220820e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070198102DNAL7 a3682212aris7 a10113/70198102hdl7 a10.1002/plr2.200452doi7 a3682212seq_no_1157 a2080-21000-018-00D2aris_project_no7 a4359772aris_accn_no  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJensen, Kevin B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5560-039410a‘AlkarXL’, a new tall wheatgrass cultivar for use on saline semiarid lands  ap. 298-305.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe USDA announces the release of cultivar ‘AlkarXL’ (Reg. no. CV‐286, PI 691611) tall wheatgrass [Thinopyrum ponticum (Podp.) Barkworth & D. R. Dewey] for use on semiarid rangelands and irrigated pastures that receive a minimum of 350 mm of average annual precipitation on alkali soils. AlkarXL is a 10‐clone synthetic that originated from 56 plant introductions from the National Plant Germplasm System plus the cultivar Alkar. AlkarXL has undergone phenotypic recurrent selection for visual plant vigor (first cycle), seed yield (first cycle), dry‐matter yield (DMY) (second cycle), and crude protein (second cycle). The 10 genotypes traced to PI 255146 (two genotypes; 30%, Turkey), PI 308592 (10%, Italy), PI 442631 (10%, Turkey), PI 109542 (10%, Turkey), PI 255443 (10%, Turkey), PI 383545 (10%, Turkey), PI 401006 (Turkey), PI 401009 (10%, Turkey), and W6 21870 (10%, Ukraine). Morphologically, AlkarXL has significantly wider lemmas and glumes and shorter glumes than cultivars Alkar, Greenstar, Jose, Largo, and Szarvasi‐1. AlkarXL had narrower flag leaves than Largo. AlkarXL had more seedlings (P < .05) emerge than Alkar at Lages Junction, NV. AlkarXL had greater (P < .05) plant persistence (plant frequency) 3 (2017), 4 (2018), and 5 (2019) yr after seeding at Lages Junction than did Alkar. Dry‐matter yield was less descriptive due to large variations in DMY among replications. AlkarXL had significantly (P < .10) more total DMY than Greenstar and Largo at Millville, UT, and similar DMY as Greenstar, Jose, and Savarsi‐1 at Panguitch, UT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThinopyrum ponticum 3aUSDA National Plant Germplasm System 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acrude protein 3acultivars 3airrigation 3aphenotype 3arangelands 3arecurrent selection 3aseed yield 3avigor 3aItaly 3aUkraine1 aPearse, Gordon1 aLarson, Steve R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2742-21341 aRobins, Joseph G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7818-889X0 tJournal of plant registrations.g2020 Sept., v. 14, no. 3 p.298-305dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:6195x1936-52097nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/70198103Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/plr2.200453Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02218naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245009000175300001800265520129100283592002801574650001301602650001901615650000901634650002001643650001501663650001301678650001201691773012201703856008201825852000901907655001201916IND60548196120221122093320.0220430e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054819612DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-008-2780-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakraborty, Akshoy Kr.10aReaction study of various mixtures of tetra ethyl ortho silicate and aluminum nitrate  ap. 5376-5384.  aSeveral studies on the formation of amorphous aluminosilicate phase during heating slow hydrolysis (SH) or Type 1 mullite gel prior to formation of 2:1 mullite is briefly reviewed. Tetra ethyl ortho silicate (TEOS) and aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (ANN) are isothermally heated on water bath at 80 °C. It has been shown that these react in an exothermic manner. The resultant isothermally heated gel (ISG) removes organics, moisture on heating and forms alumino silicate (A) precursor phase. Among the various mixtures of the two components, the batch composition corresponds to Al/Si ratio of 3/1 generates highest evolution of heat which suggests that precursor analogous to the composition of 3:2 mullite is most stable. Slow hydrolysis gels of different Al₂O₃:SiO₂ ratios synthesized out of similar sources exhibit 980 °C exotherm on DTA analysis which is a function of Al₂O₃ content. The highest exotherm is observed for the gel/precursor analogous to the same composition of the batch synthesized above by isothermal condition. Corroborating heat evolution behavior of ISG gels with DTA analysis of SH gels, it is suggested that the various compositions of intermediate aluminosilicate (A) phase may form. The composition corresponds to 3:2 mullite may be most stable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aaluminum oxide 3agels 3aheat production 3ahydrolysis 3anitrates 3asilicon0 tJournal of materials science.g2008 Aug., v. 43, no. 15 p.5376-5384dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-008-2780-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04034naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002600164245011600190300001600306500001500322520175900337592002802096650001402124650001802138650001602156650001402172650001402186650002402200650001002224650001002234650001302244650001202257650002002269650001902289650001602308650004502324650002002369650002402389650003002413650001402443650001902457650002502476650001202501650002702513650002102540650004102561650004102602650001602643650002502659650002802684650002102712650002602733650001402759650003002773650004602803650002902849650003402878650008502912650002702997651000903024651000903033653001603042700002503058700001603083700002303099773009703122856004803219852000903267655001203276IND4450756120221120124938.0121003e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445075612DNAL7 a210610212pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-010-2137-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMotamedi, Gholam Reza10aUltrastructural and molecular characterization of Sarcocystis isolated from camel (Camelus dromedarius) in Iran  ap. 949-954.  a2019-12-06  aSarcocystis cameli was first described in one-humped camels (Camelus dromedarius), and it is the only species which have so far reported in camels. Although more than 150 species of Sarcocystis were described in various animals, only a few data on camel Sarcocystis ultrastructure were published, and this report is the first for molecular information (DNA sequence and RLFP digestion pattern). The main objective of the present work is to characterize Sarcocystis isolated from camels by electron microscopy and PCR-RFLP methods. Muscle samples were taken from the fresh esophagus, diaphragm, skeletal muscles, and heart of one-humped camels (C. dromedarius) slaughtered in abattoirs of Tehran and Ghazvin provinces, Iran. The dissection and trypsin digestion techniques were applied for the detection of the cysts. The infected samples were fixed in glutaraldehyde and/or frozen at −20°C until use for ultrastructural and molecular studies, respectively. The ultrastructural and molecular studies were carried out contemporaneously. The 18S rRNA gene of the parasites was amplified by PCR. The PCR products were cloned into a pTZ57R/T and sequenced. In addition, the PCR products were digested separately with each of the four restriction enzymes for RFLP. Our results indicated that only microcysts were observed in muscle samples. The microcysts were white, elongated, spindled, and a few spiral-shaped, with mean size 260 × 75 μm which are identical with S. cameli. The ultrastructure of microcyst wall had many non-branched finger-like protrusions irregularly folded. There was a 600-bp specific band amplified after PCR with specific primers. The molecular data for camel Sarcocystis is reported for the first time in Iran and the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aparasites 3aribosomal RNA 3aDNA primers 3adiaphragm 3adigestion 3aCamelus dromedarius 3agenes 3aheart 3afreezing 3atrypsin 3askeletal muscle 3aglutaraldehyde 3aSarcocystis 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aslaughterhouses 3aelectron microscopy 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aesophagus 3aultrastructure 3anucleotide sequences 2aAnimals 2aCamelusxparasitology. 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA, Protozoanxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGenes, rRNA 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Typing 2aMusclesxparasitology 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aRNA, Protozoanxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 18Sxgenetics 2aSarcocystisxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxultrastructure. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aIran 0aIran 0adromedaries1 aDalimi, Abdolhossein1 aNouri, Abas1 aAghaeipour, Khosro0 tParasitology research.g2011 Apr., v. 108, no. 4 p.949-954dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-010-2137-y  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011800169300001600287520165900303592002801962650001201990650002102002650001102023650001102034650002202045650000902067650001402076650001102090650002602101650002302127650001402150650001502164650001602179650003302195650001702228650002202245650001402267650000902281700006602290700001602356773012802372856008202500852000902582655001202591IND60630529320221121041131.0190817e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063052932DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-018-3814-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohseni, Roshanak10aNickel uptake mechanisms in two Iranian nickel hyperaccumulators, Odontarrhena bracteata and Odontarrhena inflata  ap. 263-269.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Mechanisms and transporters responsible for Ni uptake in plants are largely unknown. To characterize Ni uptake mechanisms in Ni hyperaccumulators, we compared the effects of channel blockers, high Ca, high Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, or Co, and low temperature on Ni uptake in two Iranian serpentine endemics, Odontarrhena bracteata and (two populations of) O. inflata. METHODS: Ni uptake was measured in the presence and absence of the K and Ca channel blockers, tetraethylammonium (TEA) and verapamil, respectively, at high and low Ca, and with and without (additional) Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn or Co (100 μM) in the nutrient solution. To estimate the potential contribution of passive uptake, Ni uptake was also measured at low and high temperature (4 and 25 °C). RESULTS: Verapamil inhibited Ni uptake by 65, 72, and 91% in O. bracteata, O. inflata from Baneh, and O. inflata from Marivan, respectively, but TEA was without effect. High Ca inhibited Ni uptake by 30 to 40%. Mn inhibited Ni uptake by about 40% in all species/populations. Fe inhibited Ni uptake, by about 30%, in O. bracteata, but not at all in O. inflata. Other metals had no effect. Low temperature decreased Ni uptake by ±70% in both species/populations. CONCLUSIONS: In Odontarrhena Ni hyperaccumulators Ni is predominantly taken up via Ca channels. A Fe-deficiency inducible transporter contributes to Ni uptake in O. bracteata, but not in O. inflata. A relative small part of the Ni uptake in O. inflata (10–30%) remains unexplained. In any case, it is most probably neither mediated by apoplastic transport, nor by more or less specific transporters of Zn, Fe, Mn, or Co.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acalcium channels 3acobalt 3acopper 3ahyperaccumulators 3airon 3amanganese 3anickel 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutrient solutions 3apotassium 3aserpentine 3atemperature 3atetraethylammonium compounds 3atransporters 3auptake mechanisms 3averapamil 3azinc1 aGhaderian, Seyed Majid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2965-51531 aSchat, Henk0 tPlant and soil.g2019 Jan., v. 434, no. 1-2 p.263-269dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-018-3814-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03427naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245007500164300001200239520186700251592002802118596003202146596004802178650001202226650001802238650001002256650001402266650002502280650001002305650002202315650001502337650001702352650002202369650001402391650002502405651001302430700001602443700002302459700002702482700001602509700001702525700001902542700002602561700001802587700002502605700001802630700002402648773013302672856008302805852000902888655001202897IND60753521920221116141255.0220109e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075352192DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-021-02949-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Farhad10aMitochondrial phylogenetic and diversity analysis in Azi-Kheli buffalo  ap. 512.  aNOVELTY STATEMENT: The present study was conducted for the first time in Pakistan to investigate Cytochrome C Oxidase Subunit 1 (CO1) gene and full-length Displacement Loop (D-loop) region of mitochondrial DNA in Azi-Kheli buffalo breed native to northern hilly areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan. The present study was designed to investigate phylogeny and diversity in Azi-Kheli buffalo, through two mitochondrial DNA regions, i.e., Cytochrome C Oxidase Subunit-I (CO1) and Displacement Loop (D-loop) region. Thirty (30) blood samples were taken from Azi-Kheli pure breed animals from original breeding tract, i.e., Khwazakhela, Swat. Polymerase chain reactions using gene-specific primers were carried out for amplifying 709-bp region of CO1 gene and 1159-bp region of D-Loop for identification, phylogeny, and diversity in Azi-Kheli buffalo, respectively. The sequences of CO1 gene revealed four (04) haplotypes, whereas D-loop sequences revealed five (05) haplotypes. Mean interspecific diversity with related species was 2.56%, and mean intraspecific diversity within Azi-Kheli buffalo was 0.25%, estimated via Kimura-2 parameter. Phylogenetic tree (maximum likelihood) revealed clustering of Azi-Kheli haplotypes with river buffalo and is distinct from swamp buffalo and other related species of genus Bubalus. Mean haplotype and nucleotide diversity of D-loop were Hd = 0.9601 ± SD = 0.096 and π = 0.01208 ± SD = 0.00182, respectively. Phylogenetic tree (neighbor-joining) revealed two main clades, i.e., river buffalo and swamp buffalo clade. The haplotypes of Azi-Kheli clustered with haplotypes of different river buffalo breeds at different positions. The current study suggests that Azi-Kheli has common origin with other river buffalo breeds; hence, it is river buffalo which harbors high genetic diversity.  aPublisher supplied data  a36/170091cADP CCGR Project  aNillcDG(R), L&DD, Department, KP, Pakistan 3aBubalus 3aanimal health 3ablood 3abuffaloes 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3aphylogeny 3astatistical analysis 3aPakistan1 aAhmad, Ijaz1 aAli, Muhammad Ijaz1 aRiaz, Muhammad Hasnain1 aKhan, Nadar1 aUllah, Obaid1 aHassan, Faizul1 aSuhail, Syed Muhammad1 aKhan, Rajwali1 aKhan, Muhammad Tahir1 aAhmad, Irshad1 aZeb, Muhammad Tariq0 tTropical animal health and production.g2021 Oct., v. 53, no. 5 p.512-512dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-021-02949-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245014900212300001800361500001100379520106300390592002801453596003801481596006101519596006101580596006401641596006401705650001101769650001301780650003101793650002101824650001501845650001701860650001401877650002901891700005701920700005901977700005702036700005602093700005502149773015002204856008202354852000902436655001202445IND60647786520221119134327.0190621e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064778652DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-019-03082-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRayner, Stephanie L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1590-007110aUsing proteomics to identify ubiquitin ligase–substrate pairs: how novel methods may unveil therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases  ap. 2499-2510.  aReview  aUbiquitin ligases play an integral role in fine-tuning signaling cascades necessary for normal cell function. Aberrant regulation of ubiquitin ligases has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, generally, due to mutations within the E3 ligase itself. Several proteomic-based methods have recently emerged to facilitate the rapid identification of ligase–substrate pairs—a previously challenging feat due to the transient nature of ligase–substrate interactions. These novel methods complement standard immunoprecipitations (IPs) and include proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID), ubiquitin ligase–substrate trapping, tandem ubiquitin-binding entities (TUBEs), and a molecular trapping unit known as the NEDDylator. The implementation of these techniques is expected to facilitate the rapid identification of novel substrates of E3 ubiquitin ligases, a process that is likely to enhance our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases and highlight novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.  aPublisher supplied data  aGIA 1638cCure for MND Foundation  aAPP1095215cNational Health and Medical Research Council  aAPP1107644cNational Health and Medical Research Council  a1628cMotor Neurone Disease Research Institute of Australia  a1715cMotor Neurone Disease Research Institute of Australia 3abiotin 3amutation 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aprecipitin tests 3aproteomics 3atherapeutics 3aubiquitin 3aubiquitin-protein ligase1 aMorsch, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9484-80501 aMolloy, Mark P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4679-58681 aShi, Bingyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1043-31631 aChung, Roger1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9286-947X1 aLee, Albert1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5156-05670 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2019 July, v. 76, no. 13 p.2499-2510dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-019-03082-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03074naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245012300164300001800287520154200305592002801847650002201875650002501897650003801922650002501960650002401985650001002009650001202019650002402031650002202055650001702077650001102094650001102105650001102116650001702127650001502144650001602159650001702175700002102192700001902213700002202232700002102254700002502275700002802300700003102328773012602359856007402485852000902559655001202568IND60749230320221121004123.0210901e20210831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074923032DNAL7 a10.1039/d1fo01177d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Hawary, Seham S.10aAnti-Alzheimer chemical constituents of Morus macroura Miq.: chemical profiling, in silico and in vitro investigations  ap. 8078-8089.  aHerein, we investigated both fruits and leaves of Morus macroura Miq. as a potential source of bioactive compounds against Alzheimer's disease (AD). LC-HRMS-assisted chemical profiling of its extracts showed that they are a rich source of diverse phytochemicals. Among the 29 identified compounds in both the fruit and leaf extracts, moracin D, chrysin, resveratrol, and ferulic acid were predicted to pass the human blood–brain barrier (BBB), and hence, reach their therapeutic targets in the brain. Subsequently, these compounds were subjected to a comprehensive pharmacophore-based screening for their protein targets relevant to AD using two independent software programs (i.e. Swiss Target Prediction and PharmMapper). The results of this initial virtual screening were further refined by a number of docking and molecular dynamic simulation experiments to suggest a number of crucial AD-related proteins (e.g. acetylcholine esterase, β-secretase, and monoamine oxidase) as potential targets for these compounds. Finally, in vitro testing was performed to validate the in silico investigation's results, where chrysin, resveratrol, and ferulic acid were found to inhibit the predicted AD-related enzymes with IC₅₀ values comparable with those of the reference inhibitors. Additionally, they were able to inhibit the aggregation of amyloid-beta, one of the hallmarks in AD pathogenesis, and to exhibit considerable antioxidant capacity. Our results highlighted Morus macroura compounds as future anti-Alzheimer chemical leads.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aamine oxidase (flavin-containing) 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain 3achrysin 3acomputer simulation 3acomputer software 3aferulic acid 3afruits 3ahumans 3aleaves 3apathogenesis 3aprediction 3aresveratrol 3atherapeutics1 aSayed, Ahmed M.,1 aIssa, Marwa Y.1 aEbrahim, Hanaa S.1 aAlaaeldin, Rania1 aElrehany, Mahmoud A.1 aAbd El-Kadder, Essam M.1 aAbdelmohsen, Usama Ramadan0 tFood & function.g2021 Aug. 31, v. 12, no. 17 p.8078-8089dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo01177d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03873naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001500169245016100184300001800345520188600363592002802249650001502277650001502292650001302307650001902320650001202339650001102351650001902362650002502381650001802406650001302424650000702437650001902444650001102463650001502474650000902489650003002498650001502528650003002543650006802573650002202641650002402663650005202687650003502739650002502774650001802799650002402817650003102841650008702872650003202959650002002991700001503011700001903026700001703045773009203062856008403154852000903238655001203247IND60088280220221116193151.0141102e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008828022DNAL7 a226875222pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2012.05.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖnnby, L.10aPolymer composite adsorbents using particles of molecularly imprinted polymers or aluminium oxide nanoparticles for treatment of arsenic contaminated waters  ap. 4111-4120.  aRemoval of As(V) by adsorption from water solutions was studied using three different synthetic adsorbents. The adsorbents, (a) aluminium nanoparticles (Alu-NPs, <50 nm) incorporated in amine rich cryogels (Alu-cryo), (b) molecular imprinted polymers (<38 μm) in polyacrylamide cryogels (MIP-cryo) and (c) thiol functionalised cryogels (SH-cryo) were evaluated regarding material characteristics and arsenic removal in batch test and continuous mode. Results revealed that a composite design with particles incorporated in cryogels was a successful means for applying small particles (nano- and micro- scale) in water solutions with maintained adsorption capacity and kinetics. Low capacity was obtained from SH-cryo and this adsorbent was hence excluded from the study. The adsorption capacities for the composites were 20.3 ± 0.8 mg/g adsorbent (Alu-cryo) and 7.9 ± 0.7 mg/g adsorbent (MIP-cryo) respectively. From SEM images it was seen that particles were homogeneously distributed in Alu-cryo and heterogeneously distributed in MIP-cryo. The particle incorporation increased the mechanical stability and the polymer backbones of pure polyacrylamide (MIP-cryo) were of better stability than the amine containing polymer backbone (Alu-cryo). Both composites worked well in the studied pH range of pH 2–8. Adsorption tested in real wastewater spiked with arsenic showed that co-ions (nitrate, sulphate and phosphate) affected arsenic removal for Alu-cryo more than for MIP-cryo. Both composites still adsorbed well in the presence of counter-ions (copper and zinc) present at low concentrations (μg/l). The unchanged and selective adsorption in realistic water observed for MIP-cryo was concluded to be due to a successful imprinting, here controlled using a non-imprinted polymer (NIP). A development of MIP-cryo is needed, considering its low adsorption capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3aaluminum oxide 3aarsenic 3acopper 3aimage analysis 3amolecular imprinting 3ananoparticles 3anitrates 3apH 3apolyacrylamide 3athiols 3awastewater 3azinc 2aAcrylic Resinsxchemistry 2aAdsorption 2aAluminum Oxidexchemistry 2aArsenicxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacokinetics. 2aCopperxchemistry 2aCryogelsxchemistry 2aMetal Nanoparticlesxchemistryxultrastructure. 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aMolecular Imprinting 2aParticle Size 2aPolymersxchemistry 2aReproducibility of Results 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacokinetics. 2aWater Purificationxmethods 2aZincxchemistry1 aPakade, V.1 aMattiasson, B.1 aKirsebom, H.0 tWater research.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 46, no. 13 p.4111-4120dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2012.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01828naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009300171300001400264520071200278592002800990650001701018650001101035650002001046650002001066650002501086651001001111651001301121653000801134653000801142653000801150653002101158653002001179653002901199700002201228773009701250856008601347852000901433655001201442IND60597208020221120182358.0190718e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059720802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2018.05.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteinkamp, Sven10aSystemic crisis and growth revisited: Has the global financial crisis marked a new era ?  ap. 50-54.  aOccasional crises have been shown to be part of growth enhancing mechanism (see Rancière, Tornell and Westermann, 2008).

Callus tissue, the key product of somatic embryogenesis, grows over a tree wound under ex vitro conditions. Callus tissue can be used in research in areas such as pathogenic susceptibility at the embryonic level, effect of heavy metals, influence of low temperatures (cryopreservation), production of secondary metabolites and transformation of plants. Callus of arborescent plants can be induced in vitro by fungal elicitors to produce secondary metabolites for pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries and are strongly repellant to herbivores and can thus act to protect forests. Analyses of dual cultures demonstrated that callus tissue exposed to a pathogenic fungus responds by synthesizing low-molecular-mass proteins belonging to an immune protein class. Cryopreservation of embryonic callus tissue also has broad applications, e.g., for valuable plant genotypes in gene banks. Without strategies to protect forests against stress factors, forest ecosystems will degrade to the detriment of all life, including humans. In vitro biotechnological research using callus tissue contributes to progress in forestry and the disciplines of ecology, physiology, phytopathology, culture and selection of plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3acallus 3acryopreservation 3aecophysiology 3aelicitors 3aforest ecosystems 3aforestry 3aforests 3afungi 3agene banks 3agenotype 3aheavy metals 3aherbivores 3ahumans 3aindustry 3aplant pathology 3aproteins 3asecondary metabolites 3asomatic embryogenesis 3atemperature 3atissue culture 3atrees 3avirulent strains1 aPietrzykowski, Marcin0 tJournal of forestry research.g2019 Aug., v. 30, no. 4 p.1159-1166dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000106x1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-018-0835-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03732naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011400168520207800282592002802360650002002388650001702408650000802425650001202433650001902445650002202464650001402486650002002500650001602520650001202536650001802548650001502566650002102581650002102602650001902623650001702642650001002659650000902669650002002678650001502698650001902713653000902732653001602741653001502757653001802772653002002790700001302810700001702823700001602840700001702856700001802873700001502891700001602906773011302922856008603035852000903121655001203130IND60794985320221122003218.0221004e20221120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079498532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1343432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yujing10aOdor characteristics and health risks during food waste bioconversion by housefly (Musca domestica L.) larvae  aBioconversion by housefly (Musca domestica L.) larvae is a novel technology for reducing and recycling food waste. In this study, odor characteristics and health risks of gaseous pollutants from food waste bioconversion by housefly larvae were investigated and compared with other treatment technologies for the first time. Air samples were collected from different areas in a full-scale food waste bioconversion facility (50 t/d). The chemical compositions of the air samples were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed, the odor contribution and annoyance were assessed with the odor activity values and their sum, and the health risks (carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks via inhalation and other risks) were evaluated. The total concentrations of volatile compounds were significantly higher in the breeding and biodegradation areas than in the other areas. Ethanol was the dominant odorant in the unloading, pretreatment, substrate storage, and breeding areas, while that was ammonia in the biodegradation and product areas. The sums of odor activity values in the breeding and biodegradation areas were the highest (1171 and 756, respectively) with trimethylamine as the key odorant. Carcinogenic risk in the breeding area was unacceptable with acetaldehyde as the key carcinogen, and possible carcinogenic risks existed in the other areas except for the substrate storage area. Non-carcinogenic risk existed in the order of breeding area > biodegradation area > product area > pretreatment area with acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonia as the dominant contributors. The bioconversion technology showed different odor characteristics and health risks from other treatment technologies. Therefore, odor control and health protection measures should be taken based on the odor and health risk evaluation, especially in the breeding area. Suggestions on gas collection and treatment method selection were proposed. The findings provide a scientific basis for odor control and health protection in food waste bioconversion facilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMusca domestica 3aacetaldehyde 3aair 3aammonia 3abiodegradation 3abiotransformation 3abreathing 3acarcinogenicity 3acarcinogens 3aethanol 3aethyl acetate 3afood waste 3ahealth promotion 3ahydrogen sulfide 3aodor compounds 3aodor control 3aodors 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3atechnology 3atrimethylamine 0aOdor 0aHealth risk 0aFood waste 0aBioconversion 0aHousefly larvae1 aLu, Fan,1 aKang, Xinyue1 aXu, Xiangyu1 aChen, Wenwen1 aChai, Honghui1 aZhang, Hua1 aHe, Pinjing0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Nov. 20, v. 376 p.134343-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1343433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03278naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002400192245008200216300001600298506007600314520152700390592002801917506003701945650001701982650002201999650001802021650002202039650001802061650002002079650001202099650001702111650001902128650001702147650001502164650002702179650001402206650000902220650001302229650001302242650001402255650001502269653001702284653001702301653001602318653001502334653001502349700002102364700002302385700001702408700002302425700001902448773011402467856008602581852000902667655001202676IND60633358620221207133502.0190906e20190328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063335862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2019.02.0092doi7 aPMC66363362pmcid7 a307714122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStephens, Calvin J.10aLong-term correction of hemophilia B using adenoviral delivery of CRISPR/Cas9  ap. 128-141.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHemophilia B (HB) is a life-threatening inherited disease caused by mutations in the FIX gene, leading to reduced protein function and abnormal blood clotting. Due to its monogenic nature, HB is one of the primary targets for gene therapy. Indeed, successful correction of HB has been shown in clinical trials using gene therapy approaches. However, application of these strategies to non-adult patients is limited due to high cell turnover as young patients develop, resulting in vector dilution and subsequent loss of therapeutic expression. Gene editing can potentially overcome this issue by permanently inserting the corrective gene. Integration allows replication of the therapeutic transgene at every cell division and can avoid issues associated with vector dilution. In this study, we explored adenovirus as a platform for corrective CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knock-in. We determined as a proof-of-principle that adenoviral delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 is capable of corrective gene addition, leading to long-term augmentation of FIX activity and phenotypic correction in a murine model of juvenile HB. While we found on-target error-free integration in all examined samples, some mice also contained mutations at the integration target site. Additionally, we detected adaptive immune responses against the vector and Cas9 nuclease. Overall, our findings show that the adenovirus platform is suitable for gene insertion in juveniles with inherited disease, suggesting this approach may be applicable to other diseases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAdenoviridae 3aadaptive immunity 3aanimal models 3ablood coagulation 3acell division 3aclinical trials 3aenzymes 3agene editing 3agene targeting 3agene therapy 3ahemophilia 3ainheritance (genetics) 3ajuveniles 3amice 3amutation 3apatients 3aphenotype 3atransgenes 0aGene therapy 0aGene editing 0aCRISPR/Cas9 0aHemophilia 0aAdenovirus1 aLauron, Elvin J.1 aKashentseva, Elena1 aLu, Zhi Hong1 aYokoyama, Wayne M.1 aCuriel, David,0 tJournal of controlled release.g2019 Mar. 28, v. 298 p.128-141dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2019.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01964naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245007100154300002000225520088700245592002801132650001501160650001501175650001901190650002201209650001301231650001301244650001601257650001301273650000901286650000701295650001501302650002301317700001401340700001701354773012401371856007401495852000901569655001201578IND60669002420221119144115.0190920e20150803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066900242DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra09684g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shi10aGraphene-decorated porous ceramics for efficient removal of Cr(vi)  ap. 65982-65990.  aPorous ceramics (such as activated alumina (AA)) is a common adsorbent material in water purification. Its purifying capacity can be greatly improved through modification of porous ceramics. In this paper, a facile method has been established to prepare a graphene-decorated porous ceramic (GDPC) material. Citric acid (CA) was absorbed into the inner surface of the porous ceramics and transformed to graphene via sintering. The as-prepared material showed excellent adsorption capacity for chromium (Cr(vi)) over a wide range of pH (2 to 10) compared with the blank sample. The maximum uptake capacity for Cr(vi) exceed 699.43 mg g⁻¹. UV and ICP-OES tests indicated that chromium ions in aqueous solution were completely removed via the GDPC. Thus the GDPC could be a potential adsorbent for the environmental cleanup, especially for the chromium-contained wastewater disposal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaluminum oxide 3aaqueous solutions 3aceramics 3achromium 3acitric acid 3agraphene 3aions 3apH 3awastewater 3awater purification1 aYang, Wen1 aChen, Guohua0 tRSC advances.g2015 Aug. 03, v. 5, no. 81 p.65982-65990dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra09684g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01815naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010600164300001800270520085000288592002801138650001101166650001301177650001801190650001301208650001101221700001601232700001901248700002101267773012201288856008201410852000901492655001201501IND60548196720221122065820.0220430e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054819672DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-008-2741-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyu, Taegong10aTungsten carbide nanopowder by plasma-assisted chemical vapor synthesis from WCl6–CH4–H2 mixtures  ap. 5185-5192.  aNanosized tungsten carbide powder was prepared by a thermal plasma process using tungsten hexachloride (WCl₆) as the precursor.

The effects of the molar ratio of reactant gases, plasma torch power, the flow rate of plasma gas, and the addition of secondary plasma gas (H₂) on the product composition and grain size were investigated. The tungsten carbide powder produced by the plasma process showed particle sizes less than 20 nm. The produced powder was heated in hydrogen to fully carburize the WC₁₋ₓ, and W₂C phases to the WC phase as well as to remove excess carbon in the product.

This requires the quantification of stand structure and species diversity. In this study, species distribution, association and size differentiation in a mixed broad-leaved/Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis Siebold & Zucc.) forest in Mudanfeng National Nature Reserve were analyzed using three spatial structure indices: uniform angle index, complete mingling index, and size differentiation index. The results show that the species were randomly distributed, with a moderate size differentiation and high mixed structure. Three dominant species exhibited different patterns in terms of the three indices and their bivariate distribution. Overall, Korean pine showed an opposite trend to Manchurian maple (Acer mandshuricum Maxim.), whereas the distribution pattern of Manchurian linden (Tilia mandshurica Rupr. & Maxim.) was similar to that of the entire stand. Our work contributes to further the knowledge of population structure in order to optimize the structure of secondary forests and plantations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer 3aPinus koraiensis 3aTilia 3aconiferous forests 3aconservation areas 3adominant species 3ageographical distribution 3aharvesting 3alogging 3aplantations 3apopulation structure 3asecondary forests 3aspecies diversity 3astand structure 3atimber production 3aChina1 aCai, Tijiu1 aJu, Cunyong1 aZou, Hongfei0 tJournal of forestry research.g2019 Aug., v. 30, no. 4 p.1375-1381dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000106x1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-019-00899-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245007300154300002000227520147800247592002801725650001501753650002601768650001601794650002801810650001201838650001001850650001901860650001801879650000901897650001701906650001101923650002701934650001601961650002001977700001601997700002302013700001602036700001502052700001602067773012402083856007402207852000902281655001202290IND60669002520221119144100.0190920e20150810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066900252DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra09686c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Qian10aProperties of multi-phase foam and its flow behavior in porous media  ap. 67676-67689.  aAqueous foams were produced with partially hydrophobic SiO₂ nanoparticles and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) dispersions. The injection behavior of SiO₂ stabilized foam (SiO₂/SDS foam) was analyzed and compared with SDS stabilized foam (SDS foam). The experimental results showed that the SiO₂ nanoparticles and SDS surfactants had a synergistic effect on foam stability at proper SDS concentration. And the effect was accompanied with a slight decrease in foam volume. The adsorption of nanoparticles on the bubble surface was confirmed by laser-induced confocal fluorescence microscopy. And the effect of absorbed nanoparticles on bubble surface viscoelasticity was also verified by the interfacial dilational rheological measurement. The dilational viscoelasticity increased with increasing SiO₂ concentration, corresponding to foam stability. The plugging flow experiment demonstrated that the maximum differential pressure in SiO₂/SDS foam flooding was 1.9 MPa, much higher than that in SDS foam flooding. The SiO₂/SDS foam had better diversion properties and resistance to water flushing than SDS foam. In the oil displacement experiments, SiO₂/SDS foam could reduce the residual oil saturation noticeably. The enhanced oil recovery and the final oil recovery could reach to 41.2% and 75.7%, respectively. It was deduced that the enhanced foam stability and dilational viscoelasticity were the main reasons for the effective performance in porous media.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adifferential pressure 3adispersions 3afluorescence microscopy 3afoaming 3afoams 3ahydrophobicity 3ananoparticles 3aoils 3aporous media 3asilica 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asurfactants 3aviscoelasticity1 aLi, Zhaomin1 aWang, Chi-chʻien,1 aLi, Songyan1 aJiang, Lei1 aZhang, Chao0 tRSC advances.g2015 Aug. 10, v. 5, no. 83 p.67676-67689dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra09686c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04411naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245017200183300001800355520216600373592002802539650002502567650002502592650002002617650001102637650001602648650002502664650000902689650001902698650001102717650001502728650001502743650002302758650001102781650001902792650001302811650001502824650001702839650001302856650000902869650001102878650001402889650002502903650001202928650008702940650002703027650001103054650002103065650004803086650003903134650002903173650001903202650003703221650002503258650000903283650002303292650008803315650000903403650001703412650002303429650002203452651001003474651001003484700001503494773009903509856004803608852000903656655001203665IND4469605520221121170204.0121003e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446960552DNAL7 a218423792pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-011-2596-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, Arun K.10aAnthelmintic activity of ripe fruit extract of Solanum myriacanthum Dunal (Solanaceae) against experimentally induced Hymenolepis diminuta (Cestoda) infections in rats  ap. 1047-1053.  aAlthough there are many effective drugs available to treat intestinal worms, the fact remains that they remain out of reach to a majority of the population in many areas of the world. On the other hand, traditional plant-based remedies continue to be an important therapeutic aid for treating worm infections throughout the world, especially in the developing nations. Solanum myriacanthum Dunal is a perennial shrub that is used in the folk medicine of Tangkhul Naga tribe of India for treating intestinal worms. This study evaluates the anthelmintic activity of its ripe fruit extract using experimental Hymenolepis diminuta (a zoonotic tapeworm) infections in albino rats. The efficacy of extract was adjudged by monitoring the eggs per gram (EPG) count of parasite as well as by the direct count of surviving worms in the intestine following treatment with methanol fruit extract of this plant to different groups of rats harbouring H. diminuta infections. The plant extract showed a dose-dependent reduction of both EPG as well as worm counts for all the developmental stages of H. diminuta in rats. However, the effects of the extract were more apparent on the adult stages than larval or immature stages of the parasite. Against the adult stage, a single oral dose of 800 mg/kg of extract, given for 3 days, showed 60.49% reduction in the EPG counts and 56.60% reduction in the worm counts in the extract-treated group as compared to untreated control. In comparison, the reference drug praziquantel (5 mg/kg) showed 51.81% and 70.00% reduction in the EPG and worm counts, respectively. The LD50 (oral) of the extract was determined to be 3,093.24 mg/kg in rats, and no significant changes were observed in the values of serum glutamate oxalate transaminase, serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase, cholesterol and total protein between the extract-treated and control groups of animals. These findings indicate that ripe fruits of S. myriacanthum possess significant anthelmintic property, without any adverse effects to the experimental animals. This may provide a scientific rationale for the traditional use of this plant against intestinal worms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHymenolepis diminuta 3aSolanum myriacanthum 3aadverse effects 3aalbino 3acholesterol 3adeveloping countries 3aeggs 3afruit extracts 3afruits 3aglutamates 3aintestines 3alaboratory animals 3alarvae 3alethal dose 50 3amethanol 3amonitoring 3apraziquantel 3aproteins 3arats 3ashrubs 3atapeworms 3atraditional medicine 2aAnimals 2aAnthelminticsxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxisolation & purification. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aFemale 2aFruitxchemistry 2aHymenolepiasisxdrug therapyxparasitology. 2aHymenolepis diminutaxdrug effects 2aIntestinesxparasitology 2aLethal Dose 50 2aLiverxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aLiver Function Tests 2aMale 2aParasite Egg Count 2aPlant Extractsxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxisolation & purification. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSolanumxchemistry 2aTreatment Outcome 3aIndia 0aIndia1 aTangpu, V.0 tParasitology research.g2012 Feb., v. 110, no. 2 p.1047-1053dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-011-2596-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245006500165300001600230520164500246592002801891650001101919650002601930650002301956650003801979650002002017650001202037650001902049650002402068650001702092700002002109700001902129773012502148856004802273852000902321655001202330IND4515902520221120073651.0151006e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451590252DNAL7 a10.1007/s12272-012-0402-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Kyung Hee10aProgress in cancer therapy targeting c-Met signaling pathway  ap. 595-604.  aABSTACT: A primary hurdle in developing anticancer therapeutics is to selectively target cancer cells while sparing normal tissues. Oncogenic protein kinases represent a class of biologically important targets for cancer intervention. Among them, c-Met is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that has low activity in normal tissues but is dysregulated in many tumor types. The c-Met is the prototype member of a subfamily of RTKs, which includes Ron, which is structurally distinct from other RTK families. It is the only known high-affinity receptor for hepatocyte growth factor, also known as scatter factor. HGF and c-Met are both required for normal mammalian development. In adults, both are widely expressed in a variety of tissues; however, their expression is normally very low and is involved mainly in tissue damage, repair and regeneration. The results of in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that this receptor-growth factor pair is involved in multiple physiologic cellular responses, including cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, motility, and invasion. Here, as well as presenting the biological aspects of c-Met signaling regulation, we consider recent findings that have provided new knowledge at the molecular, cellular, and animal study. Also, we describe how the c-Met pathway is tuned by the functional cooperation between various signal transducers. We then discuss the progress in the development of agents that target the c-Met pathway, with an emphasis on small molecules of c-Met kinase inhibitors. Finally, we provide our perspective in terms of possible future trends and limitation in this field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aantineoplastic agents 3acell proliferation 3ahepatocyte growth factor receptor 3ain vivo studies 3amammals 3aneoplasm cells 3asignal transduction 3atherapeutics1 aPark, Byung Hee1 aHong, Soon-Sun0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g2012 Apr., v. 35, no. 4 p.595-604dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:J000001242x0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12272-012-0402-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245008400153300002000237520130500257592002801562650002201590650001201612650002201624650001501646650001201661650001101673650001201684650001301696650001101709650001601720650002101736700002201757773012401779856007401903852000901977655001201986IND60669002620221119144342.0190920e20150630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066900262DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra09688j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Juan10aLithium-coordinating ionic conductor for solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells  ap. 56967-56973.  aA new solid-state ionic conductor is synthesized by linking an ether group to the nitrogen-atom of 1,2-dimethylimidazole with an iodide counter anion, and the single crystal structure is determined using X-ray crystallographic analysis. Replacement of the butyl group in 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide with an ether group induces a significant improvement in conductivity. When the solid ionic conductor is mixed with LiI alone, conductivity enhancement is more remarkable for the ether-containing ionic conductor due to the lithium coordination to the ether oxygen, which is able to avoid the aggregation of lithium cations with iodides and hence improves the transport properties of Li⁺. Owing to the π-stacking of imidazolium rings for the ether-containing ionic conductor, the increment of ionic conductivity is also more significant upon further doping with I₂. The ether-containing ionic conductor mixed with LiI alone as the solid electrolyte can even make the solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells work. Further doping with iodine achieves power conversion efficiency of 7.1%, which is much higher than that (5.3%) for the alkyl analogue due to the positive shift of the conduction band edge of titanium dioxide and suppression of charge recombination caused by the ether group.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acations 3acrystal structure 3aimidazoles 3aiodides 3aiodine 3alithium 3amoieties 3aoxygen 3asolar cells 3atitanium dioxide1 aWang, Zhong-Sheng0 tRSC advances.g2015 June 30, v. 5, no. 70 p.56967-56973dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra09688j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100007100151245010400222300001600326520128800342592002801630650002001658650001401678650001901692650001501711650001701726650001701743650001001760650001801770650001001788650001901798650001101817650001301828650001101841650001801852650001401870650000901884650000901893650001401902653001901916653001401935653001301949653001401962653002401976653001802000653002602018653002502044653001402069700002502083700001502108700002402123700001902147700002602166700001802192773011402210856008602324852000902410655001202419IND60633358820221120080420.0190906e20190328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063335882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2019.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTabatabaei, Seyed Nasrollah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2521-839410aCo-delivery of miR-181a and melphalan by lipid nanoparticles for treatment of seeded retinoblastoma  ap. 177-185.  aMelphalan is an efficient chemotherapeutic agent that is currently used to treat retinoblastoma (Rb); however, the inherent risk of immunogenicity and the hazardous integration of this drug in healthy cells is inevitable. MicroRNAs are short non-coding single-stranded RNAs that affect a vast range of biological processes. Previously, we focused on the regulatory role of miR-181a during cancer development and progression. In this manuscript, 171 nm switchable lipid nanoparticles (LNP) co-delivered melphalan and miR-181a with encapsulation efficiencies of 93%. Encapsulation of melphalan in LNP significantly improved its therapeutic efficiency. Gene analysis shows that miR-181a decreases the expression of anti-proliferative gene MAPK1 and anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2, but significantly increased the expression of pro-apoptotic gene BAX. Our results suggest that the two agents have a complementary effect in reducing the viability of cultured Rb cells (primary and cell line) and decreasing Rb cell counts in an in-vivo xenograft Rb model in rats. Our results suggest that the proposed co-delivery technique significantly increases the therapeutic impact, allows for lower administration of melphalan, and consequently, could minimize the cytotoxic side-effects of this drug.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aapoptosis 3acarcinogenesis 3acell lines 3acytotoxicity 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3agenes 3aimmunogenicity 3alipids 3amicroRNA 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3arats 3arisk 3aviability 0aRetinoblastoma 0aMelphalan 0amiR-181a 0aLiposomes 0aLipid nanoparticles 0aNanoparticles 0aCo-delivery technique 0aComplementary effect 0aApoptosis1 aDerbali, Rabeb Mouna1 aYang, Chun1 aSuperstein, Rosanne1 aHamel, Patrick1 aChain, Jeanne Leblond1 aHardy, Pierre0 tJournal of controlled release.g2019 Mar. 28, v. 298 p.177-185dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2019.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005400139245012300193300001800316500002000334520167000354592002802024596002802052596005202080596002202132650002502154650001802179650001002197650001002207650001402217650001402231650003202245650002802277650001102305650001402316650001602330650001002346700006002356700001802416700002202434773011802456856007302574852000902647655001202656IND60655744320221120030551.0190805e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065574432DNAL7 a10.1111/ppa.130522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaleem, K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3187-546210aSpatiotemporal changes in fungal growth and host responses of six yellow rust resistant near‐isogenic lines of wheat  ap. 1320-1330.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe objective of the present study was to investigate to what extent the macroscopic phenotype of incompatible host–pathogen interactions reflects differences in fungal development and host responses at the histological level. This was done by conventional and advanced microscopic analysis of six wheat near‐isogenic lines differing by individual R genes and inoculated with an avirulent isolate of Puccinia striiformis. Wheat line AvocetYr15 had the lowest macroscopic infection type (IT) 0–1, in which fungal growth was stopped at early stages due to extensive expression of a hypersensitive response (HR) at all time points (4, 8 and 16 days post‐inoculation, dpi) without any sign of haustorial bodies. AvocetYr5 and AvocetYr1 had IT 1, in which most fungal colonies developed secondary hyphae. Many colonies were encased by HR at 16 dpi, more extensively in AvocetYr1 than AvocetYr5. In AvocetYr6 (IT 2), HR was expressed after the formation of secondary hyphae at 4 dpi, after which fungal growth and HR increased simultaneously until most colonies became encased by HR. AvocetYr27 (IT 2–3) and AvocetYr17 (IT 4–5) showed similar fungal growth and HR at 4 dpi, where HR was only weakly expressed in a few host cells. Encasement of secondary and runner hyphae increased significantly in AvocetYr27, but at 16 dpi, HR was often circumvented by large, intermingled fungal colonies in both lines. No resistance responses were observed in Avocet S (susceptible control). The very different histological patterns conferred by the six R genes suggests differences in the timing of the host–pathogen recognition and onset of host defence pathways.  aPublisher supplied data  cInnovation Fund Denmark  a19052cMinistry of Higher Education and Science  cAarhus University 3aPuccinia striiformis 3afungal growth 3afungi 3agenes 3ahaustoria 3ahistology 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3ahypersensitive response 3ahyphae 3aphenotype 3astripe rust 3awheat1 aSørensen, C.

G.10aDesign and microstructural analysis of magnesium alloys for dynamical applications  ap. 4880-4895.  aA microanalytical characterization of cast magnesium alloys of eutectic origin based on the Mg–Al–Ca ternary matrix system has been carried out in order to investigate the influence of alloying elements on their microstructure as well as microchemistry-processing-microstructural relations using structure-sensitive techniques of electron microscopy, mechanical spectroscopy (internal friction), X-ray diffractometry, and advanced microanalytical methods including electron probe compositional analysis. Following the data obtained here there is direct correlation of microstructure with creep properties of the new experimental magnesium alloys. The creep and heat-induced properties of the multicomponent magnesium alloys containing low range of inexpensive additions of titanium (0.07–0.2%) or strontium (of about 1.8%) are defined by resulting structure dynamically formed during creep strain (up to 200 h). It is noteworthy that Ti as novel alloying element competes for creep resistance and cost with Sr and attracts as-cast desirable properties minimizing solute effects at ambient temperatures because of the pinning of slowly moving dislocations with the binding energy no more then 0.3 eV as well as because of stress-induced strengthening. The Ti and Sr solute atmosphere dragging is believed to be the rate-controlling mechanism responsible for radical improvement of creep resistance and long-term strength in the newly developed magnesium alloys at elevated temperatures. The new experimental alloys are superior to commercial alloys AZ91D, AE42, and AS21 following their creep resistance, long-term strength, heat resistance, and castability because of their novel microstructure having desirable engineering properties for structural applications (creep strain εc less than 0.3–0.4% at 423 K and 70 MPa for 200 h; έc ~ 10⁻⁹ s⁻¹). The newly developed magnesium alloys with improved castability could be used in die-casting technology and automobile (powertrain) industry for manufacturing of components and parts which are difficult to cast with more desirable microstructure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aalloys 3aaluminum 3aambient temperature 3aautomobiles 3acalcium 3aelectron microscopy 3aenergy 3afriction 3aheat tolerance 3amagnesium 3amanufacturing 3amicrostructure 3aparts and components 3asolutes 3aspectroscopy 3astrontium 3atitanium1 aKim, K.

We performed fine-scale spatial variability by intensively sampling 100 points distributed in the nodes of a regular grid with 5 m inter-sample distance. Non-parametric statistics were used and included SADIE analysis and partial Mantel test, in addition to geostatistics (semi-variograms) and correlogram computation. Our results indicated that the spatial distribution of earthworms was characterized by areas of presence (patches) and absence (gaps), although the general pattern was random at the scale of this study (<5 m), while soil physico-chemical characteristics showed a clumped spatial distribution. Contrary to previous results reported for the nearby savanna, a significant spatial association was found for two competing endogeic species Andiodrilus sp. and Glossodrilus sp. in the GF. Semi-variograms of soil environmental factors were adjusted to model families most commonly used (spherical and linear), and correlograms for earthworms showed significant positive and negative spatial autocorrelation for lag distances <15 m and >30 m, respectively. Partial Mantel test revealed specific significant relationships between soil variables and some species. The earthworm community of the GF displayed a random structure in a spatially clumped soil environment, and our results suggested that spatial distribution observed for some species could be the result of preferential selection of soil environmental factors. In other words, soil heterogeneity contributed to the formation of population patches for some earthworm species. The variability of suitable sites (resource availability patchiness) exerted an influence in the spatial distribution of earthworms at the scale used in this study, and we identified the spatial scale at which both environmental heterogeneity could influence and express earthworm impact on soil properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3aearthworms 3aedaphic factors 3aforests 3aphysicochemical properties 3asavannas 3asoil heterogeneity1 aDecaëns, Thibaud1 aAmézquita, Edgar1 aRao, I.

Features of the illicium, such as the time of deposition and sizes of the benthic and first annual zones, width and the marginal increment progression of the edge were studied in detail. Results showed that the average horizontal diameters of the benthic and first annual zones were 0.18mm (age 0) and 0.32mm (age 1), respectively, and these zones could be identified in anglerfish of any length. There was a strong positive correlation between illicium width and fish length. In transmitted light the edge was usually dark in the winter and light in the summer, and the transition between them took place in May/June. Results from illicia age-readings and length-frequency analysis show that anglerfish in these waters have a very high growth rate during their first years of life (age 0–1, 18.5cmyear−1), after which smaller individuals grow faster than larger fish. Growth rates of fish larger than 35cm in length are comparable to the fastest growth rates in other areas of the North Atlantic. Since the illicia age determinations resulted in growth rates that were consistent with length frequency and mark-recapture analyses, we believe that illicia derived age length keys could be used in age-based assessment of anglerfish in Faroese waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLophius piscatorius 3aage determination 3afish 3asummer 3awinter 0aLophius piscatorius 0aAge 0aGrowth 0aIllicia 0aTagging1 aAngus, C.1 aPedersen, T.1 aSteingrund, P.0 tFisheries research.g2013 Mar., v. 139 p.51-60dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2012.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245010300206300001100309520159600320592002801916596001501944650002101959650002201980650003702002650002202039650001102061650001102072650002102083650001802104700006102122700006302183700006602246773012202312856008302434852000902517655001202526IND60688127820221119092527.0200612e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068812782DNAL7 a10.1007/s00606-020-01675-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDias, Yhanndra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6488-473610aComparative cytogenetic maps of Passiflora alata and P. watsoniana (Passifloraceae) using BAC-FISH  ap. 51.  aThe genus Passiflora shows a large variation in chromosome numbers (2n = 12, 14, 18, 20, 22, 24, 36, 72) and in the distribution of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sites. Most species of the subgenus Passiflora, however, have n = 9 and two pairs of 35S rDNA sites, such as species of economic importance Passiflora edulis and Passiflora alata. Species of another clade from the same subgenus, which includes Passiflora watsoniana, have three pairs of 35S rDNA sites. This karyotypic variability suggests a possible break in synteny within the subgenus Passiflora, but with maintenance of n = 9 in most species. To investigate synteny in three species of this subgenus, comparative cytogenetic mapping was performed in P. alata and P. watsoniana using BAC markers previously developed for P. edulis. In addition, the distribution of 35S and 5S rDNA sites and LTR retrotransposons Ty1-Copia and Ty3-Gypsy were investigated. The used single-copy BAC clones resulted in distinct dot-like signals exclusively in terminal or subterminal regions of the chromosomes. No synteny break with regard to the chromosomal distribution of these BACs or the rDNA sites could be detected, except for an additional 35S rDNA site on chromosome 3 of P. watsoniana. LTR elements showed proximal or uniformly dispersed patterns. The results revealed a similar distribution of BAC markers between species, preferably in the terminal regions, which is compatible with an increased accumulation of repetitive sequences preferentially in proximal regions of the chromosomes associated with an increase in genome size.  aPublisher supplied data  a001cCAPES 3aPassiflora alata 3aPassiflora edulis 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3achromosome number 3aclones 3agenome 3aretrotransposons 3aribosomal DNA1 aSader, Mariela A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8188-22171 aVieira, Maria L.

Evidence from cross-border mergers and acquisitions  aA crucial component of the combating climate change is the reduction of carbon emissions (CO2). Based on the pollution haven hypothesis, existing literature claims that to mitigate the carbon emissions, multinational enterprises undertake cross-border mergers and acquisitions (CBA), a form of foreign direct investment, in emerging economies where the regulatory institution is weak and make such host countries a pollution haven victim. In this background, we examine whether India is potentially a pollution haven for firms who prefer the CBA route by investigating the impact of the home country's CO2 emissions on CBA decisions involving the number, volume, and stake acquired in an emerging host country, India. Additionally, we use India's corruption as an indicator of institutional weakness to examine its moderation effect. We used a net sample of 796 country-pair-year observations to examine the volume and number of CBA and 3796 net deal-level data to examine stake acquisition from a gross sample of 5641 CBA data sourced from the Thomson Reuters EIKON database covering a study period from 1990 to 2020. Our results from Negative Binomial and Tobit regression models find that less carbon-emitting countries frequently undertake CBA activities with large volumes in India. Moreover, our Logit regression model results show that high emitting country firms prefer full equity control in Indian firms. Furthermore, India's corruption makes this relationship much more potent by significantly moderating the impact of the home country's CO2 emissions on CBA decisions. These results indicate that India is potentially a pollution haven for multinational enterprises from high emitting countries. Furthermore, we provide specific policy implications based on these results and add scientific value to the academic community, scholars, environmentalists, regulatory bodies, and policymakers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3adatabases 3aforeign direct investment 3aissues and policy 3apollution 3aregression analysis 3aIndia 0aCross-border mergers and acquisitions 0aCO2 emission 0aControl of corruption 0aPollution haven 0aF2 0aO1 0aQ0 0aQ51 aMahesh, Rampilla1 aTripathy, Naliniprava0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Nov. 20, v. 376 p.134355-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1343553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245007800171300001800249500001500267520160600282592002801888650001701916650002501933650001701958650000901975650002801984650001602012650001002028650001202038650001202050650001602062650001802078650001402096650001502110650002502125650001302150650002002163650002402183650001302207650000902220650001102229650001202240650001602252651000902268653001102277700002002288700002602308700002502334700002302359700001802382700002502400773013602425856008102561852000902642655001202651IND60649294520221119044628.0190703e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064929452DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-018-0692-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhosropour, Esmaiel10aResponse of Platanus orientalis leaves to urban pollution by heavy metals  ap. 1437-1445.  a2019-12-06  aAtmospheric pollution is an important concern in urban environments. The impact of urban pollution on the physiological, biochemical and anatomical properties of leaves of oriental plane (Platanus orientalis L.) was studied. The leaves were collected from an urban site (Tehran, Iran) and a non-urban forest park (Chitgar Forest Park). Anatomical (stomata, parenchyma, and cuticle) and physiological (chlorophyll content, enzyme activities) properties were analyzed. The concentrations of Cd (cadmium), Pb (lead), Ni (nickel), and Cr (chromium) in leaves were significantly higher and Zn (zinc) lower at the urban site relative to the forest park. Chlorophyll a, total chlorophyll, and carotenoid content in leaves of the urban site were significantly less than those of the forest park, but there was no significant difference in chlorophyll b. In addition, the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and guaiacol peroxidase in urban leaves were significantly higher than in the leaves of the forest park. In the urban area, leaves experienced a significant decrease in leaf surface area, stomata density, stomata pore area, epidermis, and spongy mesophyll thickness, but a significant increase in cuticle and palisade thicknesses relative to forest park leaves. The increase in enzyme activities may indicate that the trees are attempting to cope with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) because of pollution-induced stress. Our study suggests that oriental plane trees alter their physiological and anatomical properties when living in a polluted urban environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3asurface area 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aheavy metals 3alead 3areactive oxygen species 3aurban areas 3atrees 3aforests 3acadmium 3acarotenoids 3aair pollution 3amesophyll 3aperoxidase 3asuperoxide dismutase 3achromium 3aenzyme activity 3aPlatanus orientalis 3acatalase 3azinc 3anickel 3astomata 3achlorophyll 3aIran 0aleaves1 aAttarod, Pedram1 aShirvany, Anoushirvan1 aPypker, Thomas Grant1 aBayramzadeh, Vilma1 aHakimi, Leila1 aMoeinaddini, Mazaher0 tJournal of forestry research.g2019 Aug., v. 30, no. 4 p.1437-1445dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000106x1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-018-0692-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03312naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003600134024002500170024004000195024002300235040001800258100002800276245013300304300001600437500001500453520130600468592002801774596005701802650003301859650002701892650002201919650002601941650000801967650003201975650001702007650002302024650001602047650004202063650002502105650005202130650002202182651001202204700002902216700002202245700001902267700002202286700002002308700006502328773013402393856011402527856008302641961001302724852000902737655001202746IND60701983220221214223504.0200820e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070198322DNAL7 a3700212aris7 a10113/70198322hdl7 a10.1007/s10658-020-02037-22doi7 a4326492aris_accn_no7 a8042-22000-302-00D2aris_project_no7 a3700212seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCornejo-Franco, Juan F.10aExploring the virome of Vasconcellea x heilbornii: the first step towards a sustainable production program for babaco in Ecuador  ap. 961-968.  agolden set  aThe virome of babaco (Vasconcellea x heilbornii) —a non-traditional fruit crop native to Ecuador— was investigated by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) on plants obtained from a commercial nursery. Six virus-like sequences were detected, including the full length of papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) and an RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) sequence with homology to papaya virus Q. Three RNA sequences were found with homology, respectively, to apple latent spherical virus (genus Cheravirus, 71% nt identity), cherry leaf roll virus (genus Nepovirus, 54% nt identity) and Citrullus lanatus cryptic virus (genus Deltapartitivirus, 66% nt identity); whereas a DNA pararetrovirus-like sequence with homology to citrus endogenous pararetrovirus (58% nt identity) was also detected. RT-PCR-based virus surveys on a total of 284 samples collected from three provinces revealed that the partitivirus- and pararetrovirus-like sequences were present in 100% of tested plants; whereas the other virus sequences were detected in up to 68% of plants and were associated with different symptoms. This work provides information on the occurrence and prevalence of PRSV and five additional virus-like sequences in babaco, a vegetatively propagated crop, supporting the need for a virus-free certification program.  aPublisher supplied data  aPREDU-2016-001cEcuadorean University Network (REDU) 3aApple latent spherical virus 3aCherry leaf roll virus 3aDeltapartitivirus 3aPapaya ringspot virus 3aRNA 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aVasconcellea 3adisease prevalence 3afruit crops 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3anucleotide sequences 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence homology 3aEcuador1 aMedina-Salguero, Andrés1 aFlores, Francisco1 aChica, Eduardo1 aGrinstead, Samuel1 aMollov, Dimitre1 aQuito-Avila, Diego F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6170-11130 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2020 Aug., v. 157, no. 4 p.961-968dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/70198323Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-020-02037-23Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010200169500002200271520192300293592002802216650001502244650001902259650001202278650002002290650001602310650002202326650002202348650001102370650001902381650001702400651001002417653002502427653001802452653002402470653002402494700002002518700005802538773010802596856005202704852000902756655001202765IND60794986120221120183712.0220929e20220922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079498612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1343582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Shanshan10aSpatiotemporal dynamics and driving forces of city-level CO2 emissions in China from 2000 to 2019  aPre-press version  aClimate issues caused by energy consumption and related carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from urbanization and industrialization have attracted growing attention worldwide. Accurate estimation of urban CO₂ emissions and exploration of main driving factors behind are of great importance for achieving low-carbon development. In order to identify the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of CO₂ emissions among Chinese cities, we integrate two kinds of nighttime light datasets and estimate CO₂ emissions for 286 prefecture-level cities in China from 2000 to 2019, then characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics and their decoupling types with economic growth through Tapio decoupling model. Moreover, the random forest model and the partial dependence method are employed to explore the correlation between the urban CO₂ emissions and thirteen socioeconomic driving factors, from which the key influencing factors are extracted. The results show that from 2000 to 2019, the total CO₂ emissions of 286 prefecture-level cities increased and then fluctuated; meanwhile, the CO₂ emissions intensity decreased, indicating that energy efficiency has been improved. Most cities with high emissions intensity and high per capita emissions agglomerated in the north China. The number of decoupling cities has increased, while that of coupling cities and negative decoupling cities has decreased. Regarding driving factors, economic development, industrialization, transportation, land urbanization, and the production and distribution of electricity, gas, and water were the leading socioeconomic factors driving the increase in CO₂ emissions. This study has great theoretical and practical significance. It helps us not only to deeply understand the coupling relationship among resources, environment, and economic development but also to design effective low-carbon development pathways and improve urbanization quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3adata collection 3aelectricity 3aenergy efficiency 3aindustrialization 3amodels 3atransportation 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aNighttime light data 0aCO2 emissions 0aRandom forest model 0aDecoupling analysis1 aZhang, Xiaoping1 aChen, Mingxing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5224-97620 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Sept. 22,  p.134358-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.134358  aDNAL 7aarticle03019naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245016600180300001800346500001500364520131500379592002801694650001301722650000901735650001401744650001201758650001201770650001401782650002301796650001001819650001701829650001101846650001401857650002101871650001301892650001101905650002201916650001201938650001401950651001101964651001101975653001301986653001901999653001802018653002302036653002902059700002902088700001702117700002802134700002902162700003102191773012502222856008502347852000902432655001202441IND60595720220221121031053.0180607e20180511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059572022DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2018.14523052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViolante-González, Juan10aParasite community of the golden cownose ray Rhinoptera steindachneri Evermann and Jenkins 1891 (Chondrichthyes: Myliobatidae), in Acapulco Bay, Guerrero, Mexico  ap. 1115-1131.  a2019-12-06  aThe parasite community of the ray Rhinoptera steindachneri from Acapulco Bay was examined and quantified; analyses were based on the sex of the host and the date of sampling. A total of 171 specimens of R. steindachneri were examined during July–August of 2010, and May and July of 2012. Twenty-one species of parasites were found: three species of Monogenea; eight adult and one larval species of Cestoda; one larval species of Nematoda; five species of Copepoda; two species of Isopoda; and one species of Hirudinea. Cestodes had the greatest species richness (43% of the total species), followed by the copepods (24%). Two species of cestode, Glyphobothrium sp. and Rhinebothrium sp., were collected only from adult rays. At the component community level, species richness showed statistically significant variation between 13 and 16 species, which is similar to previous reports for other species of rays. The parasite component communities and infracommunities of R. steindachneri exhibited similar patterns: high species number and low numerical dominance by a particular species of parasite. The differences of body size of male vs. female rays, and a change in diet and feeding behaviour with the age of R. steindachneri, are likely important factors in the structuring of their parasite communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCopepoda 3adiet 3aparasites 3aCestoda 3aIsopoda 3aMonogenea 3aRhinoptera bonasus 3amales 3aMyliobatidae 3aadults 3abody size 3afeeding behavior 3aNematoda 3alarvae 3aspecies diversity 3afemales 3aHirudinea 3aMexico 0aMexico 0acestodes 0aMyliobatididae 0aPacific coast 0atemporal variation 0aRhinoptera steindachneri1 aSantos-Bustos, Nataly G.1 aMonks, Scott1 aPulido-Flores, Griselda1 aGarcía-Ibáñez, Sergio1 aRojas-Herrera, Agustín A.0 tJournal of natural history.g2018 May 11, v. 52, no. 17-18 p.1115-1131dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12296x1464-52627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222933.2018.14523053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148245011000166300001400276520163700290592002801927650000901955650001101964650001201975650001201987650001101999650001302010650002002023650002602043650001102069651002102080651001002101651001802111700001702129700002302146700001802169700001602187700002202203700002102225700002002246773010302266856008402369852000902453655001202462IND4472310220221121031524.0150808e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447231022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2012.01.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEndo, Tetsuya10aStable isotope ratios and mercury levels in red meat products from baleen whales sold in Japanese markets  ap. 35-41.  aWe analyzed the δ¹³C, δ¹⁵N and δ¹⁸O values and Hg concentration in red meat products originating from the predominant types sold in Japan for human consumption: two populations of common minke (J- and O-types), Bryde's and sei whales in the western North Pacific Ocean, and fin and Antarctic minke whales in the Southern Ocean. The order of the trophic positions, evaluated by δ¹⁵N values and Hg concentrations, coincided with their known feeding habits: common minke (J-type)=common minke (O-type)>Bryde's≥sei≥Antarctic minke≥fin. The Hg concentrations in the combined samples from the six samples were significantly correlated with their δ¹⁵N values (γ=0.455, n=66, p<0.05), reflecting overall differences in the trophic level. This correlation was not significant for within-species comparison for the common minke (J- and O-types) or the Bryde's whale, probably reflecting the higher δ¹⁵N value and lower Hg concentration in the North Pacific Ocean around Japan. Determination of δ¹³C, δ¹⁵N and δ¹⁸O could be used to discriminate between the red meat products originating from the whale species in the North Pacific and Southern Oceans. However, the four whale species or populations in the Pacific Ocean could not be discriminated on basis of these values, nor could the two species in the Southern Ocean. Positive correlations between the δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N values and negative correlations between the δ¹⁵N and δ¹⁸O values and the δ¹³C and δ¹⁸O values, probably reflecting migration patterns, were found in some whale species in the North Pacific and Southern Oceans.  aPublisher supplied data 3afins 3ahumans 3amarkets 3amercury 3aoceans 3ared meat 3astable isotopes 3atrophic relationships 3awhales 3aAntarctic region 3aJapan 3aPacific Ocean1 aHotta, Yohei1 aHisamichi, Yohsuke1 aKimura, Osamu1 aSatō, Rie,1 aHaraguchi, Koichi1 aFunahashi, Naoko1 aBaker, C.

Circular Economy is a framework for socio-technical regime change that prioritizes material loops to improve resource efficiency. The framework promotes business activities that capitalize on material recirculation pathways and extended product life cycles. Many countries have begun adopting circular economy principles through policies, targets, and action plans, but research in this area has focused largely on developed countries and major emerging economies. The lack of scientific analysis of circular economy implementation in developing countries is a critical research gap with significant implications on global material flows. Fast-growing countries such as the Philippines will benefit from the regime change towards circular economy to resolve sustainability issues from economic and demographic trends. Policy interventions need to be calibrated to enable a smooth transition to circularity. To address this gap, this study uses a 16-sector Environmentally-Extended Input-Output model to simulate four scenarios based on increasing product demand, implementing circular business models, implementing government regulations, and promoting service sectors. GDP growth, material intensity, and regulatory constraints of each scenario are analyzed. Results show a potential of up to 10.05% increase in GDP and 62.51% decrease in material footprint relative to business-as-usual. Policy implications on the Philippines' transition to a circular economy are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhilippines 3acircular economy 3ainput output analysis 3aissues and policy 3asimulation models 0aSustainability transition 0aLinear programming 0aOptimization 0aEEIO 0aGlobal south1 aTan, Raymond R.1 aChiu, Anthony S.F.1 aUbando, Aristotle T.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Sept. 22,  p.134360-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.134360  aDNAL 7aarticle02378naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245015800162300001800320520110600338592002801444650002501472650002101497650002101518650001001539650002101549650001301570650001301583650001901596650000701615650001501622650002301637700001501660700001701675700002101692700001601713700001801729700001701747773010201764856008101866852000901947655001201956IND60548197520221121205309.0160903e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054819752DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-011-5416-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Lang14aThe influences of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) coating on the biodegradability, bioactivity, and biocompatibility of calcium silicate bioceramics  ap. 4986-4993.  aCalcium silicate (CaSiO₃) bioceramics and polyesters have complementary qualities as potential bone substituted materials. In this study, sintered CaSiO₃ bioceramics were prepared and coated with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and the influences of the PLGA coating on the degradation, hydrophilicity, bioactivity, and biocompatibility of CaSiO₃ ceramics were investigated. The results showed that the degradation rate was reduced, while hydrophilicity was decreased with the increase of the polymer coating. In addition, the polymer coating resulted in a decrease of the alkaline pH value during the degradation of the ceramics, which indicated an increase of the cell biocompatibility, confirmed by the attachment and proliferation of rMSCs on the surface of the polymer-coated ceramics. Furthermore, the apatite-forming ability of the PLGA-coated CaSiO₃ bioceramics was maintained. This study suggested that the coating with PLGA might be a useful method to improve the integrative properties of CaSiO₃ bioceramics for applications in bone regeneration and bone tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3abones 3acalcium silicate 3aceramics 3acoatings 3ahydrophilicity 3apH 3apolyesters 3atissue engineering1 aLin, Kaili1 aZhang, Meili1 aXiong, Chengdong1 aBao, Yihong1 aPang, Xiubing1 aChang, Jiang0 tJournal of materials science.g2011 July, v. 46, no. 14 p.4986-4993dSpringer USx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-011-5416-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002100189245008000210300001600290500001900306506007600325520136000401592002801761596007201789506003701861650002201898650002801920650002401948650002601972650001801998650001502016650001002031650001102041700003102052700006202083773013402145856008202279852000902361655001202370IND60688128220221207070304.0200408e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068812822DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-020-01383-92doi7 aPMC71387812pmcid7 a319197912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTegelaar, Martin10aApical but not sub-apical hyphal compartments are self-sustaining in growth  ap. 697-706.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIt was recently demonstrated that apical compartments of Aspergillus niger hyphae are self-sustaining in growth. This was shown by assessing the growth rate of individual hyphae before and after dissection of the second compartment. Using the same methodology, it is here demonstrated that single apical compartments of the septate fungi Penicillium chrysogenum and Schizophyllum commune as well as the 500-µm-apical region of the non-septate fungus Rhizopus stolonifer are also self-sustaining in growth. In contrast, single 2nd compartments (obtained by dissection of the first and third compartment) of the septate fungi or the region between 500 and 1000 µm from tips of R. stolonifer were severely impacted in their growth rate. In addition, it is shown that existing or newly formed branches originating from the 2nd compartments function as a backup system for hyphal growth when the apical part of the hypha of the three studied fungi is damaged. Together, it is concluded that the apical compartments/zones of the studied fungi are self-sustaining in growth. In contrast, the subapical region is not self-sustaining but functions as a backup once the apical zone is damaged. This back up system is relevant in nature because the apices of hyphae are the first to be exposed to (a)biotic stress conditions when entering an unexplored substrate.  aPublisher supplied data  a823.02.015cNederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAspergillus niger 3aPenicillium chrysogenum 3aRhizopus stolonifer 3aSchizophyllum commune 3abiotic stress 3adissection 3afungi 3ahyphae1 avan der Lans, George P.

Through use of circular statistics, we show that the regular sea urchin Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus had no preference with respect to what body part, as determined by Lovén’s system, should be anterior in locomotion. The sea urchins, however, preferably proceeded with the body part, which had contacted with the aquarium walls at rest, forward. When the contact part was artificially altered, the body part facing forward in the following proceeding changed accordingly: the animals walked with the part that had contacted last forward. The biological significance of this behavior was discussed in relation to the aggregation formation and homing behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinoidea 3aanimals 3aaquariums 3alocomotion 3aphilopatry 3astatistics1 aIketani, Tomoaki1 aMotokawa, Tatsuo0 tMarine biology.g2012 May, v. 159, no. 5 p.959-965dSpringer-Verlagx0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-011-1874-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02189naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008300164300001600247520128700263592002801550650002801578650001201606650001201618650001101630650001601641651000901657700001501666700002401681773011301705856004801818852000901866655001201875IND50067395320221121025020.0130625e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006739532DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-012-0770-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoy, Andreas10aAtmospheric circulation variability in Europe and northern Asia (1901 to 2010)  ap. 105-126.  aClimate variability in Europe and northern Asia is markedly affected by changes in atmospheric circulation. Two manual catalogues of large-scale circulation patterns, the 'Grosswetterlagen' (GWLc) and 'Vangengeim-Girs' classifications (VGc), were analysed and compared to detect frequency changes of circulation forms. Results were compared with variations of 'objective' references: variations of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and a hybrid version of the GWLc (SynopVis Grosswetterlagen catalogue, SVGc). Changes were investigated for 1901-2010, focussing on the most recent climate normal (1981-2010). Trends are moderate in the winter half year (WHY), but rather consistent between the approaches. Circulation variability within VGc/NAO and GWLc/SVGc largely agrees. In the summer half year, large trends are visible in VGc and GWLc, but their objective support by the SVGc, showing comparably small changes, is low. Changes in the distribution of circulation patterns likely fostered a larger temperature increase in the investigated regions compared to global average temperatures during the past 30 years in the WHY. The results of this study help further in investigating temperature and precipitation changes in both Europe and northern Asia. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric circulation 3aclimate 3ahybrids 3asummer 3atemperature 3aAsia1 aSepp, Mait1 aMatschullat, Jörg,0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2013 July, v. 113, no. 1-2 p.105-126dSpringer-Verlagx0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-012-0770-3  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245010400214300001600318500001900334520135500353592002801708596007501736596008301811650001901894650001201913650002401925650002501949650002501974650001001999650001102009651001102020700003002031700003302061700002902094700003402123700002902157700002402186700002202210700001902232700002402251700002202275700002902297773013402326856008202460852000902542655001202551IND60688128320221119092723.0200408e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068812832DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-020-01384-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQueiroz, Luciano Lopes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5260-062810aBacterial diversity in deep-sea sediments under influence of asphalt seep at the São Paulo Plateau  ap. 707-717.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHere we investigated the diversity of bacterial communities from deep-sea surface sediments under influence of asphalt seeps at the Sao Paulo Plateau using next-generation sequencing method. Sampling was performed at North São Paulo Plateau using the human occupied vehicle Shinkai 6500 and her support vessel Yokosuka. The microbial diversity was studied at two surficial sediment layers (0–1 and 1–4 cm) of five samples collected in cores in water depths ranging from 2456 to 2728 m. Bacterial communities were studied through sequencing of 16S rRNA gene on the Ion Torrent platform and clustered in operational taxonomic units. We observed high diversity of bacterial sediment communities as previously described by other studies. When we considered community composition, the most abundant classes were Alphaproteobacteria (27.7%), Acidimicrobiia (20%), Gammaproteobacteria (11.3%) and Deltaproteobacteria (6.6%). Most abundant OTUs at family level were from two uncultured bacteria from Actinomarinales (5.95%) and Kiloniellaceae (3.17%). The unexpected high abundance of Alphaproteobacteria and Acidimicrobiia in our deep-sea microbial communities may be related to the presence of asphalt seep at North São Paulo Plateau, since these bacterial classes contain bacteria that possess the capability of metabolizing hydrocarbon compounds.  aPublisher supplied data  a2013/09159-2cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a311010/2015-6cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aKiloniellaceae 3abitumen 3acommunity structure 3adelta-Proteobacteria 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3agenes 3ahumans 3aBrazil1 aBendia, Amanda Gonçalves1 aDuarte, Rubens Tadeu Delgado1 adas Graças, Diego Assis1 ada Costa da Silva, Artur Luiz1 aNakayama, Cristina Rossi1 aSumida, Paulo Yukio1 aLima, Andre O.

Cold plasma (CP) was used to treat pure cultures and conidial suspensions of both pathogens, for 180 or 360 s, in either open or sealed environments from varying distances. In an open environment, the 360 s treatment at a distance of 5 cm reduced the colony growth of freshly inoculated cultures to less than 2 mm/day compared to the control of more than 8 mm/day, and treatment of conidial suspensions resulted in almost 100% reduction of conidial germination. In the same environment, the 180 s CP treatment did not significantly reduce the colony growth of fresh or actively growing cultures, but did suppress the germination of conidia by up to 80%. In a sealed environment, the 360 s CP treatment also effectively reduced the growth of freshly inoculated cultures, with no growth for some isolates. Production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species was observed during treatment, and these may have contributed to the reduction in growth and germination. These results demonstrate the potential of CP for the control of two Colletotrichum species.  aPublisher supplied data  cMurdoch University 3aColletotrichum 3aavocados 3acold 3aconidia 3agermination 3anitrogen 3aplant pathogenic fungi1 aSt.J.

However, the anti-aging effects of mung beans are rarely reported. In this work, we found that mung bean coat extract (MBCE), rich in vitexin and isovitexin, extended the lifespan and promoted the health of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) without any disadvantages. Moreover, MBCE enhanced the resistance to heat and oxidation of C. elegans by reducing the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and up-regulating the expression of stress-resistant genes or proteins. Further studies demonstrated that MBCE improved longevity, stress-resistance and fitness by mediating the mitochondrial function, mimicking calorie restriction, and altering histone modification. These findings provide direct evidence for the anti-aging effects of mung beans and new insights into the innovations and applications of mung beans for the healthcare industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aflavonoids 3ahealth services 3ahistone code 3aindustry 3alongevity 3alow calorie diet 3amitochondria 3amung beans 3aoxidation 3areactive oxygen species 3aseed coat1 aLi, Rong1 aXu, Tingting1 aZhang, Zhuo1 aWu, Ding,1 aPan, Siyi1 aXu, Xiaoyun0 tFood & function.g2021 Aug. 31, v. 12, no. 17 p.8196-8207dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo01322j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006400147245012800211300001600339520178500355592002802140596004102168596004102209596005702250650001202307650002402319650001402343650001902357650001102376650001402387650001502401650001902416650001602435650001602451650000902467650002402476650002002500650002202520700002602542700002202568700002402590773012802614856008202742852000902824655001202833IND60630530220221116140006.0190817e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063053022DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-018-3850-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerhongaray, Gonzalo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3662-858310aBelow-ground carbon inputs contribute more than above-ground inputs to soil carbon accrual in a bioenergy poplar plantation  ap. 363-378.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Soil organic carbon (SOC) accrual is central to the discussion on active atmospheric CO₂ removal strategies, but it requires a clear understanding of the mechanisms driving new SOC formation. SOC is formed from the decomposition of above- and below-ground plant inputs, yet their accurate quantification remains a major challenge. In the current study the in-growth soil core and δ¹³C methods were combined to quantify the net C input from single or combined above- and below-ground parts of a poplar (Populus) bioenergy plantation. METHODS: Three different mesh sizes were used for the in-growth cores in four different treatments designed to estimate the relative contributions of above-ground litter fall, fine roots and mycorrhizae (C3 input from the poplar) to the new C formation in cores filled with a C4 soil, by applying a mass balance equation. RESULTS: Soil C formation was higher in the treatments with roots as compared to the treatments with above-ground C inputs only (29 vs 16 g C m⁻²), despite the disproportionally lower root inputs as compared to above-ground C inputs (34 vs 175 g C m⁻² y⁻¹). Soil C formation from different sources (above- and below-ground) was additive; i.e. the observed soil C formation in the combined treatment was the sum of those in the single soil C input treatments. As a result, below-ground C-inputs had a high conversion efficiency to SOC of 76%. Above-ground plant inputs had a very low SOC formation efficiency of 9%, and were presumably mainly mineralized by microorganisms. CONCLUSION: The higher soil C accumulation rates from below-ground C inputs are particularly important in bioenergy plantations where the above-ground biomass is frequently removed for biomass and energy production.  aPublisher supplied data  a233366cEuropean Research Council ()  aZW09-06cFlemish Hercules Foundation  a2009-1655/001-001cEuropean Union Mobility Programme 3aPopulus 3aaboveground biomass 3abioenergy 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3aequations 3afine roots 3amicroorganisms 3amycorrhizae 3aplantations 3asoil 3asoil organic carbon 3astable isotopes 3aunderground parts1 aCotrufo, Francesca M.1 aJanssens, Ivan A.1 aCeulemans, Reinhart0 tPlant and soil.g2019 Jan., v. 434, no. 1-2 p.363-378dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-018-3850-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03767naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245011300210300001200323520178400335592002802119650003102147650001802178650001402196650001502210650001702225650002902242650001802271650001502289650001602304650002302320651003202343651001002375651001002385700001702395700003502412700002002447700001902467700001602486700002002502700001702522700002502539700001702564700002402581700002302605700002102628700001902649700001902668700003202687700001902719700002202738700002202760700002202782700001902804700001802823700001902841700002102860773014402881856008303025852000903108655001203117IND60753523020221116141202.0211023e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075352302DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-021-03164-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDusthackeer, Azger1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3616-367510aMycobacterium tuberculosis strain lineage in mixed tribal population across India and Andaman Nicobar Island  ap. 192.  aIn India, the tribal population constitutes almost 8.6% of the nation’s total population. Despite their large presence, there are only a few reports available on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) strain prevalence in Indian tribal communities considering the mobile nature of this population and also the influence of the mainstream populations they coexist within many areas for their livelihood. This study attempts to provide critical information pertaining to the TB strain diversity, its public health implications, and distribution among the tribal population in eleven Indian states and Andaman & Nicobar (A&N) Island. The study employed a population-based molecular approach. Clinical isolates were received from 66 villages (10 states and Island) and these villages were selected by implying situation analysis. A total of 78 M. tb clinical isolates were received from 10 different states and A&N Island. Among these, 16 different strains were observed by spoligotyping technique. The major M. tb strains spoligotype belong to the Beijing, CAS1_DELHI, and EAI5 family of M. tb strains followed by EAI1_SOM, EAI6_BGD1, LAM3, LAM6, LAM9, T1, T2, U strains. Drug-susceptibility testing (DST) results showed almost 15.4% of clinical isolates found to be resistant to isoniazid (INH) or rifampicin (RMP) + INH. Predominant multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) isolates seem to be Beijing strain. Beijing, CAS1_DELHI, EAI3_IND, and EAI5 were the principal strains infecting mixed tribal populations across India. Despite the small sample size, this study has demonstrated higher diversity among the TB strains with significant MDR-TB findings. Prevalence of Beijing MDR-TB strains in Central, Southern, Eastern India and A&N Island indicates the transmission of the TB strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3abiotechnology 3aisoniazid 3alivelihood 3amicrobiology 3amultiple drug resistance 3apublic health 3arifampicin 3asample size 3astrain differences 3aAndaman and Nicobar Islands 3aChina 3aIndia1 aKumar, Ashok1 aMohanvel, Sucharitha Kannappan1 aMahizhaveni, B.1 aShivakumar, S.1 aRaghavi, S.1 aAzhagendran, S.1 aVetrivel, S.1 aRao, Vikas Gangadhar1 aYadav, Rajiv1 aPaluru, Vijayachari1 aPurthy, Anil Jacob1 aHussain, Tahziba1 aKashyap, Vivek1 aDevi, K.

In addition, we compare intraspecific morphological divergence and calling song properties between individuals from different sites of the Pantanal of Poconé, Mato Grosso, Brazil. Regression analysis showed that the dominant and maximum calling song frequencies were negatively correlated with tegmen size, i.e. frequencies are either lower or higher depending on the corresponding size variation in resonance structures of the forewings. Canonical variable analysis demonstrated marked intraspecific differences in morphometric characters between localities of a L. inalata subpopulation c. 35 km apart (SESC-Pantanal Advanced Research Base and Pouso Alegre Farm, Mato Grosso, Brazil). Lerneca inalata beripocone at SESC had larger forewings than conspecifics from Pouso Alegre Farm. These morphological variations of wing properties related to reproductive behaviours were interpreted as fitness parameters, likely shaped by restricted gene flow during temporal habitat isolation episodes. Such isolation patterns occur in the Pantanal wetlands for several months during the annual hydrological cycle.  aThis work was supported by the Brazilian National Research Council, CNPq, Brasilia, Brazil [grant 704792/2009]; Science without Borders’ Program, CNPq, Brasilia, Brazil [grants 400019/2013-2 (KLS), 400037/2013-0 (OJ), 400017/2013-0 (TDG)]; National Institute for Science and Technology of Wetlands [INAU/CNPq/MCTIC], Brazil; Post-graduate Program in Agricultural Sciences of the Federal University of Recôncavo da Bahia, Brazil; Biota of Orthoptera from Brazil-SISBIOTA [MCT/CNPq/MMA/MEC/CAPES/FNDCT; FAPEMIG - Ação Transversal 47/2010, Proc. 563360/2010-0 (FAP)]; PROTAX/CNPq 440664/2015-2]; and the Brehm Funds for International Bird Conservation, Bonn, Germany; CNPq, Brasilia, Brazil [400017/2013-0,400019/2013-2,400037/2013-0,704792/2009].  aPublisher supplied data  a704792/2009cBrazilian National Research Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003593  a400019/2013-2 (KLS)cScience without Borders’ Program  a400017/2013-0 400019/2013-2 400037/2013-0 704792/2009cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológicodhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003593 3aGryllidae 3acorrelation 3afarms 3agene flow 3ahabitats 3ahydrologic cycle 3aintraspecific variation 3amorphometry 3aregression analysis 3areproductive behavior 3ategmen 3awetlands 3awings 3aBrazil 3aPantanal 0aBioacoustics 0ageometric morphometrics 0aGrylloidea 0aPantanal wetlands1 aSchuchmann, Karl-L.1 aTissiani, Ana Silvia1 aNunes, Lorena Andrade1 aJahn, Olaf1 aGanchev, Todor D.1 aLhano, Marcos Gonçalves1 aMarques, Marinêz I.0 tJournal of natural history.g2018 May 27, v. 52, no. 19-20 p.1225-1241dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12296x1464-52627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222933.2018.14577283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01999naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245006600171300001600237520116900253592002801422650001201450650001901462650001401481650002501495650001301520773009801533856008101631852000901712655001201721IND60555460020221119092624.0161028e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055546002DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-016-1744-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Ruijven, Bas J.10aMind the gap – the case for medium level emission scenarios  ap. 361-367.  aIn this essay I argue that the research on emission scenarios over the past few years has focused on low emission scenarios while producing few medium level emission scenarios. As a consequence, there is a gap in the literature on emission scenarios which prohibits answering several basic questions. This relative lack of medium emission scenarios is problematic for three reasons. First, scientific integrity, as the research community should produce scenarios along the full range of future options. Second, there is currently a very limited number of scenarios that describe real-world conditions of imperfect climate policy combined with technology restrictions. Finally, I observe a growing mismatch between the mitigation research focus on low emission scenarios and research to impacts and adaptation on medium and high emission scenarios. If this trend continues, it will be difficult to draw overarching conclusions from mitigation and impacts research in IPCCs 6th Assessment Report. Therefore, this essay ends with several recommendations for the mitigation research community to stimulate production and publication of medium level emission scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aemissions 3aenvironmental policy 3aresearch0 tClimatic change.g2016 Oct., v. 138, no. 3-4 p.361-367dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-016-1744-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100007000142245022900212300001600441500002000457520165600477592002802133596005302161650001202214650001502226650000802241650001902249650001902268650001302287650001502300650000902315650001502324651001102339700005902350700005502409773012902464856007702593852000902670655001202679IND60789540920221120030719.0220821e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078954092DNAL7 a10.1002/2017JF0045122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBessette‐Kirton, Erin K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2797-069410aUsing Stereo Satellite Imagery to Account for Ablation, Entrainment, and Compaction in Volume Calculations for Rock Avalanches on Glaciers: Application to the 2016 Lamplugh Rock Avalanche in Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska  ap. 622-641.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe use of preevent and postevent digital elevation models (DEMs) to estimate the volume of rock avalanches on glaciers is complicated by ablation of ice before and after the rock avalanche, scour of material during rock avalanche emplacement, and postevent ablation and compaction of the rock avalanche deposit. We present a model to account for these processes in volume estimates of rock avalanches on glaciers. We applied our model by calculating the volume of the 28 June 2016 Lamplugh rock avalanche in Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska. We derived preevent and postevent 2‐m resolution DEMs from WorldView satellite stereo imagery. Using data from DEM differencing, we reconstructed the rock avalanche and adjacent surfaces at the time of occurrence by accounting for elevation changes due to ablation and scour of the ice surface, and postevent deposit changes. We accounted for uncertainties in our DEMs through precise coregistration and an assessment of relative elevation accuracy in bedrock control areas. The rock avalanche initially displaced 51.7 ± 1.5 Mm³ of intact rock and then scoured and entrained 13.2 ± 2.2 Mm³ of snow and ice during emplacement. We calculated the total deposit volume to be 69.9 ± 7.9 Mm³. Volume estimates that did not account for topographic changes due to ablation, scour, and compaction underestimated the deposit volume by 31.0–46.8 Mm³. Our model provides an improved framework for estimating uncertainties affecting rock avalanche volume measurements in glacial environments. These improvements can contribute to advances in the understanding of rock avalanche hazards and dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data  cU.S. Geological Survey Landslide Hazards Program 3abedrock 3ageophysics 3aice 3anational parks 3aremote sensing 3aresearch 3asatellites 3asnow 3atopography 3aAlaska1 aCoe, Jeffrey A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0842-96081 aZhou, Wendy1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8226-375X0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2018 Apr., v. 123, no. 4 p.622-641dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27941x2169-90037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JF0045123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002200156245008400178300001600262500002000278520138200298592002801680650001301708650001201721650001601733650002201749650002401771650001501795650001101810650001101821650001801832651001201850700001901862773011501881856009101996852000902087655001202096IND60594546520221116171402.0180619e197909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059454652DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-6584.1979.tb03343.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuntoon, Peter W.10aEvolution of Ground‐Water Management Policy for Laramie, Wyoming, 1869‐1979  ap. 470-475.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFor 110 years, Laramie, Wyoming, has obtained most of its municipal water from the Casper aquifer. As demands on the supply increased, the philosophies governing the management of the aquifer gradually changed. There has been an evolution through the following policies: (1) initial inflow‐outflow safe yield concept, (2) simple conjunctive‐use ground‐ and surface‐water system, and (3) the beginnings of a conjunctive‐use system that relies heavily on the storage properties of the aquifer. The evolution of management policy resulted from the press of changing demands on the system rather than innovative technical or scientific insights. Most technical advice solicited by the city in the past dealt with the immediate problem of how to augment the total supply. Through experience, the city became aware of the physical response and storage properties inherent in the aquifer, and by 1940 peak demands were being met by pumpage of water from storage. The city is currently weighing the advantages of purchasing additional surface‐water rights, and has seriously asked its advisors if the aquifer can be managed solely as a peak‐use reservoir. Under the proposed regime, large volumes of water would be withdrawn periodically from storage to meet summer and drought demands, while normal demands would be met from impounded surface water in the Laramie River.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3adrought 3agroundwater 3aissues and policy 3apublic water supply 3apurchasing 3arivers 3asummer 3asurface water 3aWyoming1 aLundyb, Don A.0 tGround water.g1979 Sept., v. 17, no. 5 p.470-475dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl49631x0017-467X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.1979.tb03343.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03199naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245011800181300001600299520181600315592002802131650002102159650001002180650003102190650002202221650001402243650002302257650001702280650001202297650002802309650002802337650001302365651001002378653001602388653000802404653001902412700002802431700002002459700002702479700002102506773013202527856008502659852000902744655001202753IND60744692020221120232635.0210716e20210704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074469202DNAL7 a10.1080/15378020.2020.18599722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGyebi, Barbara Efua Akyaa10aKnowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) of foodservice providers, and microbial quality on food served in Kumasi  ap. 397-413.  aPoor Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices (KAP) of food safety and hygiene by foodservice providers lead to food contamination and pose health threats to consumers. This study assessed the KAP on food safety and hygiene, and microbial quality of food sold by formal and informal foodservice providers in Kumasi, Ghana. Eighty-one (81) foodservice providers were conveniently selected from ten different foodservice establishments. KAP on food safety and hygiene practices was assessed with a structured-questionnaire, while practices were observed with a prepared checklist. Food samples were collected and analyzed for microbiological counts (aerobic and coliform) and the detection of Staphylococcus species. About 58.7% of participants reported good knowledge versus 41.3% reporting little knowledge; 32.4% reported good attitude versus 67.6% bad attitude, and 54.6% reported good practices versus 43.4% poor practices. More informal foodservice providers (51.7%,34.5%,55.2%) had knowledge (p = .012), attitude (p = .798), and practices (p = .003) of food safety and practices below the 40ᵗʰ percentile than those of formal food service (23.1%,32.7%,19.2%) respectively. Food samples tested recorded high microbial counts for total aerobes and coliform counts and failed to meet ISO, GSA, and FDA safety standards. S. aureus, E. coli, S. epidermidis, and E. faecalis were identified in food samples. A weak, negative correlation (r = −0.231,p < .05) existed between attitude score and S. species present. Poor KAP and microbial contamination were observed among food providers although the informal food provision was poorer. Bad attitude by foodservice providers was associated with poorer microbial quality of tested food. Education, monitoring, and stringent enforcement of HACCP are recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aHACCP 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3acoliform bacteria 3aeducation 3afood contamination 3afood service 3ahygiene 3amicrobial contamination 3amicrobiological quality 3aresearch 3aGhana 0aFood safety 0aKAP 0amicrobial load1 aAnnan, Reginald Adjetey1 aApprey, Charles1 aAsamoah-Boakye, Odeafo1 aAsare, Chris Yaw0 tJournal of foodservice business research.g2021 July 04, v. 24, no. 4 p.397-413dRoutledgewJournal:J000000105x1537-80397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15378020.2020.18599723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002500184245014700209506007600356520115800432592002801590506003701618650003201655650002201687650001101709650002201720650001301742650001301755650001501768650001101783650002201794650002401816650000901840650003501849650002501884700002301909700002001932700002401952700002201976773012001998856007702118852000902195655001202204IND60670078120221207121810.0190925e20190905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067007812DNAL7 a10.3390/genes100906812doi7 aPMC67707052pmcid7 a314919992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarquardt, Sabin  A.10aPreviously Identified Genetic Variants in <i>ADGRL3</i> Are not Associated with Risk for Equine Degenerative Myeloencephalopathy across Breeds  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEquine neuroaxonal dystrophy/equine degenerative myeloencephalopathy (eNAD/EDM) is a neurologic disease that has been reported in young horses from a wide range of breeds. The disease is inherited and associated with vitamin E deficiency during the first two years of life, resulting in bilateral symmetric ataxia. A missense mutation (chr3:71,917,591 C > T) within adhesion G protein-coupled receptor L3 (ADGRL3) was recently associated with risk for EDM in the Caspian breed. In order to confirm these findings, genotyping of this missense mutation, along with the three other associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genomic region, was carried out on 31 postmortem-confirmed eNAD/EDM cases and 43 clinically phenotyped controls from various breeds. No significant association was found between eNAD/EDM confirmed cases and genotype at any of the four identified SNPs (P > 0.05), including the nonsynonymous variant (EquCab2.0 chr3:71,917,591; allelic P = 0.85). These findings suggest that the four SNPs, including the missense variant in the ADGRL3 region, are not associated with risk for eNAD/EDM across multiple breeds of horses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aataxia (disorder) 3abreeds 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ahorses 3amissense mutation 3amyeloencephalopathy 3arisk 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3avitamin E deficiency1 aWilcox, Callie  V.1 aBurns, Erin  N.1 aPeterson, Janel  A.1 aFinno, Carrie  J.0 tGenes.g2019 Sept. 05, v. 10, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes100906813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006300142245015600205520140800361592002801769596003001797650004401827650002201871650002001893650001501913650001001928650001901938650001901957650001101976650001301987650000702000650001802007650003302025650001302058650001302071650002302084650001702107650001902124650002502143700002402168700001902192700001902211773012002230856007602350852000902426655001202435IND60698081120221120100709.0200609e20200530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069808112DNAL7 a10.1155/2020/88406662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdokpayi, Joshua N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2550-398814aThe Equilibrium, Kinetics, and Thermodynamics Studies of the Sorption of Methylene Blue from Aqueous Solution Using Pulverized Raw Macadamia Nut Shells  aIn this study, the potential for pulverized raw macadamia nut shell (MNS) for the sequestration of methylene blue from aqueous media was assessed. The sorbent was characterized using scanning electron microscopy for surface morphology, functional group analysis was performed with a Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) isotherm was used for surface area elucidation. The effects of contact time, sorbent dosage, particle size, pH, and change in a solution matrix were studied. Equilibrium data were fitted using Temkin, Langmuir, and Freundlich adsorption isotherm models. The sorption kinetics was studied using the Lagergren pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, Elovich, and intraparticle diffusion models. The feasibility of the study was established from the thermodynamic studies. A surface area of 2.763 m²/g was obtained. The equilibrium and kinetics of sorption was best described by the Langmuir and the pseudo-second-order models, respectively. The sorption process was spontaneous (−ΔG0=28.72−31.77 kJ/mol) and endothermic in nature (ΔH0=17.45 kJ/mol). The positive value of ΔS0 (0.15 kJ/molK) implies increased randomness of the sorbate molecules at the surface of the sorbent. This study presents sustainable management of wastewater using MNS as a potential low-cost sorbent for dye decontamination from aqueous solution.  aPublisher supplied data  aI595cUniversity of Venda 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aaqueous solutions 3adecontamination 3aendothermy 3ahulls 3amacadamia nuts 3amethylene blue 3amodels 3amoieties 3apH 3aparticle size 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorbents 3asorption 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3athermodynamics 3awastewater treatment1 aAlayande, Samson O.1 aAdetoro, Ahmed1 aOdiyo, John O.0 tJournal of Analytical Methods in Chemistry (Online).g2020 May 30, v. 2020dHindawiwJournal:26807x2090-88737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/88406663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03105naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100009600155245012500251500002200376520136700398592002801765650001801793650001901811650003001830650001301860650001901873650001101892650001101903650001701914650001201931650001201943650000901955650001401964650001501978650001101993650001402004650000902018653003102027653001502058653001602073653003402089653002102123700002102144700001902165700002302184700009502207700009602302773007802398856009002476852000902566655001202575IND60659301820221119224915.0190822e20190816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065930182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1246062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInoue, Daisuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9216-8198 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9216-819810aStimulatory and inhibitory effects of metals on 1,4-dioxane degradation by four different 1,4-dioxane-degrading bacteria  aPre-press version  aThis study evaluates the effects of various metals on 1,4-dioxane degradation by the following four bacteria: Pseudonocardia sp. D17; Pseudonocardia sp. N23; Mycobacterium sp. D6; and Rhodococcus aetherivorans JCM 14343. Eight transition metals [Co(II), Cu(II), Fe(II), Fe(III), Mn(II), Mo(VI), Ni(II), and Zn(II)] were used as the test metals. Results revealed, for the first time, that metals had not only inhibitory but also stimulatory effects on 1,4-dioxane biodegradation. Cu(II) had the most severe inhibitory effects on 1,4-dioxane degradation by all of the test strains, with significant inhibition at concentrations as low as 0.01–0.1 mg/L. This inhibition was probably caused by cellular toxicity at higher concentrations, and by inhibition of degradative enzymes at lower concentrations. In contrast, Fe(III) enhanced 1,4-dioxane degradation by Mycobacterium sp. D6 and R. aetherivorans JCM 14343 the most, while degradation by the two Pseudonocardia strains was stimulated most notably in the presence of Mn(II), even at concentrations as low as 0.001 mg/L. Enhanced degradation is likely caused by the stimulation of soluble di-iron monooxygenases (SDIMOs) involved in the initial oxidation of 1,4-dioxane. Differences in the stimulatory effects of the tested metals were likely associated with the particular SDIMO types in the test strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium 3aPseudonocardia 3aRhodococcus aetherovorans 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3acobalt 3acopper 3acytotoxicity 3adioxane 3aenzymes 3airon 3amanganese 3amolybdenum 3anickel 3aoxidation 3azinc 0a1,4-Dioxane biodegradation 0aInhibition 0aStimulation 0aSoluble di-iron monooxygenase 0aTransition metal1 aTsunoda, Tsubasa1 aSawada, Kazuko1 aYamamoto, Norifumi1 aSei, Kazunari1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0684-6002 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0684-60021 aIke, Michihiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6237-8103 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6237-81030 tChemosphere.g2019 Aug. 16, dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1246063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03246naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245010100167520173800268592002802006650002002034650001902054650002202073650001102095650001902106650002902125650002202154650001702176650001402193650001702207650001102224650001602235651001002251651001802261653001702279653002702296653002802323653002502351653001802376700001502394700005502409700005702464700001902521700001902540773009702559856008702656852000902743655001202752IND60687902420221120192804.0200419e20200515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068790242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1148522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yanmei10aSpatial characteristics of CO2 emissions and PM2.5 concentrations in China based on gridded data  aOwing to global climate change and increased environmental pollution, China faces the dual responsibility of reducing CO₂ emissions and controlling PM₂.₅ pollution. This study compares the spatial characteristics of PM₂.₅ concentrations and CO₂ emissions using 10 km × 10 km grid data. The increase and decrease of CO₂ emissions and PM₂.₅ concentrations are divided into four quadrants, which indicates four different conditions. Then, spatial autocorrelation method is conducted to analysis the spatial relationships. The empirical results show that (1) In the four quadrants, the increase of CO₂ emissions and the decrease of PM₂.₅ concentrations accounted for the highest proportion (25.9%). (2) The spatial differences in CO₂ emissions are large, but the PM₂.₅ concentrations show strong spatial aggregation. (3) China’s three major urban agglomerations contain more than half of the areas in which both CO₂ emissions and PM₂.₅ concentrations increased, and the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration exhibits the best synergistic reduction effect. By contrast, the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei urban agglomeration has the worst synergistic reduction of CO₂ emissions and PM₂.₅ concentrations. (4) At the urban level, as a typical city in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei urban agglomeration, Tianjin's overreliance on heavy chemical industries has led to co-increases in its CO₂ emissions and PM₂.₅ concentrations. Shaoxing and Jiangmen, in the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration, are among the few cities where CO₂ emissions and PM₂.₅ concentrations have both been reduced. Finally, this paper suggests some policy implications of these findings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical industry 3acities 3aclimate change 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aissues and policy 3aparticulates 3apollution 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3aurban areas 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aGridded data 0aFour-quadrant analysis 0aSpatial autocorrelation 0aPM2.5 concentrations 0aCO2 emissions1 aCui, Yifei1 aCai, Bofeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3475-069X1 aGuo, Jingpeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0676-31001 aCheng, Tianhai1 aZheng, Fengjie0 tApplied energy.g2020 May 15, v. 266 p.114852-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1148523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02239naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009600168300001800264520132300282592002801605650001501633650001701648650002301665650001601688700001601704700001201720773012701732856008101859852000901940655001201949IND60600082420221121203310.0180702e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060008242DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-018-1997-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Chuanxiong13aAn Efficient Linearization Method for Long-Term Operation of Cascaded Hydropower Reservoirs  ap. 3391-3404.  aThe hydropower reservoir operation is a challenging optimization problem due to the nonlinear factors, where the water head, reservoir storage, release, generating capacity, and water rate are interconnected. To solve such a difficult problem in an efficient and stable way based on mathematical programming, efficient linearization method with high accuracy is of vital importance. This paper simplifies the hydropower output as the function of average reservoir storage and release, and presents an efficient piecewise linearization method that concaves the hydropower output function with a series of planes, which transforms the original nonlinear problem into a linear programming one without introducing any integer variables. The presented method is applied to a long-term hydropower scheduling (LHS) problem with 7 cascaded reservoirs, and a nonlinear direct search procedure is then employed to search further. The performance is compared with that of another linearization method that uses special ordered sets of type two, case study shows that LHS using the presented linearization method runs much faster and obtains results very close to that of the latter one. The presented method, as a high performance exact algorithm, should be very promising in solving the real-world hydropower operation problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3alinear programming 3awater power1 aChen, Cheng1 aZhi'an,0 tWater resources management.g2018 Aug., v. 32, no. 10 p.3391-3404dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-018-1997-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002300175245008700198300001400285520131400299592002801613650001901641650001201660650001801672650001001690650001401700650001101714650001201725650002601737700002201763773014801785856006801933856010202001990002302103852000902126655001202135IND60643236420221120054249.0190510e20100516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064323642DNAL7 a10.3791/19322doi7 aPMC31528662pmcid7 a204797042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViczian, Andrea S.10aTissue determination using the animal cap transplant (act) assay in Xenopus laevis  ap. e1932.  aMany proteins play a dual role in embryonic development. Those that regulate cell fate determination in a specific tissue can also affect the development of a larger region of the embryo. This makes defining its role in a particular tissue difficult to analyze. For example, noggin overexpression in Xenopus laevis embryos causes the expansion of the entire anterior region, including the eye1,2. From this result, it is not known if Noggin plays a direct role in eye determination or that by causing an expansion of neural tissue, Noggin indirectly affects eye formation. Having this complex phenotype makes studying its eye-specific role in cell fate determination difficult to analyze. We have developed an assay that overcomes this problem. Taking advantage of the pluripotent nature of the Xenopus laevis animal cap 3, we have developed an assay to test the ability of gene product(s), like noggin or the eye field transcription factors (EFTFs), to transform caps into particular tissue or cell types by transplanting this tissue onto the side of the embryo 4. While we have found either Noggin protein treatment or a collection of transcription factors can determine retinal cell fate in animal caps, this procedure could be used to identify gene product(s) involved in specifying other tissues as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXenopus laevis 3aanimals 3aembryogenesis 3agenes 3aphenotype 3aretina 3atissues 3atranscription factors1 aZuber, Michael E.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2010 May 16, , no. 39 p.e1932-e1932dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/19323Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/1932/tissue-determination-using-animal-cap-transplant-act-assay-xenopus  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03233naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245008100198506007600279520153900355592002801894506003701922650002301959650001601982650001601998650002402014650001502038650001402053650002402067650002402091650001402115650003102129650001702160650001502177650002002192650001802212650002302230650001302253650001302266650002002279650003102299650002202330650001702352650001102369650000902380700002602389700002402415700002202439773012302461856007402584852000902658655001202667IND60650592920221207141254.0190710e20180904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065059292DNAL7 a10.3390/nu100912242doi7 aPMC61653632pmcid7 a301814612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPisano, Anna10aBiotic Supplements for Renal Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIntestinal dysbiosis is highly pervasive among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and may play a key role in disease progression and complications. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate effects of biotic supplements on a large series of outcomes in renal patients. Ovid-MEDLINE, PubMed and CENTRAL databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any biotic (pre-, pro- or synbiotics) to standard therapy or placebo. Primary endpoints were change in renal function and cardiovascular events; secondary endpoints were change in proteinuria/albuminuria, inflammation, uremic toxins, quality of life and nutritional status. Seventeen eligible studies (701 participants) were reviewed. Biotics treatment did not modify estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (mean difference (MD) 0.34 mL/min/1.73 m2; 95% CI &minus;0.19, 0.86), serum creatinine (MD &minus;0.13 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval (CI) &minus;0.32, 0.07), C-reactive protein (MD 0.75 mg/dL; 95% CI &minus;1.54, 3.03) and urea (standardized MD (SMD) &minus;0.02; 95% CI &minus;0.25, 0.20) as compared to control. Outcome data on the other endpoints of interest were lacking, sparse or in an unsuitable format to be analyzed collectively. According to the currently available evidence, there is no conclusive rationale for recommending biotic supplements for improving outcomes in renal patients.

Because Mn and Fe problems are commonly associated with thermal stratification in summer and autumn, they frequently coincide with the presence of cyanobacteria. The use of KMnO4 as an oxidant for Mn and Fe control therefore needs to consider the potential impacts on cyanobacterial cell integrity and toxin release. This study aims to assess the effect of KMnO4 on cyanobacteria cell integrity, toxin release and toxin oxidation. A toxic strain of Microcystis aeruginosa was exposed to various concentrations of KMnO4 and the cell integrity of cyanobacteria was measured with flow cytometry. Further the intra- and extra-cellular toxin concentrations were quantified and it was apparent that KMnO4 reduced both the intra- and extra-cellular toxins at low initial concentrations of 1 and 3mgL−1 without complete cell lysis. However, the cell integrity of cyanobacteria was compromised at KMnO4 concentrations of 5mgL−1 and 10mgL−1 and led to intracellular toxin release. In the 10mgL−1 KMnO4 treatment, the total toxin was oxidised after 7h contact time. A model describing the two step process of release and degradation was developed and may provide a tool to assess the risk water quality posed by toxin release. Consequently, it may be possible to use KMnO4 as a pre-treatment for Mn and Fe at concentrations<3mgL−1 and short contact time when cyanobacteria are also present.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrocystis aeruginosa 3aautumn 3adrinking water 3aflow cytometry 3airon 3amanganese 3amodels 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3apotassium permanganate 3apretreatment 3arisk 3asummer 3atemperature profiles 3atoxicity 3atoxins 3awater quality 3awater supply 2aBacterial Toxinsxmetabolism 2aMicrocystisxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aOxidantsxmetabolism 2aPotassium Permanganatexmetabolism 0aCyanobacteria 0aCyanotoxins 0aPotassium permanganate 0aCell integrity 0aPretreatment1 aDaly, Robert1 aHobson, Peter1 aHo, Lionel1 aBrookes, Justin0 tChemosphere.g2013 July, v. 92 p.529-534dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.03.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03280naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245012300171500001400294506002800308506003200336520148400368592002801852596008301880506003701963650000902000650001302009650001602022650001602038650001302054650001302067650002002080650001102100650002202111650002402133650001702157650001502174650000902189650001402198700002202212700001802234700002502252700002402277700003602301700002902337700002602366700002102392700001402413700002302427700001902450773012202469856008002591903002202671852000902693655001202702IND60724367420221207072926.0210122e20210108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072436742DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110101122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReddy, Kambham  Raja10aMorpho-Physiological Characterization of Diverse Rice Genotypes for Seedling Stage High- and Low-Temperature Tolerance  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Access  aMDPI AG License Information  aExtreme temperatures are considered one of the main constraints that limit the growth and development of rice. We elucidated the root and shoot developmental plasticity of 64 rice genotypes during early seedling establishment, using the sunlit plant growth chambers at 22/14 (low), 30/22 (optimum), and 38/30 °C (high) day/night temperatures. Low temperature severely inhibited 23 traits, such as shoot (68%), root (57%), and physiological (35%) attributes. On the contrary, the high temperature positively affected most of the shoot (48%) and root (31%) traits, except root diameter and root/shoot ratio, compared with the optimum. Alternatively, leaf chlorophyll fluorescence-associated parameters declined under low (34%) and high (8%) temperatures. A weak correlation between cumulative high-temperature response index (CHTRI) and cumulative low-temperature response index (CLTRI) indicates the operation of different low- and high-temperature tolerance mechanisms at the early seedling stage. Groups of distinct rice genotypes associated with low or high-temperature tolerance were selected based on CHTRI and CLTRI. The genotypes that commonly performed well under low and high temperatures (IR65600-81-5-2-3, CT18593-1-7-2-2-5, RU1504114, RU1504122, Bowman, and INIA Tacuari) will be valuable genetic resources for breeders in developing early-season high- and low-temperature-tolerant genotypes for a broad range of both tropical and temperate rice-growing environments.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInia 3aagronomy 3achlorophyll 3acorrelation 3adiameter 3agenotype 3agrowth chambers 3aleaves 3anight temperature 3aplant establishment 3aplant growth 3aplasticity 3arice 3aseedlings1 aSeghal, Akanksha 1 aJumaa, Salah 1 aBheemanahalli, Raju 1 aKakar, Naqeebullah 1 aRedoña, E.

It is necessary to correct them for many applications, such as the generation of large seamless mosaics of orthoimages, or land-cover classifications. This contribution describes a method for equalizing digital aerial images based on a parametric, semiempirical radiometric model. The model’s parameters are computed through a global least-squares minimization process, using radiometric tie-points in overlapping areas between images. The method may be called a “radiometric aerial triangulation” since its principle is quite similar to a standard aerial triangulation. It leads to a relative equalization between images, keeping their original contrast and color information. The method has been successfully applied operationally to more than forty projects comprising three to four thousands digital images each, for the creation of orthoimages over France. The results are good as long as atmospheric conditions are favorable and stable</i>.</p>  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3adigital images 3aland cover 3aleast squares 3amodels 3aorthophotography 3aradiometry 3areflectance 3atemporal variation 3aFrance1 aMartinoty, Gilles0 tPhotogrammetric engineering and remote sensing.g2009 Feb. 1, v. 75, no. 2 p.193-200dAmerican Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensingx0099-11127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.14358%2FPERS.75.2.1933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245010300166520138400269592002801653650001401681650001901695650001101714650002201725650002401747650001501771650002401786650002401810650001201834650001601846650002501862653003601887653002801923653003201951653002901983653001002012653001002022700002002032700001402052700001802066773009702084856008702181852000902268655001202277IND60687902620221120192712.0200419e20200515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068790262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1148732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Bo10aOptimal control of power-split hybrid electric powertrains with minimization of energy consumption  aThis paper presents a real-time optimization strategy that targets on short-term energy consumption for the power-split hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) by focusing the mechanical motion of the powertrains. Instead of long-term energy optimization, which is usually investigated in the literatures on state of charge (SoC) management problem of HEVs, a short-term behavior of energy consumption is focused under the assumption that SoC of the battery is enough to provide the electric power required by the optimization. To this end, the transient mechanical motion of the powertrain is considered in the optimization problem instead of the battery SoC. The proposed strategy consists of two layers: the prediction of driver’s power demand based on the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication and the optimization of energy consumption along the predicted power demand. To deal with the stochastic uncertainties in the driver’s power demand, Gaussian process regression model is developed for the prediction, and the optimization is formulated as a model predictive control problem with the mechanical model of the powertrain dynamics forced by the predicted driver’s demand. Finally, the simulation results are demonstrated where the driver’s demand is generated by a professional simulator under randomly eliminated traffic environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3aelectric power 3aenergy 3amechanical models 3anormal distribution 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asystem optimization 3atraffic 3auncertainty 3avehicles (equipment) 0aEnergy consumption minimization 0aHybrid electric vehicle 0aGaussian process regression 0aModel predictive control 0a00-01 0a99-001 aZhang, Jiangyan1 aXu, Fuguo1 aShen, Tielong0 tApplied energy.g2020 May 15, v. 266 p.114873-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1148733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03148naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245010300169500001400272520171000286592002801996650002602024650003002050650001302080650001902093650001402112650001202126650002002138650001402158650001902172650001502191650001502206650001402221651000902235651001202244651001302256651001002269651000902279651001502288651001002303651001302313651001702326651001202343651001002355651001002365700001902375773012202394856008002516961001302596852000902609655001202618IND60724367520221119081942.0210122e20210108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072436752DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110101142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShowler, Allan  T.10aIncidence and Ramifications of Armed Conflict in Countries with Major Desert Locust Breeding Areas  aNAL-light  aDespite many areas of progress in recent years, desert locust surveillance and control is impaired by many obstacles, the most intractable of which is insecurity. Insecurity involves rebellions, insurgencies, civil and international war, banditry, terrorism, and minefields. Obstruction of desert locust operations in breeding areas by ongoing armed conflict and landmines constitutes “direct” insecurity. “Indirect” insecurity, although less obvious, is arguably more broadly deleterious by debilitating government function and diverting funds, personnel, and equipment from desert locust management. Indirect “active” insecurity is armed conflict and civil unrest that is occurring at the same time as a desert locust episode, but not in the breeding areas. Indirect “inactive” insecurity refers to the after-effects of insecurity, including weak funding because of prior inattention to capacity maintenance during times of direct and indirect active insecurity, disabled or militarily-appropriated vehicles and other resources, destruction of infrastructure, and deployment of mines. We provide examples of direct and indirect insecurity across 35 years, from 1986 through May 2020, in 13 African and Asian countries (Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia, India, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Western Sahara, and Yemen) with desert locust breeding areas to illustrate the complexity, pervasiveness, and chronic occurrence of insecurity. The upsurge of 2020 is used to show how direct insecurity still contributes to the genesis and expansion of desert locust episodes. Possible mitigation of direct insecurity effects on some desert locust operations is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchistocerca gregaria 3aadministrative management 3aagronomy 3abreeding sites 3aequipment 3afunding 3ahuman resources 3aincidence 3ainfrastructure 3amonitoring 3aoccurrence 3aterrorism 3aChad 3aEritrea 3aEthiopia 3aIndia 3aMali 3aMauritania 3aNiger 3aPakistan 3aSaudi Arabia 3aSomalia 3aSudan 3aYemen1 aLecoq, Michel 0 tAgronomy.g2021 Jan. 08, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110101143Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03513naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100001200174245017200186300001600358520141600374592002801790650001201818650001401830650001901844650003501863650002601898650003101924650001001955650002401965650001401989650001502003650004302018650001902061650001302080650001502093650002902108650004102137650002402178650001802202650004602220650005202266650005202318650002102370650002802391650001402419650002602433650001602459650003102475650004102506653001102547653002502558653001202583653001202595653002002607653002002627700001602647700001402663773007602677856008902753852000902842655001202851IND60112210820221122173525.0160901e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011221082DNAL7 a236228792pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.03.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, R.10aDifferent transcriptional responses of heat shock protein 70/90 in the marine diatom Ditylum brightwellii exposed to metal compounds and endocrine-disrupting chemicals  ap. 535-543.  aEnvironmental hazard assessments using diatoms have been well documented; however, their molecular toxicology has not been sufficiently studied. In this study, we characterized heat shock protein (HSP) 70/90 of the diatom Ditylum brightwellii (Db) and evaluated their transcriptional profiles in response to various environmental stresses (e.g., thermal shocks and metal and non-metal pollutants). Putative DbHSP70 (658aa, 71.7kDa) and DbHSP90 (707aa, 80.2kDa) proteins had conserved HSP family motifs but different C-terminus motifs, that is, “EEVD” in DbHSP70 and “MEEVD” in DbHSP90. Phylogenetic analyses of both proteins showed that D. brightwellii was well clustered with other diatoms. Real-time PCR analysis showed that thermal stress considerably upregulated DbHSP70 and DbHSP90. As for chemical pollutants, DbHSP70 greatly responded to CuSO4 and NiSO4 exposure, but not CuCl2 or NiCl2. However, DbHSP90 was significantly upregulated by all the metal compounds tested (CuSO4, NiSO4, CuCl2, and NiCl2). Strikingly, the expression of both genes was not induced by the organic pollutants tested, such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals. These data suggest that DbHSP70 and DbHSP90 are differentially involved in the defense response against various environmental stressors. Moreover, metal toxicity may be specifically affected by the conjugated anion in the metal compounds (e.g., SO42- and Cl−).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDitylum 3achlorides 3acopper sulfate 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aenvironmental hazards 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aheat shock proteins 3aphylogeny 3apollutants 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3athermal stress 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAlgal Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aDiatomsxchemistryxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aHSP70 Heat-Shock Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aHSP90 Heat-Shock Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aMetalsxtoxicity 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aStress, Physiological 2aTemperature 2aTranscriptional Activation 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity 0aDiatom 0aDitylum brightwellii 0aDbHSP70 0aDbHSP90 0aGene expression 0aMetal compounds1 aLee, M.

Postharvest PB and subsequent decay in fruit are linked to reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in tissues. Antioxidants neutralize or scavenge ROS and maintain the shelf-life of fruit, especially in non-climacteric ones such as litchi. This work was aimed to assess the effect of vacuum infiltrated methyl jasmonate (MeJA; 1 and 2 mM) on the quality of harvested litchi fruit (cv. Purbi) during ambient storage (28 °C, RH 70–75%). The exogenous MeJA infiltration (2 mM) significantly retained quality attributes of litchi fruit as evident by lowered PB, weight loss, disease occurrence, quinone, and ROS (H₂O₂ and O₂⁻) accumulation. Moreover, MeJA infiltrated fruit suppressed the activity of polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase resulting in higher anthocyanin, phenolics, antioxidant potential, phenylalanine ammonia lyase activity as well as membrane integrity throughout the storage. Control fruit showed an early quality deterioration marked by prominent PB and other biochemical degradative changes. Thus, exogenous MeJA infiltration (2 mM) could be suggested to increase the shelf life of litchi by four days under ambient conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitchi 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3acatechol oxidase 3aconsumer acceptance 3adisease occurrence 3amethyl jasmonate 3amolecular biology 3apericarp 3aperoxidase 3aphenolic compounds 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3aphysiology 3aquinones 3areactive oxygen species 3ashelf life 3aweight loss1 aHoma, Fozia1 aGhatak, Abhijeet1 aAftab, M.

To verify the SERS activity, organic analytes, such as Rhodamine 6G (R6G), crystal violet (CV), and methylene blue (MB), were selected as the probe molecules. Surprisingly, the detection limit of R6G reached as low as 1 × 10–¹⁷ M in SERS tests with the excitation wavelength of 532 nm, which was superior to the data reported in most literature, indicating an ultra-high SERS sensitivity. XPS, WAXD, SEM, and EDS revealed that evenly distributed nanoparticles with 203 nm based on the Cu-Ag alloy were successfully formed on the Cu layer of the polymer. Besides, the RSD values of the main characteristic peaks of R6G were less than 0.20, showing a good reproducibility of the prepared SERS substrate. This SERS substrate also demonstrated good stability because it still kept a high SERS sensitivity after 35 days of air storage. Moreover, this new substrate showed the potential for reuse and probably addressed the problem that the traditional SERS substrate can only be used once. We believe this facile and reliable approach to preparing a new SERS substrate will have prospects for large-scale production and applications in the field of analytics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aalloys 3achemical species 3adetection limit 3agentian violet 3agreen chemistry 3amethylene blue 3apolymers 3arhodamines 3awavelengths 0aLaser-induced 0aSelective metallization 0aPolymer 0aSERS 0aUltra-high sensitivity 0aR6G1 aLi, Ruilong1 aJia, Liyang1 aZheng, Zhuo1 aZhou, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3581-29250 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 9, no. 14 p.5038-5049dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c086243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245011700160300001600277520147200293592002801765650002301793650001201816650001101828650001901839650001701858700002201875700002301897700002001920700002101940700002101961773016201982856008002144852000902224655001202233IND60480576320221120210559.0160128e20090301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048057632DNAL7 a10.14358/PERS.75.3.3132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yaguang10aEffects of Mismatches of Scale and Location between Predictor and Response Variables on Forest Structure Mapping  ap. 313-322.  a<p><i>Measurement error introduced by mismatches of scale and location between response and predictor variables is one of the major sources of error in forest structure mapping. It affects the evaluation of analytical models, compromises the results of accuracy assessments, and reduces the accuracy of mapping products. Using forest structure attributes measured in a specifically-designed ground plot system, we isolated the measurement error from the total mapping errors that are related to multiple factors, and examined the distribution and magnitude of this error caused by a scale mismatch between a relatively larger forest unit and a relatively smaller forest unit, as well as location mismatch of a specific distance between two forest units of the same size. We demonstrated the effects of measurement error on the analytical models and resulting maps for three common mapping scenarios linking ground data with remote sensing imagery. Our results indicated that this scale- and location-related error can be analyzed using the Classical and Berkson error models in most practical mapping exercises involving data measured on-ground and remotely-sensed imagery, and that the distinct error pattern of each type of measurement error can be used to identify the major error source. Based on this analysis, we can adjust the plot design or adjust the resolution of imagery, and select the optimal analytical method to achieve the best mapping result.</i></p>  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aforests 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data1 aDickson, Brett G.1 aHampton, Haydee M.1 aSisk, Thomas D.1 aPalumbo, Jean A.1 aPrather, John W.0 tPhotogrammetric engineering and remote sensing.g2009 Mar. 1, v. 75, no. 3 p.313-322dAmerican Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensingx0099-11127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.14358%2FPERS.75.3.3133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245012500207500001400332520116800346592002801514650002501542650005301567650001801620650001401638650004101652650001601693650002701709650001501736650001701751650002301768653004101791653004201832653004401874653003001918653002701948653001901975700001801994700001902012700006702031700002002098773011202118856008302230852000902313655001202322IND60722080120221122231426.0210212e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072208012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2020.1161622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStilo, Federico1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2393-466910aUntargeted approaches in food-omics: The potential of comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography/mass spectrometry  aNAL-light  aThe contribution focuses on untargeted data processing/analysis approaches that are currently adopted to explore the 4D-data matrices produced by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC × GC-MS) in food-omics. Strategies for untargeted explorations are rationalized through the type of features adopted (i.e., visual, datapoint, peak, and peak-regions) at the data processing level, and then discussed through relevant applications and illustrative examples, selected over peer-reviewed literature. The role of MS, including high vs. low resolution MS, as an active probe for specific cross-comparative analysis, is critically discussed also in the context of spectral deconvolution and subtraction, well-established procedures for 1D GC-MS explorations. Moreover, the challenging task of post-targeting aimed at identifying “unknown – knowns”, is examined in its potential, being the key to access a higher level of information. Selected examples emphasize the importance of reliable identification by retention indexing, retention pattern ordering, sensory evaluation (sensory analysis and olfactometry), and data mining.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3acomprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography 3adata analysis 3afoodomics 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ainformation 3ainformation processing 3aliterature 3aolfactometry 3asensory evaluation 0aFood-omics untargeted investigations 0aMultidimensional analytical platforms 0aFeatures for cross-comparative analysis 0aGC × GC data Processing 0aSpectral deconvolution 0aMS subtraction1 aBicchi, Carlo1 aRobbat, Albert1 aReichenbach, Stephen E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8615-07951 aCordero, Chiara0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2021 Feb., v. 135 p.116162-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2020.1161623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02313naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245011400172300001600286520100300302592002801305650002201333650002201355650001301377650001701390650001401407650004401421650000901465650002001474650001801494653001901512653003201531653002001563653001301583700001501596700001801611700001701629700001901646700001801665773010001683856008701783852000901870655001201879IND60550846020221118021820.0190402e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055084602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.09.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Jian-hua10aPreparation and properties of octenyl succinate β-cyclodextrin and its application as an emulsion stabilizer  ap. 116-121.  aThe aim of this study was to synthesize and characterize the octenyl succinic-β-cyclodextrin (OS-β-CD) and assess its application as a potential emulsion stabilizer. OS-β-CD was prepared by esterifying β-CD with OSA under alkaline conditions. The properties of OS-β-CD were characterized by Fourier transform infrared, 13C and 1H NMR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), which demonstrated that OS groups had been introduced into the β-CD molecules and most of OS substitution occurred at the C-6 hydroxyl group of glycosyl units. The properties of emulsions stabilized by β-CD and OS-β-CD were evaluated via surface and interface tensiometry, determination of the creaming index and droplet size. The results showed that emulsions stabilized by β-CD broke just after 24h storage at 25°C. The emulsions prepared by OS-β-CD with all degree of substitution (DS) possessed a smaller oil droplet size and improved storage stability compared with that of the emulsion generated using β-CD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3acreaming 3adroplet size 3aemulsions 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoils 3astorage quality 3asuccinic acid 0aEsterification 0aOctenyl succinate anhydride 0aβ-Cyclodextrin 0aEmulsion1 aHu, Yan-na1 aLuo, Zhi-gang1 aChen, Weijun1 aChen, Hai-ming1 aPeng, Xi-chun0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 218 p.116-121dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.09.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006100152245014900213300001400362520094700376592002801323650001701351650002601368650002001394650001601414650000701430650001301437650001701450650001601467653001701483653001801500653001501518653002601533653002001559700002301579700006401602700002001666700002401686700002201710773009801732856008701830852000901917655001201926IND60550846120221118021946.0190402e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055084612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.09.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomes, Véronique1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1281-476010aCharacterization of neural network generalization in the determination of pH and anthocyanin content of wine grape in new vintages and varieties  ap. 40-46.  aThe generalization ability of hyperspectral imaging combined with neural networks (NN) in estimating pH and anthocyanin content during ripening was evaluated for vintages and varieties not employed in the NN creation. A NN, from a previously published work, trained with grape samples of Touriga Franca (TF) variety harvested in 2012 was tested with TF from 2013 and two new varieties, Touriga Nacional (TN) and Tinta Barroca (TB) from 2013. Each sample contained a small number of whole berries. The present work results suggest that, under certain conditions, it might be possible for the NN to provide for new vintages and varieties results comparable to those of the vintages and varieties employed in the NN training. For pH, the results are state-of-the-art for the new vintage and varieties tested. For anthocyanin, generalization is bad for TB from 2013 but presents state-of-the-art absolute percentage error for TF and TN from 2013.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aneural networks 3anew variety 3apH 3aripening 3asmall fruits 3awine grapes 0aWine quality 0aGrape berries 0aPrediction 0aHyperspectral imaging 0aNeural networks1 aFernandes, Armando1 aMartins-Lopes, Paula1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8257-01431 aPereira, Leonor1 aMendes Faia, Arlete1 aMelo-Pinto, Pedro0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 218 p.40-46dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.09.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245011400207300001200321520101100333592002801344650001401372650001801386650001701404650001501421650001001436650001201446650001801458650002601476650001901502650001901521650002201540650001201562650001701574700005901591700005901650700006001709700005701769773011101826856008201937852000902019655001202028IND60527016420221119085554.0190411e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052701642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2016.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLong, Benedict M1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4616-296710aCyanobacterial CO2-concentrating mechanism components: function and prospects for plant metabolic engineering  ap. 1-8.  aGlobal population growth is projected to outpace plant-breeding improvements in major crop yields within decades. To ensure future food security, multiple creative efforts seek to overcome limitations to crop yield. Perhaps the greatest limitation to increased crop yield is photosynthetic inefficiency, particularly in C3 crop plants. Recently, great strides have been made toward crop improvement by researchers seeking to introduce the cyanobacterial CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM) into plant chloroplasts. This strategy recognises the C3 chloroplast as lacking a CCM, and being a primordial cyanobacterium at its essence. Hence the collection of solute transporters, enzymes, and physical structures that make cyanobacterial CO2-fixation so efficient are viewed as a natural source of genetic material for C3 chloroplast improvement. Also we highlight recent outstanding research aimed toward the goal of introducing a cyanobacterial CCM into C3 chloroplasts and consider future research directions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC3 plants 3aCyanobacteria 3achloroplasts 3acrop yield 3acrops 3aenzymes 3afood security 3ametabolic engineering 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant breeding 3apopulation growth 3asolutes 3atransporters1 aRae, Benjamin D1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2199-12051 aRolland, Vivien1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9232-12871 aFörster, Britta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5231-09541 aPrice, G Dean1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5906-49120 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2016 June, v. 31 p.1-8dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl58157x1369-52667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2016.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012900168300001600297520102500313592002801338650001301366650001701379650001701396650001101413650001701424650001701441650002401458650000901482650001601491650001401507650001201521650001101533650001801544653001401562653001901576653001701595653001601612700002601628773010001654856008701754852000901841655001201850IND60550846220221118021732.0190402e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055084622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.09.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoza, Jessy10aInfluence of non-starchy polysaccharides on barley milling behavior and evaluating bioactive composition of milled fractions  ap. 137-143.  aHulless barley cultivars grown at various altitudes were subjected to different conditioning treatments prior to roller milling.

The bran fractions displayed greater levels of non-starchy polysaccharides and bioactive components as compared to refined flour fraction. The presence of greater levels of β-glucan in whole barley flour and bran of high altitude cultivars affected the refined flour yield inversely. Cultivars having higher total and insoluble arabinoxylans also resulted in lower flour yields (R=−0.76; R=−0.73). The damaged starch content of barley cultivars ranged between 5.1% and 8.7% which correlated positively with the content of β-glucans (up to R=0.77) and arabinoxylans (up to R=0.80) in bran and refined flour fractions. The anthocyanin and total phenolic contents of refined flours ranged between 3.9–7.6μg/g and 1299–1607μg FAE/g and was higher for high altitude cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aanthocyanins 3aarabinoxylan 3abarley 3abarley flour 3abeta-glucans 3abioactive compounds 3abran 3acorrelation 3acultivars 3amilling 3astarch 3awater content 0aβ-glucan 0aDamaged starch 0aArabinoxylan 0aAnthocyanin1 aGujral, Hardeep Singh0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 218 p.137-143dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.09.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245014900164520194600313592002802259650002102287650001502308650001202323650001602335650002902351650001702380650001302397650001802410650001302428650001502441650002502456653003502481653002002516653003202536653002402568653001902592700001702611700002002628700001502648700005802663773009702721856008502818852000902903655001202912IND60772394420221120071741.0220523e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077239442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2022.1183722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Kun10aOccurrence and transformation of unknown organochlorines in the wastewater treatment plant using specific Fragment-Based method with LC Q-TOF MS  aWastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are important point sources of organochlorines in surface waters. However, comprehensive molecular-level understanding of the occurrence and transformation of organochlorines in WWTPs remains elusive. In this study, a specific fragment-based screening method with SWATH of LC Q-TOF MS was established to better understand the molecular composition of organochlorines. This method effectively excludes the non-chlorinated signals and provides multi-dimensional information (e.g., retention time, precursor ion mass, product ions, and molecular formula) with one injection to identify the possible structures of organochlorines. Eighty-seven organochlorines were successfully screened in practical wastewater samples, where 8 chlorinated sulfonic acids, 4 chlorophenols, 4 chlorinated benzenediols, and 6 chlorinated benzoic acids were further (tentatively) identified. Relative abundance of organochlorines showed that their occurrence was associated with the treatment units. In particular, anaerobic biological and NaClO treatment units contributed to the formation of chlorinated by-products. Most chlorinated by-products were substituted with more chlorine atoms than organochlorines from the influent. Furthermore, the relative abundance indicated that the fate of organochlorines were related to their structures. Chlorinated benzene sulfonic acids would be removed by adsorption on activated sludge. Most chlorinated benzoic acids were refractory, but some were likely to be chlorinated during the anaerobic process. Chlorophenols and chlorinated benzenediols might undergo chlorination, dealkylation/C-O bond breakage, and bromination. Our study offers a new tool to gain molecular information on organochlorines in complex environmental samples and highlights the importance of molecular structures when evaluating the fate of organochlorines and managing effluent discharge to surrounding waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aadsorption 3abenzene 3abromination 3achlorinated hydrocarbons 3achlorination 3achlorine 3achlorophenols 3aresearch 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aSpecific fragment-based method 0aorganochlorines 0awastewater treatment plants 0aanaerobic treatment 0atransformation1 aZhu, Xiangyu1 aLiu, Zhengzheng1 aWang, Jing1 aChen, Baoliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8196-081X0 tWater research.g2022 June 01, v. 216 p.118372-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.1183723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03409naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245009400175300001200269520180200281592002802083596011102111650001502222650001502237650001202252650001102264650001902275650002502294650001902319650001402338650001502352650001702367650001102384650001302395650000702408650002002415650001302435650002402448650001002472650001602482650001502498650002702513650002002540650002002560700002102580700002902601700001802630773014102648856008102789852000902870655001202879IND60600083220221121203328.0180702e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060008322DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-018-3889-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraghiroli, Flavia Lega10aActivated Biochar as an Effective Sorbent for Organic and Inorganic Contaminants in Water  ap. 230.  aAdsorption is acknowledged as effective for the removal of pollutants from drinking water and wastewater. Biochar, as a widely available material, holds promises for pollutant adsorption. So far, biochar has been found to be effective for multiple purposes, including carbon sequestration, nutrient storage, and water-holding capacity. However, its limited porosity restricts its use in water treatment. Activation of biochars, when performed at a high temperature (i.e., 900 °C) and in the presence of certain chemicals (H₃PO₄, KOH) and/or gases (CO₂, steam), improves the development of porosity through the selective gasification of carbon atoms. Physicochemical activation process is appropriate for the production of highly porous materials. As well, the morphological and chemical structure of feedstock together with pyro-gasification operating conditions for the biochar production can greatly impact the porosity of the final materials. The effectiveness of activated biochar as adsorbent depends on porosity and on some functional groups connected to its structure, both of these are developed during activation. This study provides a comprehensive synthesis of the effect of several activated biochars when applied to the treatment of organic and inorganic contaminants in water. Results show that high aromaticity and porosity are essential for the sorption of organic contaminants, while the presence of oxygen-containing functional groups and optimum pH are crucial for the sorption of inorganic contaminants, especially metals. Finally, although activated biochar is a promising option for the treatment of contaminants in water, further research is required to evaluate its performance with real effluents containing contaminants of emerging concern.

However, these types of material solutions still lack reliable and durable operation on bulk level. Previously, we showed that cold-crystallizing material (CCM), which consists of erythritol in cross-linked polymer matrix, stored heat for a long-term period in a milligram scale by supercooling stably and preventing undesired crystallization during storage. Crystallization of CCM can be triggered efficiently by re-heating the material (i.e. cold-crystallization). Supercooling and cold-crystallization are stochastic phenomena which manifest in a way that the properties in bulk scale often deviate from the microscale. In this work, we scale up CCM to a bulk size of 160 g, and analyze its supercooling and crystallization characteristics for long-term heat storage. In order to identify the impact of the scale-up on the tested compositions and to discover optimal storage conditions, CCM samples are maintained in storage mode at constant temperature between 0 and 10 °C and up to 97 days. To this end, the thermal chamber measurement procedure estimates the heat release of CCM samples based on the measured temperature data and the one-dimensional transient heat conduction model. Results indicate that the heat release in cold-crystallization is over 70% of the melting heat. This heat can be stored without reduction for at least 97 days, demonstrating the reliable performance of long-term heat storage. Analysing the thermal properties of CCM compositions indicates a maximum volumetric storage capacity of 250 MJ/m³ and excellent properties for further heat storage applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3acrystallization 3aerythritol 3aheat transfer 3amelting 3amodels 3apolymers 3arenewable energy sources 3astorage conditions 3asupercooling 3atemperature 3athermal properties 0aLong-term thermal energy storage 0aPhase change material 0aCold-crystallization1 aYazdani, Maryam Roza1 aPuupponen, Salla1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5582-55931 aSantasalo-Aarnio, Annukka1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0077-966X1 aSeppälä, Ari0 tApplied energy.g2020 May 15, v. 266 p.114890-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1148903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024003500132024004200167040001800209100001900227245005500246300001400301506002800315506003600343506007600379506003100455520100600486592002801492596004401520596004501564506003701609650001401646650002401660650001101684650001701695650001701712650002001729650001001749650001101759650001901770650003801789650002901827700002401856700002501880773011301905856008202018903002402100852000902124655001202133IND60527016620221207072748.0190411e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052701662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2016.03.0042chorus7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2016.03.0042doi7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2016.03.0042chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerry, James O10aRegulation of Rubisco gene expression in C4 plants  ap. 23-28.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aRibulose-1,5-bisphosphate-carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) incorporates inorganic carbon into an organic form, making this chloroplastic enzyme one of the most essential factors for all life on earth. Despite its central role in photosynthesis, research into regulation of the chloroplast rbcL and nuclear RbcS genes that encode this enzyme has lagged behind other plant gene systems. A major characteristic of kranz-type C4 plants is the accumulation of Rubisco only within chloroplasts of internalized bundle sheath cells that surround the leaf vascular centers. In plants that utilize the less common single cell C4 system, Rubisco accumulates only within one type of dimorphic chloroplasts localized to a specific region of leaf chlorenchyma cells. Understanding regulatory processes that restrict Rubisco gene expression to only one cell type or chloroplast type is a major focus of C4 research. Regulatory steps may include transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational processes.  aPublisher supplied data  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aC4 plants 3abundle sheath cells 3acarbon 3achlorenchyma 3achloroplasts 3agene expression 3agenes 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3atranscription (genetics)1 aMure, Christopher M1 aYerramsetty, Pradeep0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2016 June, v. 31 p.23-28dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl58157x1369-52667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2016.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle01946naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245009200168300001600260520106400276592002801340650002301368650003101391650001901422773016201441856008001603852000901683655001201692IND60480576820221120210654.0160128e20090301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048057682DNAL7 a10.14358/PERS.75.3.3052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhoshelham, Kourosh10aRole of Tie Points in Integrated Sensor Orientation for Photogrammetric Map Compilation  ap. 305-311.  a<p><i>Direct measurement of exterior orientation parameters has been a challenge in photogrammetry for many years. Direct sensor orientation using a calibrated GPS/INS system can potentially eliminate the need for ground control points and aerial triangulation, and consequently, result in a great reduction in the cost and time of aerial photogrammetry. Previous studies have shown that, compared to conventional aerial triangulation, direct sensor orientation yields larger errors in the image and object space. It has also been shown that including a number of tie points within an integrated orientation approach can result in a reduction of errors in the image space. In this paper, the influence of the number and distribution of tie points on integrated orientation is investigated. Experiments with various numbers of tie points regularly as well as randomly distributed are presented. Results indicate that an increase in the number of tie points up to one point per model results in a considerable reduction of the errors in the image space.</i></p>  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3aglobal positioning systems 3aphotogrammetry0 tPhotogrammetric engineering and remote sensing.g2009 Mar. 1, v. 75, no. 3 p.305-311dAmerican Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensingx0099-11127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.14358%2FPERS.75.3.3053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002300181245008800204506007600292520145500368592002801823506003701851650001901888650000901907650002301916650002201939650001301961650001601974650002301990650000902013650002002022650001502042650004302057650001402100650001502114650001702129700002402146773012302170856007402293852000902367655001202376IND60650593720221207143527.0190710e20181005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065059372DNAL7 a10.3390/nu101014372doi7 aPMC62136052pmcid7 a303011292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiranda, Mario  A.10aIroning out the Details: Untangling Dietary Iron and Genetic Background in Diabetes  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe search for genetic risk factors in type-II diabetes has been hindered by a failure to consider dietary variables. Dietary nutrients impact metabolic disease risk and severity and are essential to maintaining metabolic health. Genetic variation between individuals confers differences in metabolism, which directly impacts response to diet. Most studies attempting to identify genetic risk factors in disease fail to incorporate dietary components, and thus are ill-equipped to capture the breadth of the genome&rsquo;s impact on metabolism. Understanding how genetic background interacts with nutrients holds the key to predicting and preventing metabolic diseases through the implementation of personalized nutrition. Dysregulation of iron homeostasis is associated with type-II diabetes, but the link between dietary iron and metabolic dysfunction is poorly defined. High iron burden in adipose tissue induces insulin resistance, but the mechanisms underlying adipose iron accumulation remain unknown. Hepcidin controls dietary iron absorption and distribution in metabolic tissues, but it is unknown whether genetic variation influencing hepcidin expression modifies susceptibility to dietary iron-induced insulin resistance. This review highlights discoveries concerning the axis of iron homeostasis and adipose function and suggests that genetic variation underlying dietary iron metabolism is an understudied component of metabolic disease.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadipose tissue 3adiet 3agenetic background 3agenetic variation 3ahepcidin 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin resistance 3airon 3airon absorption 3ametabolism 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anutrients 3aprediction 3arisk factors1 aLawson, Heather  A.0 tNutrients.g2018 Oct. 05, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu101014373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04263naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100007100150245017100221300001600392520184300408592002802251650001802279650002002297650002902317650003002346650001502376650002602391650002002417650001502437650002602452650002502478650001202503650002402515650001702539650002102556650001102577650003502588650002302623650001502646650002502661650001602686650002402702650001602726650002102742651001402763653002702777653002402804653001702828700002202845700001902867700002602886700002702912700002102939700002302960700002102983700002303004700002403027700002203051700002403073700001603097700002603113700002003139700002103159700002103180700002103201700001603222700001903238700002303257773010703280856008503387852000903472655001203481IND60556392020221118010700.0190214e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055639202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2016.09.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJędrzejewski, Włodzimierz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9934-068310aPredicting carnivore distribution and extirpation rate based on human impacts and productivity factors; assessment of the state of jaguar (Panthera onca) in Venezuela  ap. 132-142.  aThe worldwide decline in carnivore populations has been attributed to various human impacts. However, our understanding of the mechanisms behind these declines is insufficient to predict the timing and location of local extinctions. We collected data on presence/absence and time since extirpation of jaguars across Venezuela. To test if human impacts or ecosystem productivity better explain the observed spatial variation in probability of jaguar occurrence we compared logistic regression models fit with different combinations of anthropogenic and environmental variables. Similarly, we modelled the time since extirpation, using a multiple regression approach. Our study supported the hypothesis that jaguar extirpations and distribution are determined by a joint effect of anthropogenic factors and environmental variables, mainly those related with ecosystem productivity. Human population density and habitat alterations exerted strong negative effects on jaguar populations, while annual precipitation, mean temperature, forest cover, primary productivity, and other vegetation indices had positive effects. The strength of human impact is shaped by ecosystem productivity: jaguars disappear faster in dry, unproductive areas, and survive better in humid, productive areas even when human densities are higher. We estimated that jaguars in Venezuela have been extirpated from approximately 26% of the territory of Venezuela; present jaguar range covers approximately 66% of the country. We demonstrate that human population density alone cannot adequately explain past extirpations nor predict future jaguar declines. We conclude that the predicted future growth of the human population will not necessarily determine jaguar declines, and proper management and conservation programs could potentially prevent jaguar extirpations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanthera onca 3aadverse effects 3aanthropogenic activities 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acarnivores 3aconservation programs 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental impact 3aforests 3ahabitat destruction 3ahuman growth 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3anatural resources conservation 3apopulation density 3aprediction 3aprimary productivity 3aprobability 3aregression analysis 3atemperature 3avegetation index 3aVenezuela 0aCarnivore conservation 0aDistribution models 0aJaguar range1 aBoede, Ernesto O.1 aAbarca, María1 aSánchez-Mercado, Ada1 aFerrer-Paris, José R.1 aLampo, Margarita1 aVelásquez, Grisel1 aCarreño, Rafael1 aViloria, Ángel L.1 aHoogesteijn, Rafael1 aRobinson, Hugh S.1 aStachowicz, Izabela1 aCerda, Hugo1 aWeisz, María del Mar1 aBarros, Tito R.1 aRivas, Gilson A.1 aBorges, Gilberto1 aMolinari, Jesús1 aLew, Daniel1 aTakiff, Howard1 aSchmidt, Krzysztof0 tBiological conservation.g2017 Feb., v. 206 p.132-142dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2016.09.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006800148245008500216300001800301500001100319520149900330592002801829650001501857650002601872650002001898650001601918650002501934650001601959650001201975650001801987650000902005650001502014650001702029650001102046650000902057650001202066650001102078650002102089650001402110650001302124650001302137650001902150700006402169700006802233773012602301856008302427852000902510655001202519IND60791968820221116143005.0220903e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079196882DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-021-03037-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEmenike, Ebuka Chizitere1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7117-326510aHeavy Metal Pollution in Aquaculture: Sources, Impacts and Mitigation Techniques  ap. 4476-4492.  aReview  aAquaculture is one of the fastest growing agro-industries as it presently accounts for nearly 50% of all fish for direct human consumption and 43% of total seafood supply. Fish provide about 20% average daily intake of animal protein for about 3.2 billion people globally. The treatment of aquaculture in recent years for the mitigation of heavy metals and other contaminants has been gaining traction due to the benefits of aquaculture to both man and the environment. This paper provides a review of the sources, impacts, and the various methods that have been deployed in recent years by various researchers for the treatment of heavy metal contaminated aquaculture. Related works of literature were obtained and compiled from academic search databases and were carefully analysed in this study. The dangers these metals pose to the sustainability of aquaculture were studied in this review. Studies indicate that some heavy metals, such as mercury, lead, and cadmium, due to their long-term persistence in the environment, allow them to accumulate in the food chain. Mitigation techniques such as adsorption, bio-sorption, and phytoremediation have been deployed for the treatment of heavy metal contaminated aquaculture. Some research gaps were also highlighted which could form the basis for future research, such as research centred on the effects of these metals on the embryonic development of aquaculture organisms and the alterations the metals caused in their stages of development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aagricultural industry 3aanimal proteins 3aaquaculture 3aaverage daily intake 3abiosorption 3acadmium 3aembryogenesis 3afish 3afood chain 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3alead 3amercury 3apeople 3aphytoremediation 3apollution 3aresearch 3aseafoods 3atrace elements1 aIwuozor, Kingsley O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1161-21471 aAnidiobi, Stella Ukamaka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1024-18580 tBiological trace element research.g2022 Oct., v. 200, no. 10 p.4476-4492dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-021-03037-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100001400174245008000188300001600268520103600284592002801320650002101348650002101369650001901390650001301409650001001422650001101432650001701443650001501460650002401475650002101499650002401520650002801544650001301572650005001585650002301635653002101658653001701679653001001696653003301706700001701739700001801756773007601774856008901850852000901939655001201948IND60112211520221122173457.0160901e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011221152DNAL7 a236483272pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.04.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jie10aRegeneration of activated carbon saturated with odors by non-thermal plasma  ap. 725-730.  aThe dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) regeneration process of an activated carbon (AC) saturated with dimethyl sulfide was studied on a laboratory scale. The results showed sustainable high regeneration efficiency (RE) (>90%) in successive regeneration cycles (10 cycles). Energy density, humidity and oxygen content were key factors for DBD system, with optimum conditions of 761JL−1, 0–1vol% and 5%, respectively. The high efficiency was likely attributed to the improvement of structure and surface properties of AC by DBD. After the first regeneration, surface area, micropore volume and total pore volume of AC increased by 8%, 23% and 15% respectively, while average pore size decreased by 9.5%. The number of carboxylic groups doubled (from 0.22 to 0.48mmolg−1) while that of phenolic groups remarkably decreased (from 0.48 to 0.26mmolg−1) after successive regeneration cycles, which helped to maintain high RE. The results suggested DBD as a novel, efficient alternative process for odor-saturated AC regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3adimethyl sulfide 3aenergy density 3ahumidity 3aodors 3aoxygen 3asurface area 2aAdsorption 2aCharcoalxchemistry 2aEquipment Design 2aOdorantsxanalysis. 2aPlasma Gasesxchemistry 2aPorosity 2aSulfidesxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aSurface Properties 0aActivated carbon 0aRegeneration 0aOdors 0aDielectric barrier discharge1 aPan, Xinchao1 aChen, Jianwei0 tChemosphere.g2013 July, v. 92 p.725-730dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.04.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013700168520135200305592002801657650000801685650001601693650002801709650001901737650001201756650001901768650000901787650002401796650002201820650002201842650001101864650002401875653001801899653002401917653003301941700001601974700001301990700002302003700001902026700001902045700005802064773009702122856008702219852000902306655001202315IND60687903620221120213921.0200419e20200515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068790362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1148932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNam, KiJeon12aA proactive energy-efficient optimal ventilation system using artificial intelligent techniques under outdoor air quality conditions  aPassengers are directly or indirectly exposed to fine dust in indoor air of underground subway stations, which greatly affects the comfort and health of the passengers. However, conventional ventilation systems are manually operated, resulting in high energy consumption, and it is hard to consider the dynamic characteristics of indoor air quality due to the complex relationships between the environment of the subway station and climate change-driven outdoor air quality. Therefore, an energy-efficient ventilation optimization system based on deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI)-iterative dynamic programming was developed in this study for proactive environmental and economic maintenance of the underground ventilation system for a subway’s indoor air quality. The deep learning model predicted the next 24 h of the subway’s environmental status, and the AI-iterative dynamic programming searched a piecewise operational policy of ventilation flow rate for the same operational duration. Energy efficiency was improved by 8.68% while maintaining healthy indoor air quality for the passengers. The proactive optimal ventilation system for the platform of a target subway station presented a decrease of 96 tons of CO₂ per year to help address climate change and operating expenditure savings of up to $4217 dollars per year.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair quality 3aartificial intelligence 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adust 3adynamic programming 3aenergy efficiency 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aventilation systems 0aDeep learning 0aOutdoor air quality 0aProactive ventilation system1 aHeo, SungKu1 aLi, Qian1 aLoy-Benitez, Jorge1 aKim, Minjeong,1 aPark, DuckShin1 aYoo, ChangKyoo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9406-76490 tApplied energy.g2020 May 15, v. 266 p.114893-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1148933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03012naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245009300209300001200302520166900314592002801983650001302011650001902024650001902043650001602062650001502078650001402093650001902107650003702126650001902163650001702182650001602199700002302215700003302238700001902271700002002290700002202310700002702332773014102359856008102500852000902581655001202590IND60600083620221121203304.0180702e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060008362DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-018-3891-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrtega, Marcelo F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8595-388410aOptimization of Landfarming Amendments Based on Soil Texture and Crude Oil Concentration  ap. 234.  aThis work examines the rates of bioremediation during a landfarming process. A field study was performed using three types of soil, which were contaminated with two different hydrocarbon concentrations: 20,000 and 50,000 ppm of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH). They were subjected to landfarming under the action of different treatments, based on the provision of irrigation, aeration by rototilling, fertilizer, and surfactant. The biodegradation of TPH, considering concentration and families of hydrocarbon compounds (including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs), was precisely measured for a period of 486 days. The results show how biodegradation rates depend on soil texture, initial contamination level, and type of amendment. Thus, the combination of fertilizer, irrigation, and aeration was the best treatment for treating the soil contaminated with 20,000 ppm of TPH (TPH final concentrations were reduced to a range of 49 to 62% depending on the soil texture). In the case of parcels contaminated with 50,000 ppm of TPH, the most effective treatment combined the supply of fertilizer, surfactant, irrigation, and aeration (TPH final concentrations were reduced to a range of 47 to 63%, depending on the soil texture). The best biodegradation results are obtained for soils with coarser textures and using the treatment with fertilizer, irrigation, and aeration. In addition, the application of surfactant did not imply a significant improvement in the level of biodegradation of hydrocarbons in soil contaminated with 20,000 ppm of TPH, whereas in soils contaminated with 50,000 ppm of TPH, it played a leading role.

In this study, we investigated the critical thermal maxima (CTₘₐₓ) of larval and early juvenile life stages of three tropical marine fishes (Acanthochromis polyacanthus, Amphiprion melanopus, and Lates calcarifer). We tested for potential effects of developmental acclimation, life stage, and experimental heating rates, and we measured metabolic enzyme activities from aerobic (citrate synthase, CS) and anaerobic pathways (lactate dehydrogenase, LDH). A slightly elevated rearing temperature neither influenced CTₘₐₓ nor CS activity, which otherwise could have indicated thermal acclimation. However, we found CTₘₐₓ to either remain stable (Acanthrochromis polyacanthus) or increase with body mass during early ontogeny (Amphiprion melanopus and Lates calcarifer). In all three species, faster heating rates lead to higher CTₘₐₓ. Acute temperature stress did not change CS or LDH activities, suggesting that overall aerobic and anaerobic metabolism remained stable. Lates calcarifer, a catadromous species that migrates from oceanic to riverine habitats upon metamorphosis, had higher CTₘₐₓ than the two coral reef fish species. We highlight that, for obtaining conservative estimates of a fish species’ upper thermal limits, several developmental stages and body mass ranges should be examined. Moreover, upper thermal limits should be assessed using standardized heating rates. This will not only benefit comparative approaches but also aid in assessing geographic (re-) distributions and climate change sensitivity of marine fishes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthochromis polyacanthus 3aAmphiprion melanopus 3aLates calcarifer 3aacclimation 3aanaerobiosis 3abody weight 3acatadromous fish 3acitrate (si)-synthase 3aclimate change 3acoral reefs 3aectothermy 3ajuveniles 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alarvae 3ametamorphosis 3aontogeny 3ariparian areas 3atemperature 3athermal stress 0aFish larvae 0aDevelopment 0aUpper thermal limit 0aMetabolic enzymes1 aDownie, A.T.1 aBeghin, M.1 aRummer, J.L.0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2020 May, v. 90 p.102582-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.1025823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03456naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245013800176300001800314520135200332592002801684596008101712596006801793596006801861650001501929650003501944650002701979650003202006650003302038650002402071650001302095650001202108650001902120651001002139700002302149700001902172700002102191700002202212700002002234700002102254700002502275700006902300700002502369700002502394700002102419700001902440700002102459700002402480700002302504700006202527700007102589773012602660856008302786852000902869655001202878IND60791969020221116143008.0220903e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079196902DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-021-03040-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLalrammawia, Khawlhring10aDetermination of Multi Elements in Tobacco Plant of Northeast India by Neutron Activation Analysis and Atomic Absorption Spectrometry  ap. 4534-4549.  aEven when cultivated in uncontaminated soils, tobacco plant has higher propensity to extract and accumulate trace elements. The concentrations (mass fractions) of essential elements (K, Ca, Mg, Na, Cl, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn) and 28 non-essential elements in tobacco plant (leaves, stem, and root) of Northeast India and their respective soils were quantitatively measured. Hg mass fraction in all samples analyzed were found to be < 10 mg/kg. The heavy element mass fractions of tobacco are weakly correlated to different soil parameters. The bioconcentration factor values indicated that Cd (7) is selectively absorbed and translocated in the tobacco leaves compared to Zn (1.7), Cu (1.5), Ni (0.12), and Pb (0.1). Under acidic soil conditions, tobacco plant efficiently absorbed and translocated Cl⁻ ion with great ease, whereas it may be a very low accumulator of rare-earth elements. The mass fractions of Mn, Cu, Sb, Cs, Rb, and Pb are very similar to the “reference plant,” whereas significantly higher mass fractions of Al, Sc, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ta, Th, and U are present in the roots of tobacco plant relative to the “reference plant.” Principal component analysis has revealed that Northeast Indian tobacco can be clearly differentiated from other varieties of tobaccos used in different countries because of their element profiles.  aPublisher supplied data  aBT/PR24211/NER/95715/2017cDepartment of Bio-technology, Government of India  aRBT/04/NE/209cDepartment of Bio-technology, Govrnment of India  aBT/04/NE/209cDepartment of Bio-technology, Government of India 3aacid soils 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abioaccumulation factor 3aneutron activation analysis 3aprincipal component analysis 3arare earth elements 3aresearch 3atobacco 3atrace elements 3aIndia1 aBuragohain, Ananya1 aKakki, Bomngam1 aZote, Lalrinawma1 aMarak, Nikrang K.1 aLalrinhlupuii, 1 aMalsawmtluangi, 1 aLalmuanpuii, Rebecca1 aKumar, Nachimuthu Senthil1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0192-21331 aJahau, Lalrintluanga1 aSudarshan, Mathummal1 aChaligava, Omari1 aYushin, Nikita1 aGrozdov, Dmitrii1 aNekhoroshkov, Pavel1 aVergel, Konstantin1 aZinicovscaia, Inga1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0820-887X1 aMuthukumaran, Rajendra Bose1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1872-87590 tBiological trace element research.g2022 Oct., v. 200, no. 10 p.4534-4549dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-021-03040-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245010600209300001800315520138400333592002801717650001201745650001501757650002001772650003101792650002001823650001101843650002401854650001701878650001101895651001001906700002101916700002001937700002701957773014401984856008302128852000902211655001202220IND60795264220221118054912.0221004e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079526422DNAL7 a10.1007/s12524-022-01590-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaithani, Sandeep1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3395-886X10aSimulation of Land Surface Temperature Patterns Over Future Urban Areas—A Machine Learning Approach  ap. 2145-2162.  aThe present study attempts to simulate land surface temperature (LST) as a function of built-up density using an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm. The LST was retrieved from Landsat thermal datasets for years 2000, 2010, and 2019 using a single channel algorithm. The retrieved LST was validated using downscaled MODIS LST products of corresponding dates and an average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.3 °C and 1.9 °C was obtained on winter and summer datasets, respectively. The ANN was trained using corresponding built-up density and LST values for the year 2000, 2010, and 2019. The mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.1 °C and 0.7 °C was achieved on summer and winter training datasets, respectively, while on summer and winter testing datasets MAE of 1.5 °C and 0.9 was obtained. Various urban growth scenarios in the year 2029 were simulated using sim weight which is a nonparametric instance-based machine learning algorithm, based on K nearest neighbour procedure. The simulated built-up densities for the year 2029 were input into the trained ANN and LST patterns for the year 2029 were predicted. Analysis of the results showed that for Dehradun city which is located in a humid subtropical climate zone in India, compact urban growth led to lesser areas having LST greater than 42 °C in summers, as compared to other urban growth patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3ahumid subtropical climates 3aneural networks 3asummer 3asurface temperature 3aurbanization 3awinter 3aIndia1 aNautiyal, Garima1 aSharma, Archana1 aSharma, Surendra Kumar0 tJournal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing.g2022 Nov., v. 50, no. 11 p.2145-2162dSpringer IndiawJournal:J000001231x0255-660X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-022-01590-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245014200163300001800305520161000323592002801933596020901961650001702170650001602187650001202203650000902215650001802224650001002242650001802252650001302270650002102283650001402304650001302318650001302331650001902344651001002363700001502373700001702388700005602405773012602461856008302587852000902670655001202679IND60791969120221116143051.0220903e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079196912DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-021-03044-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Peng10aCondensed Tannins Improved Immune Functions and Reduced Environmental Pollution of Captive Sichuan Black Goat Kids Under Cadmium Toxicity  ap. 4325-4331.  aTo investigate the effects of condensed tannins (CT) on immune functions and nitrogen (N) emissions of captive Sichuan black goat kids under cadmium (Cd) toxicity, a total of 18 Sichuan black goat kids (2 months old, 9.6 ± 1.2 kg) were randomly used in this 30-day trial. The dietary treatments were (1) CON group, basic diet; (2) Cd group, basic diet + oral 10 mg Cd/kg·BW; and (3) CT group, Cd group + 400 mg/kg CT. Oral Cd supplementation significantly decreased the Cu and Fe contents in serums and livers of captive Sichuan black goat kids (P < 0.05), but adding CT in the Cd group increased the Fe and Mo contents and decreased the Cd content in serums and livers (P < 0.05). Additional CT supplementation in the Cd group extremely increased the activities of serum SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT (P < 0.05), and greatly decreased the serum MDA content (P < 0.05). The CT supplementation in the Cd group also extremely increased the concentrations of serum IgG, IgM, and IgA (P < 0.05), and greatly decreased the contents of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in serums (P < 0.05). Adding CT in the Cd group significantly increased the apparent digestibility of CP and EE and decreased the urinary nitrogen (UN) content (P < 0.05, Table 7). In conclusion, the application of additional CT improved antioxidant capacities and immune functions of captive black goats under Cd toxicity, then reduced the oxidative stress and toxic damage of Cd contamination. CT also improved the N digestibility and reduced the N emission, which was helpful to reduce environmental pollution.  aPublisher supplied data  a201931cResearch on high quality development indicators and assessment system of Guizhou tobacco business (No. 201931), Guizhou Science and Technology Project of China National Tobacco Corporation in 2019 3aantioxidants 3ablood serum 3acadmium 3adiet 3adigestibility 3agoats 3ainterleukin-6 3anitrogen 3aoxidative stress 3apollution 3aresearch 3atoxicity 3atrace elements 3aChina1 aLi, Haiyan1 aQiu, Quanyou1 aWang, Yachao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4401-70100 tBiological trace element research.g2022 Oct., v. 200, no. 10 p.4325-4331dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-021-03044-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02206naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013300158300001600291520118100307592002801488650002101516650001101537650001001548650001101558650001001569650001401579650002201593650001101615650001401626650001601640700001401656773010301670856007401773852000901847655001201856IND60621322820221120102142.0181116e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062132282DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029506032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandey, S.

Observations revealed that the pest remained active from the first fortnight of June till the second fortnight of January. Pest attained its peak activity during second fortnight of November in spring and autumn crops and during the second fortnight of October in ratoon crop as was evident from recordings of the mean larval population. For population build up, an average maximum was observed to decline from 39.30 to 30.30 and average minimum temperature from 26.62 to 14.44°C; a relative humidity around 70.00 per cent appeared to be conducive for population build up. A significant and positive correlation (r ranging from 0.465 to 0.541 for the crops) existed between the pest population and the maximum temperature whereas minimum temperature correlated negatively. A highly significant positive correlation with relative humidity (r ranging from 0.71 to 0.84) clearly showed a major role in pest build up.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChilo auricilius 3aautumn 3acrops 3alarvae 3apests 3aratooning 3arelative humidity 3aspring 3asugarcane 3atemperature1 aKant, Sri0 tSugar tech.g2005 Dec., v. 7, no. 4 p.157-159dSpringer IndiawJournal:J000000155x0972-15257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF029506033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245018000163300001400343520135000357592002801707650001601735650001701751650001701768650001401785650002101799650001201820650001001832650002801842650001801870650001401888650001301902650003201915650001001947651001201957653002601969653001401995653002002009653001602029653001602045700001802061700001902079773012302098856007802221852000902299655001202308IND60680311120221119182017.0200104s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068031112DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2019-01212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacobs, Martin10aAnalysis of stand density effects on the stem form of Norway spruce trees and volume miscalculation by traditional form factor equations using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS)  ap. 51-64.  aTree and stand volume estimates are relevant for forest inventories, forest sales, and carbon stock evaluations. Forest practice commonly uses generalized stem-wood volume functions; however, such generalized approaches neglect the stem form in detail. Hence, trees of a given species with the same diameter at breast height (d₁.₃) and height (h) are always assumed to have the same form factor and thus the same volume. This case study focused on stem form variation of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) due to competition effects. Using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), we measured the stem shape of 868 trees from a long-term spacing and thinning experiment in Germany. The plots covered a broad density range. We analysed the effect of competition and compared the TLS-determined stem volume estimates with those determined conventionally. TLS-based volume estimations showed that the lower the competition was, the lower the tree volume was with a given d₁.₃ and h. Commonly used functions underestimated the volume stock overall by 4.2%, disregarding any levels. At plot level, underestimation varied from 0.7% to 7.0%. At tree level, the volume was under- and over-estimated by −10% to +10%, respectively. The more precise the examination was, the more suitable the application of TLS was for enhancing volume estimation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3acarbon sinks 3acase studies 3aequations 3aforest inventory 3aforests 3asales 3asilvicultural practices 3astand density 3astem form 3astemwood 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3aGermany 0atree and stand volume 0astem wood 0avolume function 0aform factor 0acompetition1 aRais, Andreas1 aPretzsch, Hans0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2020, v. 50, no. 1 p.51-64dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl2003x1208-60377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2019-01213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006800148245011400216300001800330520140400348592002801752650001301780650001101793650002901804650003501833650001601868650001501884650001301899650000901912650001201921650001201933650002801945650002301973650001501996651001002011700005702021700005802078700002202136773014402158856008302302852000902385655001202394IND60795264420221118055018.0221004e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079526442DNAL7 a10.1007/s12524-022-01591-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuhara, K.

However, identifying the prospective zones for constructing check dams remains challenging. This study aimed to develop detailed geographic information system (GIS) procedures for suitable locations for check dams. The various rules given in the literature were reviewed and a set of rules were customized for selecting suitable sites for constructing the check dams, considering their practicality and purpose. The study highlighted the shortcoming observed in the Integrated Mission for Sustainable Development (IMSD) rules for identifying suitable locations for constructing the check dams. Shortcomings in routine use of Digital Elevation Model (DEM) sources are discussed. Stream network map was prepared by corroborating the streams from various sources, such as SRTM DEM, Google Earth Images, and SLUSI (Soil and Land Use Survey of India) analog maps. Detailed GIS procedures were developed for zoning the prospective locations for constructing check dams. The developed GIS procedures were implemented to map the potential zones for constructing cement concrete check dams in the Noyyal river basin, India. This work will be helpful for the hydrology community to locate the check dams in watersheds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3acement 3adigital elevation models 3ageographic information systems 3agroundwater 3airrigation 3aland use 3asoil 3astreams 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3awater conservation 3awatersheds 3aIndia1 aRavikumar, V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3539-18951 aKannan, Balaji1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2330-08931 aPanneerselvam, S.0 tJournal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing.g2022 Nov., v. 50, no. 11 p.2193-2208dSpringer IndiawJournal:J000001231x0255-660X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-022-01591-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094024004000137040001800177100005400195245014700249506007600396506003100472520102800503592002801531596004501559596013401604596009201738506003701830650001501867650002501882650001001907650002301917650002101940650001101961650001401972650001801986650000902004650001402013650001402027650001902041650001502060650001602075650004402091650002102135650001402156650001602170653001402186653000802200653002202208653002102230700002102251700002302272700002102295773010102316856008702417852000902504655001202513IND60687903920221207081551.0200517e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068790392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1266992chorus7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1266992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Aili1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4406-962710aInteraction effect of LED color temperatures and light-protective additive packaging on photo-oxidation in milk displayed in retail dairy case  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aEffect of varied LED color temperatures on photo-oxidation in 2% fat milk and protection efficiency of packaging with and without light-protective additives (LPA) under different color temperatures was firstly evaluated. Riboflavin (Rb) is one of the critical photo-sensitizers in 2% milk when exposed to LED light. Higher color temperature with higher relative intensity of Rb absorbance region resulted in lower Rb and vitamin A retention, lower dissolved oxygen content, and higher TBARS value in milk packaged with non-LPA packaging. Yellow pigmented packaging that completely blocked the Rb absorbance region of all three LED color temperatures successfully reduced the rate of degradation of milk nutrients and flavor. TiO₂-added packaging partially block the destructive light wavelength; higher level of TiO₂ provided a longer protection on milk freshness. Combination of appropriate LED color temperature and LPA-packaging provided a cost-effective solution for minimizing photo-oxidation in retail dairy case.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cVirginia Agricultural Experiment Station, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100013141  cVirginia Polytechnic Institute and State Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000072630 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorbance 3aantioxidant activity 3acolor 3acost effectiveness 3adissolved oxygen 3aflavor 3afreshness 3alipid content 3amilk 3anutrients 3apackaging 3aphotooxidation 3ariboflavin 3atemperature 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3atitanium dioxide 3avitamin A 3awavelengths 0aOxidation 0aLED 0aColor temperature 0aLight wavelength1 aDuncan, Susan E.1 aWhalley, Nicole W.1 aO'Keefe, Sean F.0 tFood chemistry.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 323 p.126699-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1266993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01537naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245021600168500001400384520008900398592002800487650001300515650001000528650002200538650003600560650001000596650001300606650001500619650001400634650001000648700003400658700003100692700002100723700002000744700002200764700003100786700002300817700001800840700003400858773012200892856008001014852000901094655001201103IND60724368820221119081744.0210122e20210111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072436882DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110101262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArnuti, Fernando 10aErratum: Arnuti, F., et al.

Comprehensive knowledge regarding the characteristics and epidemiological factors of the ND virus (NDV) is critical for the control and prevention of ND. Effective vaccinations can prevent and control the spread of the NDV in poultry populations. For decades, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has reported the impacts of ND on commercial and traditional poultry farming systems. The reports were preliminary clinical observations, and few cases were confirmed in the laboratory. However, data on the phylogenetic, genetic, and virological characteristics of NDVs circulating in the DRC are not available. In this study, the whole-genome sequences of three NDV isolates obtained using the next-generation sequencing method revealed two isolates that were a new variant of NDV, and one isolate that was clustered in the subgenotype VII.2. All DRC isolates were velogenic and were antigenically closely related to the vaccine strains. Our findings reveal that despite the circulation of the new variant, ND can be controlled in the DRC using the current vaccine. However, epidemiological studies should be conducted to elucidate the endemicity of the disease so that better control strategies can be implemented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNewcastle disease 3aindigenous species 3aphylogeny 3apoultry 3asubgenotype 3avaccines 3aviruses 3aDemocratic Republic of the Congo1 aNguyễn, Lâm Thành,1 aMasumu, Justin 1 aMpoyo, Patrick 1 aMpiana, Serge 1 aSumbu, Julienne 1 aOkamatsu, Masatoshi 1 aMatsuno, Keita 1 aIsoda, Norikazu 1 aZecchin, Bianca 1 aMonne, Isabella 1 aSakoda, Yoshihiro 0 tViruses.g2021 Jan. 20, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130201513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01863naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245012100165300001800286520087800304592002801182650002101210650001001231650001901241650001301260650001001273650001101283651002301294700001601317773013001333856007701463852000901540655001201549IND60594540420221116170907.0180625s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059454042DNAL7 a10.1656/045.024.s7162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerbert Wilson, W.10aWinter Movements of Sitta canadensis L.

B135-B146.  aWe analyzed 55 years of abundance data (1960–2014) for Sitta canadensis (Red-breasted Nuthatch) to seek patterns of winter irruptions on temporal and spatial scales. This species shows an erratic pattern of irruption into southerly areas from its northern breeding areas. Irruptions show a broad geographic synchrony. At the narrower level of the state or province and even more so at the level of individual counts, correlations of abundance in adjacent areas become weaker. The abundance of irruptive birds is best considered a mosaic. At the regional scale, correlations of Red-breasted Nuthatch abundance with irruptive northern finches that also depend on conifer seeds are weak to absent. The data suggest that birds irrupt because of failure of conifer seed production on the breeding grounds, not because the birds are seeking masting conifer stands to the south.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSitta canadensis 3abirds 3abreeding sites 3aconifers 3aseeds 3awinter 3aNew England region1 aBrown, Bets0 tNortheastern naturalist.g2017, v. 24, no. sp7 p.B135-B146dHumboldt Field Research InstitutewJournal:19634x1092-61947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1656/045.024.s7163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245013200208300001800340520129000358592002801648596007801676650004401754650002201798650002101820650002201841650001201863650001301875650001201888650001701900650001301917650001101930650002101941650001801962650001601980700002601996700001802022700002402040773012602064856008202190852000902272655001202281IND60698077420221122054251.0200608e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069807742DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-019-00893-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSehume, Thabo Z.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3814-872710aBio-oil Production from Sweet Sorghum Bagasse Via Liquefaction Using Alkaline Solutions and Identification of Phenolic Products  ap. 3593-3607.  aThe feasibility of converting biomass into bio-oil and the effect of an alkaline treatment during biomass liquefaction was studied. Sweet sorghum bagasse (SSB) was treated with NaOH concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, 3.0 and 6.0 M. The experiments were conducted in a temperature range of 260–320 °C in N₂. The results showed that the alkaline treatment affected the product distribution of SSB liquefaction. The highest yield of bio-oil (53.2 wt%) and phenols extracted (≈ 40.0 wt%) were obtained at 320 °C and NaOH aqueous solution of 3.0 M. The ATR-FTIR results indicated the presence of carboxyl, ketone, ester and aromatic ring structures in the bio-oils. The absorption intensities of all the bio-oils at 1100 cm⁻¹ (primary alcohols) substantially decreased with an increase in temperature and NaOH concentration. At given reaction temperature, the use of 3.0 and 6.0 M NaOH resulted in the extraction of more identifiable phenol derivatives than were obtained with the lower concentrations of NaOH. These results suggest that a temperature of 320 °C and a NaOH concentration of 3.0 M yields the best results among the temperatures and concentrations tested, and also that alkaline treatment is feasible for liquefaction and extraction of phenols from the bio-oil.  aPublisher supplied data  aTP1208137225cSouth African Agency for Science and Technology Advancement 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aSorghum (Poaceae) 3aalkali treatment 3aaqueous solutions 3abagasse 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3aliquefaction 3anitrogen 3aphenol 3asodium hydroxide 3asweet sorghum 3atemperature1 aStrydom, Christien A.1 aBunt, John R.1 aSchobert, Harold H.0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2020 July, v. 11, no. 7 p.3593-3607dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-019-00893-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245017400160300001600334520184600350592002802196650002702224650001102251650001502262650001402277650001602291650000902307650001202316650001202328650001302340650001702353650001802370650001102388650002102399653001502420653001402435653001902449653002402468653001902492653001302511700002002524700002102544700002702565700002002592773013702612856007802749852000902827655001202836IND60131766120221119171831.0151127e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013176612DNAL7 a10.1638/2013-0097R.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFahlman, Åsa10aLow flow oxygen therapy from a portable oxygen concentrator or an oxygen cylinder effectively treats hypoxemia in anesthetized white-tailed deer (odocoileus virginianus)  ap. 272-277.  aFor treatment of hypoxemia, delivery of the minimum effective oxygen flow rate is advantageous during field anesthesia because it prolongs the life of the oxygen cylinder. Portable oxygen concentrators as the oxygen source require less logistical considerations than cylinders and are a safer alternative during helicopter field work because they are nonexplosive devices. The objective of this study was to evaluate low oxygen flow rates by continuous or pulsed intranasal delivery for treatment of hypoxemia in anesthetized white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Nine captive adult female deer (body mass 56–72 kg) were physically restrained in a drop-floor chute and hand injected intramuscularly with medetomidine (0.1–0.14 mg/kg) and ketamine (2.5–4.3 mg/kg). Intranasal oxygen was delivered from an oxygen cylinder at continuous flow rates of 1 and 2 L/min or from a battery driven oxygen concentrator (EverGoᵀᴹ Portable Oxygen Concentrator, Respironics®) with pulse-dose delivery (maximum capacity of 1.05 L/min). The pulse-dose setting (pulse volume 12–70 ml) was adjusted according to the respiratory rate. Arterial blood gases were analyzed before, during, and after O₂ supplementation. A 10-min washout period was allowed between treatment groups. All three treatments adequately treated hypoxemia. The partial pressure of arterial oxygenation increased significantly from baseline values of 55 ± 10 to 115 ± 31 mm Hg during supplementation from the oxygen concentrator, to 138 ± 21 mm Hg during supplementation from the oxygen cylinder at 1 L/min, and to 201 ± 42 mm Hg at 2 L/min. In conclusion, low flow rates of intranasal oxygen supplemented continuously from an oxygen cylinder or by pulsed delivery from a portable oxygen concentrator effectively treated hypoxemia in anesthetized white-tailed deer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3aadults 3aanesthesia 3abatteries 3ablood gases 3adeer 3afemales 3ahypoxia 3aketamine 3amedetomidine 3anormal values 3aoxygen 3arespiratory rate 0aAnesthesia 0ahypoxemia 0aimmobilization 0aoxygen concentrator 0aoxygen therapy 0awildlife1 aCaulkett, Nigel1 aWoodbury, Murray1 aDuke-Novakovski, Tanya1 aWourms, Vincent0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2014 June, v. 45, no. 2 p.272-277dAmerican Association of Zoo Veterinariansx1042-72607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638%2F2013-0097R.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001700171245013400188300001400322520109800336592002801434650001401462650001601476650001801492650002501510650002301535650002201558650001601580650001701596650002801613650003401641650001201675650004101687650002601728650004901754650003301803650002501836650005001861650002601911650003801937650002701975650001702002653002302019653002802042653001702070653001202087700001802099700002202117773010402139856008702243852000902330655001202339IND50067163920221120235304.0190409e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006716392DNAL7 a236729412pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2013.04.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, You-Xun10aMetabolomics-based component profiling of Halomonas sp.

KM-1, was used. Intracellular metabolites were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to characterize the metabolic profile. Significant changes relating to PHB production were observed in the TCA cycle, lipid-synthesis and amino acid biosynthetic pathways were found to shift dramatically between the exponential growth and stationary phases. During the stationary phase, 17 metabolites were upregulated and a cell dry mass of 17.8g/L that included 44.8% PHB was observed at 24h in 5% glucose-supplemented cultures, whereas 11 metabolites were upregulated and a cell dry mass of 38.4g/L that included 73.7% PHB was observed at 36h in 10% glucose-supplemented cultures. This study provides pattern analysis of metabolite regulation during PHB accumulation, indicating that multicomponent and phase-specific mechanisms are involved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHalomonas 3aamino acids 3abatch systems 3abiochemical pathways 3agas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aBatch Cell Culture Techniques 2aBiomass 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aGlucosexpharmacology 2aHalomonasxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aHydroxybutyratesxmetabolism 2aLipidsxbiosynthesis 2aMetabolic Networks and Pathwaysxdrug effects 2aMetabolomicsxmethods 2aMicrobial Viabilityxdrug effects 2aPolyestersxmetabolism 2aTime Factors 0aHalomonas sp.

The activated carbons were obtained by chemically activating the African Palm Stone with a mix of 2% CaCl2 solution and 32% H3PO4 solution. After the activation, the activated carbons were functionalized to increase the solids nitrogen content. In the study we determined the immersion enthalpies in benzene, water, NaOH, and HCl solutions. Additionally, the samples were characterized by N2 adsorption at 77K and Boehm titration. The calorimetric study showed that the immersion of different solids in respective solvents and solutions generated enthalpy values between −6.22Jg⁻¹ and −173.2Jg⁻¹. The immersion enthalpies of samples in the employed liquids varied with different functionalization processes to which the materials were subjected, showing changes in the carbons’ textural and chemical characteristics. Surface areas and pore volumes decreased with the functionalization process because of the nitrogen surface groups’ blocking the solids’ porosity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3abenzene 3acalcium chloride 3acalorimetry 3aenthalpy 3ahydrochloric acid 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aphosphoric acid 3aphysicochemical properties 3aporosity 3asodium hydroxide 3asolvents 3atitration 0aActivated carbon 0aCalorimetry 0aChemical surface 0aFunctionalization1 aGiraldo, L.1 aMoreno-Piraján, J.C.0 tThermochimica acta.g2015 July 10, v. 611 p.20-25dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2015.04.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02153naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245014400167300001400311520094900325592002801274653001501302653003401317653001801351653002101369653002201390653002201412653004101434653001801475653002301493653002601516700002001542700001801562773011601580856008601696852000901782655001201791IND60596078120221121173205.0180612e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059607812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2017.01.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Jiho10aDevelopment and experimental investigation of Stirling-type pulse tube refrigerator (PTR) below 20 K; cold compressor and colder expander  ap. 64-76.  aThis research paper focuses on the experimental investigation of the Stirling-type pulse tube refrigerator with cold compression concept. Due to this innovative feature, the pulse tube refrigerator can reach lower temperature effectively other typical single-stage Stirling-type pulse tube refrigerators. The experiment as a proof of concept is carried out to demonstrate the capability of the pulse tube refrigerator operating between 80 K and 20 K. The cold linear compressor, which is submerged in a liquid nitrogen bath, produces cold mass flow with the efficiency of 85% for all the frequencies. At the lowest temperature part of the pulse tube refrigerator, the no-load temperature of 18.7 K is recorded and the cooling power of 0.4 W is measured at 20 K. The experimental results are analyzed in dynamic and thermal aspects by using the numerical model. The model can well explain how much losses are distributed in the system.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCryocooler 0aPulse tube refrigerator (PTR) 0aStirling-type 0aCold-compression 0aLinear compressor 0aCryorefroidisseur 0aRéfrigérateur à tube à pulsation 0aType Stirling 0aCompression froide 0aCompresseur linéaire1 aJeong, Sangkwon1 aCha, Jeongmin0 tInternational journal of refrigeration.g2017 Mar., v. 75 p.64-76dElsevier LtdwJournal:26758x0140-70077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2017.01.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03207naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006500142245011700207300001400324500002000338520174600358592002802104596004802132596004802180596004802228650001502276650002102291650001502312650001502327650001302342650001402355650002002369650002202389700006002411700006202471700006302533773012702596856007702723852000902800655001202809IND60789537620221120073252.0220821e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078953762DNAL7 a10.1002/2017JF0044102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrancevic, Jeffrey P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1890-755114aThe Role of Three‐Dimensional Boundary Stresses in Limiting the Occurrence and Size of Experimental Landslides  ap. 46-65.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe occurrence of seepage‐induced shallow landslides on hillslopes and steep channel beds is important for landscape evolution and natural hazards. Infinite‐slope stability models have been applied for seven decades, but sediment beds generally require higher water saturation levels than predicted for failure, and controlled experiments are needed to test models. We initiated 90 landslides in a 5 m long laboratory flume with a range in sediment sizes (D = 0.7, 2, 5, and 15 mm) and hillslope angles (θ = 20° to 43°), resulting in subsurface flow that spanned the Darcian and turbulent regimes, and failures that occurred with subsaturated and supersaturated sediment beds. Near complete saturation was required for failure in most experiments, with water levels far greater than predicted by infinite‐slope stability models. Although 3‐D force balance models predict that larger landslides are less stable, observed downslope landslide lengths were typically only several decimeters, not the entire flume length. Boundary stresses associated with short landslides can explain the increased water levels required for failure, and we suggest that short failures are tied to heterogeneities in granular properties. Boundary stresses also limited landslide thicknesses, and landslides progressively thinned on lower gradient hillslopes until they were one grain diameter thick, corresponding to a change from near‐saturated to supersaturated sediment beds. Thus, landslides are expected to be thick on steep hillslopes with large frictional stresses acting on the boundaries, whereas landslides should be thin on low‐gradient hillslopes or in channel beds with a critical saturation level that is determined by sediment size.  aPublisher supplied data  aEAR-0922199cUS National Science Foundation  aEAR-1349115cUS National Science Foundation  aEAR-1452337cUS National Science Foundation 3ageophysics 3ahydraulic flumes 3alandscapes 3alandslides 3aresearch 3asediments 3asubsurface flow 3atopographic slope1 aLamb, Michael P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5701-05041 aPalucis, Marisa C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0034-58101 aVenditti, Jeremy G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2876-42510 tJournal of geophysical research.g2018 Jan., v. 123, no. 1 p.46-65dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27941x2169-90037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JF0044103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245015800163300001800321520103500339592002801374650002301402650002101425650002301446650001401469650001001483650001601493650001301509700001501522700001601537700001401553700001601567700001701583700001801600700001301618773012501631856008101756852000901837655001201846IND60575070820221116143739.0170728e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057507082DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-017-1772-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Xuelian10aTobacco etch virus protease mediating cleavage of the cellulose-binding module tagged colored proteins immobilized on the regenerated amorphous cellulose  ap. 1101-1110.  aIn this study, four fusion proteins were designed, in which the N-terminal cellulose-binding module as the affinity tag was immobilized on the regenerated amorphous cellulose (RAC), and the release of the C-terminal colored proteins was detected easily and rapidly after on-resin cleavage using the free tobacco etch virus protease (TEVp) variant, or the immobilized cognate protease with a binding capacity of up to 220 mg protein per gram of RAC. The enhanced stability and repetitive use of the immobilized TEVp compensated slight loss of the catalytic efficiency toward the soluble protein substrate. On-resin cleavage and purity of the released target proteins are related to the context of the fusion tag, the incorporated linker composition, and the colored protein. Owing to low cost and high binding capacity of the RAC, the TEVp immobilized on the resin is an ideal alternative for removing fusion tag. The colored proteins are easily monitored in the on-resin process of fusion proteins, and rapid separation from RAC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTobacco etch virus 3abinding capacity 3acatalytic activity 3acellulose 3acolor 3aproteinases 3aproteins1 aSun, Jiaqi1 aWang, Weiyu1 aJiang, Li1 aWang, Ruyue1 aXiao, Wenjun1 aCheng, Beijiu1 aFan, Jun0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2017 July, v. 40, no. 7 p.1101-1110dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1615-75917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-017-1772-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02188naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001500140245012800155300001600283500000900299500001500308520110500323592002801428650002201456650001901478650001501497650001201512650002901524650001601553650002201569653002401591700001901615773011801634852000901752856007701761655001201838IND4402683320221119173325.0191126e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440268332DNAL7 a10.2136/vzj2006.00762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yushu,10aEfficient Schemes for Reducing Numerical Dispersion in Modeling Multiphase Transport through Heterogeneous Geological Media  ap. 340-349.  aepub  a2019-12-06  aWhen modeling transport of chemicals or solute in realistic large-scale subsurface systems, numerical issues are a serious concern, even with the continual progress made over the past few decades in both simulation algorithms and computer hardware. The problem becomes even more difficult when dealing with chemical transport in a vadose zone or multiphase flow system using coarse, multidimensional regular or irregular grids because of the known effects of numerical dispersion associated with moving plume fronts. We have investigated several total variation diminishing (TVD) or flux-limiter schemes by implementing and testing them in the T2R3D code, one of the TOUGH2 family of codes. The objectives of this paper are (i) to investigate the possibility of applying these TVD schemes, using multidimensional irregular unstructured grids, and (ii) to help select more accurate spatial averaging methods for simulating chemical transport, given a numerical grid or spatial discretization. We present an application example to show that such TVD schemes can effectively reduce numerical dispersion.  aPublisher supplied data 3asimulation models 3asoil pollution 3apollutants 3asolutes 3asoil transport processes 3avadose zone 3ahydrologic models 0amathematical models1 aForsyth, P.

In general, seed food was less affected by the treatments than insect food. The impact of seed mixture on the abundance of seed food was dependent on the study year: the highest level recorded in the first year, followed by a substantial decline in the following years. Mowing increased the biomass of seed food. The impact of treatments on insect food abundance differed between the total amount of insect food, and had significant interactions with year. Different insect groups dominated in each year as well as their response to the treatments. For the total amount, the meadow plant seed mixture appeared to be the most beneficial and a slight positive impact of mowing appeared in the last two years of the experiment. The results suggest that the value of set-asides in providing food differs according to food components and declines with increasing age of the set-aside.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrasses 3along term experiments 3aseeds 3ameadows 3aedible insects 3aagricultural land 3amowing 3aseed mixtures 3abiomass 3aSpermatophytina 3abirds 0aSpermatophyta1 aHuusela-Veistola, Erja0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2011 Sept., v. 143, no. 1 p.20-27dElsevier B.V.x0167-88097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2011.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001100139245004200150300001800192500001900210500002000229520116700249592002801416596005901444596005901503650001601562650001101578650001201589650001701601650001201618650001301630650001601643700001801659700002101677700002001698700005101718773011601769856007301885852000901958655001201967IND60718300120221119123042.0201124e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071830012DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.149842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, En10aFERONIA mediates root nutating growth  ap. 1105-1116.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRoot nutation indicates the behavior that roots grow in a waving and skewing way due to unequal growth rates on different sides. Although a few developmental and environmental factors have been reported, genetic pathways mediating this process are obscure. We report here that the Arabidopsis CrRLK1L family member FERONIA (FER) is critical for root nutation. Functional loss of FER resulted in enhanced root waviness on tilted plates or roots forming anti‐clockwise coils on horizontal plates. Suppressing polar auxin transport, either by pharmacological treatment or by introducing mutations at PIN‐FORMED2 (PIN2) or AUXIN RESISTANT1 (AUX1), suppressed the asymmetric root growth (ARG) in fer‐4, a null mutant of FER, indicating that FER suppression of ARG depends on polar auxin transport. We further showed by pharmacological treatments that dynamic microtubule organization and Ca²⁺ signaling are both critical for FER‐mediated ARG. Results presented here demonstrate a key role of FER in mediating root nutating growth, through PIN2‐ and AUX1‐mediated auxin transport, through dynamic microtubule organization, and through Ca²⁺ signaling.  aPublisher supplied data  a31771558cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31970332cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aArabidopsis 3aauxins 3acalcium 3amicrotubules 3amutants 3anutation 3aroot growth1 aWang, Guangda1 aZhang, Yu‐Ling1 aKong, Zhaosheng1 aLi, Sha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7197-01810 tplant journal.g2020 Nov., v. 104, no. 4 p.1105-1116dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.149843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245008300164300001600247520115400263592002801417650002301445650001901468650003101487650001301518650001201531650001201543650001701555650001701572650000901589650001501598653002501613653001701638653001901655653002401674653002001698700002501718700001701743700002601760700002501786700002701811700002001838700002601858773013701884856007802021852000902099655001202108IND60131766920221119171817.0151127e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013176692DNAL7 a10.1638/2013-0153R.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrogh, Anne K.

Reference intervals established were as follows: SAA, 29.5–87.7 mg/L; CRP, 0–17.5 mg/L; haptoglobin, 354.3–2,414.7 mg/L; albumin, 36.1–53.0 g/L; and iron, 13.3–40.2 μmol/L. Furthermore, changes in the acute-phase reactants were studied in two additional groups of animals: eight rhesus macaques suffering from acute traumatic injuries and nine rhesus macaques experimentally infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis reflecting a chronic active inflammation. In animals with inflammation, SAA and haptoglobin concentrations were moderately increased, while CRP increased more than 200-fold. In addition, marked decreases in albumin and iron concentrations were observed. These results show that SAA, CRP, and haptoglobin are positive acute-phase proteins, whereas albumin and iron are negative acute-phase reactants in rhesus macaques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aMacaca mulatta 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aalbumins 3aamyloid 3aanimals 3ahaptoglobins 3ainflammation 3airon 3amonitoring 0aAcute-phase proteins 0ainflammation 0aMacaca mulatta 0areference intervals 0arhesus macaques1 aLundsgaard, Jo F.

The methodology uses stochastic optimisation on 200 biogas profile scenarios generated from industrial data and envisages a Pareto approach for an a posteriori assessment of the optimal number of generation unit for the most representative plant configuration sizes. The method ensures that the dominant role of biogas fluctuation is included in the market potential and guarantees that the utilization factor of the modules remains higher than 70% to justify the investment costs. Results show that the market potential for solid oxide fuel cells across Europe would lead up to 1,300 MW of installed electric capacity in the niche market of wastewater treatment and could initiate a capital and fixed costs reduction which could make the technology comparable with alternative combined heat and power solutions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiogas 3acapital 3aelectricity 3aheat 3aniche markets 3apower generation 3asludge 3awastewater treatment 3aEurope 0aSolid oxide fuel cells 0aBiogas 0aOptimisation 0aWastewater treatment1 aGiarola, Sara1 aLanzini, Andrea1 aGandiglio, Marta1 aSantarelli, Massimo1 aOluleye, Gbemi1 aHawkes, Adam1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9720-332X0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 279 p.111753-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1117533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02185naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245017500172520093500347592002801282650003401310650001501344650001301359650001401372650001301386650001701399650000901416650001301425650001401438650001401452650001101466650002201477650001301499650001101512653002701523653002301550700002201573773008101595856009001676852000901766655001201775IND60659299720221119221145.0190822e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065929972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1244892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Sang-Ho10aCarbothermal preparation of magnetic-responsible ferrihydrite based on Fe-rich precipitates for immobilization of arsenate and antimonate: Batch and spectroscopic studies  aThe present study provides the starch-mediated carbothermal preparation of magnetic-responsible ferrihydrite (MFHP) based on Fe-rich precipitates which is recovered by mine drainage for immobilization of arsenate and antimonate in water. Fe K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) represented partial transformation from ferrihydrite to magnetite in MFHP due to the carbothermal reduction process, resulting in an effective saturation magnetism (= 19.2 emu/g). As and Sb K-edge EXAFS revealed that arsenate ion combines onto the surface of MFHP as inner-sphere binuclear bidentate surface complex, and antimonate forms inner-sphere mononuclear bidentate complex. In addition, the leachability by toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) implies the environmental friendly preparation method for preparing magnetic-responsible adsorbents using mining waste.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aantimony 3aarsenates 3adrainage 3aferrihydrite 3airon 3aleaching 3amagnetism 3amagnetite 3amining 3aspectral analysis 3atoxicity 3awastes 0aCarbothermal synthesis 0aMagnetic adsorbent1 aTakahashi, Yoshio0 tChemosphere.g2019 Dec., v. 237dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1244893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008100163300001600244520154400260592002801804650002201832650001001854650002101864650002101885650001801906650001401924650001101938650001301949650003001962650002401992650001102016650001302027650001402040650002002054650001302074651001102087700001902098700001602117700001702133700001802150700002002168773009602188856008102284852000902365655001202374IND60555458120221118005826.0170916e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055545812DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-016-3658-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDalerum, F.10aNetwork topology of stable isotope interactions in a sub-arctic raptor guild  ap. 511-518.  aPredation is an ecologically important process, and intra-guild interactions may substantially influence the ecological effects of predator species. Despite a rapid expansion in the use of mathematical graph theory to describe trophic relations, network approaches have rarely been used to study interactions within predator assemblages. Assemblages of diurnal raptors are subject to substantial intra- and interspecific competition. Here we used the novel approach of applying analyzes based on network topology to species-specific data on the stable isotopes ¹³C and ¹⁵N in feathers to evaluate patterns of relative resource utilization within a guild of diurnal raptors in northern Sweden. Our guild consisted of the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), the gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus), the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and the rough-legged buzzard (Buteo lagopus). We found a modular trophic interaction structure within the guild, but the interactions were less nested than expected by chance. These results suggest low redundancy and hence a strong ecological importance of individual species. Our data also suggested that species were less connected through intra-guild interactions than expected by chance. We interpret our results as a convergence on specific isotope niches, and that body size and different hunting behaviour may mediate competition within these niches. We finally highlight that generalist predators could be ecologically important by linking specialist predator species with disparate dietary niches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAquila chrysaetos 3aButeo 3aFalco peregrinus 3aFalco rusticolus 3abirds of prey 3abody size 3aeagles 3afeathers 3ainterspecific competition 3amathematical theory 3aniches 3anitrogen 3apredation 3astable isotopes 3atopology 3aSweden1 aHellström, P.1 aMiranda, M.1 aNyström, J.1 aEkenstedt, J.1 aAngerbjörn, A.0 tOecologia.g2016 Oct., v. 182, no. 2 p.511-518dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-016-3658-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007600166300001700242520128400259592002801543650001201571650000901583650002001592650002301612650001701635650000901652650001101661650001501672650002101687650001101708650001601719700001801735700001501753700001401768700001201782700002101794700001501815700001701830773012401847856008101971852000902052655001202061IND60575071120221119221423.0170728e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057507112DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-017-1762-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCâmara, M. M.10aOn-line identification of fermentation processes for ethanol production  ap. 989-1006.  aA strategy for monitoring fermentation processes, specifically, simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of corn mash, was developed. The strategy covered the development and use of first principles, semimechanistic and unstructured process model based on major kinetic phenomena, along with mass and energy balances. The model was then used as a reference model within an identification procedure capable of running on-line. The on-line identification procedure consists on updating the reference model through the estimation of corrective parameters for certain reaction rates using the most recent process measurements. The strategy makes use of standard laboratory measurements for sugars quantification and in situ temperature and liquid level data. The model, along with the on-line identification procedure, has been tested against real industrial data and have been able to accurately predict the main variables of operational interest, i.e., state variables and its dynamics, and key process indicators. The results demonstrate that the strategy is capable of monitoring, in real time, this complex industrial biomass fermentation. This new tool provides a great support for decision-making and opens a new range of opportunities for industrial optimization.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acorn 3adecision making 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3amash 3amodels 3amonitoring 3asaccharification 3asugars 3atemperature1 aSoares, R.

Variable Extent of Anisotropic Ice and Soft Basal Sediment From Seismic Reflection Data Acquired on Store Glacier, West Greenland  ap. 349-362.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOutlet glaciers of the Greenland Ice Sheet transport ice from the interior to the ocean and contribute directly to sea level rise because discharge and ablation often exceed the accumulation. To develop a better understanding of these fast‐flowing glaciers, we investigate the basal conditions of Store Glacier, a large outlet glacier flowing into Uummannaq Fjord in west Greenland. We use two crossing seismic profiles acquired near the centerline, 30 km upstream of the calving front, to interpret the physical nature of the ice and bed. We identify one notably englacial and two notably subglacial seismic reflections on both profiles. The englacial reflection represents a change in crystal orientation fabric, interpreted to be the Holocene‐Wisconsin transition. From Amplitude‐Versus‐Angle (AVA) analysis we infer that the deepest ∼80 m of ice of the parallel‐flow profile below this reflection is anisotropic with an enhancement of simple shear of ∼2. The ice is underlain by ∼45 m of unconsolidated sediments, below which there is a strong reflection caused by the transition to consolidated sediments. In the across‐flow profile subglacial properties vary over small scale and the polarity of the ice‐bed reflection switches from positive to negative. We interpret these as patches of different basal slipperiness associated with variable amounts of water. Our results illustrate variability in basal properties, and hence ice‐bed coupling, at a spatial scale of ∼100 m, highlighting the need for direct observations of the bed to improve the basal boundary conditions in ice‐dynamic models.  aPublisher supplied data  aNE/K006126/1cUK National Environment Research Council (NERC)  aNE/K005871/1cUK National Environment Research Council (NERC)  agrant 223259cResearch Council of Norway 3aanisotropy 3afabrics 3ageophysics 3aglaciers 3aice 3aresearch 3asea level 3asediments 3aGreenland1 aChristoffersen, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2643-87241 aHubbard, B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3565-38751 aDoyle, S.

In the Atlantic Forest occurrence data of this species are extremely rare. Here we document new records of the bush dog in four reserves in a large remnant of continuous coastal Atlantic Forest in Paraná state, southern Brazil. From a total of 4,112 trap days in two camera-trap surveys in 2009 and 2011 we obtained one opportunistic sighting and three independent photographic records of the bush dog. Additionally, park guards reported previous sightings (>4 years earlier) in three of these reserves, including the reserve where we did not record the species. Our results indicate that the remnant coastal Atlantic Forest of Paraná state is an important region for the conservation of the bush dog in southern Brazil. Given the rarity of this species in its natural habitat we suggest that conservation efforts in this region should focus on minimizing the potential threats (prey depletion from poaching and disease transmission from domestic dog) to the species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpeothos venaticus 3acameras 3adisease transmission 3adogs 3aforests 3ahabitats 3asurveys 3atropics 3aBrazil 0aAtlantic Forest 0aBrazil 0abush dog 0acamera trap 0aParaná 0aSpeothos venaticus1 aIngberman, Bianca0 tOryx.g2013 Jan., v. 47, no. 1 p.105-108dCambridge University PresswJournal:1955x1365-30087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S003060531200052X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012500167300001800292520170800310592002802018650001002046650002302056650001602079650002102095650002102116650002102137650001802158650001202176650002802188650001402216650002002230650001802250700001802268700001702286700002002303700002202323773008902345856008102434852000902515655001202524IND60449330420221118044607.0151031e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044933042DNAL7 a10.1007/s00709-015-0784-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aResnik, Nataša14aThe effect of LDL particles on the behaviour of epithelial noncancer and cancer cell lines after in vitro induced injury  ap. 1537-1550.  aCell spreading capability and cell proliferation are the major processes in wound healing of injured epithelia as well as in tumour progression. The effect of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles as a major extracellular source of cholesterol was evaluated in the re-epithelisation assay of in vitro induced injury. We selected two noncancer cell lines with different dependence on LDL concentrations, the kidney epithelial cells (MDCK) with higher dependence and keratinocytes (HaCaT) with lower dependence on LDL, and three cancer cell lines originating from epithelial cells: A549 (alveolar), CaCo-2 (intestinal) and RT4 (urothelial). All cells were incubated in a control medium, in an LDL-enriched medium or in an LDL-deficient medium. The LDL-enriched medium stimulated cell spreading of MDCK cells which, together with increased proliferation of these cells, resulted in an enhanced re-epithelisation of in vitro induced injury. LDL deficiency caused lower cell spreading which resulted in a decreased re-epithelisation despite the higher proliferation of MDCK cells in this medium. The re-epithelisation of keratinocytes (HaCaT) was not affected by altered LDL concentrations. In cancer cell lines A549, CaCo-2 and RT4, wide heterogeneity regarding cell proliferation and spreading capability was observed after treatment with different LDL concentrations. LDL had no influence on actin filament and tight junction distribution in any of the tested cell lines. The cholesterol content of all cell types, except for CaCo-2 cells, proved to be independent of the LDL level. Further research of the beneficial effects of LDL is needed to prove LDL as a safe enhancer of epithelial wound healing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3acell proliferation 3acholesterol 3aepithelial cells 3ahuman cell lines 3ain vitro studies 3akeratinocytes 3akidneys 3alow density lipoprotein 3aneoplasms 3atight junctions 3atissue repair1 aMavrič, Anja1 aKeše, Darja1 aVeranič, Peter1 aZupančič, Daša0 tProtoplasma.g2015 Nov., v. 252, no. 6 p.1537-1550dSpringer Viennax0033-183X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-015-0784-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006100142245006200203300001600265500002000281520168800301592002801989596007102017596007402088650001202162650001502174650001802189650001502207650001302222650001402235700006202249700005902311700007402370773012902444856007702573852000902650655001202659IND60789538520221121045026.0220821e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078953852DNAL7 a10.1002/2016JF0040872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBallio, Francesco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8499-170710aLagrangian and Eulerian Description of Bed Load Transport  ap. 384-408.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSediment particles transported as bed load undergo alternating periods of motion and rest, particularly at weak flow intensity. Bed load transport can be investigated by either following the motion of individual particles (Lagrangian approach) or observing the phenomenon at prescribed locations (Eulerian approach). In this paper, the Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions are merged into a unifying framework that includes definitions for quantities used to describe the kinematics of particle motion, as well as the relationships among these quantities. The alternation of motion and rest is represented by two complementary descriptions: (i) proportion of motion, indicating either the relative time spent in motion by an individual particle or the relative number of moving particles; (ii) persistence of motion, indicating the extent to which the process consists of relatively few long periods of motion or of many short ones. The framework only involves first moments of the key quantities. The conceptual developments are tested against results from an experiment with weak bed load transport, demonstrating the soundness of the approach. From an operational point of view, a Lagrangian observation is difficult to perform, since the particle motion is usually investigated for finite spatial domains (e.g., a measurement window within a laboratory or natural reach). Strategies to overcome such limitations are described, suggesting the possibility of obtaining unbiased mean values for Lagrangian descriptors. The proposed framework can be used in any study aimed at parameterizing the kinematic properties of bed load particles as functions of the hydrodynamic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  aMarie Curie‐FP7‐PEOPLE‐2012‐ITNcResearch Executive Agency  aEP/K013513/1cUK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council 3abedload 3ageophysics 3ahydrodynamics 3akinematics 3aresearch 3asediments1 aPokrajac, Dubravka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4623-094X1 aRadice, Alessio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5024-31991 aHosseini Sadabadi, Seyed Abbas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5034-30310 tJournal of geophysical research.g2018 Feb., v. 123, no. 2 p.384-408dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27941x2169-90037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016JF0040873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245010700196300001800303500001900321500002000340520091900360592002801279596003201307596004001339596004601379596002801425596003101453596003101484596003101515650002501546650001601571650002001587650001101607650001401618650001901632650001901651650002001670700006201690700006601752700005901818700005901877700005601936700006201992700006002054773011602114856007302230852000902303655001202312IND60718300520221119123106.0201124e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071830052DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.149832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMattila, Heta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5071-972110aAction spectrum of the redox state of the plastoquinone pool defines its function in plant acclimation  ap. 1088-1104.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe plastoquinone (PQ) pool mediates electron flow and regulates photoacclimation in plants. Here we report the action spectrum of the redox state of the PQ pool in Arabidopsis thaliana, showing that 470–500, 560 or 650–660 nm light favors Photosystem II (PSII) and reduces the PQ pool, whereas 420–440, 520 or 690 nm light favors Photosystem I (PSI) and oxidizes PQ. These data were used to construct a model predicting the redox state of PQ from the spectrum of any polychromatic light source. Moderate reduction of the PQ pool induced transition to light state 2, whereas state 1 required highly oxidized PQ. In low‐intensity PSI light, PQ was more oxidized than in darkness and became gradually reduced with light intensity, while weak PSII light strongly reduced PQ. Natural sunlight was found to favor PSI, which enables plants to use the redox state of the PQ pool as a measure of light intensity.  aPublisher supplied data  cTurku University Foundation  cUniversity of Turku Graduate School  cVilho, Yrjö ja Kalle Väisälän rahasto  cSuomen Kulttuurirahasto  a259075cAcademy of Finland  a265807cAcademy of Finland  a307335cAcademy of Finland 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aacclimation 3alight intensity 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aphotosystem II 3aplastoquinones 3asolar radiation1 aKhorobrykh, Sergey1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0153-51331 aHakala‐Yatkin, Marja1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3200-64371 aHavurinne, Vesa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5213-09051 aKuusisto, Iiris1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9146-936X1 aAntal, Taras1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9690-80341 aTyystjärvi, Taina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0591-86301 aTyystjärvi, Esa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6808-74700 tplant journal.g2020 Nov., v. 104, no. 4 p.1088-1104dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.149833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02343naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245012600165300001800291500001900309520108400328592002801412650001301440650001601453650001201469650001601481650001101497650001401508650002301522650002001545650002101565650001101586650001801597650001401615700002401629700001801653700002001671700002101691773012601712856007401838852000901912655001201921IND60699847620221119193156.0200623e20200622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069984762DNAL7 a10.1039/d0gc00753f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWineinger, Hannah B.12aA method for determining the uniquely high molecular weight of chitin extracted from raw shrimp shells using ionic iquids  ap. 3734-3741.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBecause the very high molecular weight of biopolymers extracted from biomass using ionic liquids (ILs) cannot be accurately determined using conventional methodologies (e.g., gel permeation chromatography, intrinsic viscosity measurements, etc.) due to their insolubility in the solvents used for such measurements, we have developed a new method for Mw determination based on static light scattering (SLS) in IL solution. The method, based on using SLS measurements to calculate weight average molecular weight (Mw) via the Rayleigh equation, was validated by determining the Mw for both commercially available (practical grade, PG-) chitin and chitin extracted from raw shrimp shell using 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate. We have shown that on average the IL-extracted chitin has a high average Mw value, almost two and a half times larger than that for PG-chitin, has a comparatively low polydispersity, and has a degree of acetylation nearly ideal (98(1)% vs. PG-chitin at 82(1)%), thus making the IL-extracted polymer preferable for utilization in materials preparation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aacetylation 3abiomass 3abiopolymers 3achitin 3aequations 3agel chromatography 3agreen chemistry 3amolecular weight 3ashrimp 3ashrimp shells 3aviscosity1 aShamshina, Julia L.1 aKelly, Adrian1 aKing, Catherine1 aRogers, Robin D.0 tGreen chemistry.g2020 June 22, v. 22, no. 12 p.3734-3741dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0gc00753f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04020naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013000167520211200297592002802409650002502437650002602462650001402488650002002502650001102522650001202533650001302545650002502558650001102583650002002594650002802614650001902642650000902661650001602670650002802686650000702714650001502721650001502736650002202751650001902773650001102792650001102803650001502814650001102829650001902840650001602859650001102875650000902886651001202895653001802907653002402925653001202949653001202961653001702973653001902990700001603009700001803025700001603043700001703059700001803076700001503094773011803109856008603227852000903313655001203322IND60723385520221120154906.0210506e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072338552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1117942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jinqi12aA constructed wetland system with aquatic macrophytes for cleaning contaminated runoff/storm water from urban area in Florida  aA community of aquatic macrophytes has an important role in reducing nutrient load and organic and inorganic contaminants in storm/runoff water. However, minimal information is available regarding the efficiency of constructed wetlands for cleaning runoff water from urban areas, especially in the tropical and subtropical regions. This study investigated the effectiveness of constructed wetland integrated with aquatic macrophytes for removal of chemical and microbial contaminants in the storm/runoff water from the urban areas. Water samples were monthly collected in the constructed wetland from the inlet of storm/runoff water, middle and outlet of discharge, and analyzed for physical and chemical properties, concentrations of nutrients, metals, and fecal coliform (FC) during the period of November, 2016 to April, 2018 in St. Lucie county, Florida, USA. The dominant plant species in the constructed wetland included cattail (Typha latifolia), waterthyme (Hydrilla verticillata) and water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), and periphyton filamentous algae (Spirogyra). The improvement of pH and electrical conductivity (EC) was not obvious, but the concentration of total suspended solids was significantly reduced. This system was effective in the removal of fecal coliform (by 68%) and particulate phosphorus (P, 72%), followed by total P (42%) and N (35%). Concentrations of metallic pollutants including cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), and copper (Cu) were mostly below the detection limit (<1 ppb) except for zinc (Zn), of which concentration was reduced by 23%. The removal of FC was consistently effective all the year round, whereas the removal of total N, P and particulate-P was effective in spring and summer, and less in autumn and winter. These results indicate that constructed wetland with a natural aquatic plant community can effectively reduce the loads of nutrients, metals, and fecal coliforms in water column. Regular harvest of aquatic macrophytes communities and collecting litters may further improve the system efficiency for cleaning storm water from urban areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEichhornia crassipes 3aHydrilla verticillata 3aSpirogyra 3aTypha latifolia 3aautumn 3acadmium 3achromium 3aconstructed wetlands 3acopper 3adetection limit 3aelectrical conductivity 3afecal bacteria 3alead 3amacrophytes 3amicrobial contamination 3apH 3aperiphyton 3aphosphorus 3aplant communities 3apollution load 3aspring 3astorms 3astormwater 3asummer 3atotal nitrogen 3aurban areas 3awinter 3azinc 3aFlorida 0aAquatic plant 0aConstructed wetland 0aTotal N 0aTotal P 0aHeavy metals 0aFecal coliform1 aWang, Weimu1 aXiong, Jibing1 aLi, Liguang1 aZhao, Biying1 aSohail, Irfan1 aHe, Zhenli0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 280 p.111794-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1117943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02216naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006900152245010400221300001600325520095400341592002801295653001401323653002401337653002801361653002301389653001201412653002101424653002501445653004201470653003301512653001401545700002001559700002601579700002401605773011801629856008601747852000901833655001201842IND60596079020221121223949.0180612e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059607902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2018.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHervas-Blasco, Estefanía1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7857-627810aStudy of different subcooling control strategies in order to enhance the performance of a heat pump  ap. 324-336.  aThe performance of vapor-compression systems working with subcritical refrigerants varies with the degree of subcooling. There is an optimal subcooling that maximizes efficiency. However, it depends on the operating conditions and the control of the system needs to be adapted. Most of the works available in literature are able to operate in optimal conditions only at the design point or if a system is designed to be able to adapt its subcooling, only complex control algorithms that usually are difficult to set and time-costly, are used. This work focuses on the study of the main variables influencing the optimal subcooling and analyzes two different control methodologies from the theoretical point of view. Based on the theoretical study a final control strategy is selected and tested experimentally. The reliability, stability and robustness of the selected strategy are experimentally demonstrated for a wide set of operating conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHeat pump 0aNatural refrigerant 0aSubcritical refrigerant 0aOptimal subcooling 0aControl 0aPompe à chaleur 0aFrigorigène Naturel 0aFrigorigène à l'état sous-critique 0aSous-refroidissement optimal 0aContrôle1 aPitarch, Miquel1 aNavarro-Peris, Emilio1 aCorberán, José M.0 tInternational journal of refrigeration.g2018 Apr., v. 88 p.324-336dElsevier LtdwJournal:26758x0140-70077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2018.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02484naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010600169300001400275520103300289592002801322650001701350650001301367650002001380650000901400650001301409650002101422650001101443650001201454651001101466653001101477653002101488653001201509653000901521653001701530653001901547653001601566653001801582700001701600700002201617700002001639700001701659700002201676700001501698700003801713700002201751773010201773856008201875852000901957655001201966IND60517199220221123042718.0190728e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051719922DNAL7 a10.1017/S00306053120006952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHunter, Luke T.B.10aWalking with lions: why there is no role for captive-origin lions Panthera leo in species restoration  ap. 19-24.  aDespite formidable challenges and few successes in reintroducing large cats from captivity to the wild, the release of captives has widespread support from the general public and local governments, and continues to occur ad hoc. Commercial so-called lion Panthera leo encounter operations in Africa exemplify the issue, in which the captive breeding of the lion is linked to claims of reintroduction and broader conservation outcomes. In this article we assess the capacity of such programmes to contribute to in situ lion conservation. By highlighting the availability of wild founders, the unsuitability of captive lions for release and the evidence-based success of wild–wild lion translocations, we show that captive-origin lions have no role in species restoration. We also argue that approaches to reintroduction exemplified by the lion encounter industry do not address the reasons for the decline of lions in situ, nor do they represent a model that can be widely applied to restoration of threatened felids elsewhere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanthera leo 3abreeding 3acaptive animals 3acats 3aindustry 3alocal government 3amodels 3awalking 3aAfrica 0aAfrica 0acaptive breeding 0aFelidae 0alion 0aPanthera leo 0areintroduction 0arestoration 0atranslocation1 aWhite, Paula1 aHenschel, Philipp1 aFrank, Laurence1 aBurton, Cole1 aLoveridge, Andrew1 aBalme, Guy1 aBreitenmoser-Würsten, Christine,1 aBreitenmoser, Urs0 tOryx.g2013 Jan., v. 47, no. 1 p.19-24dCambridge University PresswJournal:1955x1365-30087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00306053120006953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245012800203506007600331520105700407592002801464506003701492650001201529650001101541650001501552650000901567650001801576650002201594650001701616650001401633650001501647650002301662650001701685650001001702700001401712700001901726700001601745700001901761700001401780700001401794700001801808700001601826773011901842856007701961852000902038655001202047IND60670076320221207123602.0190925e20190830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067007632DNAL7 a10.3390/genes100906642doi7 aPMC67703352pmcid7 a314802722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Pengcheng 10aNatural Variation and Domestication Selection of <i>ZmPGP1</i> Affects Plant Architecture and Yield-Related Traits in Maize  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aZmPGP1, involved in the polar auxin transport, has been shown to be associated with plant height, leaf angle, yield traits, and root development in maize. To explore natural variation and domestication selection of ZmPGP1, we re-sequenced the ZmPGP1 gene in 349 inbred lines, 68 landraces, and 32 teosintes. Sequence polymorphisms, nucleotide diversity, and neutral tests revealed that ZmPGP1 might be selected during domestication and improvement processes. Marker&ndash;trait association analysis in inbred lines identified 11 variants significantly associated with 4 plant architecture and 5 ear traits. SNP1473 was the most significant variant for kernel length and ear grain weight. The frequency of an increased allele T was 40.6% in teosintes, and it was enriched to 60.3% and 89.1% during maize domestication and improvement. This result revealed that ZmPGP1 may be selected in the domestication and improvement process, and significant variants could be used to develop functional markers to improve plant architecture and ear traits in maize.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalleles 3aauxins 3abiomarkers 3acorn 3adomestication 3agenetic variation 3ainbred lines 3alandraces 3aleaf angle 3aplant architecture 3aplant height 3aseeds1 aWei, Jie 1 aWang, Houmiao 1 aFang, Yuan 1 aYin, Shuangyi 1 aXu, Yang 1 aLiu, Jun 1 aYang, Zefeng 1 aXu, Chenwu 0 tGenes.g2019 Aug. 30, v. 10, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes100906643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01931naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245008400167300001600251520091000267592002801177653003201205653002301237653002601260653002901286653002401315653002701339700001901366700001901385773011801404856008601522852000901608655001201617IND60596079120221121223932.0180612e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059607912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2018.01.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ting10aEmpirical correlation development of R245fa flow in electronic expansion valves  ap. 284-290.  aThe applications of electronic expansion valves in high temperature heat pump have increased rapidly. However, correlations for predicting R245fa mass flow rate through electronic expansion valves in high temperature heat pump are very limited in open literatures. In this study, mass flow rate characteristics of R245fa refrigerant flowing through electronic expansion valves with different operational conditions are studied experimentally, and empirical correlations are proposed based on the experimental data. The results reveal that the mass flow rate increases with increasing opening degree, condensation temperature, subcooling, and orifice diameter. Based on a modified single phase orifice equation, two empirical correlations are proposed by using the power-law correlation and the polynomial fit correlation, and over 92% of the predicted data deviate from the experimental data within ±15%.  aPublisher supplied data 0aElectronic expansion valves 0aR245fa refrigerant 0aEmpirical correlation 0aDétendeur électronique 0aFrigorigène R245fa 0aCorrélation empirique1 aBae, Kyung Jin1 aKwon, Oh Kyung0 tInternational journal of refrigeration.g2018 Apr., v. 88 p.284-290dElsevier LtdwJournal:26758x0140-70077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2018.01.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02069naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245016100169300001400330520085600344592002801200650002201228650002001250650002101270650002001291650001601311650002201327653003001349653002701379653003901406653002201445653002601467700002301493773010101516856008101617852000901698655001201707IND60604084920221119013622.0180716e20150720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060408492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2015.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThieme, Christian10aThermal expansion behavior in the solid solution series BaMg2−xCoxSi2O7 (0≤x≤2), studied by dilatometry and in situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction  ap. 49-54.  aIn the compound BaMg2Si2O7, the Mg²⁺-ions can completely be replaced by Co²⁺-ions. The resulting solid solutions show a phase transition from a low to a high temperature phase. Both, the thermal expansion behavior as well as the phase transition temperature change significantly with the Mg/Co-ratio. The phase transition runs parallel to an increase in volume, which can be detected using dilatometry. The introduction of small CoO concentrations leads to an increase in the phase transition temperature. In order to determine the thermal expansion behavior, dilatometry, as well as high temperature X-ray diffraction was used. The substitution of MgO by up to 50mol% CoO does not lead to a significant change in the thermal expansion behavior. The measured coefficients of thermal expansion lie in a range between 7.0 and 24.0×10⁻⁶K⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3amagnesium oxide 3aphase transition 3asolid solutions 3atemperature 3athermal expansion 0aBarium magnesium silicate 0aBarium cobalt silicate 0aHigh temperature X-ray diffraction 0aThermal expansion 0aSolid oxide fuel cell1 aRüssel, Christian0 tThermochimica acta.g2015 July 20, v. 612 p.49-54dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2015.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03527naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245008400161300001400245500001900259500002000278520213200298592002802430596013802458650002302596650002802619650001602647650002102663650001402684650001502698650001502713650001602728650001402744650001902758700001902777700001702796700002102813700002102834700001802855773013702873856007403010852000903084655001203093IND60718300720221119123122.0201124e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071830072DNAL7 a10.1111/gwmr.124112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStevenson, David10aSimple Resistivity Probe System for Real‐Time Monitoring of Injected Reagents  ap. 54-66.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn situ treatment usually requires contact between an injected reagent and target contaminant to realize mass removal from source zones and plumes. Despite significant site characterization efforts, unknown heterogeneities that exist at all spatial scales often hinder prediction of the distribution of injected reagents. To provide remediation practitioners with additional information on the distribution of injected reagents, a prototype real‐time monitoring probe was designed and tested. This new probe comprises a two‐wire resistivity circuit, hence the designation dipole resistivity probe (DRP). The low‐cost DRPs were built to be attached as arrays to a central stalk, and installed by direct‐push techniques. An installed network of multilevel DRPs can be used to detect the arrival, persistence, and relative concentration of a high‐conductivity reagent solution in real‐time across a zone of interest. Static cell and sandbox experiments were conducted to test and refine the DRP design before field testing. Static cell experimental results indicated that the DRP was sensitive to solution electrical conductivity (EC), and that the probe response and EC relationship is nonlinear and dependent on the fixed resistor used. The choice of fixed resistor can be adjusted to optimize the DRP response over a critical EC range of interest. Under dynamic conditions in the sandbox, the DRP was able to reproduce breakthrough profiles collected by a commercial EC sensor. The results from two field studies demonstrated the utility of the DRPs to generate information regarding the arrival and persistence of reagents in an efficient and cost‐effective manner. The first field study used a network of DRPs to monitor the land application of a sodium sulfate solution, and the second field study employed DRPs to monitor the distribution and longevity of a persulfate solution. While additional field testing is warranted, the results presented are encouraging and suggest that this low‐cost system can be used to improve our understanding of the detailed migration of injected reagents in treatment zones.  aPublisher supplied data  aCRDPJ 429357‐2011cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada Collaborative Research and Development Grant 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrical conductivity 3agroundwater 3aland application 3alongevity 3aprediction 3aprototypes 3aremediation 3aresistors 3asodium sulfate1 aSolano, Felipe1 aWei, Yunxiao1 aThomson, Neil R.1 aBarker, James F.1 aDevlin, J.

Little is known whether hydrophilous plants (pollen transport by water) suffer from an Allee effect due to pollen limitation or not. Hydrophilous pollination is a typical trait of marine angiosperms or seagrasses. Although seagrass flowers usually have high pollen production, floral densities are highly variable. We evaluated pollen limitation for intertidal populations of the seagrass Zostera noltei in The Netherlands and found a significant positive relation between flowering spathe density and fruit-set, which was suboptimal at <1200 flowering spathes m⁻² (corresponding to <600 reproductive shoots m⁻²). A fragmented population had ≈35 % lower fruit-set at similar reproductive density than a continuous population. 75 % of all European populations studied over a large latitudinal gradient had flowering spathe densities below that required for optimal fruit-set, particularly in Southern countries. Literature review of the reproductive output of hydrophilous pollinated plants revealed that seed- or fruit-set of marine hydrophilous plants is generally low, as compared to hydrophilous freshwater and wind-pollinated plants. We conclude that pollen limitation as found in Z. noltei may be a common Allee effect for seagrasses, potentially accelerating decline and impairing recovery even after environmental conditions have improved substantially.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZostera noltei 3adecline 3aenvironmental factors 3aflowering 3aflowers 3afreshwater 3afruit set 3alittoral zone 3apollen 3apollination 3areproductive performance 3aseagrasses 3ashoots 3aNetherlands1 aSoissons, L.

The fusion protein (FOXO1-PAX3/7) retains both binding domains and becomes a novel and potent transcriptional regulator in rhabdomyosarcoma subtypes. Many studies have characterized and integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic differences among rhabdomyosarcoma subtypes that contain the FOXO1-PAX3/7 gene fusion and those that do not; however, few investigations have investigated how gene co-expression networks are altered by FOXO1-PAX3/7. Although transcriptional data offer insight into one level of functional regulation, gene co-expression networks have the potential to identify biological interactions and pathways that underpin oncogenesis and tumorigenicity. Thus, we examined gene co-expression networks for rhabdomyosarcoma that were FOXO1-PAX3 positive, FOXO1-PAX7 positive, or fusion negative. Gene co-expression networks were mined using local maximum Quasi-Clique Merger (lmQCM) and analyzed for co-expression differences among rhabdomyosarcoma subtypes. This analysis observed 41 co-expression modules that were shared between fusion negative and positive samples, of which 17/41 showed significant up- or down-regulation in respect to fusion status. Fusion positive and negative rhabdomyosarcoma showed differing modularity of co-expression networks with fusion negative (n = 109) having significantly more individual modules than fusion positive (n = 53). Subsequent analysis of gene co-expression networks for PAX3 and PAX7 type fusions observed 17/53 were differentially expressed between the two subtypes. Gene list enrichment analysis found that gene ontology terms were poorly matched with biological processes and molecular function for most co-expression modules identified in this study; however, co-expressed modules were frequently localized to cytobands on chromosomes 8 and 11. Overall, we observed substantial restructuring of co-expression networks relative to fusion status and fusion type in rhabdomyosarcoma and identified previously overlooked genes and pathways that may be targeted in this pernicious disease.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarcinogenesis 3achromosome translocation 3achromosomes 3aepigenetics 3agene expression regulation 3agene fusion 3agene ontology 3agenes 3agenomics 3aneoplasms 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics1 aZhan, Xiaohui 1 aPandya, Pankita  H.1 aMurray, Mary E.,1 aPollok, Karen  E.1 aRenbarger, Jamie  L.1 aFerguson, Michael  J.1 aHan, Zhi 1 aNi, Dong 1 aZhang, Jie 1 aHuang, Kun 0 tGenes.g2019 Aug. 30, v. 10, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes100906653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03573naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245007300161300001600234500001900250520182400269592002802093596006302121650002702184650001602211650001802227650001202245650001402257650000902271650002102280650002502301650001302326650001002339650001802349650003002367650001102397650001902408650002602427650001502453650001402468700001402482700001402496700001702510700001702527700001802544700001902562700001902581700001702600700001202617700001202629700001302641700002002654700001502674700001702689700001602706700001502722773010702737856008202844852000902926655001202935IND60698079020221122101010.0200608e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069807902DNAL7 a10.1007/s13199-020-00673-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Lei10aBamboo nutrients and microbiome affect gut microbiome of giant panda  ap. 293-304.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo investigate the relationship between the bamboo including its nutrients and microbiome, and gut microbiome of giant panda, different bamboo species were provided for feeding the giant pandas. Nutrients of bamboo were examined, and the bamboo microbiome and gut microbiome of giant panda were investigated using high throughput sequencing. The results revealed that the composition of gut microbiome in giant panda varied among groups with different bamboo diet. Except for fat and hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin, carbohydrate, protein, flavone and tannin were significantly different between different bamboo species (p < 0.05). PCoA showed that the composition of bamboo microbiome varied by different species. Significant differences in richness and diversity of bacteria were observed between different bamboo (p < 0.05), as well as the abundance of the main bacteria and fungi at phylum and genus level (Kruskal-Wallis, LDA > 4). Interestingly, the content of lignin and cellulose in bamboo was positively associated with the relative abundance of Streptococcus and Clostridium in gut of giant panda, respectively (p < 0.05). The diversity of bamboo bacteria was positively correlated with that of gut bacteria in giant panda (p < 0.05). Significant associations of certain bacteria and fungi between bamboo and gut of giant panda (p < 0.05) were found. 36 bacterial and 54 fungal genera were both shared between bamboo and the gut of giant panda in all groups. Our results demonstrated that the gut microbial community varied between giant pandas fed on different bamboo species revealing that bamboo nutrients and microbiome affect gut microbiome of giant panda. Our findings contributed to the deeper understanding of dietary or environmental impact on gut microbiome of giant panda.  aPublisher supplied data  a10912-2019KYGG201530cScientific Backbone Research Project 3aAiluropoda melanoleuca 3aClostridium 3aStreptococcus 3abamboos 3acellulose 3adiet 3adigestive system 3aenvironmental impact 3aflavones 3afungi 3ahemicellulose 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alignin 3alignin content 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3asymbiosis1 aWu, Daifu1 aLi, Caiwu1 aZhang, Anyun1 aXiong, Yaowu1 aWei, Rongping1 aZhang, Guiquan1 aYang, Shengzhi1 aDeng, Wenwen1 aLi, Di,1 aLi, Bei1 aPan, Xin1 aZhang, Zhizhong1 aHuang, Yan1 aZhang, Hemin1 aHe, Yongguo1 aZou, Likou0 tSymbiosis.g2020 Apr., v. 80, no. 3 p.293-304dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl39183x0334-51147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-020-00673-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03303naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245010600164300001400270500001900284500002000303520190600323592002802229596008002257650001302337650002802350650003002378650002302408650002602431650001702457650001602474650000902490650001302499650002002512650003102532650001502563700002302578700002302601700002502624773013702649856007402786852000902860655001202869IND60718300820221119123043.0201124e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071830082DNAL7 a10.1111/gwmr.124092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchneider, Haley A.10aHigh‐Resolution Characterization of a Chlorinated Solvent Impacted Aquifer Using a Passive Profiler  ap. 27-43.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA direct‐drive high‐resolution passive profiler (HRPP) was developed to quantify and delineate concentrations of chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs), geochemical indicators and CVOC‐degrading microorganisms/genes, as well as to perform compound‐specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) of CVOCs and estimate interstitial velocity at <30‐cm resolution. The profilers can be coupled together to provide a continuous sample interval and advanced to depths up to approximately 9 m below‐ground surface (bgs) within saturated media where direct‐push techniques are feasible. The HRPP was field tested in a previous dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) source zone at the former Naval Air Station in Alameda, CA. HRPP data sets were compared to the following traditional groundwater data sets: CVOC and anion concentrations in standard and multilevel monitoring well water samples, CVOC concentrations in soil core samples, qualitative contaminant profiles delineated with a membrane interface probe (MIP), microbial community and CSIA profiles from Bio‐Traps® deployed in wells, groundwater velocity from passive flux meters (PFMs), lithologic profiles correlated with MIP electrical conductivity (EC), and velocity estimates based on permeability profiles measured with a Geoprobe hydraulic profiling tool (HPT). In some cases, the HRPP data were equivalent to traditional techniques and, in other cases, the HRPP data were more representative of local variability rather than bulk aquifer conditions. Overall the results support the use of the HRPP to provide high‐resolution data on concentrations, velocity, and microbial activity in temporary direct‐push deployments without well installation, providing a new tool to better assess source zones and contaminated groundwater plumes, even in low permeability media, and to increase the fidelity of site transport models.  aPublisher supplied data  aER‐2419cStrategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) 3aaquifers 3aelectrical conductivity 3agroundwater contamination 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial communities 3apermeability 3aremediation 3asoil 3asolvents 3astable isotopes 3avolatile organic compounds 3awell water1 aJackson, W.

In the present investigation, the impacts of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 400–700 nm), ultraviolet-B (UV-B; 280–315 nm), and PAR + UV-B radiations on two cyanobacteria viz., Nostoc sp. HKAR-2 and Nostoc sp. HKAR-11 inhabiting diverse habitats such as hot springs and rice fields, respectively, were studied. Cell viability was about 14 % in Nostoc sp. HKAR-2 and <10 % in Nostoc sp. HKAR-11 after 48 h of UV-B exposure. PAR had negligible negative impact on the survival of both cyanobacteria. The continuous exposure of UV-B and PAR + UV-B showed rapid uncoupling, bleaching, fragmentation, and degradation in both phycocyanin (C-PC) and phycoerythrin (C-PE) subunits of phycobiliproteins (PBPs). Remarkable bleaching effect of C-PE and C-PC was not only observed with UV-B or PAR + UV-B radiation, but longer period (24–48 h) of exposure with PAR alone also showed noticeable negative impact. The C-PE and C-PC subunits of the rice field isolate Nostoc sp. HKAR-11 were severely damaged in comparison to the hot spring isolate Nostoc sp. HKAR-2 with rapid wavelength shifting toward shorter wavelengths denoting the bleaching of both the accessory light harvesting pigments. The results indicate that PBPs of the hot spring isolate Nostoc sp. HKAR-2 were more stable under various light regimes in comparison to the rice field isolate Nostoc sp. HKAR-11 that could serve as a good source of valuable pigments to be used in various biomedical and biotechnological applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNostoc 3ableaching 3acell viability 3ahabitats 3ahot springs 3alight intensity 3apaddies 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aphycocyanin 3aphycoerythrin 3apigments 3aultraviolet radiation 3awavelengths1 aSinha, Rajeshwar P.0 tProtoplasma.g2015 Nov., v. 252, no. 6 p.1551-1561dSpringer Viennax0033-183X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-015-0786-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02243naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245008200161300001800243520104400261592002801305650001301333650002701346650002801373650002501401650001501426650001701441650001501458650003901473650002001512650001101532650001601543700001901559700001601578700001901594700002201613700002701635773011401662856004801776852000901824655001201833IND50059318620221121040835.0150901e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005931862DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-012-0743-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Yi10aImproving the efficiency of enzyme utilization for sugar beet pulp hydrolysis  ap. 1531-1539.  aSugar beet pulp (SBP) is a carbohydrate-rich residue of table sugar processing. It shows promise as a feedstock for fermentable sugar and biofuel production via enzymatic hydrolysis and microbial fermentation. This research focused on the enzymatic hydrolysis of SBP and examined the effects of solid loading (2–10 %, dry basis), enzyme preparation, and enzyme recycle on the production of fermentable sugars. The enzyme partitioning to the solid and liquid phases during SBP enzymatic hydrolysis and loss during recycling were investigated using SDS-PAGE and Zymogram analysis. Without considering product inhibition, the cellulase added initially to the SBP hydrolysis lost only 6 % filter paper activity and negligible carboxymethyl cellulose activity upon multiple cycles of SBP hydrolysis. It was found that enzyme dosage can be reduced by 50 % while maintaining similar, and in some cases higher fermentable sugar yield. The removal of hydrolysis products will further improve enzymatic hydrolysis of SBP for biofuel production.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afeedstocks 3afermentation 3ahydrolysis 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asugar beet pulp 3asugars 3awhite sugar1 aCheng, Yu-Shen1 aYu, Chaowei1 aZhang, Ruihong1 aJenkins, Bryan M.1 aVanderGheynst, Jean S.0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2012 Nov., v. 35, no. 9 p.1531-1539dSpringer-Verlagx1615-75917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-012-0743-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009500166300001400261520104300275592002801318650002201346650001801368650001101386650001801397650001401415650000901429650002401438650002101462653002301483653001701506653001401523653002101537653002101558700002001579700002501599700002001624773010101644856008101745852000901826655001201835IND60604085120221119015609.0180716e20150720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060408512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2015.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJomaa, Ghassan10aKinetic modeling of polyurethane pyrolysis using non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis  ap. 10-18.  aThe pyrolysis of polyurethane was studied by dynamic thermogravimetry analysis (TGA). The studied polyurethane is used as organic binder in casting process to make sand cores and molds. A semi-empirical model is presented that can be used to describe polyurethane pyrolysis occurring during TGA experiments. This model assumes that the polyurethane is pyrolysed by several parallel independent reactions. The kinetic parameters of polyurethane pyrolysis were evaluated by fitting the model to the experimental data obtained by TGA over a wide variety of heating rates. A nonlinear least-squares optimization method is employed in the fitting procedure. A hybrid objectives based simultaneously on the mass (TG) and mass loss rate (DTG) curves has been used in the least-squares method. The values of the activation energy obtained by the non-linear fitting were then recalculated by the methods of Kissinger and Friedmand. Furthermore, the parameters obtained in the present paper were then compared with those reported in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aleast squares 3amodels 3apolyurethanes 3apyrolysis 3asand 3asystem optimization 3athermogravimetry 0aKinetic parameters 0aPolyurethane 0aPyrolysis 0aThermogravimetry 0aKinetic modeling1 aGoblet, Patrick1 aCoquelet, Christophe1 aMorlot, Vincent0 tThermochimica acta.g2015 July 20, v. 612 p.10-18dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2015.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03715naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005600142245012900198300001600327500002000343520183100363592002802194596005702222596005902279596007302338650001602411650001302427650002102440650002802461650001502489650001302504650000802517650000902525650001302534650001402547650001602561650001402577651002102591651001402612700005502626700006202681700005602743700005602799700005702855700005402912700001602966773012902982856007703111852000903188655001203197IND60789539220221121100205.0220821e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078953922DNAL7 a10.1002/2017JF0045292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoyle, S.

Measurements From Boreholes Drilled to the Bed of Store Glacier, West Greenland  ap. 324-348.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMarine‐terminating outlet glaciers of the Greenland Ice Sheet make significant contributions to global sea level rise, yet the conditions that facilitate their fast flow remain poorly constrained owing to a paucity of data. We drilled and instrumented seven boreholes on Store Glacier, Greenland, to monitor subglacial water pressure, temperature, electrical conductivity, and turbidity along with englacial ice temperature and deformation. These observations were supplemented by surface velocity and meteorological measurements to gain insight into the conditions and mechanisms of fast glacier flow. Located 30 km from the calving front, each borehole drained rapidly on attaining ∼600 m depth indicating a direct connection with an active subglacial hydrological system. Persistently high subglacial water pressures indicate low effective pressure (180–280 kPa), with small‐amplitude variations correlated with notable peaks in surface velocity driven by the diurnal melt cycle and longer periods of melt and rainfall. The englacial deformation profile determined from borehole tilt measurements indicates that 63–71% of total ice motion occurred at the bed, with the remaining 29–37% predominantly attributed to enhanced deformation in the lowermost 50–100 m of the ice column. We interpret this lowermost 100 m to be formed of warmer, pre‐Holocene ice overlying a thin (0–8 m) layer of temperate basal ice. Our observations are consistent with a spatially extensive and persistently inefficient subglacial drainage system that we hypothesize comprises drainage both at the ice‐sediment interface and through subglacial sediments. This configuration has similarities to that interpreted beneath dynamically analogous Antarctic ice streams, Alaskan tidewater glaciers, and glaciers in surge.  aPublisher supplied data  aNE/K006126cUK National Environment Research Council  aNE/K005871/1cUK National Environment Research Council  a223259cResearch Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence 3adeformation 3adrainage 3adrainage systems 3aelectrical conductivity 3ageophysics 3aglaciers 3aice 3arain 3aresearch 3asea level 3atemperature 3aturbidity 3aAntarctic region 3aGreenland1 aHubbard, B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3565-38751 aChristoffersen, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2643-87241 aYoung, T.

We studied changes of choline metabolites after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and fat tolerance test (OFTT). Eighteen healthy subjects (mean age 54.3 years; BMI 26.8 kg/m2) underwent 2 tests. First, OFTT (80 g fat) was applied and blood was collected at baseline and 4 h after OFTT. Seven days later, 75 g glucose was applied and blood was collected at baseline and 2 h after OGTT. Plasma concentrations of choline, betaine, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), dimethylglycine, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), lipids and glucose were measured. After OFTT, plasma choline declined (10.6 to 9.2 µmol/L; p = 0.004), betaine declined (33.4 to 31.7 µmol/L; p = 0.003), TMAO slightly increased (4.1 to 5.6 µmol/L; p = 0.105), glucose declined (5.39 to 4.98 mmol/L; p < 0.001), and triglycerides increased (1.27 to 2.53 mmol/L; p < 0.001). After OGTT, plasma choline increased (10.1 to 11.1 µmol/L; p < 0.001), TMAO declined (4.0 to 3.5 µmol/L; p = 0.029), dimethylglycine declined (2.0 to 1.7 µmol/L; p = 0.005), SAM declined (103 to 96 nmol/L; p = 0.041), but betaine, glucose, and SAM were unchanged. In conclusion, OFTT lowered plasma betaine and choline and caused heterogeneous changes in plasma TMAO. OGTT reduced the flow of methyl groups and plasma TMAO.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aS-adenosylmethionine 3abetaine 3ablood 3ablood glucose 3abody mass index 3acholine 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance tests 3ametabolites 3amoieties 3anitrogen oxides 3atriacylglycerols 3atrimethylamine1 aAwwad, Hussain M.1 aKnell, Astrid Ines1 aHübner, Ulrich,1 aGeisel, Jürgen0 tNutrients.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 10, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu100912093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03838naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245012900212500001900341520199800360592002802358650001202386650001502398650001802413650001602431650002902447650001102476650001202487650001802499650002102517650001102538650001602549650002802565650002302593653002402616653001102640653004002651653001102691653000702702653001902709653001102728653001702739653001902756653001802775653001802793653002302811653002402834653001502858700001602873700002002889700001702909700002802926700001602954700005502970773010503025856008503130852000903215655001203224IND60722077820221122035733.0210527e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072207782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2020.1063372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamkarkach, Farida1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4722-697710aHuman biomonitoring initiative (HBM4EU): Human biomonitoring guidance values (HBM-GVs) derived for cadmium and its compounds  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe methodology agreed within the framework of the HBM4EU project is used in this work to derive HBM-GVs for the general population (HBM-GVGₑₙPₒₚ) and for workers (HBM-GVWₒᵣₖₑᵣ) exposed to cadmium (Cd) and its compounds.For Cd, a significant number of epidemiological studies with dose–response relationships are available, in particular for kidney effects. These effects are described in terms of a relation between urinary Cd (U-Cd) or blood Cd (B-Cd) levels and low molecular weight proteinuria (LMWP) markers like beta-2-microglobulin (β2M) and retinol-binding protein (RBP). In order to derive HBM-GVs for the general population and workers, an assessment of data from evaluations conducted by national or international organisations was undertaken. In this work, it appeared relevant to select renal effects as the critical effect for the both groups, however, differences between general population (including sensitive people) and workers (considered as an homogenous population of adults who should not be exposed to Cd if they suffer from renal diseases) required the selection of different key studies (i.e. conducted in general population for HBM-GVGₑₙPₒₚ and at workplace for HBM-GVWₒᵣₖₑᵣ).For U-Cd, a HBM-GVGₑₙPₒₚ of 1 µg/g creatinine (creat) is recommended for adults older than 50 years, based on a robust meta-analysis performed by EFSA (EFSA, 2009a). To take into account the accumulation of Cd in the human body throughout life, threshold or ‘alert’ values according to age were estimated for U-Cd. At workplace, a HBM-GVWₒᵣₖₑᵣ of 2 μg/g creat is derived from the study of Chaumont et al., (2011) for U-Cd, and in addition to this recommendation a HBM-GVwₒᵣₖₑᵣ for B-Cd of 5 µg/L is also proposed. The HBM-GVWₒᵣₖₑᵣ for U-Cd is similar to the biological limit value (BLV) set by the new amendment of the European Carcinogens and Mutagens Directive in June 2019 (2 µg/g creat for U-Cd).  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3acreatinine 3adose response 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental monitoring 3ahumans 3akidneys 3ameta-analysis 3amolecular weight 3apeople 3aproteinuria 3aretinol-binding protein 3aworking conditions 0aHuman biomonitoring 0aHBM4EU 0aHuman biomonitoring guidance values 0aHBM-GV 0aCd 0aHealth effects 0aKidney 0aRenal effect 0aNephrotoxicity 0aBone toxicity 0aNeurotoxicity 0aReprotoxic effects 0aExposure assessment 0aBiomarkers1 aOugier, Eva1 aGarnier, Robert1 aViau, Claude1 aKolossa-Gehring, Marike1 aLange, Rosa1 aApel, Petra1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2109-02390 tEnvironment international.g2021 Feb., v. 147 p.106337-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.1063373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03629naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002900164245017300193300001400366520152300380592002801903650002501931650002801956650001401984650002201998650002802020650001502048650002602063650002202089650002602111650001802137650001302155650001602168650001502184650003802199650002102237650001402258650001002272650001202282650001102294650002402305650004902329650002702378650004002405650002402445650002702469650002802496650005802524650002202582650002402604650004902628650004802677650002902725650002302754700002802777700001902805773009802824856004802922852000902970655001202979IND4446793220221121033610.0120727e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444679322DNAL7 a209788232pmid7 a10.1007/s11103-010-9707-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemartini, Diogo Ribeiro10aGlobal and targeted proteomics in developing jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis) seedlings: an investigation of urease isoforms mobilization in early stages of development  ap. 53-65.  aJack bean (Canavalia ensiformis) seeds are toxic for insects and the toxicity is due in part to an entomotoxic peptide enzymatically released from ureases in the midgut of susceptible insects. To characterize expression of urease isoforms in jack bean seed, particularly the more abundant urease isoform (JBU), quantitative proteomics was performed. Quiescent through 5-day germinating seeds were analyzed at 1-day intervals using a total proteomics approach (TPA) and also after co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) with anti–JBU monoclonal antibodies. Jack bean proteins for TPA and co-IP were pre-fractionated by SDS–PAGE, segmented for in-gel trypsin digestion, and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to nanospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). Acquired MS2 data were searched against a comprehensive plant database and the MEROPS peptidase database, in the absence of a jack bean EST database. Proteins detected in TPA were quantified by label-free spectral counting. A total of 234 and 106 non-redundant proteins were detected in TPA and co-IP, respectively. Mobilization of JBU was observed beginning 3-days after imbibition indicating that the entomotoxic peptide was not formed before this stage. A predicted urease isoform, JBURE-IIb, was detected in the co-IP study. Additionally, 46 plastid proteins, including RuBisCO and plastid ATPase were pulled down with JBU antibodies. These data shed new light on the behavior of urease isoforms during the early stages of plant development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanavalia ensiformis 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3adatabases 3aearly development 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aimbibition 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aplanting date 3aproteins 3aproteolysis 3aproteomics 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aseed germination 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3atrypsin 3aurease 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCanavaliaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aImmunoprecipitation 2aIsoenzymesxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Proteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aProtein Transport 2aProteomicsxmethods 2aSeedlingsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 2aUreasexmetabolism1 aCarlini, Célia Regina,1 aThelen, Jay J.0 tPlant molecular biology.g2011 Jan., v. 75, no. 1-2 p.53-65dSpringer-Verlagx0167-44127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-010-9707-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005300148245014600201300001800347500001900365520154200384592002801926650002301954650001501977650001901992650001502011650001102026650001702037650002602054650002202080650001402102700002602116700006002142700002702202700002402229700002502253700002602278773012202304856008202426852000902508655001202517IND60733759820221119231446.0210412e20210308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073375982DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.1c000852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoas, U.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9702-235010aPhosphocholine-Decorated PPI-Dendrimers Mimic Cell Membrane Phosphocholine Clusters and Tune the Innate Immune Activity of C-Reactive Protein  ap. 1664-1674.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aC-reactive protein (CRP) is widely used as biomarkers of infection and inflammation. It has a well-described ability to bind phosphocholine (PC), as well as PC-clusters from compromised and inflamed cell membranes and tissues. The binding of PC-clusters to CRP is of interest as this binding determines subsequent innate immune activity. We investigated PC-decorated dendrimers as mimics for PC-clusters. Five generations of poly(propylene imine) (PPI) dendrimers were modified with PC surface groups via a three-step synthetic sequence obtaining the PC-decorated dendrimers in high purity. The dendrimers were analyzed by NMR and infrared spectroscopy as well as HPLC. We developed immunoassays to show that dendrimer-PC binding to CRP was Ca²⁺-dependent with an apparent overall Kd of 11.9 nM for first generation (G1) PPI-PC, while G2-PPI-PC and G3-PPI-PC had slightly higher affinities, and G4-PPI-PC and G5-PPI-PC had slightly lower affinities. For all PC-dendrimers, the affinity was orders of magnitude higher than the affinity of free phosphocholine (PC), indicating a PC-cluster effect. Next, we investigated the binding of CRP:PPI-PC complexes to complement component C1q. C1q binding to CRP was dependent on the generation of PPI-PC bound to CRP, with second and third generation PPI-PCs leading to the highest affinity. The dendrimer-based approach to PC-cluster mimics and the simple binding assays presented here hold promise as tools to screen PC-compounds for their abilities to tune the innate immune activity of CRP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3abiomarkers 3acell membranes 3adendrimers 3aimines 3ainflammation 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aphosphorylcholine 3apropylene1 aDaoud, Mohammad Mahdi1 aMeier, Sebastian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3761-32171 aOlsen, Tobias Hegelund1 aGehring, Kristoffer1 aMogensen, Ditte Juhl1 aHeegaard, Peter M.

On the 7th day, the ratios of mass of free MC-LR in serum to the mass of MC-LR in given dose were 3.843–4.555%, while the ratios of total MC-LR in liver were 34.465–38.567%. Comparing the overall experimental results, the three most sensitive indices are total MC-LR in the liver, the phagocytic index and reactive oxygen species (ROS) which have shown significant differences between the lowest dose group and the control group. Alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase had proportional correlations with the MC-LR exposure doses, and the hematology of the majority of blood cells and the volume of erythrocytes were also influenced by the toxin. The alterations of some cytokines and the ROS of leukocytes were observed. The results of the studies suggest that measurement of MC-LR in blood is powerful and clear evidence to indicate that subjects have been exposed to MC-LR and can be used to discriminate from other causes leading to hepatic lesions although it is not as sensitive as other indices that are usually as useful complements to reflect the liver function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine transaminase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3acytokines 3aenzyme activity 3aerythrocytes 3ahematology 3aintraperitoneal injection 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aleukocytes 3aliver 3aliver function 3amice 3amicrocystin-LR 3areactive oxygen species 3atoxicity 2aAlanine Transaminasexblood 2aAnimals 2aAspartate Aminotransferasesxblood 2aChickens 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aCytokinesxblood 2aInjections, Intraperitoneal 2aL-Lactate Dehydrogenasexblood 2aLeukocytesxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aLiverxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aMale 2aMass Spectrometry 2aMice 2aMicrocystinsxadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokineticsxtoxicity. 2aPhagocytosisxdrug effects 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 0aMicrocystin-LR 0aIn vivo 0aSerum 0aLiquid chromatography–mass spectrometry 0aHematology 0aCytokine1 aZhang, Yonglu1 aXiao, Wenqing1 aYe, Xiaoyan1 aZhong, Qing1 aGu, Kangding0 tChemosphere.g2013 July, v. 92 p.563-569dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01918naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245006700172300001600239520096500255592002801220650001501248650001801263650002701281650001401308650001101322650001701333700006001350773011501410856008201525852000901607655001201616IND60527014320221119084837.0190411e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052701432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2015.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraybrook, Siobhan A10aShifting foundations: the mechanical cell wall and development  ap. 115-120.  aThe cell wall has long been acknowledged as an important physical mediator of growth in plants. Recent experimental and modelling work has brought the importance of cell wall mechanics into the forefront again. These data have challenged existing dogmas that relate cell wall structure to cell/organ growth, that uncouple elasticity from extensibility, and those which treat the cell wall as a passive and non-stressed material. Within this review we describe experiments and models which have changed the ways in which we view the mechanical cell wall, leading to new hypotheses and research avenues. It has become increasingly apparent that while we often wish to simplify our systems, we now require more complex multi-scale experiments and models in order to gain further insight into growth mechanics. We are currently experiencing an exciting and challenging shift in the foundations of our understanding of cell wall mechanics in growth and development.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell walls 3aextensibility 3agrowth and development 3amechanics 3amodels 3aplant growth1 aJonsson, Henrik,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2340-588X0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2016 Feb., v. 29 p.115-120dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl58157x1369-52667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2015.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245007800189300001600267520092300283592002801206650001701234650001001251650002701261650001301288650001501301650002501316650002001341650004201361650002501403650002601428650003401454650003001488650003601518650003601554650004101590650003801631650003601669650001401705650004201719650002201761650002901783650002701812650004101839700002301880700002001903700002301923700001901946700002501965773012901990856004802119852000902167655001202176IND50067853620221122200307.0130716e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006785362DNAL7 a238076822pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-013-1030-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaussereau, Elodie10aDetermination of Levels of Current Drugs in Hospital and Urban Wastewater  ap. 171-176.  aA rapid, sensitive and highly specific HPLC-MS/MS method with direct on-line preparation was applied for the determination of 20 common pharmaceuticals in hospital and urban wastewater. Median drug concentrations were quite similar in the majority of samples, cerca 1 μg L(-1) ranging from 0.06 to 2.67 μg L(-1) in both water. Pharmaceutical hospital contribution, below 1 %, was negligible, as compared to the huge amount in the municipal plant flow. Due to only partial elimination in the plant, hundreds of kilograms of harmful waste per year are discharged in the River Seine. Therefore, to reduce potential human and environmental exposure, a topic of major concern, an efficient drug treatment procedure should be used at the municipal plant stage in order to reduce urban wastewater pollution. The HPLC-MS/MS method could be a very useful tool to optimize the pharmaceutical wastewater treatment process.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3aenvironmental exposure 3asampling 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater pollution 2aAdrenergic beta-Antagonistsxanalysis 2aAnalgesicsxanalysis 2aAnestheticsxanalysis 2aAnti-Anxiety Agentsxanalysis 2aAnticonvulsantsxanalysis 2aAntidepressive Agentsxanalysis 2aCardiovascular Agentsxanalysis 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aHistamine Antagonistsxanalysis 2aHospitals 2aPharmaceutical Preparationsxanalysis 2aRiversxchemistry 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 2aWastewaterxchemistry. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis1 aLacroix, Christian1 aGuerbet, Michel1 aCellier, Dominique1 aSpiroux, Joël1 aGoullé, Jean-Pierre0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2013 Aug., v. 91, no. 2 p.171-176dSpringer-Verlagx0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-013-1030-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02328naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245004900166300001800215520115700233592002801390650001201418650003601430650001501466650001601481650002001497650001501517650001501532650001201547650001501559651001801574700003201592700002601624700001601650700002001666773016501686856008201851852000901933655001201942IND60480574720221120210647.0160128e20091101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048057472DNAL7 a10.14358/PERS.75.11.12872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranks, Shannon10aLarge Area Scene Selection Interface (LASSI)  ap. 1287-1296.  a<p><i>The Global Land Survey (GLS) 2005 is a cloud-free, orthorec-tified collection of Landsat imagery acquired during the 2004 to 2007 epoch intended to support global land-cover and ecological monitoring. Due to the numerous complexities in selecting imagery for the GLS2005, NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) sponsored the development of an automated scene selection tool, the Large Area Scene Selection Interface (LASSI), to aid in the selection of imagery for this data set. This innovative approach to scene selection applied a user-defined weighting system to various scene parameters: image cloud cover, image vegetation greenness, choice of sensor, and the ability of the Landsat-7 Scan Line Corrector (SLC)-off pair to completely fill image gaps, among others. The parameters considered in scene selection were weighted according to their relative importance to the data set, along with the algorithm’s sensitivity to that weight. This paper describes the methodology and analysis that established the parameter weighting strategy, as well as the post-screening processes used in selecting the optimal data set for GLS2005.</i></p>  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aUnited States Geological Survey 3aalgorithms 3acloud cover 3adata collection 3aland cover 3amonitoring 3asurveys 3avegetation 3aUnited States1 aMasek, J.

Kenaf is a bast fiber plant where the surface stem skin provides bast fibers whose strength-to-weight ratio competes with glass fiber. The higher volume product of the kenaf core is an under-investigated area in composite applications. The naturally porous structure of kenaf-core provides a novel reinforcement particle. In this work, foams of rigid polyurethane with 5, 10, and 15% kenaf-core were formed. To date efforts at using it as reinforcement have proven largely unsuccessful. This was mirrored in this effort when free expansion of the foam was utilized. However introducing constraint during foaming resulted in reinforcement. The environmental scanning electron microscopy is used in conjunction with in–situ microCT compression to capture the change in void fractions before and after deformation. The results show that free foaming resulted in poor reinforcement while a constrained expansion on the foam increased the reinforcement potential of the kenaf core. 3adeformation 3afoaming 3afoams 3aglass fibers 3akenaf 3amicro-computed tomography 3apolyurethanes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astrength (mechanics)1 aWebber III, Charles1 aD'Souza, Nandika Anne0 tPolymer engineering & science.g2015 Jan., v. 55, no. 1 p.132-144wSource:1x1548-26347nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/621313Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pen.238683Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Webber%20ARIS%20Log%20No%20%20307911.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245016100165300002000326520169600346592002802042596008402070596007602154596005402230650001702284650000902301650001202310650002102322650002002343650001402363650000902377650001502386700001902401700005702420700001302477700001702490773012502507856008302632852000902715655001202724IND60795260920221118055059.0221004e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079526092DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-022-07710-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhijun10aComparing non-isothermal melt and cold crystallization behavior and kinetics of poly(ethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate-co-ethylene terephthalate) copolyesters  ap. 17503-17516.  aThe objective of the present work was to compare the non-isothermal melt and cold crystallization behavior and kinetics of poly(ethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate-co-ethylene terephthalate) (PEFT) copolyesters. First, the non-isothermal melt and cold crystallization behavior of PET and PEFT copolyesters were studied at a fixed cooling and heating rate with differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Second, the non-isothermal melt and cold crystallization behavior of PET, PEFT5% and PEFT10% were studied at various cooling and heating rates, respectively. Third, the non-isothermal melt and cold crystallization kinetics of PET, PEFT5% and PEFT10% were analyzed with the crystallization half-time and Mo equation. It was found that with the increase in the FDCA content, the melt crystallization of PEFT gets gradually more difficult, and PEFT5%, PEFT10% and PEFT15% show cold crystallization behavior. The non-isothermal melt and cold crystallization rate of PET, PEFT5% and PEFT10% increases with the cooling and heating rate, respectively. At the same rate of cooling and heating, the cold crystallization rate is much larger than the melt crystallization rate. The copolymerization of FDCA units significantly hinders the melt crystallization rate of PEFT, while its effect on cold crystallization rate is not so prominent. The melt crystallization in PET during quenching significantly hinders its cold crystallization, thus leading to unexpectedly the cold crystallization rate of PEFT5% larger than that of PET. Based on this study, cold crystallization can be adapted as a feasible means for more efficiently adjusting the crystallization of PEFT copolyesters in practical processing.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018B10013cNingbo Science and Technology Innovation 2025 Major Special Project  a2021C01005cProvincial Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang  a2021YFB3700300cNational Key R&D Program of China 3acalorimeters 3acold 3acooling 3acopolymerization 3acrystallization 3aequations 3aheat 3apolyesters1 aWang, Jinggang1 aPang, Yongyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6522-33851 aZhu, Jin1 aZheng, Wenge0 tJournal of materials science.g2022 Sept., v. 57, no. 36 p.17503-17516dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-022-07710-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009700165300001300262520116800275592002801443650002201471650002201493650001401515650001801529650001901547650002801566650000901594650001201603650001001615650001001625650002101635650001101656650001401667650002601681650002001707700002001727700001701747700001801764700001901782700001601801700001601817700001801833700001801851700001901869700001901888773011201907856008202019852000902101655001202110IND60527014520221119084835.0190411e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052701452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2015.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Chi-Fa10aInsights into the regulation of C4 leaf development from comparative transcriptomic analysis  ap. 1-10.  aC4 photosynthesis is more efficient than C3 photosynthesis for two reasons. First, C4 plants have evolved a repertoire of C4 enzymes to enhance CO2 fixation. Second, C4 leaves have Kranz anatomy with a high vein density in which the veins are surrounded by one layer of bundle sheath (BS) cells and one layer of mesophyll (M) cells. The BS and M cells are not only functionally well differentiated, but also well-coordinated for rapid transport of photo-assimilates between the two types of photosynthetic cells. Recent comparative transcriptomic and anatomical analyses of C3 and C4 leaves have revealed early onset of C4-related processes in leaf development, suggesting that delayed mesophyll differentiation contributes to higher C4 vein density, and have identified some candidate regulators for the higher vein density in C4 leaves. Moreover, comparative transcriptomics of maize husk (C3) and foliar leaves (C4) has identified a cohort of candidate regulators of Kranz anatomy development. In addition, there has been major progress in the identification of transcription factor binding sites, greatly increasing our knowledge of gene regulation in plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC3 photosynthesis 3aC4 photosynthesis 3aC4 plants 3abinding sites 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3acorn 3aenzymes 3agenes 3ahulls 3aleaf development 3aleaves 3amesophyll 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics1 aChang, Yao-Ming1 aLin, Jinn-Jy1 aYu, Chun-Ping1 aLin, Hsin-Hung1 aLiu, Wen-Yu1 aYeh, Suying1 aTu, Shih-Long1 aWu, Shu-Hsing1 aKu, Maurice SB1 aLi, Wen-Hsiung0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2016 Apr., v. 30 p.1-10dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl58157x1369-52667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2015.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02243naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245006500164300001800229520114800247592002801395650003101423650001701454650002201471650001401493650002001507650003501527650001101562650001901573650001001592700001501602700002001617773016501637856008201802852000901884655001201893IND60480574920221120210645.0160128e20091201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048057492DNAL7 a10.14358/PERS.75.12.13972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCeylan, Nihal12aA Case Study of Developing An Olive Tree Database For Turkey  ap. 1397-1405.  a<p><i>This study was conducted to develop an olive tree registration database using geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing technology. It also provides information on the methodology used for the database development for the candidate country during its accession process to the European Union. Since olive farming has a great importance to the Turkish economy, an olive registration database supported by GIS and compatible with the Integrated Administrative Control System (IACS) is needed for adaptation to the European Commission Common Agricultural Policy. In this study, cadastral maps and satellite images were used to count olive trees using the OLICOUNT software developed by the Joint Research Center of the European Commission in order to develop an olive tree database. According to the analysis of the counting results for the test sites with 2,291 trees, overall omission error was 11.1 percent and commission error was 2.94 percent. These results indicate that the determination of olive trees by OLICOUNT within the area of interest has 90.37 percent accuracy that makes the method reasonably reliable.</i></p>  aPublisher supplied data 3aCommon Agricultural Policy 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3adatabases 3afarming systems 3ageographic information systems 3aolives 3aremote sensing 3atrees1 aUnal, Ediz1 aMasson, Josiane0 tPhotogrammetric engineering and remote sensing.g2009 Dec. 1, v. 75, no. 12 p.1397-1405dAmerican Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensingx0099-11127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.14358%2FPERS.75.12.13973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01669naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009300170520062500263592002800888650001900916650001900935650002800954650001400982650002300996653001901019653002201038653001201060700001901072700002301091700002101114773010201135856008501237852000901322655001201331IND60772392320221120081637.0220426e20220427xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077239232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2022.1537722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsuo, Hideaki10aCarbonylation of o-phenylenediamines with CO2 to 2-benzimidazolones catalyzed by alumina  aBiological carbon fixation can convert carbon dioxide (CO₂) into chemicals with a variety of uses, and has thus attracted considerable attention, as CO₂ is nonhazardous, inflammable and plentiful in the environment. We report here that alumina (Al₂O₃) can by itself catalyze the carbonylation of o-phenylenediamines with CO₂ to produce 2-benzimidazolones. Such alumina-catalyzed carbonylation with CO₂ is applicable to various diamine derivatives to provide the corresponding cyclic ureas. Following the reaction, the alumina catalyst is also advantageous in that it can be filtered, accumulated, and reused.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 0aCarbon dioxide 0a2-Benzimidazolone 0aAlumina1 aChoi, Jun-Chul1 aFujitani, Tadahiro1 aFujita, Ken-ichi0 tTetrahedron letters.g2022 Apr. 27, v. 96 p.153772-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11745x0040-40397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2022.1537723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03484naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100003500181245024000216506007600456520146300532592002801995506003702023650003402060650002802094650002802122650002202150650002402172650002502196650001702221650001002238650001302248650001802261650002102279650001602300650001602316650002502332650001502357650001202372650001402384650000902398700003502407700003602442700002902478700002902507700002902536700003102565700003802596700003702634700002902671773012302700856007402823852000902897655001202906IND60650591820221207140141.0190710e20180902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065059182DNAL7 a10.3390/nu100912142doi7 aPMC61635422pmcid7 a302005322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmeida Neta, Maria  Carmélia10aFermented Dessert with Whey, Ingredients from the Peel of Jabuticaba (<i>Myrciaria cauliflora</i>) and an Indigenous Culture of <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i>: Composition, Microbial Viability, Antioxidant Capacity and Sensory Features  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe use of agro-industrial wastes in combination with indigenous lactic acid bacteria is an interesting option to confer functional potential to food products. The microbial viability, chemical composition, antioxidant capacity, texture and sensory acceptability of a fermented dairy dessert containing the indigenous culture Lactobacillus plantarum CNPC003, whey and ingredients obtained from the jabuticaba (Myrciaria cauliflora) peel were compared with formulations without lactobacilli (control) or containing a commercial probiotic culture (Lactobacillus rhamnosus LR32). L. plantarum presented viability higher than 7 log CFU g&minus;1 in the dessert, as did the commercial probiotic, for 21 days at 4 &plusmn; 1 &deg;C. Total phenolic contents (45&ndash;60 mg gallic acid equivalents, GAE, 100 g&minus;1) were comparable to those of other studies evaluating dairy products containing plant sources. The formulations were low in fat, presenting as acceptable for overall consumption, with attractive color and appreciable texture. Considering the total antioxidant capacity, 200&ndash;250 g of dessert would be necessary to capture 1 g of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals. The dessert with Lactobacillus plantarum CNPC003 is seen as a viable alternative for the use of whey and jabuticaba peel, as well as a potential functional food due to the concentration of lactobacilli reached, besides the presence of antioxidant phenolic compounds.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aPlinia cauliflora 3aagricultural wastes 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acolor 3adesserts 3afree radicals 3afunctional foods 3agallic acid 3aingredients 3alactic acid bacteria 3aprobiotics 3atexture 3aviability 3awhey1 aRocha de Queiroga, Anna  Paula1 aAlmeida, Raphael  Lucas Jacinto1 aCaetano Soares, Anderson1 aMarinho Gonçalves, Jade1 aSoares Fernandes, Suenia1 ade Sousa, Marina  Cínthia1 aOlbrich dos Santos, Karina  Maria1 aAlonso Buriti, Flávia  Carolina1 aRolim Florentino, Eliane0 tNutrients.g2018 Sept. 02, v. 10, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu100912143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03288naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010000169300001600269520211200285592002802397650001602425650002902441650001102470650001502481650002602496650001902522650002802541650001702569650001202586650002202598700002202620700001702642700002002659700001902679773011202698856008302810852000902893655001202902IND60791965720221122035858.0220903e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079196572DNAL7 a10.1007/s00267-022-01684-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahammedi, Charf10aCriteria for Preliminary Risk Assessment of Brownfield Site: An International Survey of Experts  ap. 681-696.  aComprehensive risk assessment of brownfield sites requires a broad range of knowledge and multi-disciplinary expertise. Whilst the identification of criteria requirements for preliminary risk assessment has received some attention, there appears to be no studies that have specifically examined professional perspectives relating to these requirements. Yet, variations in professional practitioners’ assessments may have significant consequences for the assessment of risks, and how the criteria are imparted to stakeholders. This study aims to identify the criteria requirements for preliminary risk assessment, using the pollutant linkage model (Source–Pathway–Receptor), and explores cross-disciplinary professional perspectives related to these requirements. To this end, this study commenced with a systematic review to identify various criteria streams required for the preliminary risk assessment of brownfield sites. Thereafter, a questionnaire survey was design and shared with brownfield site professionals. Quantitative analysis of the survey responses (n = 76) reveals disciplines have markedly different priorities relating to the same hazard. For instance, geophysicists, geochemists, and hydrologists do not raise concerns regarding ground movement that can result from the removal of storage and tanks, whilst the same hazard was considered as having a high importance by other professions (such as geologists and geotechnical engineers). This example, amongst others revealed in the study, underpins potential issues and implications for various stakeholders compiling and/or using preliminary risk assessment criteria. This study clarifies both the key criteria requirements for the preliminary risk assessment of brownfield sites, as well as the importance of recognising how variation in professionals’ perceptions plays in the risk assessment process. Although, specialist knowledge is essential for brownfield site investigation, so is the maintaining a broad-based view of other experts coming from different backgrounds, as this renders holistic risk assessment insights.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrownfields 3aenvironmental management 3amodels 3apollutants 3aquantitative analysis 3aquestionnaires 3arisk assessment process 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3asystematic review1 aMahdjoubi, Lamine1 aBooth, Colin1 aBowman, Russell1 aButt, Talib E.0 tEnvironmental management.g2022 Oct., v. 70, no. 4 p.681-696dSpringer USwJournal:jnl8014x0364-152X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-022-01684-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245008600170300001400256500002000270520159200290592002801882650001801910650001801928650002201946650001801968650001201986650002401998650001602022650002502038650001202063650001002075650001502085650002602100650001402126650001102140650002402151650002602175650001602201650001602217650000902233700002402242700002102266700002202287700002002309773012702329856007902456852000902535655001202544IND60588279920221116210125.0180103e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058827992DNAL7 a10.1111/1758-2229.125012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchaeffer, Robert N.10aNon‐target effects of fungicides on nectar‐inhabiting fungi of almond flowers  ap. 79-84.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNectar mediates interactions between plants and pollinators in natural and agricultural systems. Specialized microorganisms are common nectar inhabitants, and potentially important mediators of plant‐pollinator interactions. However, their diversity and role in mediating pollination services in agricultural systems are poorly characterized. Moreover, agrochemicals are commonly applied to minimize crop damage, but may present ecological consequences for non‐target organisms. Assessment of ecological risk has tended to focus on beneficial macroorganisms such as pollinators, with less attention paid to microorganisms. Here, using culture‐independent methods, we assess the impact of two widely‐used fungicides on nectar microbial community structure in the mass‐flowering crop almond (Prunus dulcis). We predicted that fungicide application would reduce fungal richness and diversity, whereas competing bacterial richness would increase, benefitting from negative effects on fungi. We found that fungicides reduced fungal richness and diversity in exposed flowers, but did not significantly affect bacterial richness, diversity, or community composition. The relative abundance of Metschnikowia OTUs, nectar specialists that can impact pollination, was reduced by both fungicides. Given growing recognition of the importance of nectar microorganisms as mediators of plant‐pollinator mutualisms, future research should consider the impact of management practices on plant‐associated microorganisms and consequences for pollination services in agricultural landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMetschnikowia 3aPrunus dulcis 3aagricultural land 3aagrochemicals 3aalmonds 3acommunity structure 3acrop damage 3aenvironmental impact 3aflowers 3afungi 3afungicides 3amicrobial communities 3amutualism 3anectar 3anontarget organisms 3apesticide application 3apollination 3apollinators 3arisk1 aVannette, Rachel L.1 aBrittain, Claire1 aWilliams, Neal M.1 aFukami, Tadashi0 tEnvironmental microbiology reports.g2017 Apr., v. 9, no. 2 p.79-84dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:2217x1758-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.125013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03365naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245017700171300001600348520164400364592002802008650001402036650002402050650001502074650001702089650002102106650001502127650002402142650002002166650002502186650000902211650001702220650002402237650001202261650001602273650001302289650001902302650001402321650001802335650001302353650002102366653002602387653004502413653002302458653001802481653001702499700002302516700001902539700002002558700001802578773011202596856008202708852000902790655001202799IND60634673420221121035806.0190325e20180630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063467342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2018.03.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussain, Khalil K.10aPerformance comparison between multienzymes loaded single and dual electrodes for the simultaneous electrochemical detection of adenosine and metabolites in cancerous cells  ap. 263-271.  aThe analytical performance of the multi enzymes loaded single electrode sensor (SES) and dual electrode sensor (DES) was compared for the detection of adenosine and metabolites. The SES was fabricated by covalent binding of tri-enzymes, adenosine deaminase (ADA), purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), and xanthine oxidase (XO) along with hydrazine (Hyd) onto a functionalized conducting polymer [2,2:5,2-terthiophene-3-(p-benzoic acid)] (pTTBA). The enzyme reaction electrode in DES was fabricated by covalent binding of ADA and PNP onto pTTBA coated on Au nanoparticles. The detection electrode in DES was constructed by covalent binding of XO and Hyd onto pTTBA coated on porous Au. Due to the higher amount (3.5 folds) of the immobilized enzymes and Hyd onto the DES than SES, and the lower Michaelis constant (Km) value for DES (28.7 µM) compared to SES (36.1 µM), the sensitivity was significantly enhanced for the DES (8.2 folds). The dynamic range obtained using DES was from 0.5 nM to 120.0 µM with a detection limit of 1.43 nM ± 0.02, 0.76 nM ± 0.02, and 0.48 nM ± 0.01, for adenosine (AD), inosine (IN), and hypoxanthine (Hypo) respectively. Further, the DES was coupled with an electrochemical potential modulated microchannel for the separation and simultaneous detection of AD, IN, and Hypo in an extracellular matrix of cancerous (A549) and non-cancerous (Vero) cells. The sensor probe confirms a higher basal level of extracellular AD and its metabolites in cancer cells compared to normal cells. In addition, the effect of dipyridamole on released adenosine in A549 cells was investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine 3aadenosine deaminase 3abiosensors 3adipyridamole 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenzymatic reactions 3aenzyme kinetics 3aextracellular matrix 3agold 3ahypoxanthine 3aimmobilized enzymes 3ainosine 3ametabolites 3ananogold 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aphosphorylase 3apolymers 3axanthine oxidase 0aSimultaneous analysis 0aAdenosine inosine hypoxanthine detection 0aConducting polymer 0aEnzyme sensor 0aDipyridamole1 aAkhtar, Mahmood H.1 aKim, Mu-hyŏn,1 aJung, Dong-Keun1 aShim, Yoon-Bo0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2018 June 30, v. 109 p.263-271dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2018.03.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03720naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245012200162300001800284520195500302592002802257650002002285650002202305650002202327650001502349650001502364650001702379650002302396650001102419650001402430650003202444650001402476650001502490650000902505650001802514650001602532650001102548650002402559651001902583700002602602700001902628700002202647700001502669700002202684700002402706700002302730700002302753700001702776700002102793700002202814700002302836700002602859700002102885700002002906773009802926856007303024852000903097655001203106IND60481828820221118123558.0160210e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048182882DNAL7 a10.1890/14-2113.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHammerschlag, Neil10aEvaluating the landscape of fear between apex predatory sharks and mobile sea turtles across a large dynamic seascape  ap. 2117-2126.  aThe “landscape of fear” model has been proposed as a unifying concept in ecology, describing, in part, how animals behave and move about in their environment. The basic model predicts that as an animal's landscape changes from low to high risk of predation, prey species will alter their behavior to risk avoidance. However, studies investigating and evaluating the landscape of fear model across large spatial scales (tens to hundreds of thousands of square kilometers) in dynamic, open, aquatic systems involving apex predators and highly mobile prey are lacking. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated predator–prey relationships between tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) and loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) in the North Atlantic Ocean. This included the use of satellite tracking to examine shark and turtle distributions as well as their surfacing behaviors under varying levels of home range overlap. Our findings revealed patterns that deviated from our a priori predictions based on the landscape of fear model. Specifically, turtles did not alter their surfacing behaviors to risk avoidance when overlap in shark–turtle core home range was high. However, in areas of high overlap with turtles, sharks exhibited modified surfacing behaviors that may enhance predation opportunity. We suggest that turtles may be an important factor in determining shark distribution, whereas for turtles, other life history trade‐offs may play a larger role in defining their habitat use. We propose that these findings are a result of both biotic and physically driven factors that independently or synergistically affect predator–prey interactions in this system. These results have implications for evolutionary biology, community ecology, and wildlife conservation. Further, given the difficulty in studying highly migratory marine species, our approach and conclusions may be applied to the study of other predator–prey systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaretta caretta 3aGaleocerdo cuvier 3acommunity ecology 3ahome range 3alandscapes 3alife history 3amigratory behavior 3amodels 3apredation 3apredator-prey relationships 3apredators 3aprediction 3arisk 3arisk behavior 3asea turtles 3asharks 3awildlife management 3aAtlantic Ocean1 aBroderick, Annette C.1 aCoker, John W.1 aCoyne, Michael S.1 aDodd, Mark1 aFrick, Michael G.1 aGodfrey, Matthew H.1 aGodley, Brendan J.1 aGriffin, DuBose B.1 aHartog, Kyra1 aMurphy, Sally R.1 aMurphy, Thomas M.1 aNelson, Emily Rose1 aWilliams, Kristina L.1 aWitt, Matthew J.1 aHawkes, Lucy A.0 tEcology.g2015 Aug., v. 96, no. 8 p.2117-2126dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/14-2113.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03163naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011400166300001600280500001900296520172600315592002802041596004502069596007102114650002102185650002302206650001202229650002102241650001202262650001402274650001802288650001502306650002902321650002602350650001502376650000902391650000902400651001402409700002102423700002102444700002002465773012802485856008302613852000902696655001202705IND60677466820221118013236.0201124e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067746682DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-019-04290-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChieppa, Jeff10aDrought and phosphorus affect productivity of a mesic grassland via shifts in root traits of dominant species  ap. 457-473.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAIMS: Precipitation and soil nutrients play an important role in regulating grassland productivity. However, little is known regarding the sensitivity of grasslands to changes in water and nutrient availability and the mechanisms driving productivity responses. METHODS: We examined the effects of extreme drought (65% rainfall reduction) and phosphorus fertilization on aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and plant functional traits (PFTs) of four dominant mesic grassland species in a semi-natural grassland in southeast Australia. We used piecewise structural equation modelling to determine which PFTs contribute to the treatment effects on ANPP. RESULTS: Reduced rainfall decreased ANPP by 29% while P addition increased ANPP by 62% at the community-level. Significant drought-related reductions in ANPP were apparent for Setaria parviflora, while Cynodon dactylon was the only species exhibiting increased ANPP under P addition. There was no interaction between rainfall and P addition. Structural equation modelling indicated specific root length was a key trait underpinning community-level ANPP responses to P; this was, however, primarily driven by a single dominant (~61% of community biomass) species (Cynodon). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate the negative impacts of drought on ANPP – driven primarily by Setaria– were not ameliorated by P addition. The positive effect of P addition on community-level ANPP was attributed to the response of the most dominant species, Cynodon, and mediated by changes in specific root length. This study highlights the importance of understanding the link between belowground traits and ANPP for predicting dominant species’ response to global change drivers.  aPublisher supplied data  aDP150104199cAustralian Research Council  aPostgraduate ScholarshipcHawkesbury Institute for the Environment 3aCynodon dactylon 3aSetaria parviflora 3abiomass 3adominant species 3adrought 3aequations 3aglobal change 3agrasslands 3anet primary productivity 3anutrient availability 3aphosphorus 3arain 3asoil 3aAustralia1 aNielsen, Uffe N.1 aTissue, David T.1 aPower, Sally A.0 tPlant and soil.g2019 Nov., v. 444, no. 1-2 p.457-473dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-019-04290-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012200169300001800291520134500309592002801654650002401682650001401706650001101720650001701731650001301748650001501761650001801776650001101794650002101805650001801826650002001844700002401864700001901888700001901907773008601926856008102012852000902093655001202102IND60132774120221122053100.0150511e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013277412DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-015-0628-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTolonen, Lasse K.14aThe yield of cellulose precipitate from sub- and supercritical water treatment of various microcrystalline celluloses  ap. 1715-1728.  aSubcritical and supercritical water are known to dissolve crystalline cellulose, offering a simple way to produce low molar mass cellulose which precipitates at ambient temperatures. However, the yield of precipitate is limited by concomitant degradation reactions. In this study, the formation of cellulose precipitate from six different microcrystalline celluloses (MCC) was investigated in 0.2 s treatments at 250–380 °C. The results were elucidated with a simple two-step kinetic model. The maximum yield of cellulose precipitate depended on the choice of starting material, which had a more important role than the optimized treatment time or temperature. Wood-derived MCCs dissolved faster and resulted in a higher yield of precipitate than those prepared from cotton linter. The highest yield of precipitate, 68 %, was recovered from a MCC prepared from mercerized prehydrolysis hardwood Kraft pulp. The high yield of precipitate could not be attributed to any single factor but in general the wood-derived MCCs had a smaller particle size, smaller crystallite dimensions, and lower molar mass than their cotton-derived equivalents. The analysis of molar mass distributions indicated heterogeneous dissolution mechanism at 250 and 320 °C whereas at 380 °C the cellulose crystallites were subjected to random chain cleavage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acellulose 3acotton 3acrystallites 3ahardwood 3akraft pulp 3amercerization 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3aparticle size 3awater treatment1 aPenttilä, Paavo A.1 aSerimaa, Ritva1 aSixta, Herbert0 tCellulose.g2015 June, v. 22, no. 3 p.1715-1728dSpringer-Verlagx0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-015-0628-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002100150245011500171300001800286520153500304592002801839650001601867650002201883650001201905650001301917650001401930650001501944650001401959650001101973650001601984700002402000773009502024856008602119852000902205655001202214IND4461595520221120044159.0141110e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446159552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.03.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChavanne, Xavier10aComparison of the energy efficiency to produce agroethanol between various industries and processes: Synthesis  ap. 2737-2754.  aThe article assesses the energy R required by a system to transform a cereal or sugar plant into ethanol. From the specific consumption rⱼ of each process j and its weight wⱼ in the system, process consumption share Rⱼ is deduced and hence R, sum of Rⱼ. Depending on wⱼ definition, Rⱼ and R are relative to either 100 J of ethanol produced or 100 J of plant harvested. Depending on the nature of rⱼ, Rⱼ and R represent either only primary external energies, or all fuel and electricity consumed directly, or external and internal energies. From one definition to another R for average sugar cane based industries is the best or the worst relative to other plants. This results also from the use of cane residues as fuels while operating outdated processes. Through rⱼ the process based analysis allows to examine for each system the impact of modern processes or different use of residues. All systems benefit except sugar beet based industry close to its best efficiency. This flexibility permits even to build a self-sufficient system where existing processes produce from system resources substitutes to external energies. R becomes an unambiguous definition of a system efficiency. It shows that all agroethanol systems are more consuming than petroleum industry. The system can be expanded to the vehicle stage to compare with alternatives to ethanol such as electricity and biogas. Wheat straw burnt to produce electricity used in an electrical vehicle will present R close to that of petroleum industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3aenergy efficiency 3aethanol 3aindustry 3apetroleum 3asugar beet 3asugarcane 3asugars 3awheat straw1 aFrangi, Jean-Pierre0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2011 July, v. 35, no. 7 p.2737-2754dElsevier Ltdx0961-95347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.03.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245019800159300002200357520148700379592002801866650002201894650002201916650001901938650001501957650001401972650001601986650001102002650002502013650002202038650001502060650001402075650000902089650001102098650003302109650002002142650001702162650001602179650002502195650001402220650002002234700001802254700003002272700002202302700001902324700002302343773012702366856007402493852000902567655001202576IND60641328120221120083526.0190505e20161121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064132812DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra22643d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Praveen10aDimethyl carbonate synthesis from carbon dioxide using ceria–zirconia catalysts prepared using a templating method: characterization, parametric optimization and chemical equilibrium modeling  ap. 110235-110246.  aIn this paper, a series of CeₓZr₁₋ₓO₂ solid solution spheres were synthesized by exo- and endo-templating methods and tested for dimethyl carbonate (DMC) synthesis using direct conversion of CO₂. The synthesized catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N₂-physisorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and CO₂/NH₃-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). Formation of CeₓZr₁₋ₓO₂ solid solutions with tetragonal and cubic crystal structures depending on cerium/zirconium compositions was confirmed by XRD analysis. The specific surface area of the mixed oxide decreased and the average pore diameter increased with an increase in the ceria content, with the exception of the mixed oxides with x = 0.4–0.5 i.e. Ce₀.₄Zr₀.₆O₂ and Ce₀.₅Zr₀.₅O₂. The basic and acidic site density of the synthesized catalysts was in the order: ZrO₂ < CeO₂ < Ce₀.₅Zr₀.₅O₂, and the basic and acidic site density per unit area followed the same order. The best Ce₀.₅Zr₀.₅O₂ catalyst was further used for the optimization of reaction conditions such as reaction time, reaction temperature, catalyst dose and reusability for DMC synthesis. Furthermore, study of chemical equilibrium modeling was done using the Peng–Robinson–Stryjek–Vera equation of state (PRSV-EoS) along with the van der Waals one-fluid reaction condition so as to calculate change of Gibbs free energy (ΔG°) and heat of reaction (ΔH°).  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonates 3acatalysts 3aceric oxide 3acerium 3achemical equilibrium 3acrystal structure 3adesorption 3aequations 3aheat 3amodels 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolid solutions 3asurface area 3atemperature 3avan der Waals forces 3azirconium 3azirconium oxide1 aWith, Patrick1 aSrivastava, Vimal Chandra1 aShukla, Kartikeya1 aGläser, Roger1 aMishra, Indra Mani0 tRSC advances.g2016 Nov. 21, v. 6, no. 111 p.110235-110246dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra22643d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245012700179520171600306592002802022650001202050650001102062650002202073650001502095650002202110650001702132650001302149650001402162650001902176650001402195650000902209650001402218650000902232653001702241653002302258653002502281700003402306700003602340700002902376700003402405773012402439856008302563852000902646655001202655IND60757205420221119090916.0220124e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075720542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2021.1053832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez, José Alexander10aClassifying the potential of biochars from agricultural and industrial waste for the recovery of Fe and Mn mining tailings  aVarious types of agricultural and industrial waste have been used for biochar production. However, a consistent method of biochar stratification for agronomic and environmental purposes is still lacking. The aim of this study was to propose and evaluate a method of stratification based on physical and chemical properties. A set of biochar samples was produced by pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis from two agricultural wastes (poultry litter - PL and swine manure - SM) and three industrial wastes (construction wood - CW, tyres - TR and PVC plastic - PVC) at a wide range of pyrolysis temperatures (300–700 °C). The proposed stratification considered the following criteria in order: (i) construction of a biochar viability indicator (BVI); (ii) classification of biochar potential based on fixed carbon, ash and volatile matter; (iii) joint use of biochar quality criteria and those established in the literature (e.g. International Biochar Initiative - IBI); and (iv) the restrictive conditions of the environment where the biochar might be applied, in this case mining tailings, aiming at plant development. Using the proposed method of stratification, PL+CW pyrolysed at 300 °C was chosen for the recovery of Fe and Mn mining tailings due to its intermediate fertility level and extremely low risk of environmental pollution. The proposed method allowed the identification of restrictions on biochar use, and most importantly, highlighted the potential of the most viable biochars for conditioning mining tailings, which hinder plant growth. However, despite being useful and efficient in biochar selection, the proposed methods are still dependent on the physico-chemical characteristics of the biochars.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3acarbon 3aindustrial wastes 3apig manure 3aplant development 3aplant growth 3aplastics 3apollution 3apoultry manure 3apyrolysis 3arisk 3aviability 3awood 0aCo-pyrolysis 0aImmediate analysis 0aPrincipal components1 aLustosa Filho, José Ferreira1 aMelo, Leônidas Carrijo Azevedo1 ade Assis, Igor Rodrigues1 aOliveira, Teógenes Senna de,0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2022 Jan., v. 161 p.105383-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2021.1053833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03350naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245009900176300001800275520196700293592002802260650001502288650001502303650002502318650001902343650003002362650002802392650001102420650002902431650001302460650001202473651001002485651001002495651002102505651001802526653002702544653001102571653001302582700002102595700002602616700001902642700002302661773010002684856008702784852000902871655001202880IND60598442220221117095227.0200503e20180201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059844222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.11.1072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuis Míguez, José10aEvolution of CO2 capture technology between 2007 and 2017 through the study of patent activity  ap. 1282-1296.  aEnergy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to increase by approximately 30% by 2040. Based on this increase, the capture and storage of CO₂ are presented as a suitable opportunity to decrease emissions. This study offers a preliminary overview of state-of-the-art CO₂ capture patents during the past decade (2007–2017). More than 28,000 patents and 5000 scientific documents were collected, analysed and classified in terms of the Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) criteria. Most patent generation activity is concentrated in capture technologies that use absorption and adsorption chemical processes (within 35% and 30% of the collected documents, respectively). Moreover, companies such as Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems Europe GmbH, Alstom Technology Ltd., ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company and Air Liquide SA dominate the development of these main capture technologies. Specialized companies such as CO₂ Solutions Inc., Akermin Inc. and UOP LLC are leaders in membrane systems or biological processes; however, there are fewer publications related to these technologies. Most of the patent activity is occurring in the USA, Japan, China and Korea (responsible for 64% of the innovations); also highlighting the role of international offices such as the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and the European Patent Office (EPO) (with 22% of patent generation). The growing knowledge of patent generation over the past decade indicates that CO₂ capture technologies have inspired environmental and economic interest, making it possible to develop established processes that can be implemented by the current industry and to optimize the existing industries. The idea of knowing what are the most active companies in terms of patent production and the fields where they are working, give competitors information about the identification of development trends and economically viable investigation lines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3abusiness enterprises 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide production 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenergy 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aindustry 3apatents 3aChina 3aJapan 3aKorean Peninsula 3aUnited States 0aCO2 capture technology 0aPatent 0aCPC code1 aPorteiro, Jacobo1 aPérez-Orozco, Raquel1 aPatiño, David1 aRodríguez, Sandra0 tApplied energy.g2018 Feb. 01, v. 211 p.1282-1296dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.11.1073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245015300168300001100321520126900332592002801601596008001629650003001709650001801739650002501757650001401782650001401796650001901810650000901829650004801838650001001886700001801896700005801914773011901972856008302091852000902174655001202183IND60760374020221116203852.0220109e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076037402DNAL7 a10.1186/s13765-021-00662-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Jun Hwan,10aAcaricidal and repellent activities of Litsea cubeba (Lour.) oil and 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal against Haemaphysalis longicornis (Acari: Ixodidae)  ap. 88.  aThe bioactivity of the essential oil extracted from Litsea cubeba fruits against tick vectors of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome is unknown. In this study, L. cubeba oil and its main constituents, 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal and its similar structures, were evaluated for their acaricidal and repellent activities on the unfed nymphs and adults of Haemaphysalis longicornis. L. cubeba oil displayed both acaricidal and repellent activities against both life stages. Among the constituents of L. cubeba oil, only 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal exhibited both acaricidal and repellent activities against both life stages. In a repellent bioassay, 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal and L. cubeba oil at dose of 0.08 mg/cm² provided excellent repellence (100%) against the nymphs and adults for over 60 min post-application. When the acaricidal and repellent activities of 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal and its similar structures were compared, activities of all tested derivatives were significantly less potent than those of 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal. The strong acaricidal and repellent activities of 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal in L. cubeba oil suggests that it is a promising natural candidate for developing new sustainable acaricidal and repellent agents.  aPublisher supplied data  aHG18C0055cGovernment-wide R&D Fund project for infectious disease research 3aHaemaphysalis longicornis 3aLitsea cubeba 3abioactive properties 3abioassays 3achemistry 3aessential oils 3aoils 3asevere fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome 3aticks1 aLee, Hoi-Seon1 aChung, Namhyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9899-28500 tApplied biological chemistry.g2021 Dec., v. 64, no. 1 p.88-88dSpringer SingaporewJournal:27084x2468-08347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13765-021-00662-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245013100175300001400306520126400320592002801584650001201612650002201624650001901646650002201665650002601687650002201713650002401735650001301759650001101772650001501783650002701798650001801825650001501843650001301858650001201871650001701883651001401900700003301914700002001947700002201967700002001989700002602009773009002035856008402125852000902209655001202218IND60083949520221119060902.0141101e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008394952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mambio.2010.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiappero, Marina B.10aContrasting genetic structure of urban and rural populations of the wild rodent Calomys musculinus (Cricetidae, Sigmodontinae)  ap. 41-50.  aThe alteration of landscapes by human activities worldwide has forced many animal species to persist in remnants of natural habitats. One of the best examples of this process occurs in central-east Argentina, where the original prairies were almost completely replaced by agricultural land, cattle production areas and increasing urbanization. We used nine microsatellite loci to analyze the population genetic structure of the Sigmodontine rodent Calomys musculinus in two anthropically altered habitats: an agroecosystem and a city. Rodents inhabiting urban vacant lots showed higher levels of relatedness and genetic differentiation than rodents inhabiting the agroecosystem. Urban rodents presented a pattern of isolation by distance; in the rural habitat this pattern was present only along the border of a secondary road, but not over the entire area surveyed. In the city, a spatially limited but buffered environment, populations would be small, demographically stable, and dispersal would be restricted. On the contrary, in agroecosystems populations would experience a high rate of turn over: local demes would originate each year by a mixture of overwintering individuals, and dispersal would occur preferentially along the weedy borders of fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalomys 3aagricultural land 3aagroecosystems 3acattle production 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aoverwintering 3apopulation 3aprairies 3arodents 3aurbanization 3aArgentina1 aPanzetta-Dutari, Graciela M.1 aGómez, Daniela1 aCastillo, Ernesto1 aPolop, Jaime J.1 aGardenal, Cristina N.0 tMammalian biology =.g2011 Jan., v. 76, no. 1 p.41-50dElsevier GmbHx1616-50477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mambio.2010.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01664naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011700155300002000272520051800292592002800810650002300838650002600861650001900887650001800906650000700924650002300931700001600954700002000970700002100990700001601011700001701027700002201044700001701066773012401083856007401207852000901281655001201290IND60641328520221120072433.0190505e20161012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064132852DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra22650g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuang, Rui10aFacile preparation of a hierarchically porous metal–organic nanocomposite with excellent catalytic performance  ap. 97399-97403.  aHerein, we report a strategy to prepare a hierarchical micro–meso–macro porous metal–organic nanocomposite, hpCuL (L = 2,4,6-tris(3,5-dicarboxylatephenylamino)-1,3,5-triazine), using a facile gel-aging process.

STFX sesquihydrate showed larger weight change between 1% and 95% relative humidities (RHs) than other crystalline forms. In the crystal of sesquihydrate, STFX molecules form a channel structure where water molecules exist. Contrary to sesquihydrate, water molecules in a monohydrate are located in well-defined and isolated crystallographic sites. The β-form exhibited the worst photostability than any other forms under the irradiation of a D65 lamp. The intramolecular hydrogen bonding in the β-form caused a red shift on the solid-state UV spectrum by prolonging the conjugation system of the quinolone ring, resulting in greater absorption of photoenergy and consequent degradation. Solubility is also affected by the crystalline structure. Standard free energy of the formation of STFX molecule in each crystalline form and/or lattice energy binding STFX molecules to retain the crystal structure might cause a difference in solubility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aantibiotics 3acrystal structure 3aenergy 3ahydrogen bonding 3airradiation 3aphotostability 3asitafloxacin 3asolubility1 aTerada, Katsuhide0 tSensors and actuators.g2012 Jan. 17, v. 422, no. 1-2 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.x0378-51737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.10.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03919naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007300148245019700221300001100418520240100429592002802830650002602858650002102884650002002905650002702925650001702952650001502969650001902984650001403003650002303017650001703040650001503057650001203072650001103084650001603095651001703111700001803128700002503146700002503171700001803196700002103214700001703235773010503252856008303357852000903440655001203449IND60760374220221116203932.0211220e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076037422DNAL7 a10.1186/s40317-021-00271-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGallagher, C.

This observation provides insight on predator avoidance behaviour by Dolly Varden and the predator’s feeding frequency while the tag was ingested. Based on published distribution and ecology information, we presumed the predator was a beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas). Supplemental satellite telemetry data from previously tagged Dolly Varden and beluga whales were used to determine the extent of spatial and vertical overlap between species in the area where predation occurred. RESULTS: Prior to the predation event, depths and temperatures occupied by the tagged Dolly Varden averaged 1.1 m and 3.1 °C, respectively. On July 7, 2020, depths remained shallow apart from a sudden dive to 12.5 m (16:45 UTC) followed by a precipitous increase in temperature from 4.4 to 27.1 °C (16:52 UTC) suggesting predation by an endotherm. Subsequent readings indicated the endotherm had a resting stomach temperature of 36.1 °C. Including the predation event, eight separate feeding events were inferred during the 20-h period the tag was ingested (before presumed regurgitation) based on subsequent declines in stomach temperatures (mean decline to 31.1 °C) that took an average of 24.1 min to return to resting temperature. The predator occupied mainly shallow depths (mean = 2.3 m), overlapping with tagged belugas that spent 76.9% of their time occupying waters ≤ 2.5 m when frequenting the area occupied by tagged Dolly Varden in the Canadian Beaufort Sea in July. Back-calculation based on tag drift and mean displacement by tagged belugas indicated the predation likely occurred west of the Mackenzie Delta. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide new information on both anti-predator behaviour by, and marine predators of, Dolly Varden in the Beaufort Sea. We provide the first estimate of feeding frequency and stomach temperature recovery in a presumed wild beluga, and evidence for shallow foraging behaviour by belugas. Elucidating the likely predator and exploring the extent of overlap between Dolly Varden and beluga whales contributes towards knowledge on the trophic interactions in the Beaufort Sea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDelphinapterus leucas 3aSalvelinus malma 3aanadromous fish 3aantipredatory behavior 3abiotelemetry 3aendothermy 3amarine mammals 3apredation 3apredator avoidance 3ariver deltas 3asatellites 3astomach 3asummer 3atemperature 3aBeaufort Sea1 aStorrie, Luke1 aCourtney, Michael B.1 aHowland, Kimberly L.1 aLea, Ellen V.1 aMacPhee, Shannon1 aLoseto, Lisa0 tAnimal biotelemetry.g2021 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.48-48dBioMed CentralwJournal:21547x2050-33857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40317-021-00271-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03140naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005200146245011900198300001800317520189600335592002802231650002202259650001702281650001602298650001302314650001502327650001302342650002002355650001602375700001302391700001302404700003202417700006602449700002702515773013502542856008002677852000902757655001202766IND60606055820221118064641.0180724e20180208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060605582DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b097752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4248-946010aImproving Charge Carrier Mobility of Polymer Blend Field Effect Transistors with Majority Insulating Polymer Phase  ap. 2918-2930.  aThe key approach to achieve high performance field effect transistor fabricated from semiconducting/insulating polymer blends with majority insulating polymer phase is the formation of connected fibrous structures of semiconducting polymer and good interfacial interaction of semiconducting polymer with the dielectric layer. Herein, tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a marginal solvent was used as an additive in marginal/good solvent mixtures to control the crystallite structure, phase segregation, and hole transport properties of poly(3-hexylthiophene)/poly(styrene) (P3HT/PS; weight ratio: 1/4) blends, with the advantage that marginal/good solvent mixture gives P3HT sufficient time for phase segregation and relatively better solvent quality to aggregate to more stable structures compared to other reported strategies as bad/good solvent mixtures or directly marginal solvents. Incorporation of THF reduces the P3HT solubility, forming connected fibrous structures as observed in both neat P3HT and blend films; it appears these structures are responsible for improved charge transport. Furthermore, enhanced molecular ordering, π–π stacking and conjugation length are observed with increasing THF amount. THF promotes the edge-on orientation and more stable crystal structures in P3HT, while the lattice spacing remains the same. Finally, the added THF increases hole mobility for P3HT/PS blend FETs, reaching a maximum value of 4 0.0 × 10–³ cm²/(V s) with 20 vol % THF and being comparative to neat P3HT; however, THF has an insignificant influence on the hole mobility for neat P3HT FETs. Morphological characterization supports the idea that differential solubility creates both enhanced chain ordering and vertical phase segregation that both improve FET performance. These results are promising for the development of environmentally stable and lower cost polymer electronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystal structure 3acrystallites 3aelectronics 3apolymers 3asolubility 3asolvents 3atetrahydrofuran 3atransistors1 aPan, Hao1 aLi, Heng1 aMinus, M.

UV–vis absorption studies confirmed that LAF binds to ctDNA through non-covalent interactions. Fluorescence quenching and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy studies showed that the binding of LAF with ctDNA occurred through static quenching mechanism, resulting in the formation of a LAF–ctDNA complex. The binding constants (K) of the complex were found to be around 103M−1 via NMR relaxation rates and fluorescence data, and the calculated thermodynamic parameters indicated that hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces played major roles in the binding of LAF to ctDNA. The changes in CD spectra indicated that LAF induced a slight perturbation on the base stacking and helicity of B-DNA. A comparative study of the LAF–ctDNA complex with respect to potassium iodide quenching experiments and competition displacement assays with ethidium bromide, acridine orange, and Hoechst 33258 probes suggested that LAF interacted with ctDNA by minor groove mode. Molecular docking analysis further supported the minor groove binding. Molecular dynamics simulation indicated that LAF depart from the C-G region of DNA, but it can steadily bind with the middle part of DNA composed by A-T base pairs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-DNA 3aacridine orange 3aadjuvants 3aantineoplastic agents 3acalves 3aethidium 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ahydrogen bonding 3amolecular dynamics 3amolecular models 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apotassium iodide 3athermodynamics 3athymus gland 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3avan der Waals forces 0aCalf thymus DNA 0aLafutidine 0aGroove binding1 aTang, Peixiao1 aTang, Bin1 aHuang, Yanmei1 aHe, Jiawei1 aLi, Shanshan1 aLi, Hui0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017 June, v. 99 p.79-87dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.02.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03211naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012400168300002000292520166000312592002801972650001202000650001302012650001202025650001102037650002002048650002002068650001302088650001902101650001702120650001302137650000902150650001102159650001702170650001502187650001402202650001102216653002802227653001802255653002402273653002202297653001702319700001802336700001802354700001602372700006402388773014602452856008602598852000902684655001202693IND60760374320221116204042.0211220e20211203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076037432DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c042892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Peitao10aProduct Characteristics and Synergy Study on Supercritical Methanol Liquefaction of Lignocellulosic Biomass and Plastic  ap. 17103-17111.  aBio-oil originating from lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) is a potential next-generation fuel because of its abundant, renewable, and sustainable resources compared to other types. However, these bio-oils are typically of low quality compared to petroleum-derived oils due to their low calorific value, high acidity, and oxygen content. This work intends to provide a feasible method for producing hydrocarbon-rich oils by supercritical methanol (scMeOH) coliquefaction of LCB and plastic waste. Both rice straw (RS) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) are coliquefied under 300 °C for 60 min in scMeOH at various RS/LLDPE mass ratios of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2. Positive effects were found in terms of oil yield and fuel quality, such as higher hydrocarbons content and calorific value. The oil yield increased from 26.72 to 30.07 wt % with LLDPE addition of 67%. Around 79.15–92.24% of the oil was hydrocarbons, phenols, ketones, and diverse functional group compounds. The complex compounds led to various degrees of the synergetic effect on oil chemical compositions. Among various RS/LLDPE ratios in this work, RS/LLDPE of 1:2 was supposed to be an optimal ratio for hydrocarbon-rich fuel production because it presented the highest oil yield of 30.07 wt % and quality-high oil with 71.42% hydrocarbons. In addition, scMeOH coliquefaction of LCB and plastic waste shows a synergetic effect on the improvement of carbon and hydrogen contents in solid products. These results indicate that scMeOH coliquefaction of LCB with plastic is a feasible and promising means to improve fuel quality and also to realize the thermal recycling of plastic wastes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acarbon 3afuel production 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrogen 3alignocellulose 3aliquefaction 3amethanol 3aoils 3aoxygen 3apolyethylene 3arice straw 3asynergism 3awastes 0alignocellulosic biomass 0aplastic waste 0ascMeOH liquefaction 0asynergetic effect 0ahydrocarbons1 aYuan, Zhilong1 aSong, Xueping1 aZhang, Jing1 aRagauskas, Arthur J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3536-554X0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Dec. 03, v. 9, no. 50 p.17103-17111dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c042893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002300135245016200158300001600320500001500336520143600351592002801787650003001815650002201845650001101867650002601878650001501904650001701919650001701936650001101953650001301964650001701977651001001994651001702004653001102021653004202032653002702074653001602101653002502117653002602142773010002168856003802268852000902306655001202315IND4481934820221119054158.0120319s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448193482DNAL7 a10.1071/ZO110382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, Gabriel M.10aGeographic distribution of Rhyncholestes raphanurus Osgood, 1924 (Paucituberculata:Caenolestidae), an endemic marsupial of the Valdivian Temperate Rainforest  ap. 118-126.  a2019-12-06  aThe Chilean shrew opossum (Rhyncholestes raphanurus) is the southernmost representative of the family Caenolestidae (Marsupialia:Paucituberculata). The species lives in temperate forests of southern Chile and Argentina and is currently known from <25 localities, spanning a latitudinal and longitudinal range of 2°44′ (~320km) and 2°20′ (~190km), respectively. Species distribution was analysed in a historical, geographic and biogeographic context, with the use of maps at different scales (region, subregion, province, ecoregion, forest types), and two potential distribution models were generated with MaxEnt. The models show a few isolated areas of high prediction values (>50%) in coastal Chile and the Andes from 39°30′ to ~42°S, and most of Chiloé Island, plus a northern and southern expansion of medium to low (<50%) prediction values. The most important environmental variables identified from the models include precipitation and some temperature-related variables. The species occurrence lies within the Andean region, Subantarctic subregion, and Valdivian biogeographic province. At a smaller scale, most of the localities occur in eight of the 22 forest types described for the Valdivian ecoregion, implying narrow ecological requirements. Identification of critical areas through potential distribution modelling may have implications for species conservation and identification of biogeographic patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageographical distribution 3atemperate forests 3amodels 3aenvironmental factors 3aMetatheria 3arain forests 3aforest types 3ashrews 3aopossums 3abiogeography 3aChile 3aAndes region 0aMaxEnt 0aValdivian Temperate Forests ecoregion 0amarsupial biogeography 0aMarsupialia 0adistribution records 0aChilean shrew opossum0 tAustralian journal of zoology.g2011, v. 59, no. 2 p.118-126dCSIRO Publishingx0004-959X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/ZO11038  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245010000155300001800255520136500273592002801638650001901666650001501685650002401700650002001724650001801744650001001762650001701772650001101789650001301800650001201813650001901825650001401844651001601858653002001874653001501894653001501909700001701924700001801941700001601959700001701975700001801992700001802010700001802028773009902046856003802145852000902183655001202192IND50068970420221122002448.0130903s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006897042DNAL7 a10.1071/AN123052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArcher, J. A.10aGenetics of early conception and its relationship to growth traits in red deer (Cervus elaphus)  ap. 1083-1087.  aThe genetics of early conception success and live-animal growth were studied in five herds of red deer in New Zealand. Conception date (CD) was used as the criterion of success in seasonally mated hinds, with 2493 mating records available. Liveweights analysed were weaning weight, yearling weight, 15-month weight and mature weight (hinds only). CD and liveweights were analysed using restricted maximum likelihood procedures with an animal model, including all available pedigree records. Under the management conditions applied, CD had a phenotypic standard deviation of 7.9 days, a repeatability across years of 0.29 ± 0.03 and a direct (univariate) heritability of 0.20 ± 0.06. Regression procedures using DNA markers to adjust the data for genetic differences resulting from an animal’s ancestral region of origin (mainly western vs eastern European) had little effect on the parameter estimates above. Direct heritability estimates for the four weight traits were 0.38 ± 0.03, 0.49 ± 0.02, 0.48 ± 0.04 and 0.46 ± 0.04, respectively, while the genetic correlations between CD and these traits (e.g. using 1763 paired records of CD with yearling weight) were –0.24 ± 0.11, –0.24 ± 0.09, –0.16 ± 0.10 and –0.04 ± 0.09, respectively. Selection for earlier CD would be successful and compatible with selection for higher juvenile weights.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCervus elaphus 3aconception 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic markers 3agrowth traits 3aherds 3aheritability 3amodels 3apedigree 3aweaning 3aweaning weight 3ayearlings 3aNew Zealand 0abreeding season 0aconception 0aultrasound1 aAsher, G.

Vapor-deposited Ag forms nanoparticles on these films and induces considerable surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) along with a change in molecular symmetry of adjacent α-3T and formation of Ag–S bonds; no other reaction chemistry is observed. Vapor-deposited Al and Ca undergo chemical reaction with α-3T initiated by metal-to-α-3T electron transfer. For Al, the resulting product is predominantly amorphous carbon through initial radical formation and subsequent decomposition reactions. For Ca, the spectral evidence suggests two pathways: one leading to α-3T polymerization and the other resulting in thiophene ring opening, both initiated by radical formation through Ca-to-α-3T electron transfer. These interfacial reactions reflect the complex chemistry that can occur between low work function metals and thiophene-based oligomers. This reactivity is strongly correlated with metal work function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aaluminum 3acalcium 3acarbon 3achemical bonding 3aelectron transfer 3ananoparticles 3apolymerization 3asilver 3athiophene1 aMatz, Dallas L.1 aPemberton, Jeanne E.0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2015 Oct. 29, v. 119, no. 43 p.24290-24298dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b081273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148242006100170245006700231300001400298520106100312592002801373650001701401650001601418650001901434650001501453650002301468650001001491650003301501650001301534650001001547650002601557650002601583650001701609650001001626650001301636650001301649650001101662650001001673651001401683700002301697700001801720700002801738700003101766700002201797700001901819700002101838773011101859856008201970852000902052655001202061IND60088635520180622000000.0141102e20130103xx |||||o|||||||||||spa||7 aIND6008863552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.riam.2012.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantiso, Gabriela10aClinical problems in medical mycology: Problem number 4510aProblemas clínicos en micología médica: problema número 45  ap. 72-74.  aA 43 year-old diabetic woman, who suffered chronic cough and brown expectoration, is presented in this clinical problem.

The diagnosis of chronic cavitary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis was based on the isolation of Coccidioides sp. from cultures of expectoration and bronchoalveolar lavage, and the detection of specific antibodies in immunodiffusion test and counterimmunoelectrophoresis with coccidiodin. Her diabetes was not well controlled. She was treated with intravenous amphotericin B and oral itraconazole, with good clinical response; after four months of treatment the patient abandoned clinical controls.

Therefore, the volatiles from S. philanthi RM-1-138 have a high potential for biocontrol of chili anthracnose disease in postharvest system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColletotrichum 3aStreptomyces 3aanthracnose 3aantifungal properties 3abiological control 3acell walls 3afumigants 3afumigation 3ainoculum 3apathogens 3aphenylethyl alcohol 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aseeds 3aspores 3avirulent strains 3avolatile compounds 3awheat 0aAcetophenone 0aBiocontrol 0aColletotrichum spp. 0aPhenylethyl alcohol 0aStreptomyces philanthi1 aPetlamul, Wanida1 aBunkrongcheap, Ruthaiwan1 aChookaew, Teera1 aKabbua, Thai1 aThippated, Apinya1 aPrasertsan, Poonsuk0 tCrop protection.g2018 Jan., v. 103 p.1-8dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2017.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03705naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245009800208300001800306520198700324592002802311650002002339650001502359650002402374650001702398650001002415650002202425650001402447650001302461650001902474650002402493650002002517650002102537650002002558650002102578650002002599650001402619650001402633650002202647650001202669650001602681650001302697653002502710653001602735653003102751653002102782653001202803700002302815700001602838700002902854700002002883700001802903773009902921856008603020852000903106655001203115IND60645506420221120153643.0190705e20190709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064550642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.05.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNosan, Gregor1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7306-671910aVaccine immune response, autoimmunity and morbidity after neonatal blood exchange transfusion  ap. 4076-4080.  aA blood exchange transfusion (BET) is most commonly performed to treat severe neonatal haemolytic disease. A distinct form of blood transfusion adverse reaction is transfusion-related immunomodulation. The purpose of our retrospective single-centre case-control cohort study was to investigate whether a blood exchange transfusion in the neonatal period provokes immunomodulation and affects humoral immune response to vaccination, morbidity and occurrence of autoantibodies.Study subjects were 74 apparently healthy children, who were born at term as appropriate for gestational age and received four doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoid vaccine. Forty-one received BET due to neonatal hemolytic disease and no other blood product afterwards, while 33 did not receive any blood products. Analysis of diphtheria, tetanus and autoimmune antibodies was performed and their medical records were analyzed for infectious, allergic, cancerous and autoimmune diseases.A clearly exaggerated immune response to diphtheria (1.016 IU/mL, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.662–1.369 IU/mL vs. 0.515 IU/mL, 95% CI 0.363 to 0.626 IU/mL, P = 0.011) and slightly exaggerated immune response to tetanus vaccine (1.798 IU/mL, 95% CI 1.180–2.416 IU/mL vs. 1.036 IU/mL, 95% CI 0.398–1.673 IU/mL, P = non-specific) were observed in BET subjects. A propensity towards autoimmunity (25.8% vs. 12.5%, P = non-specific) was observed in BET subjects. However, BET in the neonatal period did not influence the occurrence of bacterial, childhood viral diseases with exception of varicella (43.9% vs. 21.2%, P = 0.040), autoimmune and cancer diseases.BET impacted humoral immune response to diphtheria and tetanus vaccine and occurrence of autoimmune antibodies, but did not affect morbidity and the occurrence of autoimmune diseases. These effects could be related to massive antigenic load of BET and an accelerated priming of immune cells and consequent immunomodulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aantibodies 3aautoimmune diseases 3aautoimmunity 3ablood 3ablood transfusion 3achildhood 3achildren 3acohort studies 3aconfidence interval 3agestational age 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmune response 3aimmunomodulation 3amedical records 3amorbidity 3aneoplasms 3apostpartum period 3atetanus 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aExchange transfusion 0aVaccination 0aDiphtheria-tetanus vaccine 0aImmunomodulation 0aNewborn1 aParo-Panjan, Darja1 aIhan, Alojz1 aKopitar, Andreja Nataša1 aČučnik, Saša1 aAvčin, Tadej0 tVaccine.g2019 July 09, v. 37, no. 30 p.4076-4080dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.05.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03326naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245016700165300001200332520187700344592002802221650002902249650001202278650001202290650001302302650002102315650001102336650001102347650001502358650001702373650000902390650001102399650001502410650001102425650001902436650001102455650002702466650001402493650001102507650002002518650000902538651001102547700002802558700002302586773013302609856008102742852000902823655001202832IND60132775220221120034737.0151024e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013277522DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-015-4524-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerati, Flora10aAssessment of heavy metal contamination in water and sediments of Trepça and Sitnica rivers, Kosovo, using pollution indicators and multivariate cluster analysis  ap. 338.  aThe concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn in water and sediment samples from Trepça and Sitnica rivers were determined to assess the level of contamination. Six water and sediment samples were collected during the period from April to July 2014. Most of the water samples was found within the European and Kosovo permissible limits. The highest concentration of As, Cd, Pb, and Zn originates primarily from anthropogenic sources such discharge of industrial water from mining flotation and from the mine waste eroded from the river banks. Sediment contamination assessment was carried out using the pollution indicators such as contamination factor (CF), degree of contamination (Cd), modified degree of contamination (mCd), pollution load index (PLI), and geo-accumulation index (Igeo). The CF values for the investigated metals indicated a high contaminated nature of sediments, while the Cd values indicated a very high contamination degree of sediments. The mCd values indicate a high degree of contamination of Sitnica river sediment to ultrahigh degree of contamination of Trepça river sediment. The PLI values ranged from 1.89 to 14.1 which indicate that the heavy metal concentration levels in all investigated sites exceeded the background values and sediment quality guidelines. The average values of Igeo revealed the following ranking of intensity of heavy metal contamination of the Trepça and Sitnica river sediments: Cd > As > Pb > Zn > Cu > Co > Cr > Ni. Cluster analysis suggests that As, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn are derived from anthropogenic sources, particularly discharges from mining flotation and erosion form waste from a zinc mine plant. In order to protect the sediments from further contamination, the designing of a monitoring network and reducing the anthropogenic discharges are suggested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achromium 3acluster analysis 3acobalt 3acopper 3aguidelines 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amining 3amonitoring 3anickel 3apollution load 3arivers 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3awastes 3awater pollution 3azinc 3aKosovo1 aKerolli-Mustafa, Mihone1 aKraja-Ylli, Arjana0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2015 June, v. 187, no. 6 p.338-338dSpringer International Publishingx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-4524-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03400naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245009500160300002000255520218700275592002802462650001102490650001202501650001302513650002102526650001202547650001802559650000902577650001202586650002302598650001402621650001102635650002302646650001302669650001602682650002102698700001602719700002302735773012902758856008202887852000902969655001202978IND60565908120221119222622.0170327e20151029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056590812DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b081722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Yan10aStructural and Dynamical Properties of a Deep Eutectic Solvent Confined Inside a Slit Pore  ap. 24489-24500.  aWe performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the structure and dynamics of the deep eutectic solvent (DES) choline iodide-glycerol (CI.G) at a molar ratio of 1:3, inside slitlike titania [rutile (110)] and graphitic nanopores of width H = 5.2 and 2.5 nm, and at a temperature T = 333 K. DESs share many of the remarkable properties of ionic liquids (ILs) while being more inexpensive; furthermore, and in addition to their fundamental scientific interest, the systems modeled here are relevant to dye-sensitized solar cells and gas separations. Our results show that glycerol can form stable hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atoms in the rutile walls, which account for ∼86% of the total number of hydrogen bonds involving DES species (choline, iodide, and glycerol) in the first layers (near the rutile walls), and for ∼24% of the total hydrogen bonds observed for the DES inside a rutile pore of width H = 5.2 nm. As a result, in these systems, the rutile walls are coated by glycerol layers that are almost depleted of ions, have a liquid structure that departs from that of the bulk DES, and have very slow dynamics. In contrast, for DES inside graphitic pores, all species are present in the first layers near the carbon walls, the local liquid structure everywhere is similar to that of a bulk DES, and the overall dynamics are faster than those observed inside rutile pores of the same pore size; however, the DES species in the center of both rutile and graphitic pores have comparable mobilities. When the pore size is reduced, a larger proportion of the hydrogen bonds involve the walls (in the case of a rutile pore), the overall dynamics of the confined DES become slower, and in general the hydrogen bonds formed are present during longer times in the simulation trajectories. These observations are in general similar to the results obtained by us for the IL [EMIM⁺][TFMSI–] inside the same rutile and graphitic pores; however, both of the IL ions are present in the layers near the walls, and the ions in the center of a rutile pore have dynamics that were 2–4 times slower than those observed for the same ions in the center of a graphitic pore.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acholine 3aglycerol 3ahydrogen bonding 3aiodides 3aionic liquids 3aions 3aliquids 3amolecular dynamics 3ananopores 3aoxygen 3aphotovoltaic cells 3aporosity 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide1 aHe, Xiaoxia1 aHung, Francisco R.0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2015 Oct. 29, v. 119, no. 43 p.24489-24500dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b081723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245017000169300001800339520138200357592002801739650000801767650000901775650001501784650001401799650001301813650002001826653002901846653001601875653001701891700001801908700001601926700001501942700001701957700001701974700001901991773010002010856008702110852000902197655001202206IND60598443120221117095239.0200503e20180201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059844312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTi, Shuguang10aInfluence of primary air cone length on combustion characteristics and NOx emissions of a swirl burner from a 0.5 MW pulverized coal-fired furnace with air staging  ap. 1179-1189.  aThis paper presents experimental research on cold flow, combustion characteristics, and NOₓ emissions of a swirl burner with air staging. The aim of the research is to investigate the influence of primary air cone length on the swirl burner performance. Cold flow air experiments on a centrally fuel-rich swirl burner with an over-fire air ratio of 25% were performed, and it was observed that when the dimensionless primary-air cone length (i.e., Lₚ/Lᵢ, Lₚ and Lᵢ respectively denoting the primary-air cone length in the cold-modeling experiments and inner secondary-air cone length) increases from 0 to 0.75, the diameter and length of the recirculation zone reduces from 0.91 d and 1.51 d to 0.68 d and 0.57 d, respectively. An investigation was conducted in a 0.5 MW laboratory furnace in order to optimize the primary-air cone length of a centrally fuel-rich swirl burner. The flame stability, performance of ignition, and burnout are significantly improved by decreasing the primary-air cone length. The NOₓ emissions measured at the furnace exit with a cone length Lₚ/Lᵢ = 0 decreased by 50.3% compared to those measured with a cone length Lₚ/Lᵢ = 1.0. Based on the evaluation of flame stability, performance of the ignition, burnout, and low NOₓ emissions, the optimum value of primary-air cone length was observed to be Lₚ/Lᵢ = 0.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acoal 3acombustion 3aemissions 3afurnaces 3anitrogen oxides 0aLow NOx burner structure 0aAir staging 0aNOx emission1 aChen, Zhichao1 aLi, Zhengqi1 aKuang, Min1 aXu, Guangyin1 aLai, Jinping1 aWang, Zhenfeng0 tApplied energy.g2018 Feb. 01, v. 211 p.1179-1189dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245016200168520134400330592002801674650002201702650002201724650001801746650001701764650001001781650002201791650005201813650001201865653002201877653001401899653002901913653001701942653001901959653001001978653000801988653000901996653000902005653000902014653000802023653001002031700002102041700001902062700001902081700001802100700001402118773011202132856008702244852000902331655001202340IND60757206620221119090944.0220124e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075720662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2021.1143682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaj, Rashmi10aDevelopment of a protocol for the elimination of Cyrtanthus elatus virus-A from Narcissus tazetta by in vitro chemotherapy in combination with electrotherapy  aNarcissus (Narcissus tazetta) is a bulbous ornamental plant propagated vegetatively from bulbs. The Cyrtanthus elatus virus-A (CyEV-A) had been reported to cause a severe mosaic and yellow stripe disease in narcissus. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a protocol for the elimination of CyEV-A from infected bulblets by in vitro chemotherapy (30−50 mg/L ribavirin for 30 days) and electrotherapy (10−30 mA for 20 min), individually and in combination, to produce virus-free plants. The regenerated plants obtained from these treatments were screened for the absence of the CyEV-A by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays using a set of degenerate primers specific for a potyvirus coat protein gene. The results showed that in vitro chemotherapy (30 mg/L ribavirin for 30 days) alone produced 46.0 % (14/30) of virus-free plants, while electrotherapy (20 mA for 20 min) alone produced 40.0 % (12/30) of virus-free plants. In comparison, a combination of chemotherapy (30 mg/L ribavirin for 30 days) and electrotherapy (20 mA for 20 min) produced 50.0 % (15/30) of virus-free plants. The virus-free plants obtained from this combination treatment exhibited better growth and produced more bulbs compared to the other treatments and control. The protocol may be used for the control of the virus disease in narcissus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyrtanthus elatus 3aNarcissus tazetta 3acoat proteins 3adrug therapy 3agenes 3aornamental plants 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aviruses 0aVirus elimination 0aNarcissus 0aCyrtanthus elatus virusA 0aChemotherapy 0aElectrotherapy 0aNLSYV 0aNMV 0aNCLV 0aNYSV 0aNWSV 0aNDV 0aCyEVA1 aKaur, Charanjeet1 aAgrawal, Lalit1 aKumar, Susheel1 aChauhan, P.S.1 aRaj, S.K.0 tJournal of virological methods.g2022 Feb., v. 300 p.114368-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2021.1143683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148242008200177245009300259300001400352520175000366592002802116650002002144650001902164650001002183650001902193650001402212650001302226650001802239651001402257700003102271700002402302700002002326773011102346856008202457852000902539655001202548IND60088636120180622000000.0141102e20130103xx |||||o|||||||||||spa||7 aIND6008863612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.riam.2012.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez Méndez, Dilia10aMycoses In Venezuela: Working Groups in Mycology Reported Cases (1984–2010)14aLas micosis en Venezuela: casuística de los Grupos de Trabajo en Micología (1984-2010)  ap. 39-46.  aBACKGROUND: In 1984 the Venezuelan Work Groups in Mycology (VWGM) were created introducing an innovative approach to the study of the mycoses in Venezuela. AIM: To study the occurrence of the mycoses in Venezuela. METHODS: Review the reported cases of mycoses by the newsletter Boletín Informativo Las Micosis en Venezuela (VWGM) from 1984 to 2010. RESULTS: The data collected showed 36,968 reported cases of superficial mycoses, 1,989 of deep systemic cases, and 822 of localized mycoses. Pityriasis dermatophytosis was the most common superficial infection, and paracoccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis the most frequent deep systemic infection. Chromoblastomycosis was the most frequently diagnosed subcutaneous infection. The data provided showed the distribution by geographical area for each of the fungal infections studied, which may help to establish the endemic areas. DISCUSSION: Superficial mycosis is a public health problem due to its high morbidity and is probably responsible for some of the outbreaks in high-risk groups. Paracoccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis were reported more often, which agrees with earlier reports prior to the formation of the VWGM. Cases of sporotrichosis and chromoblastomycosis in Venezuela can be considered unique due to the high number of cases. This study highlights the contribution of the VWGM to the behavior of the mycoses in Venezuela, its incidence, prevalence, and the recognition of these infections as a problem of public health importance. The VWGM should keep working in this endeavor, not only reporting new cases, but also unifying the clinical and epidemiological criteria, in order to properly monitor the evolving epidemiological changes reported in these types of infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adermatomycoses 3afungi 3ahistoplasmosis 3amorbidity 3amycology 3apublic health 3aVenezuela1 aHernández Valles, Rosaura1 aAlvarado, Primavera1 aMendoza, Mireya0 tRevista iberoamericana de micología.g2013 Jan. 3, v. 30, no. 1 p.39-46dElsevier Espanax1130-14067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.riam.2012.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03209naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011700167300001600284520182000300592002802120650001402148650001202162650001902174650001202193650001802205650002002223650001402243650001302257650001502270650002602285650001602311650001902327650001702346650002002363650001602383650002102399650001602420700001902436700001702455700002802472700001902500700002202519773009602541856008102637852000902718655001202727IND60132775620221123042237.0150511e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013277562DNAL7 a10.1007/s11119-014-9376-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaturegli, Lisa10aTurfgrass spectral reflectance: simulating satellite monitoring of spectral signatures of main C3 and C4 species  ap. 297-310.  aIn recent years, within the European Union several legislative, monitoring and coordinating actions have been undertaken to encourage sustainable use of resources, reduction in the use of chemicals and improvement of the urban environment. In this respect, two concepts that are strictly related to most of the aspects above are: “precision agriculture” and “precision conservation” and more specifically “precision turfgrass management.” Optical sensing has become a crucial part of precision turfgrass management and spectral reflectance in particular has been an active area of research for many years. However, while turfgrass status evaluation by proximity-sensed spectral reflectance appears to be an established and reliable practice, much more could be achieved in terms of monitoring of large turfgrass areas through remote sensing, and in particular through satellite imagery. This paper reports the results of a trial attempting to evaluate the spectral signatures of several turfgrass species and cultivars, for future use in turfgrass satellite monitoring. Our experimental study focused on 20 turfgrass species/varieties including perennial ryegrasses, tall fescues, kentucky bluegrasses, bermudagrass ecotypes, seeded commercial bermudagrasses, vegetatively propagated bermudagrasses, Zoysia japonica and non-japonica zoysiagrasses. Various biological and agronomical parameters were studied and turfgrass spectral reflectance for all entries was gathered. Vegetation indices were calculated by simulating the available wavelengths deriving from World View 2 satellite imagery. Results showed that within the same species selected vegetation indices are often able to discriminate between different varieties that have been established and maintained with identical agronomical practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC4 plants 3aCynodon 3aEuropean Union 3aFestuca 3aPoa pratensis 3aZoysia japonica 3acultivars 3aecotypes 3amonitoring 3aprecision agriculture 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3aturf grasses 3aturf management 3aurban areas 3avegetation index 3awavelengths1 aLulli, Filippo1 aFoschi, Lara1 aGuglielminetti, Lorenzo1 aBonari, Enrico1 aVolterrani, Marco0 tPrecision agriculture.g2015 June, v. 16, no. 3 p.297-310dSpringer-Verlagx1385-22567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11119-014-9376-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011800154300002200272520173300294592002802027650003102055650001302086650001402099650001702113650002402130650001602154650001102170650001402181650001302195650000902208650001402217650001202231650001302243650002102256700001902277700001302296700001502309700001302324700001802337700001402355700001302369773012702382856007402509852000902583655001202592IND60641329420221120072258.0190505e20161125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064132942DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra22667a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Jing10aNano-topographic titanium modulates macrophage response in vitro and in an implant-associated rat infection model  ap. 111919-111927.  aThe macrophage-implant response plays a pivotal role in the interactions between implants and tissue involving inflammation and tissue remodeling. In this study, we investigated the proliferation, migration, and inflammatory cytokine secretion of macrophages adhering to titania nanotubes (TNT) and polished titanium (pTi) surfaces in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-simulated infection environment. An infection model in rats was used to analyze cell and bacterium responses to TNT and pTi implants in vivo. The in vitro results indicated that TNT surfaces restricted macrophage proliferation and migration and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Notably, LPS loading onto the TNT surface resulted in macrophage elongation with increased levels of secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines within 24 h followed by a decrease to the lowest level of all tested samples at 72 h. Analogously, increased amounts of inflammatory cytokines were observed for the TNT implants in vivo at 24 h with fewer detected at 72 h compared with pTi in the presence of Staphylococcus epidermidis (Se). Additionally, TNT implants exhibited lower total amounts of viable bacteria at 72 h than pTi implants. Furthermore, the tissues exhibited preferential spreading on TNT-Se implants at 72 h. These results suggested that the TNT surface in an infection environment could regulate the inflammatory response and promote tissue remodeling more effectively within the initial implantation compared with pTi. This study indicated the ability to construct functional nano-topographic surfaces by loading proteins or cytokines on implant surfaces that then could effectively modulate macrophages to support a healing process in lieu of chronic inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3abacteria 3acytokines 3ainflammation 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3amodels 3ananotubes 3aproteins 3arats 3asecretion 3atissues 3atitanium 3atitanium dioxide1 aZhao, Chanjuan1 aWang, Yi1 aLi, Yiting1 aDuan, Ke1 aWang, Jianxin1 aWeng, Jie1 aFeng, Bo0 tRSC advances.g2016 Nov. 25, v. 6, no. 113 p.111919-111927dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra22667a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03673naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245009500190300001600285520141600301592002801717650001601745650001201761650001601773650001801789650002801807650001101835650001201846650001301858650001701871650001401888650001901902650001201921650005501933650004801988650001202036650002602048650002902074650002602103650004902129650003802178650004502216650002902261650004902290650001402339650005602353650005502409650005602464650002902520650002502549650003302574650005302607650002202660650002402682650003902706700002102745700002202766700002102788700001702809773009702826856005502923852000902978655001202987IND4468764320221120143952.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446876432DNAL7 a216891732pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04680.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Ree, Kalie10aNitric oxide accumulation in Arabidopsis is independent of NOA1 in the presence of sucrose  ap. 225-233.  aNitric oxide signals diverse responses in animals and plants. Whereas nitric oxide synthesis mechanisms in animals are well understood, how nitric oxide is synthesized and regulated in plants remains controversial. NOA1 is a circularly permuted GTPase that is important for chloroplast function and is implicated in nitric oxide synthesis. However, the reported consequences of a null mutation in NOA1 are inconsistent. Whereas some studies indicate that the noa1 mutant has severe reductions in nitric oxide accumulation, others report that nitric oxide levels are indistinguishable between noa1 and the wild type. Here, we identify a correlation between the reported ability of noa1 to accumulate nitric oxide with growth on sucrose‐supplemented media. We report that noa1 accumulates both basal and salicylic acid‐induced nitric oxide only when grown on media containing sucrose. In contrast, nitric oxide accumulation in wild type is largely insensitive to sucrose supplementation. When grown in the absence of sucrose, noa1 has low fumarate, pale green leaves, slow growth and reduced chlorophyll content. These phenotypes are consistent with a defect in chloroplast‐derived photosynthate production and are largely rescued by sucrose supplementation. We conclude that NOA1 has a primary role in chloroplast function and that its effects on the accumulation of nitric oxide are likely to be indirect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aanimals 3achlorophyll 3agrowing media 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3aleaves 3amutants 3amutation 3anitric oxide 3aphenotype 3aplant response 3asucrose 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBiomass 2aChlorophyllxanalysis 2aChloroplastsxmetabolism 2aFumaratesxmetabolism 2aGTP Phosphohydrolasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aNitrate Reductasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aNitric Oxidexmetabolism 2aNitric Oxide Synthasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effectsxenzymologyxphysiology. 2aPlant Rootsxdrug effectsxenzymologyxphysiology. 2aPlant Shootsxdrug effectsxenzymologyxphysiology. 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aSalicylic Acidxpharmacology 2aSeedlingsxdrug effectsxenzymologyxphysiology. 2aSequence Deletion 2aSignal Transduction 2aSucrosexmetabolismxpharmacology.1 aGehl, Bernadette1 aWassim Chehab, E.1 aTsai, Yu‐Chang1 aBraam, Janet0 tplant journal.g2011 Oct., v. 68, no. 2 p.225-233dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04680.x  aDNAL 7aarticle04079naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245010200160300001600262520174900278592002802027596009502055596009202150596015602242596013502398596013002533650002102663650002102684650001902705650001802724650002302742650002502765650003102790650002402821650001002845650001502855650001802870650001502888650001402903650001902917650001302936650002102949650001402970650002202984650004303006650005203049650001703101700001603118700001403134700001503148700001803163700001703181700005703198773013103255856008203386852000903468655001203477IND60677468320221118013502.0191128e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067746832DNAL7 a10.1007/s11626-019-00398-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Tao10aSNHG14 promotes the tumorigenesis and metastasis of colorectal cancer through miR-32-5p/SKIL axis  ap. 812-820.  aColorectal cancer (CRC) is regarded as one of the top ten malignant cancers, which has caused millions of mortalities all over the world. Although advanced therapeutic methods have been employed to treat CRC, the prognosis of CRC patients remains unsatisfactory. Many researchers claimed long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) frequently participate in the development of cancers. Small nucleolar RNA host gene 14 (SNHG14) was proved to play roles in various cancers. Nevertheless, neither biological function nor regulatory mechanism of SNHG14 has been explored in CRC. This investigation is aimed at exploring the role of SNHG14 in CRC. The expression of genes including SNHG14, miR-32-5p, and ski-oncogene-like (SKIL) was measured by RT-qPCR assay. 5-Ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay was employed to measure cell proliferation. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated by transwell assay. Western blot assay was performed to test the protein expression. The binding capacity between miR-32-5p and SNHG14 (or SKIL) was explored by luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. SNHG14 expression is upregulated in CRC cells. Moreover, SNHG14 suppression inhibited the proliferation, metastasis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in CRC cells. miR-32-5p presented lower expression, which was negatively regulated by SNHG14. SKIL could combine with miR-32-5p. The mRNA and protein expression of SKIL was downregulated by SNHG14 knockdown or miR-32-5p overexpression. At last, the inhibitory effect of SNHG14 suppression on proliferation, metastasis, and EMT process was rescued by SKIL overexpression. SNHG14 regulates CRC progression via miR-32-5p/SKIL axis, providing a novel point in treatment of CRC patients.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo.81760814cRegional science fund project of national natural science foundation of China  a81860819cRegional science fund project of national natural science foundation of China  aThe qian family matches the talented person[2016]No.4032cNational High-tech ResearchHigh-level innovative talent training plan of Guizhou (100 levels)  aguizhou people lead [2018] No.3cTCM tumor inheritance and scientific and technological innovation talent base of Guizhou province  aGYZYYFY-BS-2018[10]cDoctor foundation of the first affiliated hospital of guizhou university of traditional Chinese medicine 3aWestern blotting 3abinding capacity 3acarcinogenesis 3acell movement 3acell proliferation 3acolorectal neoplasms 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aluciferase 3amessenger RNA 3ametastasis 3amortality 3anon-coding RNA 3apatients 3aprecipitin tests 3aprognosis 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atherapeutics1 aZhang, Ning1 aWu, Wenyu1 aYang, Bing1 aWang, Jinghui1 aHuang, Wenqi1 aTang, Dongxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0101-28660 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2019 Dec., v. 55, no. 10 p.812-820dSpringer USwJournal:jnl50084x1071-26907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11626-019-00398-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02441naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012900160300002200289520095300311592002801264650002201292650001201314650002001326650003001346650002801376650001601404650001301420650001901433650001901452650001901471650002201490650002901512650003301541650001701574650003701591700002001628700001501648700001501663700002001678700001401698700001801712700001901730773012701749856007401876852000901950655001201959IND60641329620221120072349.0190505e20161024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064132962DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra22669h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAit Ahsaine, H.10aElectronic band structure and visible-light photocatalytic activity of Bi₂WO₆: elucidating the effect of lutetium doping  ap. 101105-101114.  aBismuth tungstate and 5% Lu-doped bismuth tungstate photocatalysts were synthesized by coprecipitation method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area. The effect of lutetium doping on electronic structure was investigated using density functional theory calculations (DFT). The change of morphological and optical band gap was conditioned by lutetium doping.

The photocatalytic mechanism was explained on the basis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), photoluminescence (PL) spectra, active trapping measurements and optoelectronic properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3abismuth 3acoprecipitation 3adensity functional theory 3adielectric spectroscopy 3airradiation 3alutetium 3amethylene blue 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotoluminescence 3areflectance spectroscopy 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aEl jaouhari, A.1 aSlassi, A.1 aEzahri, M.1 aBenlhachemi, A.1 aBakiz, B.1 aGuinneton, F.1 aGavarri, J.-R.0 tRSC advances.g2016 Oct. 24, v. 6, no. 103 p.101105-101114dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra22669h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04031naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245015200159500001900311520261200330592002802942650002502970650001202995650001603007650002103023650002303044650004203067650003603109650001603145650001403161650001203175650002003187650001503207650004203222650001903264650002103283650001503304650002503319700001803344700001603362773012003378856007803498852000903576655001203585IND60729439520221120055322.0210228e20210123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072943952DNAL7 a10.3390/plants100202142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Yuan 10aDynamic Responses of Ascorbate Pool and Metabolism in Lettuce to Light Intensity at Night Time under Continuous Light Provided by Red and Blue LEDs  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo understand the dynamic changes of hydroponic lettuce growth, ascorbate (AsA) pool and metabolism under two different dark period light intensities (LL, 20 μmol·m⁻²·s⁻¹; CL, 200 μmol·m⁻²·s⁻¹) of continuous light and normal light (NL, 0 μmol·m⁻²·s⁻¹) provided by red (R) and blue (B) LEDs, the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, ascorbate pool size, AsA metabolism-related enzyme activities, and H₂O₂ contents of lettuce were measured at 0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, and 72 h after light treatment and the lettuce growth parameters were measured on the 9th day after light treatment. The results showed that compared with the NL, CL treatment for 9 days significantly increased the biomass, dry matter content, and specific leaf weight of lettuce, but had no significant effect on the leaf area and root-to-shoot ratio; LL had no significant effect on lettuce biomass, but it would reduce the root-shoot ratio. Compared with the NL, the AsA content of CL increased significantly within 8 h after light treatment (at the end of first dark period), and then maintained at a relatively stable level with a slight increase; there was no significant difference in AsA contents between NL and LL showing the same circadian rhythm characteristics. Overall, the activities of L-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase (GalLDH), ascorbate peroxidase(APX), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), and glutathione reductase (GR) under CL were the highest among the three treatments, and the differences with the other two treatments reached significant levels at several time points; there was almost no significant difference in the activities of GalLDH, APX, MDHAR, and GR between NL and LL; there was no significant difference in the activities of dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) under different treatments. Compared with the NL, CL caused a sharp decrease of PSⅡ maximal photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) in lettuce within 0–8 h after treatment, which then stabilized at a relatively stable level; the Fv/Fm value under the LL was almost the same as the NL. Except for 32 h, the H₂O₂ content of lettuce under CL was the highest among the three treatments during the entire experimental period, and was significantly higher than that of NL at several time points; the H₂O₂ content of LL was almost the same as NL. In summary, lettuce biomass, AsA contents, AsA metabolism-related enzyme activities, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, and H₂O₂ contents were regulated by the dark period light intensities of continuous light rather than continuous light signals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbate peroxidase 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3acircadian rhythm 3adry matter content 3aglutathione dehydrogenase (ascorbate) 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahydroponics 3aleaf area 3alettuce 3alight intensity 3ametabolism 3amonodehydroascorbate reductase (NADH) 3aphotochemistry 3aroot shoot ratio 3ascotophase 3aspecific leaf weight1 aZha, Lingyan 1 aLiu, Wenke 0 tPlants.g2021 Jan. 23, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants100202143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245008800160300001800248500001500266520136300281592002801644650001601672650001701688650001801705650002301723650002501746650000801771650001801779650001401797650001901811650001001830650002501840650000701865650002001872650001601892650002201908651001001930653001901940700001201959700001901971700001301990700002002003700001702023700001302040700001802053700002002071773017702091856007602268852000902344655001202353IND60238161620221119005751.0150617e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023816162DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.0001232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jia-Meng10aNesterenkonia populi sp. nov., an actinobacterium isolated from Populus euphratica   ap. 1474-1479.  a2019-12-05  aAn alkaliphilic and moderately halophilic actinobacterium, designated strain GP10-3 ᵀ, was isolated from Populus euphratica collected from the southern edge of Taklimakan desert, Xinjiang, China. Cells of this strain were Gram-stain-positive, non-motile and non-spore-forming short rods. Strain GP10-3 ᵀ grew optimally at 37 °C on LB agar media in the presence of 5–10 % (w/v) NaCl at pH 9.0. The menaquinones were MK-7, MK-8 and MK-9. The major fatty acids (>10 %) were anteiso-C ₁₇ : ₀, anteiso-C ₁₅ : ₀ and iso-C ₁₆ : ₀. The peptidoglycan type was variation A4α, l -Lys- l -Glu. The polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycolipid, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, glycolipid and an unidentified phospholipid. The DNA G+C content was 67.4 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that strain GP10-3 ᵀ belonged to the genus Nesterenkonia , sharing 94.6–96.9 % sequence similarity with the type strains of species within this genus with validly published names. Based on the evidence of the polyphasic taxonomic study, strain GP10-3 ᵀ represents a novel species of the genus Nesterenkonia , for which the name Nesterenkonia populi sp. nov. is proposed.

Here, we aimed to evaluate the changes in soil C and N stocks in livestock areas under pasture reclamation and contribute to the empirical basis for evaluating the ABC Plan. Based on the assessment of six chronosequences across Brazilian Cerrado, we observed that the effects of management practices for pasture reclamation on soil C and N stocks in livestock areas were quite variable. Any general tendencies depend on the depth evaluated. At the 0–30 cm soil layer, pasture areas under reclamation in Brazilian Cerrado showed an average soil C change rate of 0.47 Mg C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹. However, for the more in-depth assessment (0–100 cm), the adoption of management practices for pasture reclamation did not affect the average rate of soil C changes for these areas. In this sense, we suggest that an up-scaling from single case studies may lead to overestimations of soil C inventories. Thefore, ABC Plan must review some of its approaches based on general values and extrapolations regarding C sequestration in pasture areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aagricultural management 3acarbon 3acerrado 3aenvironmental policy 3alivestock 3apastures 3asoil 3aBrazil 0aSoil C 0apasture reclamation 0agreenhouse gases 0aBrazilian iNDC 0asoil organic matter 0aABC Plan1 aOliveira, Dener Márcio da Silva1 aFreitas, Rita de Cassia Alves de1 aBarreto, Matheus Sampaio1 aAlmeida, Rodrigo Estevam Munhoz de1 aBatista, Rafael Butke1 aCerri, Carlos Eduardo Pellegrino0 tCarbon management.g2021 Sept. 3, v. 12, no. 5 p.499-508dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2218x1758-30127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17583004.2021.19773903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03580naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245013800158300001800296520190000314592002802214650001902242650000802261650001302269650001802282650000902300650001602309650001402325650000902339650001702348650001402365650001602379650002502395650000702420650003002427650001402457650001902471650001802490650002002508650001902528650001102547650001602558651001602574700001802590700001502608700001802623700002102641700002002662700001902682700001902701700002002720773017702740856007602917852000902993655001203002IND60238161720221119005515.0150617e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023816172DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.0001242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Heeji10aAnaerosolibacter carboniphilus gen. nov., sp. nov., a strictly anaerobic iron-reducing bacterium isolated from coal-contaminated soil  ap. 1480-1485.  aA strictly anaerobic, mesophilic, iron-reducing bacterial strain, IRF19 ᵀ, was isolated from coal-contaminated soil in the Republic of Korea. IRF19 ᵀ cells were straight, rod-shaped, Gram-staining-negative and motile by means of flagella. The optimum pH and temperature for their growth were determined to be pH 7.5–8.0 and 40 °C, while the optimum range was pH 6.5–10.0 and 20–45 °C, respectively. Strain IRF19 ᵀ did not require NaCl for growth but it tolerated up to 2 % (w/v). Growth was observed with yeast extract, d -glucose, d -fructose, d -ribose, d -mannitol, d -mannose, l -serine, l -alanine and l -isoleucine. Fe(III), elemental sulfur, thiosulfate and sulfate were used as electron acceptors. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain IRF19 ᵀ is affiliated to the family Clostridiaceae and is most closely related to Salimesophilobacter vulgaris Zn2 ᵀ (93.5 % similarity), Geosporobacter subterraneus VNs68 ᵀ (93.2 %) and Thermotalea metallivorans B2-1 ᵀ (92.3 %).

The major respiratory quinone of strain IRF19 ᵀ was menaquinone MK-5 (V-H ₂). The main polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, an unknown phospholipid and two unknown polar lipids. The G+C content of the genomic DNA of strain IRF19 ᵀ was determined to be 37.4 mol%.

The results indicated that drought consistently reduced the growing-season mean SR, especially during the period of drought treatment, while heat wave, alone or when combined with drought, had little effect on SR. The decreased SR under drought at the intra-annual timescale could be primarily attributable to restriction of low soil moisture to microbial biomass, as there were no consistent changes in plant community (aboveground biomass, richness and abundance). In contrast, the inter-annual variation in SR was positively related to plant community abundance, richness and aboveground biomass in additional to soil water availability, but was not significantly affected by microbial biomass. Our study highlighted that incorporating microbial biomass in C cycling models can improve simulation of seasonal dynamics of soil respiration while incorporating plant community characteristics can benefit prediction of variation in SR across multiple years in semiarid grasslands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3acarbon 3aclimate 3adrought 3agrasslands 3agrowing season 3aheat 3amicrobial biomass 3aplant available water 3aplant communities 3aprediction 3asoil respiration 0aCarbon cycling 0aHeat wave 0aRespiration 0aSoil moisture 0aTimescale1 aQian, Ruyan1 aWang, Weijin1 aKang, Xiaoming1 aRan, Qinwei1 aZheng, Zhenzhen1 aZhang, Biao1 aXu, Cong1 aChe, Rongxiao1 aDong, Junfu1 aXu, Zhihong1 aCui, Xiaoyong1 aHao, Yanbin1 aWang, Yanfen0 tGeoderma.g2020 Nov. 15, v. 378 p.114629-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.1146293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03365naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002800144245013600172500001900308520166500327592002801992650002202020650001602042650002502058650001702083650001502100650002802115650001202143650002102155650001602176650001402192650001602206650001002222650001902232650002302251650002102274650001702295650002002312650001502332650004302347650001202390650002002402650001802422650001202440650002502452650001702477650002102494700002802515700003002543700001902573773012002592856007802712852000902790655001202799IND60729439820221120070324.0210228e20210123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072943982DNAL7 a10.3390/plants100202162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIgnat, Maria  Valentina10aPlants of the Spontaneous Flora with Beneficial Action in the Management of Diabetes, Hepatic Disorders, and Cardiovascular Disease  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe current pharmacological agents advised for the management of diabetes as well as cardiovascular and hepatic diseases are subject to numerous studies for safety and efficacy. Therefore, it is worth looking into alternative therapeutic aids such as natural products of medicinal plants. By a broad review of in vitro and in vivo studies on the various dandelion, chicory, and mulberry extracts, this work highlights their bioactive compounds and therapeutic action when used as a prevention and management aid in public health such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hepatic disorders like non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Natural products of dandelion leaves and root extracts can suppress the development of liver cancer, decrease insulin resistance, and suppress total triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Recent studies on mulberry leaves extracts indicated that they could decrease palmitic acid-induced lipotoxicity, increase total cholesterol and bile acid excretion, improve superoxide dismutase expression, and improve insulin resistance. Chicory root extracts boost satiety, reverse insulin resistance, and augment lipid metabolism thanks to their contents in chicoric acid, chlorogenic acid, and polysaccharides. Taraxacum officinale L., Morus nigra L., and Cichorium intybus L. present hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hypolipidemic, and hypoglycemic activities and are shown to be advantageous in the management of obesity, dyslipidemia, Type 2 diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases. These plants are commonly available in the European spontaneous flora and more attention could be paid to their natural products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCichorium intybus 3aMorus nigra 3aTaraxacum officinale 3aantioxidants 3abile acids 3acardiovascular diseases 3achicory 3achlorogenic acid 3acholesterol 3aexcretion 3afatty liver 3aflora 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainsulin resistance 3alipid metabolism 3alipotoxicity 3aliver neoplasms 3amulberries 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3apolysaccharides 3apublic health 3asatiety 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atherapeutics 3atriacylglycerols1 aColdea, Teodora  Emilia1 aSalanță, Liana  Claudia1 aMudura, Elena 0 tPlants.g2021 Jan. 23, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants100202163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012600168300001600294520146900310592002801779650001201807650001501819650001601834650001101850650002601861650001801887650001801905650001601923650002101939650002101960653001801981653002601999653001402025653001702039653003102056700001602087700001502103700001502118700001502133773009802148856008502246852000902331655001202340IND60634670720221122225543.0200330e20190715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063467072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2019.03.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Difang10aCo-biodrying of sewage sludge and organic fraction of municipal solid waste: A thermogravimetric assessment of the blends  ap. 652-660.  aThis study investigated the thermogravimetric properties of sewage sludge and organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) during their co-biodrying at different fractions. Sewage sludge and OFMSW were co-biodried at the mass proportion of 0%, 42.5% and 85% (of the total wet weight), respectively, with 15% cornstalk as the bulking agent. Results show that of these three raw materials, OFMSW exhibited the lowest ignition temperature and the highest burnout temperature. Moreover, OFMSW had a better comprehensive combustion performance (S) than sewage sludge. Blending OFMSW, sewage sludge and cornstalk showed the highest S value (4.0 × 10⁻⁷%² min⁻² °C⁻³). In addition, there existed certain interactions between the co-combustion process, especially at high temperature stage. The burning characteristics, including ignition performance, burnout efficiency, DTGₘₐₓ and S increased with fluctuations in the first 6–9 days of co-biodrying process, and then declined in all treatments. Hence, 15-day of biodrying made the product with poor burning behavior (S value of 1.0 × 10⁻⁷–1.4 × 10⁻⁷%² min⁻² °C⁻³). More importantly, the optimal combustion performance was observed when co-biodrying the same amount (42.5%) of sewage sludge and OFMSW with the peak of 8.3 × 10⁻⁷%² min⁻² °C⁻³ achieved on day 9. In addition, the blends were easier to burn after the biodrying process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburning 3acombustion 3acorn stover 3amixing 3amunicipal solid waste 3araw materials 3asewage sludge 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3awaste management 0aSewage sludge 0aMunicipal solid waste 0aCornstalk 0aCo-biodrying 0aThermogravimetric property1 aLuo, Wenhai1 aLiu, Yifei1 aYuan, Jing1 aLi, Guoxue0 tWaste management.g2019 July 15, v. 95 p.652-660dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2019.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245008400170500001900254520158800273592002801861650001901889650002101908650001201929650001601941650002301957650001501980650001601995650001602011650001602027650002202043650001202065653001602077653003902093653000902132653003002141700002402171700002002195700001902215700001602234773009602250856008702346852000902433655001202442IND60706564120221119035542.0200907e20201115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070656412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.1146282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAchor, Samuel10aResponse of organic acid-mobilized heavy metals in soils to biochar application  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMicrocosm experiments were conducted to examine the chemical behaviour of selected heavy metals in the co-presence of biochar and low-molecular-weight organic acids. The results showed that except for Cd under citric acid treatment where the added biochar did not have effects on inhibiting the release of soil-borne Cd, the biochar could partially impede LMWOA-driven mobilization of soil-borne Cd, Cu and Pb. The reduction of LMWOA-driven mobilization of the heavy metals was in the range of 17–31% for Cd in malic acid treatment, 22–65% for Cd in the oxalic acid treatment, 11–36% for Cu in the citric acid treatment, 21–39% for Cu in the malic acid treatment, and 0–19% for Cu in the oxalic acid treatment. Biochar was only effective for Pb in citric acid treatment with a reduction rate of about 16%. Under the set experimental conditions, the soil pH remained <5 after biochar addition except for Cd in malic and oxalic acid treatments. This caused protonation of biochar surfaces and consequently disabled the biochar or reduced the capacity of biochar to adsorb cationic metals. It is likely that the liming effect of biochar played a more important role in the inhibition of LMWOA-driven mobilization of the heavy metals. The findings obtained from this study have implications for optimizing remediation methods for reducing uptake of soil-borne heavy metals by vegetables using biochar as a soil conditioner. However, the cost-effectiveness of using a high biochar application rate to achieve the remediation goal needs to be evaluated before a decision is made.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid treatment 3aapplication rate 3abiochar 3acitric acid 3acost effectiveness 3amalic acid 3aoxalic acid 3aprotonation 3aremediation 3asoil conditioners 3asoil pH 0aHeavy metal 0aLow-molecular-weight organic acids 0aSoil 0aEnvironmental remediation1 aAravis, Charalambos1 aHeaney, Natalie1 aOdion, Ebhohon1 aLin, Chuxia0 tGeoderma.g2020 Nov. 15, v. 378 p.114628-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.1146283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01157naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002300154245004100177300001600218520034800234592002800582650001300610650001100623650002200634650001000656773015900666856005700825852000900882655001200891IND4480346920221119144252.0120418e197708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448034692DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-8489.1977.tb00200.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGriffith, Garry R.12aA note on the pig cycle in Australia  ap. 130-139.  aSpectral analysis is used to test hypotheses relating to regular four‐year cycles in the Australian pig industry.

In this study, the effect of wounding on suberin, endogenous hormones and their metabolic genes expression was observed during the wound healing of kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis Planch.). In addition, the role of abscisic acid (ABA) in wound suberisation was investigated by analysing the coordinated regulation between ABA and other hormones. The wound healing process in kiwifruit could be divided into two stages including: (1) initial accumulation of suberin polyphenolic (SPP) and long carbon chain suberin polyaliphatic monomers (LSPA) before 24h; and (2) massive synthesis of SPP and very long carbon chain suberin polyaliphatic monomers (VLSPA) after 24h. ABA content rapidly increased and induced the jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis at the early stage of wound healing. ABA level gradually decreased with the expression of AchCYP707A genes, while the contents of trans-zeatin (t-ZT) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) steadily increased at the late stage of wound healing. Exogenous ABA stimulated JA and suberin monomers accumulation, but suppressed both t-ZT and IAA biosynthesis. The role of ABA in wound healing of kiwifruit might be involved in the coordination of both JA-mediated suberin monomers biosynthesis and t-ZT- and IAA-mediated formation of suberised cells via an interaction mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinidia chinensis 3aabscisic acid 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3acytokinins 3aindole acetic acid 3ajasmonic acid 3akiwifruit 3asuberin 3asuberization 0aindole-3-acetic acid 0atrans-zeatin 0awound healing1 aWei, Xiaopeng1 aGuan, Weiliang1 aMao, Linchun1 aIrving, Helen0 tFunctional plant biology.g2021, v. 48, no. 11 p.1100-1112dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl70735x1445-44087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP203603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245009300168300001600261520121300277592002801490650001601518650001001534650001501544650001601559650001801575650001601593650001801609650001301627650001301640650001901653650001601672650001401688650001501702653002901717653002601746653002501772653003001797653001201827773015201839856007801991852000902069655001202078IND60522842320221119043658.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052284232DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1991-7-8072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez-Figueroa, F.10aControl by Light Quality of Chlorophyll Synthesis in the Brown Alga Desmarestia aculeata  ap. 542-548.  aThe chlorophyll synthesis in the brown algae Desmarestia aculeata is affected by light quality and by the nutrient state in the medium before the illumination. Pulses of 5 min of red, green and blue light together with 200 μM nitrate in plants growing under natural conditions deter­ mined similar induction of chlorophyll synthesis. However, when the plants were incubated previously under starvation conditions the light effect was different. The induction of chlorophyll synthesis was greater after blue and green light than after red light pulses. Red-light photoreceptor was only involved in the chlorophyll synthesis under no nutrient limitations and under starvation conditions after previous illumination with blue light followed by far-red light. The induction of chlorophyll synthesis by green and blue light pulses applied together with nitrate was greater when the algae were incubated in starvation conditions than in natural conditions (normal nutrient state).Because all light effects were partially reversed by far-red light the involvement of a phyto-chrome-like photoreceptor is proposed. In addition, a coaction between blue-and a green-light photoreceptors and phytochrome is suggested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDesmarestia 3aalgae 3ablue light 3achlorophyll 3afar-red light 3agreen light 3alight quality 3alighting 3anitrates 3aphotoreceptors 3aphytochrome 3ared light 3astarvation 0aBlue-Light Photoreceptor 0aChlorophyll Synthesis 0aDesmarestia aculeata 0aGreen-Light Photoreceptor 0aNitrate0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 46, no. 7-8 p.542-548dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1991-7-8073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001700171245011900188300001600307520100600323592002801329650001901357650002701376650001801403650002101421650001401442650000701456650001501463650001501478650002501493650001101518650003001529650003801559650001601597650001801613650003101631650002101662650002201683650001301705650001601718650001701734650002601751650001601777650003201793653001301825653002601838653003001864653003001894700001501924700001601939773010601955856008702061852000902148655001202157IND50069089220221120225226.0190409e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006908922DNAL7 a239482672pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2013.07.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLing, Jiayin10aEnhancement of lipid productivity of Rhodosporidium toruloides in distillery wastewater by increasing cell density  ap. 301-309.  aThis study is to improve the process of producing lipid convertible to biodiesel, from distillery wastewater while simultaneously removing organics and nutrients efficiently by inoculating oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides in the presence of indigenous microorganisms.

METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into DEXA (DEX), DEXA + RE (DEX-RE), DEXA + LEU (DEX-LEU), and DEXA + RE + LEU (DEX-RE-LEU) groups. Each group received DEXA 5 mg · kg⁻¹ · d⁻¹ for 7 d from drinking water and were pair-fed to the DEX group; LEU-supplemented groups received 0.135 g · kg⁻¹ · d⁻¹ through gavage for 7 d; the RE protocol was based on three sessions of squat-type exercise composed by three sets of 10 repetitions at 70% of maximal voluntary strength capacity. RESULTS: The plantaris mass was significantly greater in both trained groups compared with the non-trained groups. Muscle cross-sectional area and fiber areas did not differ between groups. Both trained groups displayed significant increases in the number of intermediated fibers (IIa/IIx), a decreased number of fast-twitch fibers (IIb), an increased ratio of the proteins phosphoSᵉʳ²⁴⁴⁸/total mammalian target of rapamycin and phosphoᵀʰʳ³⁸⁹/total 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase, and a decreased ratio of phosphoSᵉʳ²⁵³/total Forkhead box protein-3a. Plasma glucose was significantly increased in the DEX-LEU group compared with the DEX group and RE significantly decreased hyperglycemia. The DEX-LEU group displayed decreased glucose transporter-4 translocation compared with the DEX group and RE restored this response. LEU supplementation worsened insulin sensitivity and did not attenuate muscle wasting in rats treated with DEXA. Conversely, RE modulated glucose homeostasis and fiber type transition in the plantaris muscle. CONCLUSION: Resistance exercise but not LEU supplementation promoted fiber type transition and improved glucose homeostasis in DEXA-treated rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood glucose 3adrinking water 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3aexercise 3aglucose 3aglucose transporters 3ahomeostasis 3ahyperglycemia 3ainsulin resistance 3aleucine 3amuscles 3amuscular atrophy 3arats 3aribosomal proteins 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aDexamethasone 2aDietary Supplements 2aGlucose Transporter Type 4xmetabolism 2aHyperglycemiaxmetabolismxprevention & control. 2aInsulin Resistancexphysiology 2aLeucinexpharmacology 2aMale 2aMovementxphysiology 2aMuscle Strengthxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMuscle, Skeletalxanatomy & histologyxcytologyxphysiology. 2aMuscular Atrophyxchemically inducedxmetabolismxprevention & control. 2aPhysical Conditioning, Animalxphysiology 2aRandom Allocation 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aResistance Training 2aRibosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDaxmetabolism1 aZanchi, Nelo E.1 ada Luz, Claudia R.1 ade Moraes, Wilson M.A.M.1 aRamona, Pamella1 ade Siqueira Filho, Mario A.1 aChaves, Daniela F.S.1 aMedeiros, Alessandra1 aBrum, Patrícia C.1 aDardevet, Dominique1 aLancha, Antonio H., Jr.cJr.0 tNutrition.g2012 Apr., v. 28, no. 4 p.465-471dElsevier Inc.x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2011.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02094naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245008000169500001900249520119700268592002801465650001101493650001701504650001701521650002001538650001701558700002201575773012001597856007801717852000901795655001201804IND60729440220210525000000.0210228e20210123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072944022DNAL7 a10.3390/plants100202202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIzzo, Luigi  Gennaro10aRoot Tropisms: New Insights Leading the Growth Direction of the Hidden Half  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTropisms are essential responses of plants, orienting growth according to a wide range of stimuli. Recently, considerable attention has been paid to root tropisms, not only to improve cultivation systems, such as those developed for plant-based life support systems for future space programs, but also to increase the efficiency of root apparatus in water and nutrient uptake in crops on Earth. To date, the Cholodny–Went theory of differential auxin distribution remains the principal tropistic mechanism, but recent findings suggest that it is not generally applicable to all root tropisms, and new molecular pathways are under discussion. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms and functions underlying root tropisms is needed. Contributions to this special issue aimed to embrace reviews and research articles that deepen molecular, physiological, and anatomical processes orchestrating root tropisms from perception of the stimulus to bending. The new insights will help in elucidating plant–environment interactions, providing potential applications to improve plant growth on Earth and in space where microgravity diminishes or nullifies the gravitropism dominance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aauxins 3agravitropism 3amicrogravity 3anutrient uptake 3aplant growth1 aAronne, Giovanna 0 tPlants.g2021 Jan. 23, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants100202203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03908naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245014000168500001900308520223900327592002802566650001102594650001402605650001002619650001302629650001202642650001602654650001002670650002002680650002902700650001202729650001502741650001102756650001602767650001302783650001902796650000902815650001602824650002002840650003302860650001102893650001202904650001202916650001802928650000902946651001202955653001902967653001602986653002203002700001803024700002303042700002903065700002003094773009603114856008703210852000903297655001203306IND60706564320221119035614.0200907e20201115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070656432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.1146352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaal, Joeri10aOrigin of dissolved organic matter in the Harz Mountains (Germany): A thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM-GC–MS) study  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEnvironmental change is increasing the concentration of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in catchments of the Northern Hemisphere. This study aims to assess the causes of high DOM concentrations in streams and reservoirs of the Harz National Park (Germany), by means of molecular characterization using thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM-GC–MS). In order to formulate proxies of the prevailing origin of the numerous THM products of polyphenols, carbohydrates, proteins, aliphatic macromolecules, resins and other DOM precursors, we created a reference sample set of potential sources (spruce, birch, blueberry, heather, peat moss, soils) from the area. Besides solid-state reference samples (bulk organic matter; BOM) we obtained and analyzed their leachates (water-extractable OM; WEOM). Finally, an existing THM-GC–MS dataset of the DOM from the Oder river, which crosses the boundary between peat and forest biomes in the Harz, was extended and explored chemometrically using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to test the proxies for stream DOM assessment. The results show large differences between BOM and WEOM, which suggests that the solid-to-leachate transition is highly selective or significantly alters the major biomolecular constituents. THM compounds that tend to be more abundant in WEOM than in BOM are G-type phenolic compounds (1,2-dimethoxybenzenes, from lignin and tannin), nitrogen-containing moieties and benzene carboxylic acids, whereas WEOM is depleted in products of polysaccharides, syringyl lignin and aliphatic macromolecules (cutin and suberin). The lignin fingerprint of the WEOM also differs significantly from that of BOM, being depleted in the vast majority of the typical products of macromolecular lignin (G7, G8, G14, G15) and enriched in the acid moiety (G6, predominantly from vanillic acid), especially for spruce wood. THM chromatograms of DOM from the forest section of the Oder show an extraordinary abundance of G6, most probably from spruce-derived lignin. This may indicate a major role of DOM released from decaying spruce logs and forest soils. The results highlight both the potential and the pitfalls associated with source identification of DOM using THM-GC–MS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3aEricaceae 3aPicea 3aSphagnum 3abenzene 3ablueberries 3acutin 3adata collection 3adissolved organic matter 3aforests 3ahydrolysis 3alignin 3amethylation 3amoieties 3anational parks 3apeat 3apolyphenols 3apolysaccharides 3aprincipal component analysis 3arivers 3astreams 3asuberin 3avanillic acid 3awood 3aGermany 0aHarz Mountains 0aTHM-GC–MS 0aSource assessment1 aPlaza, César1 aNierop, Klaas G.J.1 aPérez-Rodríguez, Marta1 aBiester, Harald0 tGeoderma.g2020 Nov. 15, v. 378 p.114635-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.1146353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245009200160300001800252520162600270592002801896650000801924650002101932650001801953650001601971650002501987650000702012650002502019650003002044650001402074650001802088650002202106650002002128650001602148651001602164700001802180700001702198700002002215700002002235773017702255856007602432852000902508655001202517IND60238162220221119004057.0150617e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023816222DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.0001282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWon, Sung-Min10aPseudohalocynthiibacter aestuariivivens gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from a tidal flat  ap. 1509-1514.  aA Gram-stain-negative, non-motile, aerobic and coccoid, ovoid or rod-shaped bacterial strain, designated BS-W9 ᵀ, was isolated from a tidal flat of the South Sea, South Korea. Strain BS-W9 ᵀ grew optimally at 25–30 °C, at pH 7.0–8.0 and in the presence of approximately 2.0 % (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic trees, based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, revealed that strain BS-W9 ᵀ clustered with the type strain of Halocynthiibacter namhaensis , showing a highest sequence similarity of 97.3 %. It exhibited sequence similarity values of less than 95.6 % to the type strains of other species with validly published names. Strain BS-W9 ᵀ contained Q-10 as the predominant ubiquinone and C ₁₈ : ₁ω7 c as the predominant fatty acid. The major polar lipids of strain BS-W9 ᵀ were phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, one unidentified lipid and one unidentified aminolipid. The fatty acid and polar lipid profiles of strain BS-W9 ᵀ were distinguished from those of the type strains of H. namhaensis and other phylogenetically related genera. The DNA G+C content of strain BS-W9 ᵀ was 53.2 mol% and its mean DNA–DNA relatedness value with H. namhaensis RA2-3 ᵀ was 14 %. On the basis of the phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and other phenotypic properties, strain BS-W9 ᵀ is considered to represent a novel genus and species within the family Rhodobacteraceae , for which the name Pseudohalocyntiibacter aestuariivivens gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Pseudohalocyntiibacter aestuariivivens is BS-W9 ᵀ (= KCTC 42348 ᵀ = CECT 8726 ᵀ).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRhodobacteraceae 3achemotaxonomy 3afatty acids 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence homology 3asodium chloride 3aubiquinones 3aSouth Korea1 aPark, Sooyeon1 aPark, Ji-Min1 aKim, Byung-Chan1 aYoon, Jung-Hoon0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2015 May, v. 65, no.

The objective of our study is to develop a series of new spatial metrics to support sustainable development through assessing the direction and magnitude of tourism development support and conflict between groups. We surveyed 317 individuals out of an estimated total population of 3300 using public participation GIS (PPGIS) on Tioman Island, Malaysia. Here we present a first example of how nuances in conflict can be articulated spatially across different levels of attitude toward tourism development within and between different segments of the population. Our results suggest that treating a population as homogeneous risks missing place specific development conflicts between segments of the population and locations of agreement where development can be managed sustainably with the support of the community.  aPublisher supplied data 3acitizen participation 3acorals 3alandscapes 3asustainable development 3atourism 3aMalaysia 0aCoastal management 0aDevelopment preferences 0aPublic participation GIS 0aMalaysia/Southeast Asia 0aCluster analysis1 aVerbrugge, Laura N.H.1 aChelliah, Alvin1 aAng, Michelle Li Ern1 aRaymond, Christopher M.0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2020 Nov., v. 203 p.103902-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.1039023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245012300205506010400328506007600432520128000508592002801788506003701816650001501853650002101868650002001889650002201909650002501931653002101956653000801977653000901985653002001994653001302014653002402027653002002051653001702071653002302088653002502111700002502136773008302161856008202244852000902326655001202335IND60720103320221207113823.0220914s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072010332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mex.2020.1011702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, Xiangrui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7205-072310aOrdinal analysis applied to the results of positive matrix factorization of chemical ionization mass spectrometry data  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAs an innovative analytical approach ordinal analysis is applied to positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis outputs to identify the most important species and factors in chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) data. The procedure and outcome of the ordinal analysis facilitate further automated data analysis. Prior to standard PMF analysis, CIMS data were normalized to assure equal comparisons and facilitate the analysis process. The ordinal analysis was applied to the Factor Profiles (FPs) results, where mass numbers m/z are ranked by their FP fractions. Such ranking seeks the most influential compounds leading each factor, and the top m/z can be further investigated, e.g. by peak assignments. Rank maps can be plotted based on the ordinal results where the FPs are converted into a different space, which can potentially be used for cluster analysis. The rank maps provide an additional method for factor identification, especially when time series or other forms of the dataset are difficult to recognize. • Ordinal analysis identifies the most important fingerprint species leading each factor. • Rank map visualizes the features of each factors. • The method can be used as an online approach for source appointments of atmospheric pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aautomation 3acluster analysis 3adata collection 3amass spectrometry 3atime series analysis 0aOrdinal analysis 0aPMF 0aCIMS 0aFactor analysis 0aRank map 0aAtmospheric science 0aBiomass burning 0aVisulization 0aSource appointment 0aPMF ordinal analysis1 aPettersson, Jan B.C.0 tMethodsX.g2020, v. 7 p.101170-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23402x2215-01617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2020.1011703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245008900170300001600259520158900275592002801864650001201892650002001904650001101924650001001935650002301945650001601968653001601984653001502000653002902015653001702044653002002061700001702081700001802098773008302116856008602199852000902285655001202294IND60561205320221118221401.0170607e20150615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056120532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.03.1142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReguero, B.G.12aA global wave power resource and its seasonal, interannual and long-term variability  ap. 366-380.  aAssessments of global wave power have been receiving increasing attention currently; however, a characterization of the global resources that holistically consider the different temporal scales that influence wave climate (monthly and seasonal, interannual and long-term) is still lacking. Moreover, the debate around the global figure of available resource is still widely open. This study provides a new global wave power assessment using a dataset that covers the period from 1948 to 2008, which was corrected using altimetry data and validated with buoys in terms of wave power. This study characterizes the mean wave power globally as well as its monthly and seasonal variability. Furthermore, it provides a link with the most relevant climate indices globally. The effect of the interannual variability is especially noteworthy for the Northern Hemisphere, where the seasonality is strongest. Additionally, we detect decadal long-term changes and determine that natural variability could explain a few of the differences found between decades. Lastly, we provide an assessment of the global theoretical wave power that covers the last six decades, compare approaches and estimates, and discuss factors of discrepancy. The global offshore wave power is estimated at 32,000TWh/yr, which is reduced to 16,000TWh/yr when considering the direction of the energy. The historical average change is 580TWh/decade. Our results indicate that the global natural variability could be a more relevant factor in the lifetime of wave farms than the historical long-term changes in wave energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adata collection 3aenergy 3afarms 3aseasonal variation 3awater power 0aWave energy 0aWave power 0aInter-annual variability 0aWave climate 0aClimate indices1 aLosada, I.J.1 aMéndez, F.J.0 tApplied energy.g2015 June 15, v. 148 p.366-380dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.03.1143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245008400170300001600254520154700270592002801817650001501845650000901860650001101869650001101880650001701891653003101908653002701939653002601966653002901992653001902021653002202040700001402062700001702076700001702093700001802110773008402128856008602212852000902298655001202307IND60561205420221118221108.0170607e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056120542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.04.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhiguo10aTheoretical and experimental investigation of thermoacoustics transfer function  ap. 131-142.  aThe coupling between unsteady heat release and acoustic perturbations can lead to self-sustained thermoacoustic oscillations, also known as combustion instability. When such combustion instability occurs, the pressure oscillations may become so intense that they can cause engine structural damage and costly mission failure. Thus there is a need to understand the coupling physics between acoustic waves and unsteady combustion and to identify a measure to quantify the interaction between the flame and acoustics. The present work studies linear and nonlinear response of a conical premixed laminar flame to oncoming acoustic disturbances. Unsteady heat release from the flame is assumed to be caused by its surface area variations, which results from the fluctuations of the oncoming flow velocity. The classical G-equation is used to track the flame front variation in real-time. Second-order finite difference method is then used to expand the flame model. Time evolution of the flame surface distortions is successfully captured. To quantify the dynamic response of the flame to the acoustic disturbances, system identification is then conducted to estimate the linear and nonlinear flame transfer function. Good agreement is obtained. Finally, transfer function of an actuated open–open thermoacoustic system is experimentally measured by injecting a broad-band white noise. The present work opens up new applicable way to measure heat-driven acoustics transfer function in a thermoacoustic system by simply implementing white noise.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3aheat 3amodels 3asounds 3asurface area 0aThermoacoustic oscillation 0aCombustion instability 0aSystem identification 0aHeat-to-sound conversion 0aPremixed flame 0aTransfer function1 aZhao, Dan1 aDobriyal, R.1 aZheng, Youqu1 aYang, Wenming0 tApplied energy.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 154 p.131-142dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.04.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03784naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245014100164300001800305520209800323592002802421650003002449650002502479650000802504650001902512650001302531650001202544650001602556650001002572650001702582650002202599650001202621650002002633650001102653650001602664650001502680650002502695650002502720650003002745650001402775650003002789650001802819650001402837650000902851651001102860700002102871700002002892700001702912700001902929773019702948856007603145852000903221655001203230IND60238162520221119003726.0150617e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023816252DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.0001302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrison, Claire M.10aRhizobium metallidurans sp. nov., a symbiotic heavy metal resistant bacterium isolated from the Anthyllis vulneraria Zn-hyperaccumulator  ap. 1525-1530.  aA Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming bacterium (ChimEc512 ᵀ) was isolated from 56 host seedlings of the hyperaccumulating Anthyllis vulneraria legume, which was on an old zinc mining site at Les Avinières, Saint-Laurent-Le-Minier, Gard, South of France. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities, strain ChimEc512 ᵀ was shown to belong to the genus Rhizobium and to be most closely related to Rhizobium endophyticum CCGE 2052 ᵀ (98.4 %), Rhizobium tibeticum CCBAU 85039 ᵀ (98.1 %), Rhizobium grahamii CCGE 502 ᵀ (98.0 %) and Rhizobium mesoamericanum CCGE 501 ᵀ (98.0 %). The phylogenetic relationships of ChimEc512 ᵀ were confirmed by sequencing and analyses of recA and atpD genes. DNA–DNA relatedness values of strain ChimEc512 ᵀ with R. endophyticum CCGE 2052 ᵀ, R. tibeticum CCBAU 85039 ᵀ, R. mesoamericanum CCGE 52 ᵀ, Rhizobium grahamii CCGE 502 ᵀ, Rhizobium etli CCBAU 85039 ᵀ and Rhizobium radiobacter KL09-16-8-2 ᵀ were 27, 22, 16, 18, 19 and 11 %, respectively. The DNA G+C content of strain ChimEc512 ᵀ was 58.9 mol%. The major cellular fatty acid was C18 : 1ω7 c , characteristic of the genus Rhizobium . The polar lipid profile included phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine and moderate amounts of aminolipids, phospholipid and sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol. Although ChimEc512 ᵀ was able to nodulate A. vulneraria , the nodC and nifH genes were not detected by PCR. The rhizobial strain was tolerant to high concentrations of heavy metals: up to 35 mM Zn and up to 0.5 mM Cd and its growth kinetics was not impacted by Zn. The results of DNA–DNA hybridizations and physiological tests allowed genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of strain ChimEc512 ᵀ from species of the genus Rhizobium with validly published names. Strain ChimEc512 ᵀ, therefore, represents a novel species, for which the name Rhizobium metallidurans sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain ChimEc512 ᵀ (= DSM 26575 = CIP 110550 ᵀ).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aAnthyllis vulneraria 3aDNA 3aRhizobium etli 3abacteria 3acadmium 3afatty acids 3agenes 3aheavy metals 3ahyperaccumulators 3alegumes 3ametal tolerance 3amining 3anew species 3anodulation 3anucleotide sequences 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3aseedlings 3azinc 3aFrance1 aJackson, Stephen1 aMerlot, Sylvain1 aDobson, Alan1 aGrison, Claude0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2015 May, v. 65, no.

The adsorption rate and saturation level to PL were greatest for RBIDF-2.0 (modified with 2.0% H2SO4 + 1.25% KOH), which had the highest specific surface area and oil holding capacity. The conformational deformation of unbound PL in the supernatant of PL-RBIDF confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) suggested that not only bound but also unbound PL activities were altered. Free energy calculations using data from fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that binding of PL to fibre depends primarily on electrostatic interactions, and the binding process is spontaneous and exothermic. This study indicates that dietary intake of cellulosic fractions of rice bran may be useful in reducing the bioavailability of dietary fat by altering the conformation and activity of PL that might be useful to control obesity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aadsorption 3abioavailability 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adeformation 3adietary fat 3adietary fiber 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afood intake 3aheat production 3aobesity 3aoils 3aphysicochemical properties 3apotassium hydroxide 3arice bran 3asulfuric acid 3asurface area 3aswine 3atriacylglycerol lipase 0aRice bran 0aInsoluble dietary fibre 0aPhysicochemical properties 0aLipase 0aCircular dichroism 0aConformation 0aSulfuric acid (PubChem CID: 1118) 0aPotassium hydroxide (PubChem CID: 14797) 0aSodium hydroxide (PubChem CID: 14798) 0aMonosodium phosphate (PubChem CID: 23672064) 0aDisodium hydrogen phosphate (PubChem CID: 24203) 0aPorcine pancreatic lipase (PubChem CID: 54603431) 0an-hexane (PubChem CID: 8058) 0apolyvinyl alcohol (PubChem CID: 11199) 0aphenolphthalein (PubChem CID: 4764)1 aLi, Yue1 aYokoyama, Wallace1 aMajeed, Hamid1 aMasamba, Kingsley George1 aZhong, Fang1 aMa, Jianguo0 tJournal of functional foods.g2015 Dec., v. 19 p.39-48dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2015.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03435naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245013800204300002000342520174700362592002802109650002202137650003702159650001102196650001202207650001202219650001102231650001402242650001702256650001102273650001802284650002102302650002202323650002102345650001402366650001102380650002202391650000702413650001702420650002302437650001402460700002002474700002502494700001802519700002702537700001802564700002302582700006102605773013802666856008002804852000902884655001202893IND60606716220221120193738.0180727e20180702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060671622DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b028082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmiri, Mandana1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8789-569210aSolution Processable Cu(II)macrocycle for the Formation of Cu2O Thin Film on Indium Tin Oxide and Its Application for Water Oxidation  ap. 16510-16518.  aThe development of efficient water oxidation catalytic interfaces has become a demanding challenge to fulfill the promise of water splitting for clean energy conversion and storage. The present work reports on the use of a Cu²⁺-macrocycle, formed by the interaction of copper perchlorate hexahydrate with ethylenediamine and 1,4-bis(2-carboxyaldehyde phenoxy)butane, as precursors for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on anode. In alkaline solution, using potassium borate electrolyte (pH 12.0) as electrolyte, the catalytic onset potential was less than 0.80 V, reflecting an overpotential of 524 mV for a catalytic current density of 1 mA cm–². The OER activity was much higher when compared to Cu²⁺ (e.g., Cu(OAc)₂), which converts under these conditions into OER inactive Cu(OH)₂ precipitate in solution. The interest of this complex is that it can be used as homogeneous OER catalyst but can be in addition electrochemically deposited on electrode materials, where it maintained its robust electrocatalytic activity for the OER. Surface-supported thin catalytic film was grown on glassy carbon and indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes upon the application of a potential of 1.1 V for 5 h. X-ray diffraction (XRD) as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicate the preferential formation of Cu₂O. Remarkably, under applied anodic potential of 1.1 V vs SCE, the ITO/Cu₂O anode efficiently catalyze water oxidation by evolving oxygen. The overpotential was determined as 400 mV vs NHE at 1 mA cm–². This anode maintained a current density of about 5.1 mA cm–² for 5 h with a recession of about 11%. In addition, the same ITO/Cu₂O anode could be used for several OER experiments without loss of activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aanodes 3aborates 3abutanes 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3aclean energy 3acopper 3acuprous oxide 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy conversion 3aindium tin oxide 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 3apH 3aperchlorates 3aphysical chemistry 3apotassium1 aFallahi, Maryam1 aBezaatpour, Abolfazl1 aJijie, Roxana1 aNozari-asbmarz, Mehran1 aRouhi, Maryam1 aBoukherroub, Rabah1 aSzunerits, Sabine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1567-49430 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 July 02, v. 122, no. 29 p.16510-16518dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b028083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01793naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245007400159300001600233520077300249592002801022650001301050650001001063650001201073650001101085650001601096651001201112651001101124651000901135653001201144653001301156653001701169653001601186653001801202653000901220773009601229856007301325852000901398655001201407IND60564716020221119050941.0170318e20160524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056471602DNAL7 a10.3417/20150092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPringle, James S.10aNew South American Species of Gentiana and Gentianella (Gentianaceae)  ap. 389-398.  aThe new species Gentiana woodii J.

This is driven by the rising interest in the use of hydrogen blends and syngas in combined cycle power plants, as an alternative to standard natural gas. Typical applications where such mixtures are used include the recycling of hydrogen by-product from industry as well as promising pre-combustion carbon capture methods like fuel reforming or gasification integrated with gas turbine combined cycle plants. Syngas is mainly a mixture of H2, CO and CH4; its composition can vary due to fluctuations in the process’s conditions but can also dramatically change if the feedstock is modified like coal or biomass grades in gasification. Due to the substantially different chemical, transport and thermal properties that distinguish the syngas components, especially H2, when compared with conventional hydrocarbon fuels, these non-standard fuels pose several challenges in premixed combustion. These challenges are reviewed in this paper along with the combustion fundamentals of these fuels. A survey of available technologies able to handle syngas and hydrogen-rich fuel in general is provided reflecting the difficulties encountered while using these fuels in real large scale commercial applications. We find that a limited number of options exist today for fully premixed combustion, but promising designs are under development. Finally, the ever growing use of numerical simulation to cost-effectively study full scale combustion systems—with Large Eddy Simulations (LES) being at the forefront as a compromise between accuracy and computational cost—justifies the simultaneous review of the different numerical attempts to simulate hydrogen-containing fuel mixtures and syngas in premixed combustion. Challenges specific to performing LES calculations for these reacting flows are highlighted. We find that, while the literature on premixed LES methane combustion is abundant, LES of premixed syngas and hydrogen-rich fuels combustion is comparatively scarce. Only few attempts were made so far showing the need for more research effort in this area to help tackle the challenges presented by these fuels.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3acarbon monoxide 3acoal 3acombustion 3aemissions 3afeedstocks 3agasification 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3anatural gas 3apower plants 3arecycling 3asimulation models 3asurveys 3asynthesis gas 3athermal properties 0aPremixed combustion 0aFuel flexibility 0aGas turbines 0aHydrogen-rich fuels 0aCombustion instabilities 0aLarge eddy simulations1 aVogiatzaki, K.1 aAlzahrani, F.M.1 aMokheimer, E.M.A.1 aHabib, M.A.1 aGhoniem, A.F.0 tApplied energy.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 154 p.1020-1047dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.04.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02140naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245006300171500001900234520102900253592002801282650001901310650001501329650000901344650001901353650001501372650002301387651001201410653003001422653001301452653003101465653001701496653002501513700001901538773011001557856009001667852000901757655001201766IND60706589820221123031136.0200907e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070658982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.1039092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeely, John10aBlue-green or grey, how much is the public willing to pay?  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFlood reduction infrastructure is a vital aspect of many urban and peri-urban areas. To date, the majority of flood reduction projects use traditional “grey” materials and techniques. However, the use of blue-green infrastructures (BGI) is becoming more popular. This paper explores residents’ preferences for BGI or grey infrastructure projects to reduce flood risk. A discrete choice experiment using a split sample methodology was employed to determine if residents of the Carlingford Lough catchment in Ireland prefer either type of infrastructure to reduce flood risk. A random parameter logit was applied to the data. The results reveal that for the average person, they have a preference for flood risk reduction resulting in a flooding event once every 25 years rather than once every five years. The average respondent also holds a preference for BGI based solutions as opposed to a grey infrastructure solution. However, respondent living in a flood-prone area show no greater preference for a BGI solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainfrastructure 3alandscapes 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3awatersheds 3awillingness to pay 3aIreland 0aBlue-green Infrastructure 0aFlooding 0aDiscrete choice experiment 0aSplit sample 0aNon-market valuation1 aHynes, Stephen0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2020 Nov., v. 203 p.103909-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.1039093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001300137245019600150300001800346520154900364592002801913650002001941650001201961650001401973650001601987650002202003650001502025650001702040650003502057650001302092650002002105653003202125653001102157653003302168653002002201653003102221653001502252653001302267653002502280700001702305700001202322700002102334700001602355700001602371700001902387773011602406856007202522852000902594655001202603IND60754058120221120222249.0211021s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075405812DNAL7 a10.1071/FP210312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Qi10aPhosphorus and selenium uptake, root morphology, and carboxylates in the rhizosheath of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) as affected by localised phosphate and selenite supply in a split-root system  ap. 1161-1174.  aLow availability of phosphorus (P) is a key limiting factor for the growth of many crops. Selenium (Se) is a nutrient for humans that is acquired predominantly from plants. Localised P and Se supply may affect P- and Se-uptake efficiency. Our aim was to examine the mechanisms of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) to acquire P and Se when the elements are heterogeneously or homogeneously distributed in soil, and how P and Se supply affect plant growth and uptake of P and Se. We conducted a split-root experiment growing alfalfa in a loess soil with two distribution patterns (i.e. heterogeneous and homogeneous) of P and Se. The application rates of P (KH2PO4) and Se (Na2SeO3) were 0 and 20mgPkg−1, and 0 and 1mgSekg−1, respectively. Our results showed that plants absorbed more Se when both P and Se were supplied homogeneously than when supplied heterogeneously. Supplying Se had a positive effect on plant P content. Localised P supply resulted in the exudation of more carboxylates by roots than homogeneous P supply did. Soil microbial biomass P was significantly greater when P was supplied homogeneously. Shoot-to-root translocation of Se had a positive effect on P-uptake efficiency. These results indicated that, compared with homogeneous P supply, localised P supply promoted P and Se uptake by increasing the amount of rhizosheath carboxylates and weakening the competition between roots and microbes. Translocation of Se within plant organs was promoted by the application of P, thus enhancing the P-uptake efficiency of alfalfa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3aexudation 3aloess soils 3amicrobial biomass 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3apotassium dihydrogen phosphate 3aselenium 3asodium selenite 0aheterogeneous fertilisation 0alegume 0aphosphorus-uptake efficiency 0aroot morphology 0aselenium-uptake efficiency 0asplit root 0atartrate 0atranslocation factor1 aZhang, Zekun1 aSu, Rui1 aZhang, Xingchang1 aLambers, H.1 aHe, Honghua1 aCavagnaro, Tim0 tFunctional plant biology.g2021, v. 48, no. 11 p.1161-1174dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl70735x1445-44087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP210313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03717naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005800144245010500202300001800307520189500325592002802220650001902248650001902267650002102286650001502307650001602322650001002338650002302348650001202371650001302383650000902396650001102405650002402416650002902440650001402469650002302483650001102506653002002517653001202537653001702549653001502566700005902581700005902640700005602699700005402755700001402809700005402823700005502877773015502932856007903087852000903166655001203175IND60706564820221119035419.0200913e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070656482DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2019-171032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Connor, A.H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1864-096810aAssociating mobility scores with production and reproductive performance in pasture-based dairy cows  ap. 9238-9249.  aLameness in dairy cows can have significant effects on cow welfare, farm profitability, and the environment. To determine the economic and environmental consequences of lameness, we first need to quantify its effect on performance. The objective of this study, therefore, was to determine the associations of various production and reproductive performance measurements (including milk, fat, and protein yield, somatic cell count, calving interval, cow death, or cow slaughter), and mobility scores in spring-calving, pasture-based dairy cows. We collected mobility scores (0 = good, 1 = imperfect, 2 = impaired, and 3 = severely impaired mobility), body condition scores, and production data for 11,116 cows from 68 pasture-based dairy herds. Linear mixed modeling was used to determine the associations between specific mobility scores and milk, fat and protein yield, and somatic cell count and calving interval. Binomial logistic regression was used to determine the association between mobility score and cow death, or slaughter. Significant yield losses of up to 1.4% of the average yield were associated with mobility score 2 and yield losses of up to 4.7% were associated with mobility score 3 during the early scoring period. Elevated somatic cell count was associated with all levels of suboptimal mobility during the late scoring period. Cows with a mobility score of 2 during the early scoring period were associated with longer calving interval length, whereas only cows with a mobility score of 3 during the late scoring period were associated with longer calving interval length. Cows with a mobility score ≥1 were more likely to be culled during both scoring periods. Our study, therefore, shows an association between specific mobility scores and production and reproductive performance in spring-calving, pasture-based dairy cows scored during the summer grazing period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3abody condition 3acalving interval 3adairy cows 3adairy herds 3adeath 3afarm profitability 3agrazing 3alameness 3amilk 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3areproductive performance 3aslaughter 3asomatic cell count 3asummer 0amilk production 0aculling 0areproduction 0alocomotion1 aBokkers, E.A.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2000-76001 ade Boer, I.J.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0675-75281 aHogeveen, H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9443-14121 aSayers, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0307-45691 aByrne, N.1 aRuelle, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0077-81061 aShalloo, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1714-672X0 tJournal of dairy science.g2020 Oct., v. 103, no. 10 p.9238-9249dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-171033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03807naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006300155245013600218500001900354520236500373592002802738650001502766650002002781650001102801650002202812650001502834650001502849650001802864650001102882650002402893650002202917651001202939651001302951653003602964653001803000653001303018653001803031700005703049700005803106773011003164856009003274852000903364655001203373IND60706589920221123031119.0200907e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070658992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.1039042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang Chien, Yi-Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3567-271810aUsing geographically weighted models to explore how crowdsourced landscape perceptions relate to landscape physical characteristics  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study explores how formal measures of landscape wildness (i.e. absence of human artefacts, perceived naturalness of land cover, remoteness from mechanised access, and ruggedness of the terrain) correlate with crowdsourced measures of landscape aesthetic quality as captured in Scenic-Or-Not data for Great Britain. It evaluates multiple linear regression (MLR) and two spatially varying coefficients models: geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR). The MLR provided a baseline model in an analysis of national data, exhibiting the presence of spatially autocorrelated residuals and suggesting that geographically weighted models may be appropriate. A standard GWR was found to exacerbate local collinearity between covariates, both overfitting and underfitting the model with highly varied and localised results. This was due to its single one-size-fits-all bandwidth and the assumption that all relationships between the target and predictor variables operate over the same spatial scale. MGWR relaxes this assumption by determining parameter-specific bandwidths, mitigating the local collinearity issues found in a standard GWR and resulting in more spatially stable and consistent coefficient estimates. The findings also indicated that the relationship between some covariates (such as remoteness) and perceived landscape quality varied little spatially, while clear gradients were found for other covariates. For example, naturalness was stronger in the north and west, ruggedness was stronger in the south and east, and the absence of human artefacts was weaker in Scotland and the north than in England and the south. Overall, the study showed that MGWR is more sensitive than GWR to the spatial heterogeneity in the statistical relationships between landscape factors and public perceptions. These findings provide nuanced understandings of how these relationships vary spatially, underscoring the value of such approaches in landscape scale analyses to support policy and planning. The discussion section of this paper considers the MGWR as the default geographically weighted model, assessing the potential for the use of crowdsourced data in landscape studies. In so doing, it illustrates how such approaches could be used to explore both subjective and objective landscape evaluations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3aautocorrelation 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3amechanization 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3aspatial variation 3aEngland 3aScotland 0aLandscape character assessments 0aCrowdsourcing 0aWildness 0aScenic-Or-Not1 aCarver, Steve1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4202-82341 aComber, Alexis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3652-78460 tLandscape and urban planning.g2020 Nov., v. 203 p.103904-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.1039043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245008000175300001800255520089500273592002801168650001401196650003301210650002301243650002601266650002901292650002901321650001601350650002101366650002001387650003201407653001401439653003001453653002301483653002401506653003001530700002601560700003801586700003401624700003101658773010501689856008501794852000901879655001201888IND60132849620221120083026.0150513e20150803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013284962DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2015.10161212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolina Mayo, Carlos10aGreen chromatography determination of fatty acid methyl esters in biodiesel  ap. 1933-1942.  aThis work proposes a green, simple and rapid chromatographic methodology for separation and determination of a group of 13 fatty acids methyl esters (FAMEs) by using a capillary gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector. The method was successfully applied for the determination of FAMEs in biodiesel samples from commercial and waste cooking oils, synthesized by homogeneous catalysis. Detection and quantification limits were in the μg L ⁻¹ level. Direct injection of sample solution was compared with solid-phase extraction and solid-phase microextraction procedures, giving similar results. The lower analysis time represent considerable improvement compared with other papers. The described methodology is especially suitable for process control applications. The samples analysed showed total contents of FAMEs higher than 96.5%, which verifies the European regulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3acapillary gas chromatography 3acatalytic activity 3acooking fats and oils 3aenvironmental technology 3afatty acid methyl esters 3afatty acids 3aflame ionization 3aprocess control 3asolid phase microextraction 0abiodiesel 0afatty acids methyl esters 0agas chromatography 0atransesterification 0aflame ionization detector1 aBrito Alayón, Andrea1 aGarcía Rodríguez, María Teresa1 aJiménez Abizanda, Ana Isabel1 aJiménez Moreno, Francisco0 tEnvironmental technology.g2015 Aug. 3, v. 36, no. 15 p.1933-1942dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2015.10161213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03486naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002500137245013400162300001600296520220100312592002802513650001502541650001502556650001102571650001002582650001102592650001102603650001602614651001302630651001702643651001202660651001102672651001302683651000902696653001202705653001102717653001302728653001202741653001802753653000902771653001502780653001702795653001402812773009602826856007302922852000902995655001203004IND60564716320221119044655.0170318e20160524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056471632DNAL7 a10.3417/20150212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, Charlotte M.10aRubiacearum Americanarum Magna Hama Pars XXXI: More New Neotropical Species and Morphological Notes for Psychotria (Psychotrieae)  ap. 413-434.  aBotanical exploration has documented 11 new species of Psychotria L.

(Karst). The rate-limiting enzymes of the pathway were the hexokinases, ATP: phosphofructo-kinase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and pyruvate kinase. Two phosphofructokinases were found: ATP : fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase (PFK) and pyrophosphate :fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase (PFP). In the presence of its activator fructose-2,6-bisphos-phate, PFP had a 4 -5-fold higher specific activity than PFK. PFP could be activated about 20-fold by fructose-2,6-bisphosphate at saturating concentrations of the substrates (fructose-6-phosphate and pyrophosphate). The increase of Vₘₐₓ was accompanied by a strong increase in the apparent affinity of the enzyme for the substrates. Km for fructose-6-phosphate and pyrophosphate was 0.44 mM and 24 μM, respectively. Kₐ for fructose-2,6-bisphosphate was 24 nM.In seedlings, specific activity of the glycolytic enzymes was 30-300 percent higher in the hypocotyls, except for fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase, their activity being 100-150 percent higher in the cotyledons, This distribution remained unchanged during periods of 2 -16 weeks of cultivation of the seedlings.In callus cultures and in cell suspension cultures, grown mixotrophically with different carbohydrates, all enzymes were between 1-and 7-fold higher than in autotrophically grown seedlings. Incubation of seedlings in mineral salt mixture containing a carbohydrate resulted in a rapid coordinate increase of the activities to the levels of callus-or cell suspension cultures. This induction required a carbohydrate and oxygen. During prolonged cultivation of cell suspension cultures, when carbohydrate became limiting, activity of the enzymes slowly declined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acallus culture 3acell suspension culture 3acotyledons 3afructose 6-phosphate 3afructose-bisphosphate aldolase 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aglycolysis 3ahypocotyls 3aoxygen 3aphosphofructokinases 3aphosphoglycerate kinase 3apyruvate kinase 3aseedlings 0aPicea abies 0aCell Culture 0aCarbohydrate Metabolism 0aPPi -phosphofructokinase 0aEnzyme Regulation0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 46, no. 7-8 p.597-604dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1991-7-8163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245019600172300001800368520161000386592002801996650001502024650002502039650001902064650001102083650002002094650002502114650001502139650001802154650002902172700002302201700002202224700002802246700002502274700002302299700002202322700001902344700006502363773012902428856008502557852000902642655001202651IND60770361520221119184646.0220315e20220303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077036152DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c047112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanders, James D.10aEnhanced Ion Mobility Separation and Characterization of Isomeric Phosphatidylcholines Using Absorption Mode Fourier Transform Multiplexing and Ultraviolet Photodissociation Mass Spectrometry  ap. 4252-4259.  aThe structural diversity of phospholipids plays a critical role in cellular membrane dynamics, energy storage, and cellular signaling. Despite its importance, the extent of this diversity has only recently come into focus, largely owing to advances in separation science and mass spectrometry methodology and instrumentation. Characterization of glycerophospholipid (GP) isomers differing only in their acyl chain configurations and locations of carbon–carbon double bonds (C═C) remains challenging due to the need for both effective separation of isomers and advanced tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) technologies capable of double-bond localization. Drift tube ion mobility spectrometry (DTIMS) coupled with MS can provide both fast separation and accurate determination of collision cross section (CCS) of molecules but typically lacks the resolving power needed to separate phospholipid isomers. Ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) can provide unambiguous double-bond localization but is challenging to implement on the timescales of modern commercial drift tube time-of-flight mass spectrometers. Here, we present a novel method for coupling DTIMS with a UVPD-enabled Orbitrap mass spectrometer using absorption mode Fourier transform multiplexing that affords simultaneous localization of double bonds and accurate CCS measurements even when isomers cannot be fully resolved in the mobility dimension. This method is demonstrated on two- and three-component mixtures and shown to provide CCS measurements that differ from those obtained by individual analysis of each component by less than 1%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aanalytical chemistry 3acell membranes 3aenergy 3ainstrumentation 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphotolysis 3aspectrometers 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aShields, Samuel W.1 aEscobar, Edwin E.1 aLanzillotti, Michael B.1 aButalewicz, Jamie P.1 aJames, Virginia K.1 aBlevins, Molly S.1 aSipe, Sarah N.1 aBrodbelt, Jennifer S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3207-02170 tAnalytical chemistry.g2022 Mar. 03, v. 94, no. 10 p.4252-4259dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c047113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03376naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245014200166300001600308520154900324592002801873650001801901650001401919650002201933650001301955650002301968650002701991650001702018650001602035650002202051650001502073650001502088650001502103650001702118650001802135650001402153650000702167650001502174650002102189650002402210650001902234650002002253650001302273650001702286653003402303653002402337653001802361653004202379653001402421653004402435700001402479700001502493700001302508700001202521700001402533773010802547856008602655852000902741655001202750IND60553111220221121111136.0161021e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055311122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.06.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Kun10aSynthesis of multi-functional nanocapsules via interfacial AGET ATRP in miniemulsion for tumor micro-environment responsive drug delivery  ap. 188-195.  aNovel multi-functional polymeric hollow nanocapsules (PHN) based on the crosslinked poly(tert-butyl acrylate) (PtBA) shells were synthesized in a miniemulsion interfacial polymerization via activator generated electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization (AGET ATRP) technique with N,N′-bis(acryloyl) cystamine (BACy) as cross-linking agent, CuBr2 as catalyst, ascorbic acid (VC) as reducing agent and hexadecane as inert solvent. In the AGET ATRP, a folate-conjugated block copolymer, folate-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(tert-butyl acrylate) (FA-PEG-tBA-Br), was used as macroinitiator/stabilizer, and the specific amphiphilic nature of the copolymer led the extending inward of polymer chains. The DLS analysis directly showed the PHN with an average diameter of 150nm was obtained. After the PtBA shells were transformed into poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) by hydrolysis, doxorubicin (DOX), as a model drug, was loaded efficiently into the hydrolyzed polymeric hollow nanocapsules (HPHN), then the in vitro release of drug was carried out in phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH 7.4 or 5.0, with or without DTT or GSH of different concentrations). It showed that the existence of folate group significantly improved pH stimuli-responsive and DOX-loading capacity of the polymeric nanocapsules. An acidic pH (5.0) and presence of GSH would accelerate the DOX release behavior. Thus, these multi-functional polymeric nanocapsules have excellent available properties in the field of targeted and controlled drug delivery for cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3acatalysts 3achemical elements 3acolloids 3acomposite polymers 3across-linking reagents 3acrosslinking 3adoxorubicin 3aelectron transfer 3afolic acid 3ahexadecane 3ahydrolysis 3ananocapsules 3ananoemulsions 3aneoplasms 3apH 3aphosphates 3apolyacrylic acid 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3areducing agents 3asolvents 3atherapeutics 0aPolymeric hollow nanocapsules 0aReduction-triggered 0apH responsive 0aTargeted and controlled drug delivery 0aAGET ATRP 0aMiniemulsion interfacial polymerization1 aZeng, Jin1 aZhao, Xubo1 aLiu, Lei1 aJia, Xu1 aLiu, Peng0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 134 p.188-195dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.06.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03446naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245014700164500001900311520185600330592002802186650002302214650001902237650002502256650001802281650001902299650001602318650001102334650001402345650002502359650002002384650001002404650003402414650001602448650001402464650002002478650002702498650002202525650001902547700001802566700001502584700001702599700002102616700001802637700002102655700001602676700001702692773012002709856007802829852000902907655001202916IND60729441020221119040337.0210228e20210125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072944102DNAL7 a10.3390/plants100202272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Fangfang 10aGenome-Wide Analysis of MDHAR Gene Family in Four Cotton Species Provides Insights into Fiber Development via Regulating AsA Redox Homeostasis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMonodehydroasorbate reductase (MDHAR) (EC1.6.5.4), a key enzyme in ascorbate-glutathione recycling, plays important roles in cell growth, plant development and physiological response to environmental stress via control of ascorbic acid (AsA)-mediated reduction/oxidation (redox) regulation. Until now, information regarding MDHAR function and regulatory mechanism in Gossypium have been limited. Herein, a genome-wide identification and comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of 36 MDHAR family genes in four Gossypium species, Gossypium arboreum, G. raimondii, G. hirsutum, and G. barbadense, were performed, indicating their close evolutionary relationship. Expression analysis of GhMDHARs in different cotton tissues and under abiotic stress and phytohormone treatment revealed diverse expression features. Fiber-specific expression analysis showed that GhMDHAR1A/D, 3A/D and 4A/D were preferentially expressed in fiber fast elongating stages to reach peak values in 15-DPA fibers, with corresponding coincident observances of MDHAR enzyme activity, AsA content and ascorbic acid/dehydroascorbic acid (AsA/DHA) ratio. Meanwhile, there was a close positive correlation between the increase of AsA content and AsA/DHA ratio catalyzed by MDHAR and fiber elongation development in different fiber-length cotton cultivars, suggesting the potential important function of MDHAR for fiber growth. Following H₂O₂ stimulation, GhMDHAR demonstrated immediate responses at the levels of mRNA, enzyme, the product of AsA and corresponding AsA/DHA value, and antioxidative activity. These results for the first time provide a comprehensive systemic analysis of the MDHAR gene family in plants and the four cotton species and demonstrate the contribution of MDHAR to fiber elongation development by controlling AsA-recycling-mediated cellular redox homeostasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium arboreum 3aabiotic stress 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3abioinformatics 3acell growth 3acotton 3acultivars 3adehydroascorbic acid 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3ahomeostasis 3aoxidation 3aoxidoreductases 3aphysiological response 3aplant development 3aplant hormones1 aZheng, Bowen 1 aWang, Fei 1 aCao, Aiping 1 aXie, Shuangquan 1 aChen, Xifeng 1 aSchick, Joel  A.1 aJin, Xiang 1 aLi, Hongbin 0 tPlants.g2021 Jan. 25, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants100202273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03180naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100001800181245011300199300001800312506007600330520150000406592002801906506003701934650002801971650003201999650002502031650001802056650002702074650001302101650002402114650002702138650002202165650002802187650001802215650005002233650002802283650003102311650001302342650003002355650002502385650002602410650002202436700001602458700001902474773011702493856004302610852000902653655001202662IND4481985220221207131250.0120501e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448198522DNAL7 a223454592pmid7 aPMC33186452pmcid7 a10.1128/JVI.07019-112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Xuefeng12aA Local, Interactive Network of 3' RNA Elements Supports Translation and Replication of Turnip Crinkle Virus  ap. 4065-4081.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe majority of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) was previously identified as forming a highly interactive structure with a ribosome-binding tRNA-shaped structure (TSS) acting as a scaffold and undergoing a widespread conformational shift upon binding to RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Tertiary interactions in the region were explored by identifying two highly detrimental mutations within and adjacent to a hairpin H4 upstream of the TSS that reduce translation in vivo and cause identical structural changes in the loop of the 3' terminal hairpin Pr. Second-site changes that compensate for defects in translation/accumulation and reverse the structural differences in the Pr loop were found in the Pr stem, as well as in a specific stem within the TSS and within the capsid protein (CP) coding region, suggesting that the second-site changes were correcting a conformational defect and not restoring specific base pairing. The RdRp-mediated conformational shift extended upstream through this CP open reading frame (ORF) region after bypassing much of an intervening, largely unstructured region, supporting a connection between 3' elements and coding region elements. These data suggest that the Pr loop, TSS, and H4 are central elements in the regulation of translation and replication in TCV and allow for development of an RNA interactome that maps the higher-order structure of a postulated RNA domain within the 3' region of a plus-strand RNA virus.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a3' untranslated regions 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aTurnip crinkle virus 3acoat proteins 3amolecular conformation 3amutation 3aopen reading frames 3atranslation (genetics) 3avirus replication 2a3' Untranslated Regions 2aBase Sequence 2aCarmovirusxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aMutation 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aRNA, Viralxchemistry 2aVirus Replication1 aShi, Kerong1 aSimon, Anne E.0 tJournal of virology.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 86, no. 8 p.4065-4081dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0022-538X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JVI.07019-11  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245011100169300001800280500002000298520141500318592002801733650001601761650001401777650001301791650001401804650001201818650001401830650002401844650001301868650001101881650001501892650000901907650002501916650001401941650001501955700002801970700002401998700001802022700002402040700002802064700001702092700002002109700001902129700002402148700002302172773013102195856007902326852000902405655001202414IND60588278320221116205936.0180103e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058827832DNAL7 a10.1111/1758-2229.124832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBui, Thi Phuong Nam10aComparative genomics and physiology of the butyrate‐producing bacterium Intestinimonas butyriciproducens  ap. 1024-1037.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIntestinimonas is a newly described bacterial genus with representative strains present in the intestinal tract of human and other animals. Despite unique metabolic features including the production of butyrate from both sugars and amino acids, there is to date no data on their diversity, ecology, and physiology. Using a comprehensive phylogenetic approach, Intestinimomas was found to include at least three species that colonize primarily the human and mouse intestine. We focused on the most common and cultivable species of the genus, Intestinimonas butyriciproducens, and performed detailed genomic and physiological comparison of strains SRB521ᵀ and AF211, isolated from the mouse and human gut respectively. The complete 3.3‐Mb genomic sequences of both strains were highly similar with 98.8% average nucleotide identity, testifying to their assignment to one single species. However, thorough analysis revealed significant genomic rearrangements, variations in phage‐derived sequences, and the presence of new CRISPR sequences in both strains. Moreover, strain AF211 appeared to be more efficient than strain SRB521ᵀ in the conversion of the sugars arabinose and galactose. In conclusion, this study provides genomic and physiological insight into Intestinimonas butyriciproducens, a prevalent butyrate‐producing species, differentiating strains that originate from the mouse and human gut.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aarabinose 3abacteria 3abutyrates 3aecology 3agalactose 3agenetic engineering 3agenomics 3ahumans 3aintestines 3amice 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aphysiology1 aShetty, Sudarshan Anand1 aLagkouvardos, Ilias1 aRitari, Jarmo1 aChamlagain, Bhawani1 aDouillard, François P.1 aPaulin, Lars1 aPiironen, Vieno1 aClavel, Thomas1 aPlugge, Caroline M.1 aVos, Willem M. de,0 tEnvironmental microbiology reports.g2016 Dec., v. 8, no. 6 p.1024-1037dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:2217x1758-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.124833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245009400163300001600257500001500273520115200288592002801440650003201468650001401500650002001514650003001534650002101564650001301585650002001598650002901618650002201647650002101669650002401690650001401714650001201728650001901740650002801759650002301787653001001810653001401820653001301834653002701847653002101874653003001895700002501925700002701950773015201977856007802129852000902207655001202216IND60522843420221119042053.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052284342DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1991-7-8182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStarke, Thomas10aTwo Separate Genes Encode the Catalytic 70 kDa V-ATPase Subunit in Psilotum and Equisetum  ap. 613-620.  a2019-12-06  aVacuolar type ATPases have been found on various endomem branes of eukaryotic cells, e.g. lysosomes, chromaffin granules, vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus, endosomes and vacuoles. Although this ATPase type is targeted to different compartments in one cell, only one gene for each subunit had been found per genome.Using PCR across intron-exon boundaries we show that two different genes encode the cat­alytic subunit of the V-ATPase in Psilotum nudum and Equisetum arvense. The substitution rates for the three codon positions and the intervening sequences show that in Psilotum both genes are transcribed and are under selection pressure, however, this seems not to be the case for Equisetum. The relatively high similarity between the two genes found in each species as compared to the interspecies similarities suggest that for some time after the gene duplication had occurred the two copies were subject to gene conversion mechanisms. An unexpected degree of conservation of the intervening sequences themselves is noted and statistically verified, however, no structural constraints that could explain these findings were detected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3alysosomes 3aGolgi apparatus 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aeukaryotic cells 3avacuoles 3agene conversion 3atranscription (genetics) 3aEquisetum arvense 3agene duplication 3achromaffin granules 3aendosomes 3aintrons 3aPsilotum nudum 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aselection pressure 0agenes 0aEvolution 0aV-ATPase 0aIntron-Exon Boundaries 0aGene Duplication 0aPolymerase Chain Reaction1 aLinkkila, Timothy P.1 aGogarten, Johann Peter0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 46, no. 7-8 p.613-620dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1991-7-8183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01421naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245006000159300001600219520049100235592002800726650001800754650001200772650001600784650001200800651001100812653001100823653001500834653001800849653001800867700002000885773009600905856007301001852000901074655001201083IND60564716620221119044817.0170318e20160524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056471662DNAL7 a10.3417/20150302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcPherson, Gordon12aA New Species of Conceveiba (Euphorbiaceae) from Belize  ap. 369-372.  aConceveiba belizensis McPherson & B.

The 700 nm (λₑₓ, 570 nm) and 600 nm (λₑₓ, 470 nm) fluorescence emission of QCy(MeBT)₃ was significantly and individually enhanced with the addition of G-quadruplex (G4) DNA and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), respectively. The results of docking simulations and the response against the viscosity change revealed that the dual-fluorescence response was caused by the difference in the binding mode of QCy(MeBT)₃ depending on the DNA structure. The results of fluorescence microscopy imaging experiments using QCy(MeBT)₃ suggested that G4 DNAs and dsDNAs in the cell nucleus can be imaged with near-infrared (NIR, 700 nm) and red (600 nm) fluorescence emissions. Furthermore, pyridostatin-induced G4 formation in the living cells can be imaged with NIR fluorescence. The results indicated that QCy(MeBT)₃ has huge potential to be a NIR-fluorescent molecular probe for analyzing the structural dynamics of nucleic acids in living cells with a normal fluorescence microscope.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aanalytical chemistry 3acell nucleus 3acondensation reactions 3adyes 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopes 3afluorescence microscopy 3aiodides 3aquinones 3aviscosity1 aYu, Zehui1 aOtani, Yuto0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2022 Mar. 02, v. 94, no. 10 p.4269-4276dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c048043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02308naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012500162300001600287520113600303592002801439650002001467650002901487650002101516650002101537650001201558650001901570650001401589650001501603650002801618650002201646650001101668700001401679700001201693700001201705773011501717856008101832852000901913655001201922IND60524391320221117225111.0160706e200210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052439132DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-002-1108-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaronian, 10aDetection of two distinct substrate-dependent catabolic responses in yeast cells using a mediated electrochemical method  ap. 108-113.  aMediated electrochemical detection of catabolism in prokaryotic cells is well documented; however, the application of this technique to eukaryotic cells has received less attention. Two catabolic substrate-dependent mediated electrochemical signals were detected in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The signal using a single hydrophilic mediator (ferricyanide) is small whereas the response using a double mediator system comprising a hydrophilic and a lipophilic mediator (ferricyanide and menadione) is up to three orders of magnitude larger. The behaviour of each response during cell ageing is different: the single mediator response increases whereas the double mediator response decreases. This difference indicates that the two signals originate at different points in the catabolic pathways. In S. cerevisiae the double mediator response is proposed to originate from the reduction of the lipophilic mediator by NADPH produced in the pentose phosphate pathway. The single mediator signal arises from reduction of the hydrophilic mediator by an extracellular redox species produced in response to the presence of glucose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aelectrochemistry 3aeukaryotic cells 3aglucose 3ahydrophilicity 3amenadione 3ametabolism 3apentose phosphate cycle 3aprokaryotic cells 3ayeasts1 aDownard, 1 aLowen, 1 aPasco, 0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2002 Oct., v. 60, no. 1-2 p.108-113dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-002-1108-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03349naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100001800168245015600186300001800342520152600360592002801886650002101914650002601935650002501961650002001986650002102006650002102027650002502048650002502073650002302098650001902121650001702140650001302157650001602170650003402186650001202220650005202232650004902284650001602333650002502349650002402374650005102398650003502449650003202484650001302516700002002529700002202549700002702571773010302598856008502701852000902786655001202795IND4473101120221120170133.0141111e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447310112DNAL7 a215140372pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2011.03.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Runying10aInfluence of plants on microbial activity in a vertical-downflow wetland system treating waste activated sludge with high organic matter concentrations  ap. S158-S164.  aThe rhizosphere is a key zone for pollutant removal in treatment wetlands; therefore, studies on microbial activity may provide helpful information for a better understanding of purification processes. We studied microbial activity in a vertical-downflow constructed wetland system treating waste activated sludge with high organic matter concentrations, under Mediterranean climate. The aims of the work were to study the influence of (i) the presence of plants, (ii) the plant species (Phragmites australis Cav., Typha latifolia L., Iris pseudacorus L.), and (iii) the plant growth stage (plant senescence and plant fast growing stage) on total respiration rate and phosphatase activity in the substrate (intented here as the solid support on which the plants grow). The presence of plants had a positive influence on microbial activity, since substrate respiration and both acid and alkaline phosphatase activity were always higher in planted than in unplanted mesocosms. Among the three tested species, Phragmites was the one that most stimulated both substrate respiration rate and phosphatase activity, followed by Typha and Iris. These differences of microbial activity between mesocosms were corresponding to differences of removal efficiency. Substrate respiration and phosphatase activity were of similar magnitude at the two growth stages, while the stimulating effect of plants seemed to have been delayed and microbial activity showed higher fluctuations at plant fast growing stage than at plant senescence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIris pseudacorus 3aMediterranean climate 3aPhragmites australis 3aTypha latifolia 3aacid phosphatase 3aactivated sludge 3aconstructed wetlands 3adevelopmental stages 3amicrobial activity 3aorganic matter 3aplant growth 3aplanting 3arhizosphere 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aClimate 2aIris Plantxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aPoaceaexgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aRhizosphere 2aSewagexmicrobiology 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTyphaceaexgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 2aWater Purificationxmethods 2aWetlands1 aBaldy, Virginie1 aPérissol, Claude1 aKorboulewsky, Nathalie0 tJournal of environmental management.g2012 Mar., v. 95S p.S158-S164dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2011.03.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01442naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245007200158300001600230520050700246592002800753650001600781650002000797650001600817651001800833653001100851653001100862653001100873653001600884653001400900653001200914773009600926856007301022852000901095655001201104IND60564716720221119050951.0170318e20160524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056471672DNAL7 a10.3417/20150362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiapella, Jorge12aA New Combination in Deschampsia (Poaceae) in Arctic North America1  ap. 343-346.  aNorthern North American populations of Deschampsia P.

Searching for an agent that inhibits such tolerance to nutrient starvation and kills the pancreatic cancer cells preferentially in nutrient-starvation is a unique anti-austerity strategy in anti-cancer drug discovery. In this strategy, plant extracts and compounds are tested against PANC-1 human pancreatic cancer cell line under the conditions of nutrient-deprived medium (NDM) and nutrient-rich medium (DMEM), to discover the compounds that show selective cytotoxicity in NDM. Screening of twenty-five Thai indigenous medicinal plant extracts for their anti-austerity activity against the PANC-1 human pancreatic cancer cell line in nutrient deprived medium (NDM) resulted in the identification of four active plants, Derris scandens, Boesenbergia pandurata, Citrus hystrix, and Kaempferia parviflora, with PC₅₀ values 0.5–8.9 µg/mL. K. parviflora extract also inhibited PANC-1 cancer cell colony formation. Phytochemical investigation of K. parviflora extract led to the isolation of fourteen compounds, including two polyoxygenated cyclohexanes (1 and 2), eleven flavonoids (3–13), and β-sitosterol (14). Stereochemical assignment of compound 1 was confirmed through X-ray analysis. All isolated compounds were tested for their preferential cytotoxicity against PANC-1 cells. Among them, 5-hydroxy-7-methoxyflavone (3) displayed the most potent activity with a PC₅₀ value of 0.8 µM. Mechanistically, it was found to induce apoptosis in PANC-1 cell death in NDM as evident by caspase cleavage. It was also found to inhibit PANC-1 cancer cell colony formation in DMEM. Therefore, compound 3 can be considered as a potential lead compound for the anticancer drug development based on the anti-austerity strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus hystrix 3aDerris scandens 3aKaempferia parviflora 3aX-radiation 3aantineoplastic agents 3aapoptosis 3acaspases 3acyclohexanes 3acytotoxicity 3adrug development 3aflavonoids 3ahumans 3amedicinal plants 3aneoplasm cells 3apancreatic neoplasms 3astarvation 3astereochemistry1 aKim, Min-jo,1 aDibwe, Dya  Fita1 aOmar, Ashraf  M.1 aAthikomkulchai, Sirivan 1 aPhrutivorapongkul, Ampai 1 aOkada, Takuya 1 aTsuge, Kiyoshi 1 aToyooka, Naoki 1 aAwale, Suresh 0 tPlants.g2021 Jan. 25, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants100202293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03104naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001800159245008900177300001600266520180600282592002802088650002802116650001302144650001702157650001702174650003802191650001902229650001402248650001902262650002602281650001602307650002202323653002202345653001902367653001802386653001902404653001402423700001602437700001602453773009902469856009302568852000902661655001202670IND60581634420221116175234.0171005e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058163442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2016.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Zhenhua14aThe microstructure and stability of collagen hydrogel cross-linked by glutaraldehyde  ap. 264-270.  aCollagen hydrogels, which are comprised of fibrils and possess three-dimensional network structure, were prepared via self-assembly of collagen molecules and sequentially incubated in glutaraldehyde (GTA) solutions with different [CHO]/[NH2] ratios (0–9). The cross-linking degree of outer and inner parts of hydrogels was similar, demonstrating the homogeneous reaction. Based on the results of atomic force microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic rheological measurements, it was conjectured that the stability of hydrogels were closely associated with the structural changes of collagen fibrils. When the [CHO]/[NH2] ratios ≤3, cross-linking preferentially occurred between adjacent fibrils; therefore, the fibrils presented in pairs and then densely agglomerated. As a result, the thermal denaturation temperature (from 47.1 to 73.6 °C) and elastic modulus (from 108.32 to 1618.55 Pa) increased drastically, accompanied by a distinct decrease in enzymatic degradation degree (from 93.69 to 26.91%). The effective binding ratio (EB) of aldehyde groups reduced from 72.66 to 43.92%. Moreover, hydrogels turned into yellow and yellowness (Δb*) increased from 0 to 1.68. When the [CHO]/[NH2] ratio reached 3, the arrangement of fibrils became very compact; therefore, although the GTA dosage was multiplicative ([CHO]/[NH2] = 9), there was only a relatively small improvement in thermal stability and anti-enzymolysis. Furthermore, the EB value was only 16.40%, indicating that intensive self-polymerization of GTA molecules caused a large consumption of aldehyde groups, accompanied by a remarkable yellow-stain (Δb* = 2.73). These data on the stability of cross-linked hydrogels could be helpful for the design and fabrication of materials based on collagen hydrogels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic force microscopy 3acollagen 3acrosslinking 3adenaturation 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aglutaraldehyde 3ahydrogels 3amicrostructure 3amodulus of elasticity 3atemperature 3athermal stability 0aCollagen hydrogel 0aGlutaraldehyde 0aCross-linking 0aMicrostructure 0aStability1 aLiu, Wentao1 aLi, Guoying0 tPolymer Degradation and Stability.g2016 Aug., v. 130 p.264-270dElsevier Ltdx0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2016.06.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245011500163300001800278520152500296592002801821650001801849650001901867650002001886650001601906650001401922650001201936650002901948650001801977650002301995650001502018650001202033650001502045650003102060650002202091650000802113653001602121653002302137653001802160700001402178700001602192700001702208700001602225700001302241700001502254700001902269773011202288856008302400852000902483655001202492IND60645504220221122073730.0200405e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064550422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2019.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiumin10aDoes tea extract supplementation benefit metabolic syndrome and obesity? A systematic review and meta-analysis  ap. 1049-1058.  aGiven the global epidemic of obesity, numerous strategies have been employed in the management of metabolic syndrome (MS) in this population. A meta-analysis was designed in the present investigation to evaluate the benefits of tea extract (TE) supplementation in MS in obesity.We conducted searches of published literature in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases from inception in 1985 to May 2017. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which studied TE consumption in obesity with MS were analyzed. Results were summarized using weighted mean differences (WMDs), standardized mean differences (SMDs) or odds ratio (OR) by suitable effect model.Sixteen eligible randomized controlled trials, including 1090 subjects were identified. Benefits were demonstrated on reduction of Body Mass Index (BMI) (SMD, −0.27; 95% CI, −0.40 to −0.15, P < 0.0001) and blood glucose (SMD, −0.22; 95% CI, −0.34 to −0.10, P = 0.0003), and increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (SMD, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.35, P = 0.03). Limited benefits without significance were observed on blood pressure and other anthropometric, cholesterol, and biochemistry outcomes. All-cause adverse events were minimal (0.99; 95% CI: 0.55, 1.77, P = 0.97).This meta-analysis suggests that consumption of TE supplementation in the obese with MS has beneficial effects on improvement of lipid and glucose metabolism, as well as in the facilitation of weight loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood glucose 3ablood pressure 3abody mass index 3acholesterol 3adatabases 3aglucose 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ameta-analysis 3ametabolic syndrome 3ametabolism 3aobesity 3aodds ratio 3arandomized clinical trials 3asystematic review 3atea 0aTea extract 0aMetabolic syndrome 0aMeta-analysis1 aWang, Wen1 aHou, Liming1 aWu, Huanghui1 aWu, Yongjie1 aXu, Rong1 aXiao, Yuan1 aWang, Xiaoming0 tClinical nutrition.g2020 Apr., v. 39, no. 4 p.1049-1058dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2019.05.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02485naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245006500164300002000229520130000249592002801549650001101577650001401588650002301602650001901625650001201644700002701656700002201683700002001705700001501725700002001740700002001760700002001780700001901800700001701819700003101836773012901867856008201996852000902078655001202087IND60565905920180611000000.0170327e20151029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056590592DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b070622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavid, Thomas10aKinetics and Energetics of Ge Condensation in SiGe Oxidation  ap. 24606-24613.  aThe fabrication of an ultrathin Ge-rich SiGe body on silicon on insulator (SOI) is highly challenging for the next generation of fully depleted complementary metal-oxide semiconductor devices that will be implemented in the near future. Ge-rich layers (GRLs) could be fabricated using a Ge enrichment process which takes place during dry thermal oxidation of SiGe thin films. While several studies make use of the GRL for many applications, the basic mechanism at work during the enrichment process is still unclear. In this study, we address the mechanism of formation of GRL and we determine the major driving forces of the enrichment process. We highlight the particular role played by the Si₀.₅Ge₀.₅ which is stabilized for various experimental conditions and strain levels. A systematic study demonstrates that the 50% Ge content is stabilized by a self-limited interdiffusion process regulated by the entropic term of the formation energy, which is a minimum at Si₀.₅Ge₀.₅ at the expense of the elasticity-driven interdiffusion. The process developed provides an easy and efficient way to produce planar GRLs free of dislocations with abrupt GRL/Si interfaces and tunable thickness. These GRLs could be fashioned for the heterogeneous integration of various systems on SOI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aoxidation 3aphysical chemistry 3asemiconductors 3asilicon1 aBenkouider, Abdelmalek1 aAqua, Jean-Noël,1 aCabie, Martiane1 aFavre, Luc1 aNeisius, Thomas1 aAbbarchi, Marco1 aNaffouti, Meher1 aRonda, Antoine1 aLiu, Kailang1 aBerbezier, I.q(Isabelle),0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2015 Oct. 29, v. 119, no. 43 p.24606-24613dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b070623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003500148245010000183300001600283520174900299592002802048650003402076650002502110650001402135650001502149650002602164650002502190650001702215650002402232650001802256650001002274650001602284650001302300650001102313650001402324650001402338651001102352700003502363700003702398700003802435700002102473700003802494700003002532773010702562856008202669852000902751655001202760IND60088633320180622000000.0141102e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008863332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.riam.2011.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAyala Zavala, Jesús Fernando,10aAntioxidant and antifungal potential of methanol extracts of Phellinus spp. from Sonora, Mexico  ap. 132-138.  aBACKGROUND: Among the potential natural sources of bioactive compounds, those of the macroscopic fungi Phellinus spp. have been identified by previous researches. Phenolic compounds are among the major antioxidant and antimicrobial contributors due to their bioactive properties. AIMS: The goal of this study was to determine the total phenolic and flavonoid contents, and its relation with the antioxidant and antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of Phellinus gilvus, Phellinus rimosus and Phellinus badius, respectively. METHODS: The collected and identified organisms of Phellinus spp. were treated with methanol and the generated aqueous extract was analyzed to quantified total phenolic compounds, total flavonoids, radical scavenging activity against DPPH, trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, and oxygen absorbance capacity. The antifungal property of the extracts was evaluated against Alternaria alternata. RESULTS: The content of phenolic compounds was of 49.31, 46.51 and 44.7mg of gallic acid equivalents/g, for P. gilvus, P. rimosus and P. badius, respectively. The total flavonoid content followed the same pattern with values of 30.58, 28, and 26.48mg of quercetin equivalents/g for P. gilvus, P. rimosus and P. badius, respectively. The variation on the content of phenolic components was reflected on the antioxidant activity of every organism. The antioxidant activity ranked as follows: P. gilvus>P. rimosus>P. badius. The antifungal effect of the different extracts against A. alternata showed a significant effect, all of them, inhibiting the growth of this pathogen. CONCLUSIONS: P. gilvus showed the best potential to inactivate free radicals, being all the tested fungi effective to inhibit A. alternata growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aAlternaria alternata 3aPhellinus 3aabsorbance 3aantifungal properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abioactive compounds 3afree radicals 3afungi 3agallic acid 3amethanol 3aoxygen 3apathogens 3aquercetin 3aMexico1 aSilva-Espinoza, Brenda Adriana1 aCruz-Valenzuela, Manuel Reynaldo1 aVillegas-Ochoa, Mónica Alejandra1 aEsqueda, Martín1 aGonzález-Aguilar, Gustavo Adolfo1 aCalderón-López, Yazaric0 tRevista iberoamericana de micología.g2012 , v. 29, no. 3 p.132-138dElsevier Espanax1130-14067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.riam.2011.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013800166300001600304500001900320520160500339592002801944650002201972650003501994650002202029650001802051650001702069650001202086650002002098650003102118650001602149650000902165650001802174650002002192700001802212700001702230700001802247700001802265700001202283700001902295773012802314856008302442852000902525655001202534IND60677465520221118013258.0201124e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067746552DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-019-04283-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xi-Min10aTranscriptome analysis of Medicago lupulina seedlings leaves treated by high calcium provides insights into calcium oxalate formation  ap. 299-314.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBACKGROUND AND AIM: Calcium oxalate (CaOx) is a common biomineral found in the plant kingdom. Crystals of CaOx occur in different plant tissues, such as leaves and stems. However, little is known about the biosynthesis of CaOx in oxalate-accumulating plants. Moreover, the literature on genes related to CaOx formation under high-calcium environment is scarce. In the present study, the physiological parameters and the transcript profiles of Medicago lupulina leaves treated with 0.1 and 25 mM Ca²⁺ were analyzed to study the genes involved in the biosynthesis of CaOx. RESULTS: We demonstrated that exposure to high external calcium concentration induced H₂O₂ production, ascorbic acid degradation, and CaOx accumulation in M. lupulina leaves. Moreover, we identified 1715 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (1322 up-regulated and 393 down-regulated genes) in leaves treated with 25 mM Ca²⁺ compared with the leaves treated with 0.1 mM Ca²⁺. We further demonstrated the involvement of DEGs in oxalic acid production, calcium transport, and calcium buffering. These results revealed that a high calcium promoted oxalic acid biosynthesis by inducing the expression of NADPH oxidase and ascorbate oxidase genes. In addition, several genes encoding cyclic nucleotide-gated channel, Ca²⁺-ATPase, H⁺/Ca²⁺ exchangers, and calcium-binding proteins were found to be differentially expressed and involved in calcium transport and calcium buffering. CONCLUSION: Our transcriptome analyses provide a comprehensive insight into the biosynthesis of CaOx in oxalate-accumulating plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago lupulina 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aascorbate oxidase 3aascorbic acid 3abiosynthesis 3acalcium 3acalcium oxalate 3agene expression regulation 3aoxalic acid 3asoil 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics1 aLiu, Lun-Xian1 aSu, Zhi-Meng1 aShen, Zhi-Jun1 aGao, Gui-Feng1 aYi, Yin1 aZheng, Hai-Lei0 tPlant and soil.g2019 Nov., v. 444, no. 1-2 p.299-314dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-019-04283-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012600168500002200294520140800316592002801724650001801752650001801770650001601788650001101804650001401815650001901829650002101848650002101869650001701890650001801907650001701925650002201942650002001964650001201984650001901996650001402015650001702029650002002046650000902066650000902075650002702084653000702111653000802118653001002126653000802136653000802144653000802152653000802160653000802168653001002176653001002186653001102196653001102207653000802218653000902226653001102235653000802246653002502254653001802279653001702297700001302314700001402327700001502341700001302356700001602369700001602385700001202401700001602413773009602429856008602525852000902611655001202620IND60563806120221117220554.0170713s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056380612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.02.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Sheng10aApple Polysaccharide inhibits microbial dysbiosis and chronic inflammation and modulates gut permeability in HFD-fed rats  aPre-press version  aThe saying “An apple a day keeps the doctor away” has been known for over 150 years, and numerous studies have shown that apple consumption is closely associated with reduced risks of chronic diseases. It has been well accepted that dysbiosis is the reflection of various chronic diseases. Therefore, this study investigates the effects of apple polysaccharides (AP) on gut dysbiosis. High-fat diet (HFD) fed rats were treated for 14 weeks with AP. The microbiota composition, microbiota-generated short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), gut permeability and chronic inflammation were analyzed. AP treatment showed higher abundance of Bacteroidetes and Lactobacillus while lower Firmicutes and Fusobacteium. AP significantly increased total SCFAs level that contributed by acetic acid and isobutyric acid. Moreover, AP dramatically alleviated dysbiosis-associated gut permeability and chronic inflammation with decreased plasma LBP, up-regulation of Occludin, down-regulation of tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL-1) and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β). The potential mechanism is due to the fact that AP reduces gut permeability, which involves the induction of autophagy in goblet cells. Therefore, AP exerts health benefits through inhibiting gut dysbiosis and chronic inflammation and modulating gut permeability in HFD-induced dysbiosis rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidetes 3aLactobacillus 3aacetic acid 3aapples 3aautophagy 3achemokine CCL2 3achronic diseases 3adigestive system 3agoblet cells 3ahigh fat diet 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3aisobutyric acid 3aligands 3amicroorganisms 3aoccludins 3apermeability 3apolysaccharides 3arats 3arisk 3atumor necrosis factors 0aAP 0aHFD 0aSCFAs 0aBte 0aBde 0aLac 0aFus 0aFir 0aTNF-a 0aMCP-1 0aCXCL-1 0aIL-1β 0aLPS 0aMUC2 0aRELMβ 0aLBP 0aApple polysaccharide 0agut dysbiosis 0agoblet cells1 aLi, Qian1 aZang, Yue1 aZhao, Yang1 aLiu, Nan1 aWang, Yifei1 aXu, Xiaotao1 aLiu, Li1 aMei, Qibing0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.02.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011400172300001600286520151600302592002801818650001601846650001301862650001301875650001401888650002801902650002101930650001501951650001701966650001101983650001301994650001202007650002102019650001302040650001402053650001302067650001902080650001702099650002002116650001602136653001802152653001802170653002002188653002502208653004302233700001602276700002302292700002202315773011302337856008602450852000902536655001202545IND60611546620221121065816.0190705e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061154662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.06.2442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKennedy, L.

These WBW are biologically resistant as a result of complexation between chromium (III) salts and the carboxyl groups of collagen. The objective of this study is to propose an unusual way to minimize environmental contamination routing through waste to energy concept, adopting cleaner methodologies. The research is also specifically focussed to bring in, new initiatives through interdisciplinary approach serving as a decisive key to transform wet blue leather wastes into a high performance supercapacitor electrode material. Electrochemical measurements such as cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques using 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte were performed to evaluate the suitability of the prepared carbon for supercapacitor applications. Na2SO4, is chosen as it can serve as neutral electrolyte, and has less corrosion behavior. The values of specific capacitance, specific energy, specific power and cycle stability for WBW activated at 900 °C (LSAC9) were 2203 Fg-1, 624.7 Whkg−1, 749.9 Wkg-1 and over 10,000 cycles respectively and are comparable with graphene like carbons. The performance of WBW porous carbons are consequence of micro-meso porosity and graphitic structure and are an initiative of waste to energy storage conversion concepts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3achromium 3acollagen 3acorrosion 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3agraphene 3aleather 3aleather industry 3amoieties 3apollution 3aporosity 3asodium sulfate 3asolid wastes 3aspecific energy 3avalue added 0aPorous carbon 0aLeather waste 0aSupercapacitors 0aSpecific capacitance 0aElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy1 aRatnaji, T.1 aKonikkara, Niketha1 aVijaya, J.

These superantigens are associated with mobile genetic elements such as plasmids, prophages and S. aureus pathogenicity islands (SaPI). The presence of well-known eight SaPI integrase and 13 enterotoxin genes (sea, seb, sec, sed, see, seg, seh, sei, sej, sel, sek, seq, and tst) in 93 S. aureus strains were investigated. All S. aureus isolates were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and the genes were detected using five sets of multiplex PCR (mPCR). The most predominant toxin genes were sea (19%), seb (15%), sec (54%), sell (48%), selk (46%), selq (52%), seg (22%), and sei (19%). Analysis showed that many S. aureus isolates harbored multiple toxin genes. An mPCR-based assay was developed for the determination of all SaPI and their superantigen gene combinations. Twenty three isolates revealed the gene combination sec, sell and tst, typical of the SaPIbov1 and SaPIn1/m1 pathogenicity islands. Twelve isolates revealed the selk and selq gene combination consistent with SaPI3. Eight isolates exhibited the sec and sell genes without the tst gene typical of SaPImw2. We established a correlation between superantigenic toxin genotypes in S. aureus in terms of combinations of toxin gene-encoding SaPI. These results provide a rapid method for determining superantigenic toxin genotypes in S. aureus strains. A total of 24 PFGE patterns were generated. To our knowledge, this is a first study analyzing the correlation of all known SaPI and their enterotoxins in S. aureus using mPCR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aenterotoxins 3afoodborne illness 3agenes 3agenotype 3ainterspersed repetitive sequences 3apathogenicity islands 3aplasmids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3arapid methods 3asuperantigens 0aStaphylococcus aureus 0aEnterotoxin gene 0aSaPI 0aPFGE 0aFood 0amPCR1 aZdenkova, Kamila1 aSykorova, Hana1 aDemnerova, Katerina0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2014 Dec., v. 107 p.197-204dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2014.10.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02205naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245008000167500002200247520089900269592002801168650002501196650002601221650001401247650001101261650001301272650001401285650001801299650001601317650001301333650002101346650002001367650001401387650002301401650001201424653001501436653002901451653002301480700001801503700001701521700001801538773009601556856008601652852000901738655001201747IND60563806220221117220510.0170713s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056380622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.02.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Yang10aSynergistic Effects of Nanochitin on Inhibition of Tobacco Root Rot Disease  aPre-press version  aNanomaterials have great potential for use in various fields, due to their unique properties. In order to explore the bioactivity of nanochitin on tobacco, the effects of nanochitin suspensions on tobacco seed germination, seedling growth, and synergistic effects with fungicides were studied in indoor and field trials. Results showed that 0.004% (w/v) of nanochitin improved tobacco seed germination and shortened mean time to germination significantly; 0.005% (w/v) of nanochitin increased tobacco stem length, stem girth, leaf number and leaf area, and 0.001% (w/v) of nanochitin had synergistic effects on inhibition of tobacco root rot when mixed with metalaxyl mancozeb and thiophanate methyl fungicides. This indicates that nanochitin suspensions have a strong potential to protect tobacco from tobacco root rot diseases and reduce the use of chemical fungicides in tobacco plantations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3afield experimentation 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3amancozeb 3ametalaxyl 3ananomaterials 3aplantations 3aroot rot 3aseed germination 3aseedling growth 3asynergism 3athiophanate-methyl 3atobacco 0aNanochitin 0aTobacco root rot disease 0aSynergistic effect1 aJiang, Shijun1 aJiao, Yongji1 aWang, Hezhong0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.02.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02377naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011100173300001600284500001500300520100200315592002801317650002001345650003201365650000901397650001001406650001801416650002601434650002301460650002001483650001001503650001001513650001801523650002401541650001101565650001201576650002601588650001601614650002001630653001701650700002501667773009801692856008501790990002301875852000901898655001201907IND60099935020221119213622.0141105e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009993502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.09.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShegokar, Ranjita10aSurface modified nevirapine nanosuspensions for viral reservoir targeting: In vitro and in vivo evaluation  ap. 341-352.  a2019-12-06  aMost of the time HIV virus escape immunological burden exerted by antiretroviral drugs and develops resistance against therapy.

Nevirapine (NNRTI, non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) nanosuspensions were developed and surface modified with serum albumin, polysaccharide and polyethylene glycol to enhance its targeting potential. The biodistribution studies revealed improved antiretroviral drug accumulation in various organs of rat for nanosuspensions as compared to the plain drug solution when administered intravenously. Nanosuspension after surface modification showed further enhancement in accumulation. Higher MRT values of surface coated nanosuspension in brain, liver and spleen as compared to pure drug solution ensured enhanced bioavailability and prolonged residence of the drug at the target site.  aPublisher supplied data 3ain vivo studies 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3arats 3aliver 3aserum albumin 3aintravenous injection 3apatient compliance 3abioavailability 3adrugs 3abrain 3adrug toxicity 3apolyethylene glycol 3aspleen 3aviruses 3aantiretroviral agents 3anucleosides 3adrug resistance 0atherapeutics1 aSingh, Kamalinder K.0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 421, no. 2 p.341-352dElsevier B.V.x0378-51737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.09.0413Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245008700181300001800268520147400286592002801760650001201788650002001800650001501820650001101835650002801846650002401874650001101898650001701909650002101926650001701947650001601964651001301980653002501993653001602018653001502034653003502049700002602084700002302110773010002133856008702233852000902320655001202329IND60598441020221117112209.0200503e20180201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059844102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.11.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastanheira, André F.A.10aDemonstration project of a cooling system for existing PV power plants in Portugal  ap. 1297-1307.  aWater cooling continues to be an attractive solution for mitigating thermal effects in photovoltaic (PV) panels. However, a technically viable and economically effective design of a cooling system for utility-scale solar power plants already operating is still in its early developments. In this context, this work not only presents the design and characterization of a water cooling kit system specifically conducted for already existing and operating PV plants, but also takes into account various aspects of its potential as a commercial-scale product. One considers not only water and energy losses in the cooling system, optimizing it for a real industrial application, but also economic aspects as the investment cost, durability and maintenance have been taken into account. In this specific context, the cooling kit was designed to minimize its cost and also the amount of water used. An analytical model is also presented and validated to predict the PV temperature of a cooled and non-cooled panel, all based on meteorological data at the desired installation place. Prototyping and testing were done on a 20 kW PV plant functioning in a roof of an industrial building in Lisbon (Portugal). Experiments showed how cooling/heating thermal time constants of the PV panels and water ON/OFF time cycles affect PVs’ efficiency. A large amount of test data was produced and analyzed, showing how the cooling kit can increase annual energy production up to +12%.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling 3acooling systems 3adurability 3aenergy 3aindustrial applications 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3apower plants 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3atemperature 3aPortugal 0aPhotovoltaic systems 0aTemperature 0aEfficiency 0aWater-cooling system prototype1 aFernandes, João F.P.1 aBranco, P.J.

Among small plastics, microplastics are intensively studied, whereas the physicochemical properties, environmental abundance, chemical states, bioavailability and toxicity toward organisms of nanoplastics are inadequately investigated. There are substantial difficulties in separation, visualization and chemical identification of nanoplastics due to their small sizes, relatively low concentrations and interferences from coexisting substances (e.g., dyes or natural organic matters). Moreover, detection of polymers at nanoscale is largely hampered by the detection limit or sensitivity for existing spectral techniques such as Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) or Raman Spectroscopy. This article critically examined the current state of art techniques that are exclusively reported for nanoplastic characterization in environmental samples. Based on their operation principles, potential applications and limitations of these analytical techniques are carefully analyzed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3abioavailability 3adetection limit 3ananoplastics 3apollution 3atoxicity1 aWang, Qi1 aChen, Hao0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2022 Jan., v. 16, no. 1 p.11-11dHigher Education PresswJournal:J000001686x2095-22017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-021-1445-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011500172300001600287520187100303592002802174650001602202650001402218650002102232650002302253650001702276650002602293650001002319650001702329650001702346650001702363650001902380650002102399650001202420650001302432650001802445650000702463650001102470650001902481650001602500650003702516650001902553700002002572773009802592856008502690990002302775852000902798655001202807IND60099935120221119213534.0141105e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009993512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDutta, Pranabesh10aDrug solubilization by amino acid based polymeric nanoparticles: Characterization and biocompatibility studies  ap. 353-363.  aThree novel amino acid based amphiphilic copolymers, poly(sodium N acryloyl-l-aminoacidate-co-dodecylacrylamide) (where aminoacidate=glycinate, leucinate, and phenylalaninate) were synthesized and characterized. These hydrophobically modified polyelectrolytes (HMPs) formed spheroidal nanoparticular aggregates above a critical aggregation concentration with average diameter 20–200nm and overall negative charges as indicated by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta-potential (ζ≈−10.2 to −25.2) measurements, respectively. The size and shape of the nanostructures was confirmed by transmission electron microscopic images. The micropolarity and microviscosity of the nanosize aggregates were investigated by fluorescence probe method using extrinsic probes like N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine, pyrene, and 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene. The stability of the copolymer micelles was investigated as a function of pH and temperature using fluorescence and DLS techniques. Both fluorescence probe and DLS data suggest that the copolymer micelles are highly stable under physiological condition (pH 7.4, 37.4°C). These HMP micelles were evaluated primarily as a drug delivery system. The ability of the copolymers to encapsulate hydrophobic drug was investigated using a poorly water-soluble antifungal drug, griseofulvin. Biocompability of the HMPs were examined by hemolytic and cytotoxicity assay. All three HMPs were non-hemolytic up to the tested concentration of about 1.0g/L. In vitro biological assay indicated that these new copolymers were also less toxic against 3T3 mammalian cell line. The studies suggest that these newly conceived amino acid based biocompatible polymeric nanoparticles might have potential application as injectible drug delivery systems which can enhance the therapeutic index of poorly water-soluble clinically challenging drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abioassays 3abiocompatibility 3acomposite polymers 3acytotoxicity 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3aelectrolytes 3afluorescence 3agriseofulvin 3ahydrophobicity 3alight scattering 3amammals 3amicelles 3ananoparticles 3apH 3asodium 3asolubilization 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azeta potential1 aDey, Joykrishna0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 421, no. 2 p.353-363dElsevier B.V.x0378-51737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.10.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002400148245007500172300001600247520197400263592002802237650001702265650002302282650001302305650002002318650001902338650001802357650000902375650001602384651003102400700002202431700002102453700002602474773009002500856008402590852000902674655001202683IND4472667420221120052117.0150808e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447266742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2012.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee Jenni, Grace D.10aAssessing biodiversity conservation conflict on military installations  ap. 127-133.  aConflict over endangered species conservation on military lands is becoming increasingly important as militaries attempt to balance an increased operational tempo with endangered species conservation. Successfully managing this conflict has major implications for biodiversity conservation given the US military alone manages over 12 million ha of land providing habitat to hundreds of at risk species, 24 of which are endemic to military installations. This paper provides the first assessment of this issue with a qualitative study of military trainers and civilian natural resource professionals who are employed by the Department of Defense (DoD) at the interface of endangered species conservation and troop training on installations throughout the Southeastern US. Emerging conflicts over endangered species conservation on DoD lands differed from non-military contexts because military structure forced interactions into strict protocols allowing avoidance, but not direct contention. Although all informants officially stated nothing impacted training, training area supervisors described endangered species conservation the greatest threat to training they faced. Despite pointed efforts to avoid engagement and official denial that conflict existed, interactions between the groups were characterized by deindividualization and communication breakdown, residues typically associated with highly escalated conflicts. These findings suggest suppressing conflict may create the same negative outcomes typically associated with prolonged direct conflict, by denying parties the ability to resolve differences. These negative outcomes can be addressed by both acknowledging biodiversity conservation conflict exists and allowing dissent during decision-making. Improved cooperation between TASU and NRECM can help reduce impacts of warfare on wildlife conservation, while ensuring sustainability of military training on lands critical to biodiversity conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aendangered species 3ahabitats 3aland management 3amilitary lands 3aprofessionals 3arisk 3asupervisors 3aSoutheastern United States1 aNils Peterson, M.1 aCubbage, Fred W.1 aJameson, Jessica Katz0 tBiological conservation.g2012 Sept., v. 153 p.127-133dElsevier Ltdx0006-32077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2012.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01776naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245008900169300001600258520085900274592002801133650002201161650001801183650001401201650001101215650001501226700001801241773009801259856008501357990002301442852000901465655001201474IND60099935220221119213417.0141105e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009993522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.09.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhawam, Ammar10aModeling powder encapsulation in dosator-based machines: II.

The theoretical basis of the model was discussed earlier. In this part; the model was evaluated experimentally using two powder formulations with substantially different flow behavior. Encapsulation experiments were performed using a Zanasi encapsulation machine under two sets of experimental conditions. Model predicted outcomes such as encapsulation fill weight and plug height were compared to those experimentally obtained. Results showed a high correlation between predicted and actual outcomes demonstrating the model's success in predicting the encapsulation of both formulations. The model is a potentially useful in silico analysis tool that can be used for capsule dosage form development in accordance to quality by design (QbD) principles.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrug formulations 3aencapsulation 3aequipment 3amodels 3aprediction1 aSchultz, Leon0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 421, no. 2 p.210-219dElsevier B.V.x0378-51737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.09.0273Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100005400159245011200213500002200325520106800347592002801415650002801443650001201471650001201483650002101495650001701516650002401533650002301557650001101580650001901591650002101610650000901631653001401640653001201654653001801666653002101684653001501705700001901720700002901739700002001768700002301788773007801811856009301889852000901982655001201991IND60581635420221116175833.0171005s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058163542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2017.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Oisik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5474-151210aBiochar to the rescue: Balancing the fire performance and mechanical properties of polypropylene composites  aPre-press version  aBiochar based wood/polypropylene (PP) composites were manufactured with two flame retardants (FRs): ammonium polyphosphate/APP and magnesium hydroxide/Mg(OH)2. The amounts of wood and biochar were alternated for accommodating the FRs in each blend. Flammability and mechanical characterisation for both the batches containing different FRs were done. Having higher proportion of biochar and less wood is beneficial to reduce flammability. The thermally stable biochar contributes to formation of effective char to restrict O2 transfer into PP. The higher weight ratio of biochar than wood in the composites compromised the tensile and flexural strengths to some extent as the APP and Mg(OH)2 particles were trapped inside biochar pores consequently reducing the effectiveness of biochar pore infiltration by PP. In general, addition of biochar with a woody biomass (with FRs) to neat PP significantly impedes its flammability while enhancing certain mechanical properties, such as flexural strength and tensile/flexural moduli and preserving the tensile strength.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium polyphosphates 3abiochar 3abiomass 3aflame retardants 3aflammability 3amagnesium hydroxide 3amodulus of rupture 3aoxygen 3apolypropylenes 3atensile strength 3awood 0aComposite 0aBiochar 0aPolypropylene 0aFlame retardants 0aMechanical1 aKim, Nam Kyeun1 aKalamkarov, Alexander L.1 aSarmah, Ajit K.1 aBhattacharyya, D.,0 tPolymer Degradation and Stability.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2017.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03366naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011000167300001600277520202300293592002802316650001902344650000802363650001602371650001602387650001302403650002102416650001302437650001502450650002402465650002102489650001002510650001902520650001102539650001102550650002502561650001402586650001302600650003002613650002202643650001302665700002002678773010702698856008202805852000902887655001202896IND60088633920180622000000.0141102e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008863392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.riam.2012.03.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVilela, Raquel14aThe taxonomy and phylogenetics of the human and animal pathogen Rhinosporidium seeberi: A critical review  ap. 185-199.  aRhinosporidum seeberi is the etiologic agent of rhinosporidiosis, a disease of mucous membranes and infrequent of the skin and other tissues of humans and animals. Because it resists culture, for more than 100 years true taxonomic identity of R. seeberi has been controversial. Three hypotheses in a long list of related views have been recently introduced: 1) a prokaryote cyanobacterium in the genus Microcystis is the etiologic agent of rhinosporidiosis, 2) R. seeberi is a eukaryote pathogen in the Mesomycetozoa and 3) R. seeberi is a fungus. The reviewed literature on the electron microscopic, the histopathological and more recently the data from several molecular studies strongly support the view that R. seeberi is a eukaryote pathogen, but not a fungus. The suggested morphological resemblance of R. seeberi with the genera Microcystis (bacteria), Synchytrium and Colletotrichum (fungi) by different teams is merely hypothetical and lacked the scientific rigor needed to validate the proposed systems. A fundamental aspect against the prokaryote theory is the presence of nuclei reported by numerous authors and updated in this review. Moreover, Microcystis's and Synchytrium's ultra-structural and key cell cycle traits cannot be found in R. seeberi parasitic phase. The PCR amplification of a cyanobacteria 16S rDNA sequence from cases of rhinosporidiosis, while intriguing, will be viewed here as an anomaly due to contamination with environmental Microcystis or perhaps as an endosymbiotic acquisition of plastids from cyanobacteria ancestors. Thus, even if R. seeberi possesses prokaryote DNA, this does not prove that R. seeberi is a cyanobacterium. The placement of R. seeberi within the fungi is scientifically untenable. The isolation and the DNA analysis performed in a fungal strain, and the lack of appropriate controls are the main problems of this claim. Further studies are needed to validate R. seeberi's acquisition of prokaryote plastids and other issues that still need careful scrutiny.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColletotrichum 3aDNA 3aMicrocystis 3aSynchytrium 3aancestry 3aanimal pathogens 3abacteria 3acell cycle 3aelectron microscopy 3aeukaryotic cells 3afungi 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3amucosa 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aplastids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprokaryotic cells 3ataxonomy1 aMendoza, Leonel0 tRevista iberoamericana de micología.g2012 , v. 29, no. 4 p.185-199dElsevier Espanax1130-14067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.riam.2012.03.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03142naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245013400157300001800291500001500309520165600324592002801980650001802008650001602026650002202042650003402064650001802098650002002116650002502136650000902161650001802170650003302188650002602221650002202247650002502269650001702294650002602311650002002337653002402357700001502381700002102396700001902417700001202436773013002448856007302578852000902651655001202660IND60515265220221120194823.0160312e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051526522DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.72862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Qiu‐Yue10aOptimised extraction of β‐carotene from Spirulina platensis and hypoglycaemic effect in streptozotocin‐induced diabetic mice  ap. 1783-1789.  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: Spirulina platensis is rich in β‐carotene, which possesses many important biological activities. This study investigated the ultrasound‐assisted extraction and purification of β‐carotene from Spirulina platensis by using response surface methodology (RSM), determined its antioxidant capacity in vitro and explored its hypoglycaemic effect in diabetic mice. RESULTS: The raw β‐carotene extract with a concentration of 1942.14 ± 10.03 µg mL⁻¹ was obtained at the optimised condition by RSM (0.40 of the solid–liquid ratio, 51% of the extraction power, and 17 min of the extraction time), and the purity of evaporated β‐carotene extract reached 816.32 ± 10.57 mg g⁻¹ after purified by a NKA‐9 resin with a sampling and elution rate of 1 mL min⁻¹. The β‐carotene extract scavenged 1,1‐diphenyl‐2‐picrylhydrazyl and hydroxyl free radicals with the highest ratios of 44 ± 0.26% and 35 ± 0.45% respectively, and exhibited strong inhibiting capacity on anti‐lipid peroxidation. The blood glucose level of streptozotocin‐induced diabetic mice was significantly reduced from 15.81 ± 1.71 mmol L⁻¹ to 8.10 ± 0.88 mmol L⁻¹ after 10 d administration of the β‐carotene extract [100 mg kg⁻¹ body weight (BW)], and the increased food and water intakes in the diabetic mice were also significantly relieved after β‐carotene treatment. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that extraction of β‐carotene from Spirulina platensis had potential prospects in scaled‐up industrialisation and healthcare applications. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3afree radicals 3abody weight 3adiabetes mellitus 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3ablood glucose 3aglycemic effect 3aultrasonic treatment 3amice 3abeta-carotene 3aresponse surface methodology 3aArthrospira platensis 3aindustrialization 3aantioxidant activity 3aperoxidation 3aanimal disease models 3ahealth services 0aSpirulina platensis1 aFang, Ming1 aZheng, Jia‐Hui1 aRen, Di‐Feng1 aLu, Jun0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2016 Mar., v. 96, no. 5 p.1783-1789dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.72863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002900144245008800173500001900261520143900280592002801719650001001747650002701757650002001784650001001804650001101814650001401825650001201839650001001851650001601861650001601877650000901893650002001902650001101922650001201933650002401945700003001969700002101999700002502020700003202045700003002077773012602107856007802233852000902311655001202320IND60738705520221122005123.0210524e20210427xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073870552DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox100506882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez-Yerena, Anallely 10aTissue Distribution of Oleocanthal and Its Metabolites after Oral Ingestion in Rats  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aClaims for the potential health benefits of oleocanthal (OLC), a dietary phenolic compound found in olive oil, are based mainly on in vitro studies. Little is known about the tissue availability of OLC, which is rapidly metabolized after ingestion. In this study, the distribution of OLC and its metabolites in rat plasma and tissues (stomach, intestine, liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, heart, brain, thyroid and skin) at 1, 2 and 4.5 h after the acute intake of a refined olive oil containing 0.3 mg/mL of OLC was examined by LC-ESI-LTQ-Orbitrap-MS. OLC was only detected in the stomach and intestine samples. Moreover, at 2 and 4.5 h, the concentration in the stomach decreased by 36% and 74%, respectively, and in the intestine by 16% and 33%, respectively. Ten OLC metabolites arising from phase I and phase II reactions were identified. The metabolites were widely distributed in rat tissues, and the most important metabolizing organs were the small intestine and liver. The two main circulating metabolites were the conjugates OLC + OH + CH₃ and OLC + H₂O + glucuronic acid, which may significantly contribute to the beneficial health effects associated with the regular consumption of extra virgin olive oil. However, more studies are necessary to determine the concentrations and molecular structures of OLC metabolites in human plasma and tissues when consumed with the presence of other phenolic compunds present in EVOO.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3aextra-virgin olive oil 3aglucuronic acid 3aheart 3ahumans 3aingestion 3akidneys 3aliver 3ametabolites 3aoleocanthal 3arats 3asmall intestine 3aspleen 3astomach 3atissue distribution1 aVallverdú-Queralt, Anna 1 aJáuregui, Olga 1 aGarcia-Sala, Xavier 1 aLamuela-Raventós, Rosa  M.1 aEscribano-Ferrer, Elvira 0 tAntioxidants.g2021 Apr. 27, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox100506883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01461naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245005000207520047200257592002800729653000800757653000800765653000800773653002800781653002200809653002400831653002000855700006000875700001900935773009800954856008601052852000901138655001201147IND60757204520221119091011.0220110e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075720452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2021.1101502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvans, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6395-400210aBounded rationality and unemployment dynamics  aUsing the bounded rationality implementation developed in Evans et al.

The design of ideal nanoconjugates requires optimization of fundamental parameters including size, shape, ligand shell composition, and reduction in nonspecific protein adsorption. Of great importance is the choice of bioconjugation approach, given that it affects the orientation, accessibility, and bioactivity of the targeting molecule.

An antibody raised from the 16.9 kDa rice HSP also cross-reacted with the same class I LMW HSPs of the ten plant species tested. HSPs-enriched fractions (70 to 100% ammonium sulfate saturation) prepared from mung bean and rice heat-shocked seedlings were able to thermostabilize the homologous soluble proteins, as we have shown previously in soybean. Up to 50% of the soluble proteins that are normally denatured by heating at 55 degrees C for 30 min was protected when an HSPs-enriched fraction was added to either mung bean or rice protein. Additionally, the HSPs-enriched fractions were exchangeable among these three plant species for thermostabilization. The protection provided by these HSPs-enriched fractions is effective mainly for membrane-associated proteins. In soybean depletion of the 15 to 18 kDa HSPs in the HSPs-enriched fraction resulted in the loss of the thermostabilizing ability and when the 15 to 18 kDa HSPs were recovered in this fraction, the thermostabilizing ability was again restored. Thus, the 15 to 18 kDa HSPs in plant, which shuttle between the cytoplasm and cellular organelles during heat shock (HS) and recovery from HS, are responsible for providing the thermostabilization. 3aplant physiology 3acell biology 3aheat shock proteins 3aimmunology 3aplant proteins 3aheat tolerance1 aWu, S.H.1 aYeh, C.H.1 aHsieh, M.H.1 aYeh, Y.C.1 aChen, Y.M.1 aLin, C.Y.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g1993 Oct., v. 34, no. 7 p.1055-1062x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdADS  aNon-US 7aarticle01603naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245006900165300001400234520067700248653003600925653001700961653001900978653004700997700001801044700002001062700001601082773009601098852000901194856008501203946001301288655001201301IND4447515320221119005716.0110114e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444751532DNAL7 a10.1007/s10562-010-0446-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zongxian 10aDirect CO Oxidation by Lattice Oxygen on Zr-Doped Ceria Surfaces  ap. 78-82.  aSystematic density-functional calculations have been performed to address an important issue for CO oxidation on redox ceria: the role of lattice oxygen.

Neurochem. (2010) 114, 1569-1580. It has been postulated that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) might be effective treatments for neurodegenerative disorders either by replacement of lost cells by differentiation into functional neural tissue; modulation of the immune system to prevent further neurodegeneration; and/or provision of trophic support for the diseased nervous system. Here we have performed a series of experiments showing that human bone marrow-derived MSCs are able to protect cultured rodent cerebellar neurons, and specifically cells expressing Purkinje cell markers, against either nitric oxide exposure or withdrawal of trophic support via cell-cell contact and/or secretion of soluble factors, or through secretion of soluble factors alone. We have demonstrated that MSCs protect cerebellar neurons against toxic insults via modulation of both the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and MAPK pathways and defined superoxide dismutase 3 as a secreted active antioxidant biomolecule by which MSCs modulate, at least in part, their neuroprotective effect on cerebellar cells in vitro. Together, the results demonstrate new and specific mechanisms by which MSCs promote cerebellar neuronal survival and add further evidence to the concept that MSCs may be potential therapeutic agents for neurological disorders involving the cerebellum. 3abone marrow 3aneurons 3asuperoxide dismutase 2aAnimals 2aBone Marrow Cellsxphysiologyxsecretion. 2aCell Communication 2aCell Survival 2aCells, Cultured 2aCerebellumxcytology 2aCulture Media, Conditioned 2aEnzyme Activation 2aHumans 2aJNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxmetabolism 2aMesenchymal Stem Cellsxphysiologyxsecretion. 2aNeuronsxcytology 2aNitric Oxidexphysiology 2aPhosphatidylinositol 3-Kinasesxphysiology 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-aktxphysiology 2aPurkinje Cellsxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aRats 2aSignal Transduction 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexphysiologyxsecretion. 2ap38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxmetabolism 0amesenchymal stem cell 0astem cell transplantation 0aPurkinje cell1 aHares, Kelly1 aMallam, Elizabeth1 aHeesom, Kate J.1 aScolding, Neil1 aWilkins, Alastair0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2010 Sept., v. 114, no. 6 p.1569-1580dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:28254x1474-16447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06553.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100903b20101001c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02480naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008900125300001600214500001500230520124100245650002501486650003601511650002701547650002001574650001601594650002001610650002601630650001801656650002001674650002301694653001201717653004801729653001401777653003401791700001801825700001501843700001701858700001201875773008101887852000901968930003301977945001302010946001102023655001202034IND2036936520221119005239.0940127e199307  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203693652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToyoda, K.10aRapid change in polyphosphoinositide metabolism in pea in response to fungal signals  ap. 729-735.  a2019-12-05  aEffects of the elicitor and/or suppressor from Mycosphaerella pinodes on polyphosphoinositide metabolism (PI metabolism) in pea were examined both in vivo and in vitro. The elicitor induced a rapid and biphasic increase in levels of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP2) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) in epicotyl tissues that was apparent within 15 min. A transient increase in levels of PtdInsP2 and IP3 was detected immediately in elicitor-treated plasma membranes. However, the concomitant presence of suppressor with elicitor resulted in inhibition of these increases both in vivo and in vitro. These findings suggest that the elicitor rapidly activates phosphatidylinositol kinase, phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate kinase and phospholipase C, which are involved in PI metabolism, whereas the suppressor markedly inhibits these enzymes. Neomycin, a known inhibitor of phospholipase C, blocked the elicitor-induced accumulation both of IP3 and pisatin and it also induced local susceptibility in pea tissues that resembled that of the fungal suppressor. From these results, it appears that rapid changes in PI metabolism are indispensable in the signal transduction related to defense responses of pea plants. 3acell wall components 3a1-phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase 3aMycosphaerella pinodes 3aphospholipase C 3alipogenesis 3aplasma membrane 3aphosphatidylinositols 3aPisum sativum 3aenzyme activity 3adefense mechanisms 0akinases 0aphosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate kinase 0aelicitors 0aphosphotransferases (kinases)1 aShiraishi, T.1 aTamada, T.1 aIchinose, Y.1 aOku, H.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g1993 July, v. 34, no. 5 p.729-735x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02721naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245018400127300001600311500001500327520141500342650001901757650001801776650001501794650001701809650002001826650002601846650002201872650001801894650001201912650002701924650002001951650000701971650002001978650001601998650002302014653001002037653001002047700001802057700001602075700001302091773008102104852000902185930003302194945001302227946001102240655001202251IND2036932720221119005259.0940127e199307  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203693272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansen, U.P.14aThe effect of transthylakoid proton uptake on cytosolic pH and the imbalance of ATP and NAPDH/H+ production as measured by CO2- and light-induced depolarisation of the plasmalemma  ap. 681-695.  a2019-12-05  aThe light-induced changes of plasmalemma potential and of chlorophyll fluorescence were compared with changes induced by the modulation of O2- or CO2-concentration. The fast depolarization of plasmalemma potential upon illumination as labeled by the time-constant tau 4 (ca. 10 s) is used as a measure of the light-induced alkalinization of the cytosol. Firstly, these experiments on leaves of tobacco, Agopodium podagraria and spinach show that transenvelope fluxes of protons and not the uptake of CO2 mediate the changes in cytosolic pH. Comparing the light-induced depolarisations of plasmalemma potential with chlorophyll luminescence or fluorescence in Chara excluded alternative explanations like signal flow via putative thylakoid-chlorolemma connections and alkalinization by PGA-fluxes. Secondly, the occurrence of the pH changes during CO2 modulation demonstrates the imbalance of ATP and NADPH/H+ generation by the linear electron flow. Searching for mechanisms furnishing additional ATP was done by measuring heat evolution and O2-uptake by means of photoacoustic pulse experiments. They show that the Mehler reaction is active under steady-state conditions. It is stimulated when the transthylakoid pH-gradient increases. Further, the time course of heat evolution gave additional evidence that the time-constant tau 4 is related to transthylakoid proton fluxes and alkalinization in the cytosol. 3acarbon dioxide 3ahydrogen ions 3athylakoids 3afluorescence 3aChara corallina 3aAegopodium podagraria 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aion transport 3acytosol 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3apH 3aplasma membrane 3achlorophyll 3amembrane potential 0aChara 0alight1 aMoldaenke, C.1 aTabrizi, H.1 aRamm, D.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g1993 July, v. 34, no. 5 p.681-695x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02365naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245009300201300002000294506007600314520109600390506003701486650001501523650001801538650001001556650001101566650002001577650001001597650002401607700001801631700001701649773017501666852000901841856008301850930003301933946001301966655001201979IND4438450520221207072917.0100611e20100608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443845052DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10056351072doi7 aPMC28907792pmcid7 a204980802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Sean X.10aGenerating sparse and selective third-order responses in the olfactory system of the fly  ap. 10713-10718.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn the antennal lobe of Drosophila, information about odors is transferred from olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) to projection neurons (PNs), which then send axons to neurons in the lateral horn of the protocerebrum (LHNs) and to Kenyon cells (KCs) in the mushroom body. The transformation from ORN to PN responses can be described by a normalization model similar to what has been used in modeling visually responsive neurons. We study the implications of this transformation for the generation of LHN and KC responses under the hypothesis that LHN responses are highly selective and therefore suitable for driving innate behaviors, whereas KCs provide a more general sparse representation of odors suitable for forming learned behavioral associations. Our results indicate that the transformation from ORN to PN firing rates in the antennal lobe equalizes the magnitudes of and decorrelates responses to different odors through feedforward nonlinearities and lateral suppression within the circuitry of the antennal lobe, and we study how these two components affect LHN and KC responses.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3aantennal lobe 3aaxons 3amodels 3amushroom bodies 3aodors 3aolfactory receptors1 aAxel, Richard1 aAbbott, L.F.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 June 8, v. 107, no. 23 p.10713-10718dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10056351073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100612b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02694naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245006900204300002000273506007600293520154200369506003701911650001401948650001101962650003101973650001502004700002302019773017602042852000902218856008302227930003302310946001302343655001202356IND4438736720221207062518.0100619e20100615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443873672DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10032421072doi7 aPMC28907632pmcid7 a205344592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamir, Diana I.10aNeural correlates of anchoring-and-adjustment during mentalizing  ap. 10827-10832.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecent studies have suggested that the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) contributes both to understanding the mental states of others and to introspecting about one's own mind. This finding has suggested that perceivers might use their own thoughts and feelings as a starting point for making inferences about others, consistent with "simulation" or "self-projection" views of social cognition. However, perceivers cannot simply assume that others think and feel exactly as they do; social cognition also must include processes that adjust for perceived differences between self and other. Recent cognitive work has suggested that such correction occurs through a process of "anchoring-and-adjustment" by which perceivers serially tune their inferences from an initial starting point based on their own introspections. Here, we used functional MRI to test two predictions derived from this anchoring-and-adjustment view. Participants (n = 64) used a Likert scale to judge the preferences of another person and to indicate their own preferences on the same items, allowing us to calculate the discrepancy between the participant's answers for self and other. Whole-brain parametric analyses identified a region in the MPFC in which activity was related linearly to this self-other discrepancy when inferring the mental states of others. These findings suggest both that the self serves as an important starting point from which to understand others and that perceivers customize such inferences by serially adjusting away from this anchor.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acognition 3acortex 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3aprediction1 aMitchell, Jason P.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 June 15, v. 107, no. 24 p.10827-10832dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10032421073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100619b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03233naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072001700146100001600163245014900179300001600328520173900344650004302083650001302126650001902139650002702158650003002185650002002215650004102235650002302276650002102299650002002320650001802340650002302358650002402381653002502405700001602430700001902446700001702465700001602482700001602498773007102514852000902585856008602594930003302680945002502713946001302738655001202751IND4366322920221119005653.0041229e200406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436632292DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2004.88.6.6692doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Solar Set). In experiments with PGPR, Pseudomonas putida 89B61 significantly reduced bacterial wilt incidence when applied to the transplants at the time of seeding and 1 week prior to inoculation with Ralstonia solanacearum. Bio Yield, a formulated PGPR that contained two Bacillus strains, decreased disease significantly in three experiments. Equity, a formulation containing more than 40 different microbial strains, did not reduced wilt incidence compared with the untreated control. With inoculum at low pathogen densities of 1 x 10(5) and 1 x 10(6) CFU/ml, disease incidence of Actigard-treated plants was significantly less than with nontreated plants. This is the first report of Actigard-mediated reduction of bacterial wilt incidence in a susceptible tomato cultivar. When PGPR and Actigard applications were combined, Actigard plus P. putida 89B61 or BioYield reduced bacterial wilt incidence compared with the untreated control. Incorporation of S-H mixture into infested soil 2 weeks before transplanting reduced bacterial wilt incidence in one experiment. Combination of Actigard with the S-H mixture significantly reduced bacterial wilt incidence in tomato in two experiments. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3atomatoes 3abacterial wilt 3aRalstonia solanacearum 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3adisease control 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aPseudomonas putida 3aBacillus pumilus 3asoil amendments 3aagrochemicals 3abiological control 3asoil-borne diseases 0aacibenzolar-S-methyl1 aMomol, M.T.1 aKloepper, J.W.1 aMarois, J.J.1 aOlson, S.M.1 aJones, J.B.0 tPlant disease.g2004 June, v. 88, no. 6 p.669-673x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2004.88.6.6693Available from publisher's Web site  a20050718b20050802c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/03/08  aOther US 7aarticle03323naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245006700128300001400195520223500209650001302444650001102457650002302468650001302491650002102504650001902525650001902544650001102563650000702574650000902581650001502590650001102605650001602616650002302632650001402655650001802669650001002687651001402697700001902711773008102730852000902811930003302820945001302853946001102866655001202877IND2332051420221119005559.0030418e20020102ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233205142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShevenell, L.10aEffects of precipitation events on colloids in a karst aquifer  ap. 50-68.  aThe effects of precipitation events on colloid mobilization were evaluated during several storms from six wells in a karstic aquifer at the Oak Ridge Y-12 Plant in eastern Tennessee (USA). Turbidity increases and rapidly recedes following rain events. Although the magnitude of the turbidity increases are relatively small (less than or equal to 4.78 NTU), the increased turbidity suggests transient increases in colloid abundance during storm versus non-storm periods. During the larger storms (>19 mm), the increased turbidity is associated with increases in pH, total organic carbon (TOC) and temperature, and with decreases in dissolved oxygen (DO). These larger storms result in flushing of a greater proportion of higher pH, TOC (and lower DO) soil or matrix waters into the fractures and conduits than occurs during smaller storms. Smaller storms also result in increases in turbidity, but show increases in DO and decreases in pH reflecting less influence on the water chemistry from the longer residence time epikarst or and matrix waters, and greater impact from the more dilute, newly recharged waters. Due to the complexity of karst flow and temporal variations in flow and chemistry, controls on turbidity are not consistent through time and space at the wells. During smaller storms, recharge by lower ionic strength waters may promote colloid release and thus contribute to observed increases in turbidity. During larger storms, elevated turbidity may be more related to pH increases resulting from greater influx of matrix and soil waters into fractures and conduits. Chemical factors alone cannot account for the changes in turbidity observed during the various storms. Because of the complicated nature of flow and particle transport in karst aquifers, the presence of colloids during precipitation events is dictated by a complex interplay of chemical reactions and the effects of physical perturbations due to increased flow through the conduits and fractures. Simple trends in water quality parameters could not be identified, and broad generalizations cannot easily be made in karst settings, and some of the expected correlations between chemical parameters during the storms were not observed in this work. 3aaquifers 3acarbon 3achemical reactions 3acolloids 3adissolved oxygen 3ahydrochemistry 3aionic strength 3akarsts 3apH 3arain 3asoil water 3astorms 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3aturbidity 3awater quality 3awells 3aTennessee1 aMcCarthy, J.F.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2002 Jan. 2, v. 255, no. 1/4 p.50-68x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle03268naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245013900204300002000343506007600363520171700439506003702156650001802193650001002211650001702221650001002238650001502248650002002263650001902283650001102302650003002313650000902343650001202352650001402364650001702378650002102395700002002416700001802436700001802454773017602472852000902648856008302657930003302740946001302773655001202786IND4438738520221207073606.0100619e20100615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443873852DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09146421072doi7 aPMC28907312pmcid7 a205344752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsumoto, Kazu12aA mouse model of chondrocyte-specific somatic mutation reveals a role for Ext1 loss of heterozygosity in multiple hereditary exostoses  ap. 10932-10937.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMultiple hereditary exostoses (MHE) is one of the most common skeletal dysplasias, exhibiting the formation of multiple cartilage-capped bony protrusions (osteochondroma) and characteristic bone deformities. Individuals with MHE carry heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in Ext1 or Ext2, genes which together encode an enzyme essential for heparan sulfate synthesis. Despite the identification of causative genes, the pathogenesis of MHE remains unclear, especially with regard to whether osteochondroma results from loss of heterozygosity of the Ext genes. Hampering elucidation of the pathogenic mechanism of MHE, both Ext1⁺/⁻ and Ext2⁺/⁻ heterozygous mutant mice, which mimic the genetic status of human MHE, are highly resistant to osteochondroma formation, especially in long bones. To address these issues, we created a mouse model in which Ext1 is stochastically inactivated in a chondrocyte-specific manner. We show that these mice develop multiple osteochondromas and characteristic bone deformities in a pattern and a frequency that are almost identical to those of human MHE, suggesting a role for Ext1 LOH in MHE. Surprisingly, however, genotyping and fate mapping analyses reveal that chondrocytes constituting osteochondromas are mixtures of mutant and wild-type cells. Moreover, osteochondromas do not possess many typical neoplastic properties. Together, our results suggest that inactivation of Ext1 in a small fraction of chondrocytes is sufficient for the development of osteochondromas and other skeletal defects associated with MHE. Because the observed osteochondromas in our mouse model do not arise from clonal growth of chondrocytes, they cannot be considered true neoplasms.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3abones 3achondrocytes 3agenes 3agenotyping 3aheparan sulfate 3aheterozygosity 3ahumans 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amice 3amutants 3aneoplasms 3apathogenesis 3asomatic mutation1 aIrie, Fumitoshi1 aMackem, Susan1 aYamaguchi, Yu0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 June 15, v. 107, no. 24 p.10932-10937dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09146421073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100619b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03330naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245010000203300002000303506007600323520171600399506003702115650002502152650001402177650002502191650001202216650001002228650000902238650001102247650001802258650001202276650002902288650002602317700002002343700002802363700002202391700001902413700002002432700001802452700001902470700002102489773017602510852000902686856008302695930003302778946001302811655001202824IND4438738420221207073600.0100619e20100615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443873842DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09076011072doi7 aPMC28907672pmcid7 a205081492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeki, Yasuhiro10aTIF1β regulates the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells in a phosphorylation-dependent manner  ap. 10926-10931.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTranscription networks composed of various transcriptional factors specifically expressed in undifferentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells have been implicated in the regulation of pluripotency in ES cells. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for self-renewal, maintenance of pluripotency, and lineage specification during differentiation of ES cells are still unclear. The results of this study demonstrate that a phosphorylation-dependent chromatin relaxation factor, transcriptional intermediary factor-1β (TIF1β), is a unique regulator of the pluripotency of ES cells and regulates Oct3/4-dependent transcription in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. TIF1β is specifically phosphorylated in pluripotent mouse ES cells at the C-terminal serine 824, which has been previously shown to induce chromatin relaxation. Phosphorylated TIF1β is partially colocalized at the activated chromatin markers, and forms a complex with the pluripotency-specific transcription factor Oct3/4 and subunits of the switching defective/sucrose nonfermenting, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex, Smarcad1, Brg-1, and BAF155, all of which are components of an ES-specific chromatin remodeling complex, esBAF. Phosphorylated TIF1β specifically induces ES cell-specific genes and enables prolonged main-tenance of an undifferentiated state in mouse ES cells. Moreover, TIF1β regulates the reprogramming process of somatic cells in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Our results suggest that TIF1β provides a phosphorylation-dependent, bidirectional platform for specific transcriptional factors and chromatin remodeling enzymes that regulate the cell differentiation process and the pluripotency of stem cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell differentiation 3achromatin 3aembryonic stem cells 3aenzymes 3agenes 3amice 3aserine 3asomatic cells 3asucrose 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aKurisaki, Akira1 aWatanabe-Susaki, Kanako1 aNakajima, Yoshiro1 aNakanishi, Mio1 aArai, Yoshikazu1 aShiota, Kunio1 aSugino, Hiromu1 aAsashima, Makoto0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 June 15, v. 107, no. 24 p.10926-10931dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09076011073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100619b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02398naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001800136245009200154300001600246520122900262650002201491650001001513650001901523650002801542650002201570650002501592650002501617650002001642650002101662653001201683653002801695653001901723700001601742700001901758700001501777773013001792852000901922930003301931945001301964946001101977655001201988IND2051798520221119005616.0960620e19960215enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205179852DNAL7 ano direct match2pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichael, A.J.10aMolecular cloning and functional identification of a plant ornithine decarboxylase cDNA  ap. 241-248.  aA cDNA for a plant ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a key enzyme in putrescine and polyamine biosynthesis, has been isolated from root cultures of the solanaceous plant Datura stramonium. Reverse transcription-PCR employing degenerate oligonucleotide primers representing conserved motifs from other eukaryotic ODCs was used to isolate the cDNA. The longest open reading frame potentially encodes a peptide of 431 amino acids and exhibits similarity to other eukaryotic ODCs, prokaryotic and eukaryotic arginine decarboxylases (ADCs), prokaryotic meso-diaminopimelate decarboxylases and the product of the tabA gene of Pseudomonas syringae cv. tabaci. Residues involved at the active site of the mouse ODC are conserved in the plant enzyme. The plant ODC does not possess the C-terminal extension found in the mammalian enzyme, implicated in rapid turnover of the protein, suggesting that the plant ODC may have a longer half-life. Expression of the plant ODC in Escherichia coli and demonstration of ODC activity confirmed that the cDNA encodes an active ODC enzyme. This is the first description of the primary structure of a eukaryotic ODC isolated from an organism where the alternative ADC route to putrescine is present. 3aDatura stramonium 3aroots 3atissue culture 3aornithine decarboxylase 3acomplementary DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aEscherichia coli 0acloning 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x878471 aFurze, J.M.1 aRhodes, M.J.C.1 aBurtin, D.0 tBiochemical journal.g1996 Feb. 15, v. 314, no. pt.1 p.241-248aBiochemical journal (London, England : 1984)x0264-60217nnas  aDNAL  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02060naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001800136245014300154300001600297500001500313520092600328650002901254650001701283650001501300650000801315650001601323650001101339653001701350653002201367653001401389653001501403700001201418700001801430700001701448773013101465852000901596930003301605945001301638946001101651655001201662IND2043187720221119005446.0941110e19940915enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204318772DNAL7 ano direct match2pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNielsen, G.M.10aPurification and characterization of an oxygen-stable form of dinitrogenase reductase-activating glycohydrolase from Rhodospirillum rubrum  ap. 801-806.  a2019-12-05  aDinitrogenase reductase-activating glycohydrolase (DRAG) is responsible for removing the ADP-ribose moiety from posttranslationally inactivated nitrogenase of Rhodospirillum rubrum. Using DRAG purified from an overexpressing strain (UR276), further properties of this enzyme were studied, including its u.v.-visible and fluorescence spectra and its stability in air. DRAG appears to require no covalently bound inorganic cofactors for its activity or regulation. Previously, purified DRAG was found to be rapidly inactivated in air. The air-catalysed lability originated with the presence of sodium dithionite and Mn2+ throughout the purification of the enzyme. This lability can be mimicked using H2O2, which is known to oxidatively inactivate proteins containing bivalent metals. Implications for the regulation of nitrogenase are discussed with respect to the lack of sensitivity to air of the regulatory enzyme, DRAG. 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3ainactivation 3ahydrolases 3aair 3anitrogenase 3aoxygen 0apurification 0aaerobic treatment 0astability 0adithionite1 aBao, Y.1 aRoberts, G.P.1 aLudden, P.W.0 tBiochemical journal.g1994 Sept. 15, v. 302, no. pt.3 p.801-806aBiochemical journal (London, England : 1984)x0264-60217nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03130naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245005900161300001500220520212200235650001202357650001702369653001602386653000902402653002302411700001902434700001902453700001502472700002002487700001802507773011702525852000902642856008502651930003302736946001102769655001202780IND4447252320221119005458.0110107e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444725232DNAL7 a10.1007/s11010-010-0643-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunjal, C. 10aMesenteric vascular remodeling in hyperhomocysteinemia  ap. 99-108.  aRemodeling by its very nature implies synthesis and degradation of extracellular matrix components (such as elastin, collagen, and connexins). Most of the vascular matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) are latent because of the presence of constitutive nitric oxide (NO). However, during oxidative stress peroxinitrite (ONOO-) activates the latent MMPs and instigates vascular remodeling. Interestingly, in mesenteric artery, homocysteine (Hcy) decreases the NO bio-availability, and folic acid (FA, an Hcy-lowering agent) mitigates the Hcy-mediated mesentery artery dysfunction. Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-2 (DDAH-2) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) increases NO production. The hypothesis was that the Hcy decreased NO bio-availability, in part, activating MMP, decreasing elastin, DDAH-2, eNOS and increased vasomotor response by increasing connexin. To test this hypothesis,the authors used 12-week-old C57BJ/L6 wild type (WT) and hyperhomocysteinemic (HHcy)-cystathione beta synthase heterozygote knockout (CBS+/−) mice. Blood pressure measurements were made by radio-telemetry. WT and MMP-9 knockout mice were administered with Hcy (0.67 mg/ml in drinking water). Superior mesenteric artery and mesenteric arcade were analyzed with light and confocal microscopy. The protein expressions were measured by western blot analysis. The mRNA levels for MMP-9 were measured by RT-PCR. The data showed decreased DDAH-2 and eNOS expressions in mesentery in CBS−/+ mice compared with WT mice. Immuno-fluorescence and western blot results suggest increased MMP-9 and connexin-40 expression in mesenteric arcades of CBS−/+ mice compared with WT mice. The wall thickness of third-order mesenteric artery was increased in CBS−/+ mice compared to WT mice. Hcy treatment increased blood pressure in WT mice. Interestingly, in MMP-9 KO, Hcy did not increase blood pressure. These results may suggest that HHcy causes mesenteric artery remodeling and narrowing by activating MMP-9 and decreasing DDAH-2 and eNOS expressions, compromising the blood flow, instigating hypertension, and acute abdomen pain. 3aelastin 3ahypertension 0aEndothelial 0aDDAH 0aResistance vessels1 aGivvimani, S. 1 aQipshidze, N. 1 aTyagi, N. 1 aFalcone, J.

  1 aIroume, A.10aSummer flows in experimental catchments with different forest covers, Chile  ap. 300-313.  aRunoff and peak flows in four experimental catchments with different land uses are analyzed for summer periods. The catchments have a rainy temperate climate with annual precipitations between 2000 and 2500 mm, 70% of which is concentrated in the winter period between May and August. The final harvest of the forest plantation in one of these catchments generated increases in summer runoff. Also, differences between the maximum instantaneous discharge and the flow at the beginning of the storm then almost duplicated those registered in rainfall events of similar magnitude when the catchment was fully forested. Runoff analysis in this catchment is difficult because the two post-harvesting summer periods are much wetter than the two pre-harvesting ones but a double mass analysis shows the effect of harvesting clearly. In a paired catchment study, low cover in one of the two neighbour catchments explains higher direct runoff and base flows although lower maximum instantaneous specific discharge occurred in the less vegetated but larger catchment. Low vegetation cover explains increases in summer flows, although the size, topography, rainfall conditions, road density, extent of affected area and runoff generation processes play an important role in the hydrological effects of different land uses. 3aforested watersheds 3asummer 3awatershed hydrology 3aforest hydrology 3astream flow 3aland use 3arunoff 3aforest plantations 3alogging 3aPinus radiata 3aEucalyptus nitens 3aChile1 aHuber, A.1 aSchulz, K.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2005 Jan. 10, v. 300, no. 1-4 p.300-313x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a20060512b20060607c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02837naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002000127245007700147300001300224520190100237650002402138650001602162650001902178650001302197650002302210650001602233650002002249651001602269653002502285700001802310773008102328852000902409930003302418945002502451946001102476655001202487IND4367925820221119005347.0050325e20050120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436792582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aFortuin, N.P.M.10aExsolution of nitrogen and argon by methanogenesis in Dutch ground water  ap. 1-13.  aDutch ground water was sampled under high pressure in stainless steel vessels and analysed by gas chromatography for Ar, N2, CH4 and O2. Results show a deficit N2 and Ar concentrations combined with a high CH4 concentration that are attributed to the occurrence of exsolution of Ar and N2 during methanogenesis (the focus of this article). They also show N2 and Ar in concentrations exceeding the concentration in equilibrium with atmospheric air that are caused by the entrapment and subsequent (partial) dissolution of excess air; in recent ground water, N2 excesses also are caused by denitrification. PHREEQC model runs of methanogenesis at different pressures, with different amounts of organic matter decomposition and different amounts of initial dissolved N2 show five features. Firstly, methanogenesis under lower hydrostatic pressures causes more N2 and Ar exsolution than methanogenesis under higher hydrostatic pressures. Secondly, when little organic matter is decomposed (e.g. 1 mmol/l), the value taken for the fixed total pressure (between 1.05 and 3.0 atm.) influences mostly the N2 and Ar concentration, and when much organic matter is decomposed (e.g. 16 mmol/l), the value taken for the fixed total pressure influences mostly the CH4 concentration. Thirdly, in order to explain the observed gas concentrations, not more than 27 mmol of organic matter should be decomposed per litre of soil. Fourthly, the PHREEQC run with initial denitrification (initial N2 pressure=1.0 atm.) fits the data better than the PHREEQC run without initial denitrification. Fifthly, the maximum total pressure of bubble formation is 3.0 atm. Analysed gas concentration profiles show that the greatest source of CH4 is found up to approximately 20 m below surface. However, samples with CH4 partial pressures >0.25 atm. were found up to a maximum average sampling screen depth of 81 m below surface. 3aargon (noble gases) 3agroundwater 3ahydrochemistry 3anitrogen 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3adenitrification 3aNetherlands 0ahydrostatic pressure1 aWillemsen, A.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2005 Jan. 20, v. 301, no. 1-4 p.1-13x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a20060925b20061003c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/11  aNon-US 7aarticle03041naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245013400189300001800323520143300341650003801774650002401812650002101836650002501857650001101882650005501893650005001948650001101998650004102009650000902050650001602059650001502075650001702090650005902107651002802166653003002194700001702224700001802241700002302259700002202282773011702304852000902421856008502430930003302515946001102548655001202559IND4440104120221119004738.0100716e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444010412DNAL7 a203730112pmid7 a10.1007/s10552-010-9553-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeleteiro, Bárbara 10aFactors contributing to the underestimation of Helicobacter pylori-associated gastric cancer risk in a high-prevalence population  ap. 1257-1264.  aObjective This study aimed to identify sources of underestimation of the association between Helicobacter pylori infection and non-cardia gastric cancer, in a high-risk European population. Methods Non-cardia gastric cancer patients (n = 420) recruited in two major hospitals in North of Portugal and population controls (n = 1,389) were evaluated. Whole-cell IgG antibodies against H. pylori were quantified by ELISA and Western Blot testing was conducted in a subsample (272 cases and 186 controls) allowing for the detection of current infection marker and CagA. Sex- and age-adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were computed. Results When assessing infection by ELISA, the OR for its association with gastric cancer decreases and reverts as IgG titers increased, from 1.96 (95% CI: 1.09-3.54) for borderline positive results (16.0-21.9 RU/ml) to 0.52 (95% CI: 0.36-0.74) for the highest IgG levels (≥102.0 RU/ml). The same pattern was observed across strata of age and blood collection timing with stronger associations among younger subjects and those providing blood samples earlier after diagnosis. The presence of CagA (Western Blot) was associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer (OR = 11.32; 95% CI: 5.64-22.73). Conclusion The use of methods with low sensitivity to detect past infection leads to a substantial underestimation of gastric cancer risk in high-prevalence settings. 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aWestern blotting 2aCase-Control Studies 2aFemale 2aHelicobacter Infectionsxepidemiologyximmunology. 2aHelicobacter pylorixisolation & purification 2aHumans 2aImmunoglobulin Gxbloodximmunology. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPrevalence 2aRisk Factors 2aStomach Neoplasmsxepidemiologyximmunologyxvirology. 0aPortugalxepidemiology. 0aNon-cardia gastric cancer1 aLunet, Nuno 1 aBarros, Rita 1 aLa Vecchia, Carlo 1 aBarros, Henrique 0 tCancer causes & control.g2010 Aug., v. 21, no. 8 p.1257-1264dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0957-52437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10552-010-9553-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20100716b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03326naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012400127300001600251520241700267650001702684650002102701650001402722650002202736650002402758700002002782700001902802700001302821700001702834773008302851852000902934930003302943945001302976946001102989655001203000IND2334166620221119004749.0030926e20030401ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233416662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDewandel, B.10aEvaluation of aquifer thickness by analysing recession hydrographs. Application to the Oman ophiolite hard-rock aquifer  ap. 248-269.  aFor more than a century, hydrologists and hydrogeologists have been investigating the processes of stream and spring baseflow recession, for obtaining data on aquifer characteristics. The Maillet Formula [Librairie Sci., A. Hermann, Paris (1905) 218], an exponential equation widely used for recession curve analysis, is an approximate analytical solution for the diffusion equation in porous media whereas the equation proposed by Boussinesq [C. R. Acad. Sci. 137 (1903) 5; J. Math. Pure Appl. 10 (1904) 5], that depicts baseflow recession as a quadratic form, is an exact analytical solution. Other formulas currently used involve mathematical functions with no basis on groundwater theory. Only the exact analytical solutions can provide quantitative data on aquifer characteristics. The efficiency of the two methods was compared on the basis of recession curves obtained with a 2D cross-sectional finite differences model that simulates natural aquifers. Simulations of shallow aquifers with an impermeable floor at the level of the outlet show that their recession curves have a quadratic form. Thus, the approximate Maillet solution largely overestimates the duration of the 'influenced' stage and underestimates the dynamic volume of the aquifer. Moreover, only the Boussinesq equations enable correct estimates of the aquifer parameters. Numerical simulations of more realistic aquifers, with an impermeable floor much deeper than the outlet, proves the robustness of the Boussinesq formula even under conditions far from the simplifying assumptions that were used to integrate the diffusion equation. The quadratic form of recession is valid regardless of the thickness of the aquifer under the outlet, and provides good estimates of the aquifer's hydrodynamic parameters. Nevertheless, the same numerical simulations show that aquifers with a very deep floor provide an exponential recession. Thus, in that configuration, the Maillet formula also provides a good fit of recession curves, even if parameter estimation remains poor. In fact, the recession curve appears to be closer to exponential when flow has a very important vertical component, and closer to quadratic when horizontal flow is dominant. As a consequence, aquifer permeability anisotropy also changes the recession form. The combined use of the two fitting methods allows one to quantify the thickness of the aquifer under the outlet. 3ahydrogeology 3agroundwater flow 3abase flow 3ahydrologic models 3amathematical models1 aLachassagne, P.1 aBakalowicz, M.1 aWeng, P.1 aAl-Malki, A.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2003 Apr. 1, v. 274, no. 1/4 p.248-269x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a20031103b20031113c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle01747naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245006700158300001600225520091400241650002301155650001901178650001401197650002001211650002401231700001601255773008401271852000901355930003301364945002501397946001101422655001201433IND4367923120221119004651.0050325e20050110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436792312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Some versions that require a land surface temperature instead of a humidity measurement could potentially be used with routine remotely sensed surface temperature data. A comparison of alternative complementary approaches, including those that require land surface temperatures, was made at small (10-30 min) time scales with point measurements spatially, using data from the FIFE, CASES, SGP, and Sahel field experiments. The advection-aridity version and a related version based on the Penman and the Priestley-Taylor equations performed the best overall. One of the four versions that incorporated land surface temperature performed fairly well. The complementary approach appears to remain viable, especially in remote sensing applications with sparse data. 3aevapotranspiration 3aenergy balance 3aequations 3agrassland soils 3amathematical models1 aCrowley, R.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2005 Jan. 10, v. 300, no. 1-4 p.199-211x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a20060512b20060607c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02815naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002300161245011000184300001600294500001500310520161400325650004101939650002201980650000902002650001902011650001102030650001802041650002202059651001402081653002402095653004802119700002302167700002002190700002102210773008402231852000902315930003302324945002502357946001102382655001202393IND4367922720221119004741.0050325e20050110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436792272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In this paper, a simple exponential rainfall depth-intensity distribution (ERDID) was tested, involving only two storm characteristics that are easily calculated from rainfall intensity measurements: rainfall depth (P) and depth-averaged rainfall intensity (R). This distribution fitted well to tipping bucket rainfall intensity measurements during 30 storms of 33-81 mm in West Java, Indonesia. The ERDID was used to derive analytical expressions for the hydrological model variables of two commonly used erosion models, i.e. the 'R' factor in RUSLE and normalised soil loss in GUEST. The ERDID-based expressions reproduced hydrological variables for the 30 storms with high accuracy for both models (mean difference of +/-4-17% for individual storms and between -2 and 14% on aggregate). A comparison of results obtained with the original (high temporal resolution) measurements and data resampled into 5-min intervals shows that resampling had a significant effect on calculations with the original models (cumulative values were decreased by 2-26%). In some cases the use of ERDID-based expressions with distribution parameters calculated from resampled data partially corrected this underestimation. The proposed rainfall depth-intensity distribution combines physically meaningful, clearly defined variables with theoretical simplicity and high descriptive accuracy and so provides a good scope for further application in runoff and erosion modelling. 3aRevised Universal Soil Loss Equation 3asimulation models 3arain 3arain intensity 3arunoff 3awater erosion 3ahydrologic models 3aIndonesia 0amathematical models 0aGriffith University Erosion System Template1 aMeesters, A.G.C.A.1 aSchellekens, J.1 aBruijnzeel, L.A.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2005 Jan. 10, v. 300, no. 1-4 p.155-171x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a20060512b20060607c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02883naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245011400171300001600285520155800301650002901859650002001888650001501908650001401923650001201937650001001949650002201959650002301981650001002004650002202014650001502036650001402051651001402065653003002079653003202109700002002141700002002161773012302181852000902304856009202313930003302405946001102438655001202449IND4440279520221119004925.0100723e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444027952DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-9993.2009.02057.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPRICE, JODI N.10aRecovery of understorey vegetation after release from a long history of sheep grazing in a herb-rich woodland  ap. 505-514.  aThe effects of stock grazing on native grassy ecosystems in temperate southern Australia are well documented. However, less is known about the potential of ecosystems to recover after a long history of stock grazing and, in particular, whether the removal of stock will have positive, negative or neutral impacts on biodiversity. We examined the response of understorey vegetation to the removal of sheep grazing in a herb-rich Eucalyptus camaldulensis (red gum) woodland in western Victoria. Using a space-for-time chronosequence, woodlands were stratified into groups based on their time-since-grazing removal; these were long-ungrazed (>20 years), intermediate-time-since-grazing (9-14 years), recently ungrazed (5 years) and continuously grazed. We found significantly higher species density in long-ungrazed sites relative to sites with a more recent grazing history. No differences were found in species density between continuously grazed sites and those ungrazed in the previous 14 years. Species composition differed with time-since-grazing removal and indicator species analysis detected several native species (including tall native geophytes and herbs) associated with long-ungrazed sites that were absent or in low abundance in the more recently grazed sites. Seven of the eight species significantly associated with continuously grazed sites were exotic. Removal of sheep grazing in red gum woodlands can have positive benefits for understorey diversity but it is likely that recovery of key indicators such as native species will be slow. 3aEucalyptus camaldulensis 3achronosequences 3aecosystems 3ageophytes 3agrazing 3aherbs 3aindicator species 3aindigenous species 3asheep 3aspecies diversity 3aunderstory 3awoodlands 3aAustralia 0aalternative stable states 0aspace-for-time substitution1 aWONG, NATHAN K.1 aMorgan, John W.0 tAustral ecology.g2010 Aug., v. 35, no. 5 p.505-514dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax1442-99857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2009.02057.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100723b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03053naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001700179245010700196300001600303500002400319506007600343520184600419506003702265650001502302650001702317650001702334650001102351650001902362650001302381650002502394700001602419700001502435773009802450852000902548856007802557856003202635655001202667IND4391118520221207072416.0070506e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439111852DNAL7 a10.1093/aob/mcm0192doi7 aPMC28029112pmcid7 a173471612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCramer, M.D.10aDoes the Prostrate-leaved Geophyte Brunsvigia orientalis Utilize Soil-derived CO₂ for Photosynthesis  ap. 835-844.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: A test was made of the hypothesis that the prostrate growth habit of the leaves of the geophyte Brunsvigia orientalis enables utilization of soil-derived CO₂ and is related to the presence of lysigenous air-filled channels characteristic of B. orientalis leaves. METHODS BRUNSVIGIA ORIENTALIS: was sampled at a field site. Leaf anatomy, stomatal density, leaf/soil gas exchange characteristics and soil atmosphere and leaf δ¹³C isotope abundances were examined. KEY RESULTS: The leaves of B. orientalis have large lysigenous air-filled channels separating the upper and lower surfaces of the leaves. The upper surface comprised approx. 70 % of the leaf mass and 75 % of the leaf N (mmol g⁻¹). Between 20 % and 30 % of the stomatal conductance and CO₂ assimilation was through the lower surface of the leaf. CO₂ efflux rates from the soil surface were up to 5·4 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ while photosynthetic fluxes through the lower surface of the leaves were approx. 7 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹. However, the utilization of soil-derived CO₂ only altered the leaf δ¹³C isotope abundance of the prostrate leaves by a small amount. Using δ¹³C values it was estimated that 7 % of the leaf tissue C was derived from soil-derived CO₂. CONCLUSIONS: A small proportion of photosynthetically fixed CO₂ was derived from the soil, with minimal associated transpirational H₂O loss into the space between the leaf and soil. The soil-derived CO₂, taken up through the lower surface was probably assimilated by the palisade tissue in the upper surface of the leaf which was exposed to sunlight and where most of the leaf N was located. The occurrence of lysigenous air channels in the leaves may provide longitudinal strength without impaired transfer of CO₂ taken up through the lower surface to the upper surface.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrunsvigia 3agas exchange 3agrowth habit 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3asoil air 3astomatal conductance1 aKleizen, C.1 aMorrow, C.0 tAnnals of botany.g2007 May, v. 99, no. 5 p.835-844dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcm0193Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aob.oupjournals.org/ 7aarticle02979naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245011700184300001600301520142000317650004401737650001801781650002501799650001501824650001901839650001101858650004301869650004101912650005401953650003802007653002202045653003102067653001802098653001702116700002002133700002202153700001902175700001902194700002302213773013502236852000902371856008502380930003302465946001102498655001202509IND4441324320221119004714.0100813e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444132432DNAL7 a205826942pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-010-3924-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKammer, Martin 10aSpatially resolved determination of the structure and composition of diatom cell walls by Raman and FTIR imaging  ap. 509-517.  aVibrational spectroscopic imaging has developed into a versatile tool to study the local composition of various materials. Here, we present for the first time that Raman mapping and Fourier transform infrared imaging are useful tools to study diatom cell walls as is demonstrated for the species Stephanopyxis turris. The unicellular diatoms exhibit intricately micro- and nano-patterned cell walls, which consist of amorphous silica as well as various organic and inorganic constituents, thus making up an extremely interesting inorganic/organic hybrid material. The structure and composition of this material as well as the biochemical and biophysical processes leading to its formation remain to be challenges for ongoing research. Whereas the lateral resolution of Fourier transform infrared imaging is limited to 5 μm by diffraction, Raman maps are shown to be capable of detecting the spatial distribution of the silica as well as an additional inorganic component and the organic material down to 330-nm resolution. Due to the spherical shape of the sample with a radius of 40 μm and the requirement to accurately focus the laser before each Raman measurement within the micrometer range, Raman maps of whole diatom cell walls were registered after an adjustment of the axial position. The results reveal local differences in the cell wall composition of the honeycomb-like structures and the bottom layer. 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aStephanopyxis 3acell wall components 3acell walls 3aimage analysis 3asilica 2aCell Wallxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aDiatomsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infraredxmethods 2aSpectrum Analysis, Ramanxmethods 0aBiomineralization 0aOrganic cell wall material 0aRaman mapping 0aFTIR imaging1 aHedrich, René 1 aEhrlich, Hermann 1 aPopp, Jürgen.1 aBrunner, Eike 1 aKrafft, Christoph 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2010 Sept., v. 398, no. 1 p.509-517dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-010-3924-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20100813b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02708naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245014100125300001600266300002100282500001500303520164200318650001301960650001201973650002101985650001302006650001802019650001602037650001702053653001102070653001502081653001302096653002302109653001702132700001602149700001702165773007302182852000902255939003302264946001302297655001202310IND8905195620221119004759.0890921e198905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890519562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbad, M.S.10aProperties of a chloroplast enzyme that cleaves the chlorophyll a/b binding protein precursor.

We have previously (GK Lamppa, M Abad [1987] J Cell Biol 105: 2641-2648) identified a soluble enzyme that cleaves the LHCP precursor (pLHCP). In this study, we describe the conditions for optimal recovery of the processing activity and provide evidence that the N terminus of pLHCP is indeed cleaved, removing the transit peptide. Two pLHCP deletions were made from a cloned pLHCP gene removing 13 and 21 amino acids, respectively, from the carboxy terminus of the protein. After organelle-free processing, the cleavage products showed a shift in mobility during SDS-PAGE proportional to the size of the precursor truncations, as predicted for N-terminal processing. Unexpectedly, a third truncated precursor lacking 91 residues of the C-terminus was not cleaved although the transit peptide domain was intact, suggesting that this deletion disrupted conformational features of the precursor necessary for processing. The pLHCP processing enzyme is inhibited by 2 millimolar EDTA and the metal chelator 1,10 phenanthroline at 0.4 millimolar, while being inhibited by EGTA only at high concentrations and insensitive to iodoacetate. Optimal processing occurs at pH 8 to 9, and 26 degrees C. Gel filtration chromatography shows that the pLHCP processing enzyme has an apparent molecular weight of about 240,000. The identical column fractions that process pLHCP also convert the precursor of the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase to its mature form. 3aTriticum 3aenzymes 3abinding proteins 3aplasmids 3aPisum sativum 3achlorophyll 3achloroplasts 0agrowth 0aprecursors 0acleavage 0amolecular genetics 0acell biology1 aClark, S.E.1 aLamppa, G.K.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 May, v. 90, no. 1 p.117-124x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02599naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245009400148300001600242300002100258500001500279520161900294650001201913650001501925650002201940650002001962650002001982653001502002653001702017700001502034700001502049700001602064700001702080773007302097852000902170939003302179946001302212655001202225IND8905198820221119004800.0890926e198905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890519882DNAL7 a166667572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrouquisse, R.10aEvidence for a ferredoxin-dependent choline monooxygenase from spinach chloroplast stroma  ap. 322-329.  ap. 322-329. ill.  a2019-12-05  aChenopods synthesize betaine in the chloroplast via a two-step oxidation of choline: choline leads to betaine aldehyde leads to betaine. Our previous experiments with intact chloroplasts, and in vivo 18O2 labeling studies, led us to propose that the first step is mediated by a monooxygenase which uses photosynthetically generated reducing power (C Lerma, AD Hanson, D Rhodes [1988] Plant Physiol 88: 695-702). Here, we report the detection of such an activity in vitro. In the presence of O2 and reduced ferredoxin, the stromal fraction from spinach (Spinacia oleracea) chloroplasts converted choline to betaine aldehyde at rates similar to those in intact chloroplasts (20-50 nanomoles per hour per milligram protein). Incorporation of 18O from 18O2 by the in vitro reaction was demonstrated by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. Ferredoxin could be reduced either with thylakoids in the light, or with NADPH plus ferredoxin-NADP reductase in darkness; NADPH alone could not substitute for ferredoxin. No choline-oxidizing actaivity was detected in the stromal fraction of pea (Pisum sativum L.), a species that does not accumulate betaine. The spinach choline-oxidizing enzyme was stimulated by 10 millimolar Mg2+, had a pH optimum close to 8, and was insensitive to carbon monoxide. The specific activity was increased threefold in plants growing in 200 millimolar NaCl. Gel filtration experiments gave a molecular weight of 98 kilodaltons for the choline-oxidizing enzyme, and provided no evidence for other electron carriers which might mediate the reduction of the 98-kilodalton enzyme by ferredoxin. 3acholine 3athylakoids 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aoxidoreductases 3aenzyme activity 0aferredoxin 0achloroplasts1 aWeigel, P.1 aRhodes, D.1 aYocum, C.F.1 aHanson, A.D.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 May, v. 90, no. 1 p.322-329x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03744naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245009400206300002000300500001500320506007600335520171200411506003702123650002602160650002502186650001302211650001102224650002602235650001802261650002902279650000902308650001302317650002502330650001002355650002202365650001502387650001102402653001002413700002902423700001902452700002502471700002102496700002502517700002002542700002502562700002302587700002202610700002002632700001902652700001902671700001502690700001802705700002402723700002202747773017502769852000902944856008302953930003303036946001303069655001203082IND4438447120221207070607.0100611e20100608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443844712DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09122601072doi7 aPMC28908512pmcid7 a204980462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalomonis, Nathan10aAlternative splicing regulates mouse embryonic stem cell pluripotency and differentiation  ap. 10514-10519.  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTwo major goals of regenerative medicine are to reproducibly transform adult somatic cells into a pluripotent state and to control their differentiation into specific cell fates. Progress toward these goals would be greatly helped by obtaining a complete picture of the RNA isoforms produced by these cells due to alternative splicing (AS) and alternative promoter selection (APS). To investigate the roles of AS and APS, reciprocal exon-exon junctions were interrogated on a genome-wide scale in differentiating mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells with a prototype Affymetrix microarray. Using a recently released open-source software package named AltAnalyze, we identified 144 genes for 170 putative isoform variants, the majority (67%) of which were predicted to alter protein sequence and domain composition. Verified alternative exons were largely associated with pathways of Wnt signaling and cell-cycle control, and most were conserved between mouse and human. To examine the functional impact of AS, we characterized isoforms for two genes. As predicted by AltAnalyze, we found that alternative isoforms of the gene Serca2 were targeted by distinct microRNAs (miRNA-200b, miRNA-214), suggesting a critical role for AS in cardiac development. Analysis of the Wnt transcription factor Tcf3, using selective knockdown of an ES cell-enriched and characterized isoform, revealed several distinct targets for transcriptional repression (Stmn2, Ccnd2, Atf3, Klf4, Nodal, and Jun) as well as distinct differentiation outcomes in ES cells. The findings herein illustrate a critical role for AS in the specification of ES cells with differentiation, and highlight the utility of global functional analyses of AS.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atranscription factors 3aalternative splicing 3amedicine 3ahumans 3amicroarray technology 3asomatic cells 3atranscription (genetics) 3amice 3amicroRNA 3aembryonic stem cells 3aexons 3acomputer software 3acell cycle 3aadults 0agenes1 aSchlieve, Christopher R.1 aPereira, Laura1 aWahlquist, Christine1 aColas, Alexandre1 aZambon, Alexander C.1 aVranizan, Karen1 aSpindler, Matthew J.1 aPico, Alexander R.1 aCline, Melissa S.1 aClark, Tyson A.1 aWilliams, Alan1 aBlume, John E.1 aSamal, Eva1 aMercola, Mark1 aMerrill, Bradley J.1 aConklin, Bruce R.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 June 8, v. 107, no. 23 p.10514-10519dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09122601073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100612b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03105naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245012800160300001800288520155000306650001201856650001201868650001301880650002401893650004401917650001601961650001001977650001901987650001302006650001402019650001602033650002002049650004302069650001602112650001802128651001002146653003002156653003102186653001502217653001802232700001902250700001802269700001702287700001802304773012702322852000902449856008502458930003302543946001102576655001202587IND4445568220221119005217.0101126e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444556822DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-010-0256-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xin 10aSoil type determines the abundance and community structure of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea in flooded paddy soils  ap. 1510-1516.  aPurpose Ammonia oxidation plays an important role in global nitrogen cycle. However, little information is available on ammonia oxidizers in paddy soils. This study aimed to understand the controlling factors of ammonia oxidizers in the paddy soils. Materials and methods Three types of paddy soils were collected from southwest [Chongqing City (CQ)], central [Honghu City (HH)], and northeast [Panjin City (PJ)] of China, respectively. The soils were cultured with unplanted and rice-planted pot experiments for 10 weeks. The abundance and composition of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) of the paddy soil samples were investigated by real-time polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis approaches based on amoA genes. Results and discussion In this study, minor changes in the abundance and community structure of both AOB and AOA were observed among the treatments of unplanted and rhizosphere and bulk of rice-planted soil samples in the same type of paddy soil. The AOB population sizes in CQ were lower than those in HH and PJ, while the AOA in CQ and HH were lower than those in PJ. The amoA gene copy numbers of AOA were more abundant than those of AOB in all treatments of the three paddy soils. The community structure of both AOB and AOA in all paddy soils was different from each other. Conclusions The population size and community structure of AOB and AOA in the flooded paddy soils were mainly determined by the soil types, irrespective of rice-planted or unplanted. 3aArchaea 3aammonia 3abacteria 3acommunity structure 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3agene dosage 3agenes 3anitrogen cycle 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3apaddy soils 3apopulation size 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arhizosphere 3asoil sampling 3aChina 0aAmmonia-oxidizing archaea 0aAmmonia-oxidizing bacteria 0aPaddy soil 0aReal-time PCR1 aZhang, Li-Mei 1 aShen, Ju-Pei 1 aXu, Zhihong 1 aHe, Ji-Zheng 0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2010 Dec., v. 10, no. 8 p.1510-1516dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-010-0256-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20101126b20101204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03092naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245018900171300001800360520129600378650001501674650002501689650001801714650002601732650002701758650001601785650002301801650001301824650001701837650001501854650001101869650003301880650002201913650001701935651001001952653002701962653002801989653002302017653001902040653001702059700002502076700002202101700002102123700002202144700002002166700002202186700002302208700002102231773013602252852000902388856008502397930003302482946001102515655001202526IND4447534320221119005230.0110114e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444753432DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-010-4408-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMignani, Anna Grazia 10aVisible and near-infrared absorption spectroscopy by an integrating sphere and optical fibers for quantifying and discriminating the adulteration of extra virgin olive oil from Tuscany  ap. 1315-1324.  aBecause of its high price, extra virgin olive oil is frequently targeted for adulteration with lower quality oils. This paper presents an innovative optical technique capable of quantifying and discriminating the adulteration of extra virgin olive oil caused by lower-grade olive oils. An original set-up for diffuse-light absorption spectroscopy in the wide 400-1,700 nm spectral range was experimented. It made use of an integrating sphere containing the oil sample and of optical fibers for illumination and detection; it provided intrinsically scattering-free absorption spectroscopy measurements. This set-up was used to collect spectroscopic fingerprints of authentic extra virgin olive oils from the Italian Tuscany region, adulterated by different concentrations of olive-pomace oil, refined olive oil, deodorized olive oil, and refined olive-pomace oil. Then, a straightforward multivariate processing of spectroscopic data based on principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis was applied which was successfully capable of predicting the fraction of adulterant in the mixture, and of discriminating its type. The results achieved by means of optical spectroscopy were compared with the analysis of fatty acids, which was carried out by standard gas chromatography. 3aabsorption 3aadulterated products 3adeodorization 3adiscriminant analysis 3aextra-virgin olive oil 3afatty acids 3agas chromatography 3alighting 3aolive pomace 3aprediction 3aprices 3aprincipal component analysis 3aspectral analysis 3aspectroscopy 3aItaly 0aExtra virgin olive oil 0aAbsorption spectroscopy 0aIntegrating cavity 0aOptical fibers 0aChemometrics1 aCiaccheri, Leonardo 1 aOttevaere, Heidi 1 aThienpont, Hugo 1 aConte, Lanfranco 1 aMarega, Milena 1 aCichelli, Angelo 1 aAttilio, Cristina 1 aCimato, Antonio 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2011 Jan., v. 399, no. 3 p.1315-1324dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-010-4408-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110114b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03706naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245007700205300002000282506007600302520171700378506003702095650002202132650001502154650002502169650001102194650001302205650002002218650001202238650001102250650001002261650000902271650001402280650001202294650001202306650001802318650001302336650001402349650002802363650001502391650001002406650002402416650001302440650001402453650002002467650001402487650002202501651001802523651001102541700002002552700002102572700001802593700002202611700002002633700002702653700002702680773017502707852000902882856008302891930003302974946001303007655001203020IND4438447620221207063931.0100611e20100608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443844762DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10013331072doi7 aPMC28908482pmcid7 a204980482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichelutti, Neal10aTrophic position influences the efficacy of seabirds as metal biovectors  ap. 10543-10548.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSeabirds represent a well documented biological transport pathway of nutrients from the ocean to the land by nesting in colonies and providing organic subsidies (feces, carcasses, dropped food) to these sites. We investigated whether seabirds that feed at different trophic levels vary in their potency as biovectors of metals, which can bioaccumulate through the marine foodweb. Our study site, located on a small island in Arctic Canada, contains the unique scenario of two nearby ponds, one of which receives inputs almost exclusively from upper trophic level piscivores (Arctic terns, Sterna paradisaea) and the other mainly from lower trophic level molluscivores (common eiders, Somateria mollissima). We used dated sediment cores to compare differences in diatoms, metal concentrations and also stable isotopes of nitrogen (δ¹⁵N), which reflect trophic position. We show that the seabirds carry species-specific mixtures of metals that are ultimately shunted to their nesting sites. For example, sediments from the tern-affected pond recorded the highest levels of δ¹⁵N and the greatest concentrations of metals that are known to bioaccumulate, including Hg and Cd. In contrast, the core from the eider-affected site registered lower δ¹⁵N values, but higher concentrations of Pb, Al, and Mn. These metals have been recorded at their greatest concentrations in eiders relative to other seabirds, including Arctic terns. These data indicate that metals may be used to track seabird population dynamics, and that some metal tracers may even be species-specific. The predominance of large seabird colonies on every continent suggests that similar processes are operating along coastlines worldwide.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillariophyceae 3aParadisaea 3aSomateria mollissima 3aSterna 3aaluminum 3abioaccumulation 3acadmium 3acoasts 3afeces 3alead 3amanganese 3amercury 3anesting 3anesting sites 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aphysiological transport 3apiscivores 3aponds 3apopulation dynamics 3aseabirds 3asediments 3astable isotopes 3asubsidies 3atracer techniques 3aArctic region 3aCanada1 aBlais, Jules M.1 aMallory, Mark L.1 aBrash, Jaclyn1 aThienpont, Joshua1 aKimpe, Lynda E.1 aDouglas, Marianne S.V.1 aSmol, J.

However, as there are no parameters or methods to evaluate soil quality directly, some attributes of relevant soil functions are taken as indicators; lately, an increase in the use of soil microbial parameters has occurred, and their viability as indicators of proper land use has been highlighted. In this study we performed a meta-analysis of the response ratios of several microbial and chemical parameters to soil disturbance by different land uses in the Brazilian biomes. The studies included native forests, pastures and perennial and annual cropping systems. The introduction of agricultural practices in all biomes covered previously with natural vegetation profoundly affected microbial biomass-C (MB-C)―with an overall decrease of 31%. Annual crops most severely reduced microbial biomass and soil organic C, with an average decrease of 53% in the MB-C. In addition, the MB-C/TSOC (total soil organic carbon) ratio was significantly decreased with the transformation of forests to perennial plantation (25%), pastures (26%), and annual cropping (20%). However, each biome reacted differently to soil disturbance, i.e., decreases in MB-C followed the order of Cerrado>Amazon>Caatinga>Atlantic Forest. In addition, the Cerrado appeared to have the most fragile soil ecosystem because of lower MB-C/TSOC and higher qCO₂. Unfortunately, the Cerrado and the Amazon, demonstrated by our study as the most fragile biomes, have been subjected to the highest agronomic pressure. The results reported here may help to infer the best land-use strategies to improve soil quality and achieve agriculture sustainability. The approach can also be very useful to monitor soil quality in other tropical and subtropical biomes. 3acerrado 3acropping systems 3acrops 3adisturbed soils 3aecosystems 3afarmers 3aforests 3aland use 3ameta-analysis 3amicrobial biomass 3apastures 3asoil ecology 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil quality 3aviability 0aBrazilian biomes 0aMeta-analyses1 aAlberton, Odair 1 aHungria, Mariangela 0 tPlant and soil.g2011 Jan., v. 338, no. 1-2 p.467-481dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-010-0559-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101224b20110101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02210naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245010900204300002000313506007600333520098300409506003701392650001501429650001401444650001201458650001001470650001201480650002401492700001901516773017501535852000901710856008301719930003301802946001301835655001201848IND4438448420221207072942.0100611e20100608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443844842DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09124571072doi7 aPMC28908252pmcid7 a204980552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujii, Shinsuke10aVentral lateral and DN1 clock neurons mediate distinct properties of male sex drive rhythm in Drosophila  ap. 10590-10595.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMale sex drive rhythm (MSDR) in Drosophila is a circadian behavior only observed in the social context of male-female pairs. In the presence of a female, males exhibit long periods of courtship activity with a pronounced rest phase at dusk, although isolated males exhibit an activity peak at dusk. The molecular mechanisms regulating the switch between these activity patterns are unknown. Here, we genetically manipulate the molecular clock in different subsets of neurons and find that proper oscillation of the molecular clock in ventral lateral neurons is essential for MSDR. These neurons express pigment-dispersing factor, the lack of which disrupts MSDR. Furthermore, we show that a cluster of dorsal neurons (DN1s) requires the molecular clock to synchronize the trough phase at dusk in MSDR and to establish the evening peak in single fly locomotor rhythm (SLR). Finally, we provide evidence that DN1s exert their roles in MSDR and SLR via distinct signaling pathways.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3acourtship 3afemales 3amales 3aneurons 3asignal transduction1 aAmrein, Hubert0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 June 8, v. 107, no. 23 p.10590-10595dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09124571073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100612b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02218naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120072001700138072001700155100001700172245013900189300001400328500001500342520070900357650001801066650001501084650001901099650002601118650001601144650001601160650001701176650002701193650001201220650002101232651001001253651001201263651001101275651001001286651001001296653001301306653001301319653001801332653001801350653001901368700001801387700001501405700001701420773006901437852000901506856007801515930003301593945002501626946001301651655001201664IND4369207320221119005124.0050423e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436920732DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-89-00172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Infection structures were sufficient to distinguish among species. Isolates of Uromyces viciae-fabae proved to be specialized with respect to host, because each isolate infected only cultivars of the species from which it was collected. Host-specialized isolates of U. viciae-fabae also were morphologically distinct, differing in both spore dimensions and infection structure morphology. In particular, the shape and dimensions of the substomatal vesicle were distinctive. These results support the view that U. viciae-fabae sensu lato is a species complex. 3arust diseases 3aVicia faba 3aLens culinaris 3aUromyces viciae-fabae 3ateliospores 3ahost plants 3aVicia sativa 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3alegumes 3ahost specificity 3aEgypt 3aMorocco 3aCanada 3aItaly 3aSpain 0aUromyces 0aFabaceae 0afungal spores 0aurediniospore 0afungal anatomy1 aSillero, J.C.1 aNiks, R.E.1 aRubiales, D.0 tPlant disease.g2005 Jan., v. 89, no. 1 p.17-22x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-89-00173Available from publisher's Web site  a20080312b20080404c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/10/21  aOther US 7aarticle03100naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120072001700138100001600155245010000171300001400271520168900285650002601974650002702000650002802027650001802055650002802073650001302101650003002114650001202144650001302156650001302169650002302182650002202205650001202227650001602239651001002255700001602265700001602281700001502297700002002312700001602332700001902348773006902367852000902436856007802445930003302523945002502556946001302581655001202594IND4369207220221119004857.0050423e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436920722DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-89-00122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMsikita, W.10aPrevalence and severity of Nattrassia mangiferae root and stem rot pathogen of cassava in Benin  ap. 12-16.  aRoot rot pathogens were found through diagnostic surveys in all departments (regions) of Benin, West Africa, to affect 86 to 100% and 96 to 100% of cassava fields during the dry and rainy seasons, respectively. Disease incidence in individual fields ranged between 0 and 53%, and averaged 16 to 27% per department. Nattrassia mangiferae was consistently the most frequently isolated root rot pathogen (56% in the dry season and 22 to 52% in the rainy season). Pathogenicity of N. mangiferae was confirmed on four cultivars of cassava using stem cuttings and storage roots. For all four cultivars, N. mangiferae significantly reduced the number of roots. Lesions (3 to 15 cm long) formed on the lower stem portion of all inoculated plants, whereas control plants remained symptom free. On storage roots, the disease profile was similar to that formed on stem cuttings. Other root rot pathogens detected during the dry season were Macrophomina phaseolina (14.2%), Fusarium spp. (11.8%), Botryodiplodia theobromae (7.7%), and Pythium spp. (2.9%). During the rainy season, Fusarium spp. were the second most commonly isolated root rot pathogens in three departments (Atlantique, Borgou, and Mono). In Oueme and Zou, B. theobromae was the second most isolated root rot pathogen (ranging between 24 and 28%) during the rainy season. During the same season, Pythium spp. were pronounced in Borgou (18%), followed by Mono (11%), Atlantique (9%), Atacora (8%), Oueme (5%), and Zou (6%). Results of the study are discussed with a view to creating awareness of the destructive power of N. mangiferae, a hitherto poorly recognized root rot pathogen of cassava in Benin and West Africa in general. 3aNattrassia mangiferae 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apathogen identification 3apathogenicity 3aMacrophomina phaseolina 3aFusarium 3aBotryodiplodia theobromae 3aPythium 3aroot rot 3astem rot 3adisease prevalence 3aManihot esculenta 3acassava 3ahost plants 3aBenin1 aBissang, B.1 aJames, B.D.1 aBaimey, H.1 aWilkinson, H.T.1 aAhounou, M.1 aFagbemissi, R.0 tPlant disease.g2005 Jan., v. 89, no. 1 p.12-16x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-89-00123Available from publisher's Web site  a20080312b20080404c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/10/21  aOther US 7aarticle02698naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120072001700138100001800155245004900173300001300222500001500235520122700250650001001477650001201487650001601499650002001515650002201535650002101557650002501578650001801603650002701621650002201648650004001670650002201710650002501732650002701757651001601784651001801800651001601818651001201834651001501846653002301861700001601884700002401900773008601924852000902010856007802019930003302097945002502130946001302155655001202168IND4369207120221119004902.0050423e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436920712DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-89-00042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aToit, L.J. du10aVerticillium wilt in spinach seed production  ap. 4-11.  a2019-12-04  aThere are no previous reports of Verticillium wilt in fresh and processing spinach (Spinacia oleracea) crops in the United States. In 2002, a hybrid spinach seed crop in the Pacific Northwest developed late-season wilt symptoms. Assays of the harvested seed and stock seed of the male and female parents revealed 59.5, 44.0, and 1.5%, respectively, were infected with Verticillium dahliae. Assays of 13 stock or commercial seed lots grown in 2002 and 62 commercial lots harvested in 2003 in Denmark, Holland, New Zealand, and the United States revealed the prevalence of Verticillium spp. in commercial spinach seed. Sixty-eight lots (89%) were infected with Verticillium spp. at incidences ranging from 0.3 to 84.8%. Five spinach seed isolates of V. dahliae were pathogenic on each of three spinach cultivars by root-dip inoculation. V. dahliae was detected on 26.4% of the seed from 7 of 11 inoculated plants but on none of the seed from 6 control plants, demonstrating systemic movement of V. dahliae. Seed-to-seed transmission was also demonstrated by planting naturally infected seed lots. This is the first report of Verticillium wilt of spinach in the primary region of spinach seed production in the United States. 3aseeds 3aspinach 3ahost plants 3avegetable crops 3aSpinacia oleracea 3anew host records 3adisease transmission 3apathogenicity 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aVerticillium wilt 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae 3aseed productivity 3aVerticillium dahliae 3anew geographic records 3aNew Zealand 3aUnited States 3aNetherlands 3aDenmark 0aWashington 0aFusarium oxysporum1 aDerie, M.L.1 aHernandez-Perez, P.0 tPlant disease.g2005 Jan., v. 89, no. 1 p.4-11wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-89-00043Available from publisher's Web site  a20080312b20080404c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/10/21  aOther US 7aarticle02730naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072001700149100001800166245009500184300001300279520152900292650002601821650001801847650002401865650002801889650003801917650002501955650001701980650001601997650002102013650002702034651000902061700001902070773007402089852000902163856008902172930003302261945002502294946001302319655001202332IND4369207020221119005105.0050423e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436920702DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2004.88.12.1384C2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWhitten, K.R.10aFirst report of Cucumber mosaic virus in Eryngium yuccifolium (rattlesnake master) in Ohio  ap. 1384.  aRattlesnake master (Eryngium yuccifolium) is a wildflower that is native to Ohio. In recent years, native wildflowers have become very popular with home gardeners, and conservationists have begun to reestablish these plants in their native ranges. As native perennial wildflowers become more common, it is important to determine if they might serve as possible perennial reservoirs of viruses. A plot of 20 species native to Ohio was established on the Waterman Agricultural and Natural Resources Laboratory, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. In the summers of 1999 and 2001, random samples were collected from established plantings. Some sampled plants did not show symptoms of virus infection; however, all samples of E. yuccifolium appeared chlorotic, slightly mottled, and stunted. Using double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) analysis (1), these plants were assayed for viral infection. dsRNA profiles obtained from symptomatic E. yuccifolium resembled that of Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). These results were confirmed with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Agdia Inc., Elkhart, IN) for CMV. dsRNA-containing samples of E. yuccifolium produced ELISA absorbance values (A(405)) of 0.231 to 0.713 when compared with the negative control. All 14 samples of E. yuccifolium tested positive for CMV. To our knowledge, this is the first report of CMV in E. yuccifolium, which should serve as the basis for a more extensive survey, since CMV can potentially infect a wide variety of ornamental and nonornamental hosts. 3aCucumber mosaic virus 3aplant viruses 3adouble-stranded RNA 3apathogen identification 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aEryngium yuccifolium 3awild flowers 3ahost plants 3anew host records 3anew geographic records 3aOhio1 aNameth, S.G.P.0 tPlant disease.g2004 Dec., v. 88, no. 12 p.1384-1384x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2004.88.12.1384C3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080730b20080801c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/10/22  aOther US 7aarticle03158naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072001700148100001600165245008000181300001800261520145800279650002301737650003001760650001801790650002201808650002801830650001801858650001401876650002101890650002201911650002301933650001601956650001901972650001101991650001802002650001202020650002002032650002102052650002702073650002102100650001302121650002502134651001502159653002802174700001402202700001902216700001602235700002702251700001802278700001802296773007402314852000902388856008802397930003302485945002502518946001302543655001202556IND4366756720221119004858.0050125e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436675672DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2004.88.11.12552doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCosta, H.S.10aPlant hosts of Xylella fastidiosa in and near southern California vineyards  ap. 1255-1261.  aXylella fastidiosa is a xylem-limited bacterium that causes Pierce's disease (PD) of grapevines. A variety of plant species found near a severe outbreak of PD in vineyards in the Temecula Valley of California were tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, culture on media, and polymerase chain reaction to identify potential inoculum sources in the area. Species that consistently tested positive for X. fastidiosa were the known hosts, grape, almond, and oleander, and two new hosts, Spanish broom (Spartium junceum) and wild mustard (Brassica spp). Sequence analysis of the 16S-23S rRNA spacer region found that strains isolated from grapevine, Spanish broom, wild mustard, and almond clustered with previously sequenced PD strains. Thus, these species could serve as sources of inoculum for infection of grapevines and should be removed or monitored for signs of infection. Sequences from oleander isolates from Temecula formed another cluster with a previously published oleander strain sequence. Oleander strains do not infect grapevines and thus do not appear to cause a direct threat to grapevines. Two additional isolates from almond were determined to be genetically different from PD strains, and the ability of these strains to infect grapevine is not known. Greenhouse transmission studies indicate that the glassy-winged sharpshooter was able to transmit a PD strain of X. fastidiosa to Spanish broom, black mustard, and other hosts. 3aXylella fastidiosa 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3apathogen identification 3apathogenicity 3aphylogeny 3aPierce's disease 3adisease outbreaks 3aseasonal variation 3ahost plants 3aVitis vinifera 3agrapes 3aPrunus dulcis 3aalmonds 3aNerium oleander 3anew host records 3anew geographic records 3aSpartium junceum 3aBrassica 3anucleotide sequences 3aCalifornia 0amolecular sequence data1 aRaetz, E.1 aPinckard, T.R.1 aGispert, C.1 aHernandez-Martinez, R.1 aDumenyo, C.K.1 aCooksey, D.A.0 tPlant disease.g2004 Nov., v. 88, no. 11 p.1255-1261x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2004.88.11.12553Available from publisher's Web site  a20060222b20060302c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/05/09  aOther US 7aarticle02082naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120072001700138072001700155100001800172245007000190300001400260520098800274650002201262650001001284650002101294650001001315650001901325650002601344650002201370650002501392700001701417700001701434773008701451852000901538856007801547930003301625945002501658946001301683655001201696IND4369207420221119005057.0050423e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436920742DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-89-00232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSillero, J.C.10aSources of resistance to crenate broomrape among species of Vicia  ap. 23-27.  aCrenate broomrape is a parasitic weed that represents a major constraint for pulse and forage legume production in the Mediterranean and West Asia regions. Control strategies have centered around agronomic practices and the use of herbicides, although success has been marginal. Resistance breeding is hampered by scarcity of proper sources of resistance and of a reliable and practical screening procedure. A germ plasm collection of 208 accessions of vetch belonging to 42 Vicia spp. was screened for resistance to crenate broomrape under field conditions. High levels of resistance were found in several species. Resistance of selected accessions was confirmed by a low induction of broomrape seed germination in pot and in vitro experiments. This was followed by a scarce establishment of broomrape radicles in contact with host roots and a limited development of established tubercles. In addition, a hypersensitive-like necrosis occasionally was observed, but at low frequency. 3aOrobanche crenata 3aweeds 3aparasitic plants 3aVicia 3aforage legumes 3aresistance mechanisms 3agenetic variation 3aphenotypic variation1 aMoreno, M.T.1 aRubiales, D.0 tPlant disease.g2005 Jan., v. 89, no. 1 p.23-27wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-89-00233Available from publisher's Web site  a20080312b20080404c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/10/21  aOther US 7aarticle01687naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010900127300001700236520091500253650002001168650001601188650001601204653001301220653001501233700002001248773008601268852000901354939003301363946001301396655001201409IND8805620920221119005103.0881123e198810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880562092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoddie, R.L.10aEfficacy of a fatty acid-lactic acid postmilking teat germicide in reducing incidence of bovine mastitis  ap. 799- 803.  aThe efficacy of a postmilking leaf germicide containing Lauricidin and caprylic, capric, and lactic acids was evaluated against new udder infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae.

  1 aColetta-Filho, H.D.10aFirst report of the causal agent of Huanglongbing ("Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus") in Brazil  ap. 1382.  aHuanglongbing (ex-greening) disease is one of the most serious diseases of citrus. It is caused by the phloem-limited, gram-negative bacterium “Candidatus Liberibacter spp.”. This bacterium is not well characterized mainly because it is still uncultured. There are two known strains, Asian (“Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus”) and African (“Candidatus Liberibacter africanus”) that cause severe damage to citrus plants including twig dieback, decline, and death. Symptoms first appear as leaf mottling and chlorosis occurring in one shoot or sector of trees. Later, leaf symptoms resemble nutritional deficiencies (Zn, Ca, and N) that vary depending on the strains, with more severe symptoms caused by “Ca. L. asiaticus”. The Asian strains are transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid (AsCP), Diaphorina citri, which is present in Brazil. The bacterium has been detected in citrus plants in many geographic locations including China, Japan, Thailand, India, the Philippines, the Arabian Peninsula, and Africa. In 2004, plants showing Huanglongbing symptoms were observed in the Araraquara County, a central region of the State of Sao Paulo, the largest citrus-producing area in Brazil. To verify the presence of “Ca. L. spp.” in these plants, leaf samples of sweet orange cvs. Hamlin and Valencia were used for DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction amplification using the specific OI1 and Oi2c primers (1). Amplification of the 16S rDNA was positive for 2 (cvs. Hamlin and Valencia) of 10 analyzed plants. The amplified fragments were cloned and sequenced. The amplicons obtained from both plants showed the same sequence, which differed from “Ca. L. africanus”, utilized as the positive control in the amplification experiment (27 divergent bases in 1,160). The sequences were used for BLAST searches, and the results showed identities ranging from 94.71 to 100% with “Ca. L. spp.” sequences available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information database (on-line publication). The highest scores were obtained with “Ca. L. asiaticus sequences. These analyses confirmed the presence of such agent in the State of Sao Paulo. To our knowledge, this is the first report of “Ca. L. asiaticus” in Brazil as well as elsewhere in the Americas. The significance of this report relates to the potential damage that this pathogen could cause to the citrus industry in the largest citrus-producing country in the world. It remains unclear how and when the pathogen entered Brazil. 3aCandidatus Liberibacter asiaticus 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3apathogen identification 3abacterial diseases of plants 3agreening disease 3anew geographic records 3aCitrus sinensis 3aoranges 3afruit trees 3afruit crops 3ahost plants 3aBrazil1 aTargon, M.L.P.N.1 aTakita, M.A.1 aNegri, J.D. de1 aPompeu, J.

Both Cpt1p and Ept1p activities display an absolute requirement for cations and phospholipids. A mixed-micelle assay was employed to determine cation and lipid activators of parental and chimaeric Cpt1p/Ept1p enzymes to gain insight into their mechanism(s) of activation. Mg2+, Mn2+ and Co2+ were the only cations capable of activating Cpt1p and Ept1p in vitro. Kinetic data revealed that only Mg2+ is present in appropriate amounts to activate CPT activity in vivo. The two enzymes displayed distinct activation profiles on the basis of their relative affinities for Mg2+, Mn2+ and Co2+. This allowed the use of chimaeric enzymes to determine the mechanism of cation activation. Cations do not activate Cpt1p or Ept1p by complexing with the substrate, CDP-choline, but instead bind to disparate regions within the enzymes themselves. Cpt1p and Ept1p also displayed distinct phospholipid activation profiles. Phospholipid activation required a phosphate and/or glycero-phosphoester linkage, with the phospho-head group moiety positioned at the surface of the micelle. Assays with parental and chimaeric Cpt1p/Ept1p constructs revealed that the phospholipid binding/activation domains are not located within linear segments of the protein, but instead are contained within distinct and separate regions of the proteins that require an intact tertiary structure for formation. Phosphatidylcholine (and its structural analogue sphingomyelin) were the best lipid activators of Cpt1p, the main biologically relevant CPT activity in S. cerevisiae. Hence CPT displays product activation. Because phosphatidylcholine is an efficient activator of CPT activity (and hence Cpt1p is not subject to feedback inhibition by its product), Cpt1p is incapable of functioning as a direct monitor of membrane phosphatidylcholine composition. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3acholine 3aethanolamine 3aphosphotransferases (phosphomutases) 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme activation1 aMorash, S.C.1 aBell, R.M.0 tBiochemical journal.g1996 Feb. 1, v. 313, no. pt.3 p.729-735aBiochemical journal (London, England : 1984)x0264-60217nnas  aDNAL  a19960503b19960510c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02874naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072001700148072001700165100001700182245009400199300001800293500001500311520147800326650001101804650003001815650002601845650001601871650002001887650002001907650002701927650001201954650001901966651001701985653003502002653002202037653002202059653001502081653003202096700001602128773009202144852000902236856008802245930003302333945002502366946001302391655001202404IND4366755820221119005154.0050125e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436675582DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2004.88.11.12412doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A major means of spread of the causal organisms, Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and Phaeoacremonium spp., is via infected propagation material. Since no curative control measures are known, proactive measures must be taken in grapevine nurseries to manage this disease. To study this aspect, semicommercial trials with naturally infected rootstock material were performed in grapevine nurseries in South Africa. Prior to grafting, rootstocks were treated as follows: 1-h drench in suspensions of benomyl, phosphoric acid, different bacterial and Trichoderma formulations, water, or hot water treated (HWT; 30 min at 50 degrees C). Grafted cuttings were planted and grown in a greenhouse and two commercial field nurseries and uprooted 8 months later. In instances where rootstocks were treated with benomyl or Trichoderma formulations, the incidences of Phaeomoniella and Phaeoacremonium in grafted cuttings and uprooted nursery vines were significantly lower than that of the water treatment. However, the reduction was most consistent and noteworthy in vines on rootstocks that received HWT prior to grafting. HWT of dormant nursery vines effected a similar reduction in Phaeomoniella and Phaeoacremonium incidence. Rootstock drenches in benomyl and/or Trichoderma formulations could thus be integrated with HWT for the proactive management of Petri disease in grapevine nurseries. 3agrapes 3afungal diseases of plants 3apropagation materials 3aTrichoderma 3adisease control 3aphosphoric acid 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3abenomyl 3aVitis vinifera 3aSouth Africa 0aPhaeoacremonium chlamydosporum 0ablack goo decline 0aplant propagation 0aAscomycota 0aPhaeomoniella chlamydospora1 aHalleen, F.0 tPlant disease.g2004 Nov., v. 88, no. 11 p.1241-1245wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2004.88.11.12413Available from publisher's Web site  a20060222b20060302c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/05/09  aOther US 7aarticle03222naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245007700124300001600201520223400217650001302451650002702464650001002491650002002501650001102521650002902532650002102561650001102582650001402593650001602607650001202623651001602635700002102651700001502672773008302687852000902770930003302779945001302812946001102825655001202836IND2332052920221119005130.0030418e20020102ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233205292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRegli, C.10aInterpretation of drill core and georadar data of coarse gravel deposits  ap. 234-252.  aPollution in the shallow subsurface has led to an increasing need of understanding how to quantitatively characterize both the heterogeneity of gravel aquifers and the influence of heterogeneity on groundwater flow and solute transport. Models play an important role in decision-making processes, especially in the context of better characterizing and in forecasting the behavior of a given geological system. The objective of the present paper is the derivation of a gradual lithofacies-based interpretation of outcrop, drill core, and ground penetrating radar (GPR or georadar) data of different quality. The presented method allows a probability estimation of drill core layer descriptions and radarfacies types representing defined sedimentary structure types. The method includes a determination of 'initial structure type probabilities' for grain-size categories and combinations thereof described in drill core layer descriptions as well as a subsequent differentiation of these structure type probabilities in an iterative process considering 'additional information' like main constituent, quantity, fraction, and sorting of single grain-size categories, color, chemical precipitation, layer thickness, and adjacent layer. The radarfacies types are calibrated with drill cores located in the vicinity of georadar sections. The calibration process consists of the assignment of the calculated structure type probabilities from the drill core layer descriptions to the corresponding radarfacies types considering the proportion in thickness between drill core layers and georadar structures. The structure type probabilities can be given for points along boreholes and a grid with arbitrary mesh size along georadar sections. The method is applied to field examples from the Rhine/Wiese aquifer near Basel in Switzerland. The resulting structure type probabilities can be used for conditioning stochastic simulations of geological models. However, the conditioned stochastic simulation of the Rhine/Wiese aquifer is the topic of another paper. The results show the importance of a detailed sedimentological analysis of outcrops and drill cores as well as its significance on the distinction of sedimentary structure types. 3aaquifers 3achemical precipitation 3acolor 3adecision making 3agravel 3aground-penetrating radar 3agroundwater flow 3amodels 3apollution 3aprobability 3asolutes 3aSwitzerland1 aHuggenberger, P.1 aRauber, M.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2002 Jan. 2, v. 255, no. 1/4 p.234-252x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02369naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072001700148072001700165100001500182245008600197300001800283520123300301650001501534650002101549650001501570650001501585650001901600650001001619650002501629653002601654653002801680700001501708773009201723852000901815856008801824930003301912945002501945946001301970655001201983IND4366756420221119005124.0050125e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436675642DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2004.88.11.12522doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Acremonium implicatum is a fungus that forms an endophytic association with at least some of these economically important grasses. To ascertain whether A. implicatum can be seed transmitted in Brachiaria species, we vegetatively propagated, under greenhouse conditions, 20 tillers from an endophyte-infected mother plant obtained from each of 14 Brachiaria hybrids and species. Ten tillers of each genotype were treated with the fungicide tebuconazole to eliminate the endophyte, and the other 10 were left untreated. Seeds were then harvested individually from all 20 of these genetically identical plants, germinated, and the seedlings grown. A previously developed polymerase chain reaction-based method used a pair of endophyte-specific primers to amplify a diagnostic 500-bp DNA fragment. The seedlings generated from seeds harvested from endophyte-infected plants also tested positive, whereas those from seeds of endophyte-free plants showed no amplification products. This is the first report of A. implicatum being transmitted through seeds of Brachiaria grasses. 3aAcremonium 3aseed-borne fungi 3aendophytes 3aBrachiaria 3aforage grasses 3aseeds 3anucleotide sequences 0aAcremonium implicatum 0amolecular sequence data1 aKelemu, S.0 tPlant disease.g2004 Nov., v. 88, no. 11 p.1252-1254wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2004.88.11.12523Available from publisher's Web site  a20060222b20060302c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/05/09  aOther US 7aarticle01917naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245005100125300001600176520112100192650001901313650002701332650002101359650002301380650003001403650001501433700001801448773008301466852000901549930003301558945001301591946001101604655001201615IND2332051920221119005040.0030418e20020102ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233205192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurn, D.H.10aDetection of hydrologic trends and variability  ap. 107-122.  aThis paper describes the development and application of a procedure that identifies trends in hydrologic variables.

The research investigates 18 hydrologic variables that reflect different parts of the hydrologic cycle. The hydrologic variables are analyzed for a network of 248 Canadian catchments that are considered to reflect natural conditions. A selection of catchments identified to have trends in hydrologic variables is studied further to investigate the presence of trends in meteorological variables and the relationship between the hydrologic and the meteorological response to climatic change. It is concluded that a greater number of trends are observed than are expected to occur by chance. There are differences in the geographic location of significant trends in the hydrologic variables investigated implying that impacts are not spatially uniform. 3aclimate change 3ageographical variation 3ahydrologic cycle 3ahydrologic factors 3ameteorological parameters 3awatersheds1 aElnur, M.A.H.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2002 Jan. 2, v. 255, no. 1/4 p.107-122x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02820naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245013800126300001400264520185300278650001702131650002802148650002202176650001502198650001302213650002402226650001802250650001202268651001002280700001502290700001702305773008202322852000902404930003302413945001302446946001102459655001202470IND2331341320221119004855.0030312e20030210ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233134132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsidoro, D.10aSampling strategies for the estimation of salt and nitrate loads in irrigation return flows: La Violada Gully (Spain) as a case study  ap. 39-51.  aAppropriate estimates of salt and nitrate loads exported by irrigated agriculture are needed to ascertain the potential negative impacts on the quality of the receiving water bodies. The irrigation return flows of the La Violada irrigation district (NE Spain), collected by La Violada Gully, were monitored for 4 years (1995-1998) in order to estimate salt and nitrate loads. The existence of a daily cycle in the Gully flow during the April to September 1995 irrigation season, associated with a cycle in the electrical conductivity, made it necessary to analyse the influence of the sampling hour on the daily estimates of salt and nitrate loads. Interpolation and regression methods were evaluated using nine 2-days surveys with samples taken at all even hours. The interpolation approach proved to be reliable for daily load estimations, whereas the regression approach was unacceptable due to the poor salinity-flow and nitrate concentration-flow relationships. The sampling time was important for the determination of salt load by the interpolation method, but resulted almost irrelevant for the estimation of nitrate load. Although the biases represent a small percentage of the mean (< 7% for both salt and nitrate load estimates), the lack of consideration of the sampling hour will result, depending on the time of sampling, in a systematic over- or under-estimation of the measured loads. The number of samples needed to estimate salt and nitrate loads within a pre-specified margin of error was determined using the 1995 and 1996 irrigation seasons series and confirmed through a Monte Carlo test for the four irrigation seasons. A systematic sampling interval of 9 days (i.e. 21 samples along the irrigation season) allowed estimating salt loading within a 5% error and nitrating loading within a 10% error at the 95% confidence level. 3acase studies 3aelectrical conductivity 3airrigated farming 3airrigation 3anitrates 3aregression analysis 3asurface water 3asurveys 3aSpain1 aQuilez, D.1 aAragües, R.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2003 Feb. 10, v. 271, no. 1/4 p.39-51x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02310naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245017400147300001800321300002300339500001500362520105200377650001701429650002201446650001401468650002501482650001201507650001501519650001801534650002001552650002001572650001701592650001101609653001001620653001501630653001101645653001901656700001601675700001401691700001601705773007601721852000901797939003301806946001301839655001201852IND9001800620221119005309.0900425e198912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900180062DNAL7 a166671832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewinsohn, E.10aFlavanone glycoside biosynthesis in citrus.

The glucosylated flavanone was further rhamnosylated when exogenous UDP-glucose and NADPH were added to the extract. Chalcone-synthase activity was detected in cell-free extracts derived from young leaves and fruits. Young fruits (2 millimeter diameter) had the highest chalcone synthase activity. UDP-glucose:flavanone-7-O-glucosyl-transferase activity was measured in cell-free extracts derived from young leaves and fruits of Citrus mitis and Citrus maxima. The highest UDP-glucose:flavanone-7-O-glucosyl-transferase activity was found in young C. maxima leaves. These data indicate that Citrus contains a flavonoid pathway similar to that studied in other species. 3abiosynthesis 3aCitrus madurensis 3achalcones 3abiochemical pathways 3aligases 3aglucosides 3aCitrus maxima 3aenzyme activity 3aCitrus paradisi 3atransferases 3aleaves 0afruit 0aflavonoids 0aCitrus 0arhamnosylation1 aBritsch, L.1 aMazur, Y.1 aGressel, J.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 Dec., v. 91, no. 4 p.1323-1328x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02329naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245013000148300001800278300002300296500001500319520118200334650001301516650001201529650001701541650002101558650001601579650001101595650001301606650001101619650001401630650001901644650001301663653003101676653001001707653003601717653002301753773007601776852000901852939003301861946001301894655001201907IND9001802620221119005202.0900426e198912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900180262DNAL7 a166672012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLefebvre, D.D.10aIncreased potassium absorption confers resistance to group IA cations in rubidium-selected suspension cells of Brassica napus  ap. 1460-1466.  ap. 1460-1466. ill.  a2019-12-05  aCell lines of suspension cultures of Brassica napus cv. Jet Neuf were identified for their ability to tolerate 100 millimolar Rb+, a level which was double the normally lethal concentration. Ten spontaneous isolates were obtained from approximately 5 X 10(7) cells, one of which was reestablished as a cell suspension. This cell line, JL5, was also resistant to the other group IA cations--Li+, Na+, K+, and Cs+--and this trait was stable for at least 30 cell generations in the absence of Rb+ selection pressure. The growth characteristics were similar to those of sensitive cells under nonselective conditions. The selected JL5 cells were shown by analysis to have effected more net accumulation of K+ and Rb+ and less of Na+ than did the unselected cells. JL5 and unselected cells after 14 days of culture in basal medium contained 597.2 and 258.2 micromoles of K per gram dry weight, respectively. Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis of K+ influx showed that JL5 possessed an elevated phase 1 Vmax, but there was no alteration in its Km. This is the first time that a plant mutation has been shown to have both increased influx and net absorption of a major essential cation. 3arubidium 3alithium 3acell culture 3atoxic substances 3asuspensions 3acesium 3amutation 3asodium 3apotassium 3aBrassica napus 3akinetics 0anutrient removal by plants 0alines 0aresistance to injurious factors 0aselection pressure0 tPlant physiology.g1989 Dec., v. 91, no. 4 p.1460-1466x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02645naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001600136245010700152300001600259520148400275650001301759650002201772650000901794650001501803650002101818650002501839650002501864653002801889653001901917653001601936653001601952700002101968700001501989700001702004700001902021773012902040852000902169930003302178945001302211946001102224655001202235IND2047544020221119004749.0950830e19950801enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204754402DNAL7 ano direct match2pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerks, B.C.14aThe napEDABC gene cluster encoding the periplasmic nitrate reductase system of Thiosphaera pantotropha  ap. 983-992.  aThe napEDABC locus coding for the periplasmic nitrate reductase of Thiosphaera pantotropha has been cloned and sequenced. The large and small subunits of the enzyme are coded by napA and napB. The sequence of NapA indicates that this protein binds the GMP-conjugated form of the molybdopterin cofactor. Cysteine-181 is proposed to ligate the molybdenum atom. It is inferred that the active site of the periplasmic nitrate reductase is structurally related to those of the molybdenum-dependent formate dehydrogenases and bacterial assimilatory nitrate reductases, but is distinct from that of the membrane-bound respiratory nitrate reductases. A four-cysteine motif at the N-terminus of NapA binds a [4Fe-4S] cluster. The DNA- and protein-derived primary sequence of NapB confirm that this protein is a dihaem c-type cytochrome and, together with spectroscopic data, indicate that both NapB haems have bishistidine ligation. napC is predicted to code for a membrane-anchored tetrahaem c-type cytochrome that shows sequence similarity to the NirT cytochrome c family. NapC may be the direct electron donor to the NapAB complex. napD is predicted to encode a soluble cytoplasmic protein and napE a monotopic integral membrane protein. napDABC genes can be discerned at the aeg-46.5 locus of Escherichia coli K-12, suggesting that this operon encodes a periplasmic nitrate reductase system, while napD and napC are identified adjacent to the napAB genes of Alcaligenes eutrophus H16. 3abacteria 3anitrate reductase 3aheme 3amolybdenum 3astructural genes 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/z36773 0aembl/z36773 0addbj/z367731 aRichardson, D.J.1 aReilly, A.1 aWillis, A.C.1 aFerguson, S.J.0 tBiochemical journal.g1995 Aug. 1, v. 309, no. pt.3 p.983-992aBiochemical journal (London, England : 1984)x0264-60217nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02075naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002300129245013000152300001800282300002300300500001500323520101100338650001601349650001101365650002601376650002001402650001501422650001901437650002001456650001501476650001501491653001701506700001201523700002301535773007601558852000901634939003301643946001301676655001201689IND9001803020221119004831.0900426e198912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900180302DNAL7 a166672052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanchez-Ferrer, A.10aNovel procedure for extraction of a latent-grape polyphenoloxidase using temperature-induced phase separation in Triton X-114  ap. 1481-1487.  ap. 1481-1487. ill.  a2019-12-05  aPolyphenoloxidase from grape berries is extracted only by nonionic detergents with a hydrophilic-lipophilic balance between 12.4 and 13.5. The enzyme was partially purified in latent form, free of phenolics and chlorophylls, by using temperature phase partitioning in a solution of Triton X-114. This method permits the purification of the enzyme with the same fold purification as the commonly used method, but with a yield three times higher and a 90% reduction in time needed. The latent enzyme can be activated by different treatments, including trypsin and cationic and anionic detergents. Cetyltrimethylamonium bromide was found to be the most effective detergent activator, followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate. Polyphenoloxidase in grape berries, in spite of being an integral membrane protein, had an anomalous interaction with Triton X-114, remaining in the detergent-poor phase after phase separation. This could be explained by its having a short hydrophobic tail that anchors it to the membrane. 3apolyphenols 3agrapes 3alaboratory techniques 3aoxidoreductases 3aextraction 3aVitis vinifera 3aelectrophoresis 3aseparation 3adetergents 0apurification1 aBru, R.1 aGarcia-Carmona, F.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 Dec., v. 91, no. 4 p.1481-1487x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02395naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245007500148300001800223300002300241520145000264650002001714650001901734650001801753650001701771650001701788650001601805650001501821650001601836653001401852653002101866700001501887773007601902852000901978939003301987946001302020655001202033IND9001803620221119004741.0900426e198912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900180362DNAL7 a166672112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacobsen, J.V.10aHeat-stable proteins and abscisic acid action in barley aleurone cells  ap. 1520-1526.  ap. 1520-1526. ill.  a[35S]Methionine labeling experiments showed that abscisic acid (ABA) induced the synthesis of at least 25 polypeptides in mature barley (Hordeum vulgare) aleurone cells. The polypeptides were not secreted. Whereas most of the proteins extracted from aleurone cells were coagulated by heating to 100 degrees C for 10 minutes, most of the ABA-induced polypeptides remained in solution (heat-stable). ABA had little effect on the spectrum of polypeptides that were synthesized and secreted by aleurone cells, and most of these secreted polypeptides were also heat-stable. Coomassie blue staining of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels indicated that ABA-induced polypeptides already occurred in high amounts in mature aleurone layers having accumulated during grain development. About 60% of the total protein extracted from mature aleurone was heat stable. Amino acid analyses of total preparations of heat-stable and heat-labile proteins showed that, compared to heat-labile proteins, heat-stable intracellular proteins were characterized by higher glutamic acid/glutamine (Glx) and glycine levels and lower levels of neutral amino acids. Secreted heat-stable proteins were rich in Glx and proline. The possibilities that the accumulation of the heat-stable polypeptides during grain development is controlled by ABA and that the function of these polypeptides is related to their abundance and extraordinary heat stability are considered. 3aHordeum vulgare 3aaleurone cells 3aabscisic acid 3apolypeptides 3abiosynthesis 3aheat stress 3asolubility 3acoagulation 0astability 0acharacterization1 aShaw, D.C.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 Dec., v. 91, no. 4 p.1520-1526x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02970naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001300184245013900197300002000336500001500356506007600371520124800447506003701695650002101732650001301753650001301766650001601779650001601795650003101811650002401842650001501866650001901881653000901900653001701909700001701926700001901943700001301962700001301975700002901988700001602017700002202033700001802055700002002073700002102093773017602114852000902290856008302299930003302382946001302415655001202428IND4438736920221207063931.0100619e20100615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443873692DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10056321072doi7 aPMC28907092pmcid7 a205344992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Fan10aColorimetric detection of DNA, small molecules, proteins, and ions using unmodified gold nanoparticles and conjugated polyelectrolytes  ap. 10837-10841.  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe have demonstrated a novel sensing strategy employing single-stranded probe DNA, unmodified gold nanoparticles, and a positively charged, water-soluble conjugated polyelectrolyte to detect a broad range of targets including nucleic acid (DNA) sequences, proteins, small molecules, and inorganic ions. This nearly "universal" biosensor approach is based on the observation that, while the conjugated polyelectrolyte specifically inhibits the ability of single-stranded DNA to prevent the aggregation of gold-nanoparticles, no such inhibition is observed with double-stranded or otherwise "folded" DNA structures. Colorimetric assays employing this mechanism for the detection of hybridization are sensitive and convenient--picomolar concentrations of target DNA are readily detected with the naked eye, and the sensor works even when challenged with complex sample matrices such as blood serum. Likewise, by employing the binding-induced folding or association of aptamers we have generalized the approach to the specific and convenient detection of proteins, small molecules, and inorganic ions. Finally, this new biosensor approach is quite straightforward and can be completed in minutes without significant equipment or training overhead.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aoligonucleotides 3ananogold 3aproteins 3acolorimetry 3ablood serum 3anucleic acid hybridization 3asingle-stranded DNA 3abiosensors 3ainorganic ions 0aions 0aelectrolytes1 aZuo, Xiaolei1 aYang, Renqiang1 aXiao, Yi1 aKang, Di1 aVallée-Bélisle, Alexis1 aGong, Xiong1 aYuen, Jonathan D.1 aHsu, Ben B.Y.1 aHeeger, Alan J.1 aPlaxco, Kevin W.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 June 15, v. 107, no. 24 p.10837-10841dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10056321073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100619b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02557naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245008800143300001800231300002300249500001500272520150000287650001401787650001301801650001101814650002101825650001101846650001001857650001601867650001601883650002001899653003201919653002501951653001101976700001601987700001302003773007602016852000902092939003302101946001302134655001202147IND9001802520221119004737.0900426e198912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900180252DNAL7 a166672002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, J.J.10aNegative pressures produced in an artificial osmotic cell by extracellular freezing  ap. 1454-1459.  ap. 1454-1459. ill.  a2019-12-05  aA rigid artificial osmotic cell has been constructed using reverse osmosis membranes that were supported by metal grids from both sides to yield a high elastic modulus of the system. The cell could be subjected to changes of external water potential either by evaporation or by application of hypertonic solutions so that negative internal pressures or tensions (i.e. pressures smaller than atmospheric) could be built up. Negative pressures were also obtained by freeze-induced dehydration when the cell was cooled to -1.5 degrees C and ice was formed on the outer surface. Tensions of up to -0.7 megapascals (-7 bars) could be established in the different types of experiments. Smaller tensions could be kept in the cell for several hours. Cavitations caused the pressure to increase instantaneously to values of about -0.1 megapascals (relative to atmospheric pressure) as theoretically expected. Cavitations could be reversed by pressurizing the system. The cell could be cooled to subzero temperatures while the cell solution was under tension. Intracellular freezing could be easily detected from an instantaneous increase in pressure. When the membrane was not supported by a grid from the inside (analogous to the situation in plant cells), no tensions could be built up in the system. The results support the idea of the incidence of negative pressures during freezing, if the wall is sufficiently rigid to prevent cell collapse and if the membrane does not separate from the cell wall. 3asolutions 3afreezing 3aturgor 3aosmotic pressure 3amodels 3acells 3atemperature 3ameasurement 3awater potential 0adehydration (physiological) 0ahypertonic solutions 0aplants1 aSteudle, E.1 aBeck, E.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 Dec., v. 91, no. 4 p.1454-1459x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02891naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002600136245019500162300001400357520160100371650002801972650001802000650001002018650003102028650001702059650001002076650002502086650002502111650003502136653002802171700001702199700002002216700001602236700001802252700001702270773012802287852000902415930003302424945001302457946001102470655001202481IND2049603620221119005541.0960125e19951115enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204960362DNAL7 ano direct match2pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMillward-Sadler, S.J.10aNovel cellulose-binding domains, NodB homologues and conserved modular architecture in xylanases from the aerobic soil bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa and Cellvibrio mixtus  ap. 39-48.  aTo test the hypothesis that selective pressure has led to the retention of cellulose-binding domains (CBDs) by hemicellulase enzymes from aerobic bacteria, four new xylanase (xyn) genes from two cellulolytic soil bacteria, Pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa and Cellvibrio mixtus, have been isolated and sequenced. Pseudomonas genes xynE and xynF encoded modular xylanases (XYLE and XYLF) with predicted Mr values of 68 600 and 65 000 respectively. XYLE contained a glycosyl hydrolase family 11 catalytic domain at its N-terminus, followed by three other domains; the second of these exhibited sequence identity with NodB from rhizobia. The C-terminal domain (40 residues) exhibited significant sequence identity with a non-catalytic domain of previously unknown function, conserved in all the cellulases and one of the hemicellulases previously characterized from the pseudomonad, and was shown to function as a CBD when fused to the reporter protein glutathione-S-transferase. XYLF contained a C-terminal glycosyl hydrolase family 10 catalytic domain and a novel CBD at its N-terminus. C. mixtus genes xynA and xynB exhibited substantial sequence identity with xynE and xynF respectively, and encoded modular xylanases with the same molecular architecture and, by inference, the same functional properties. In the absence of extensive cross-hybridization between other multiple cel (cellulase) and xyn genes from P. fluorescens subsp. cellulosa and genomic DNA from C. mixtus, similarity between the two pairs of xylanases may indicate a recent transfer of genes between the two bacteria. 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3asoil bacteria 3axylan 3axylanolytic microorganisms 3aglucosidases 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3axylan endo-1,3-beta-xylosidase 0amolecular sequence data1 aDavidson, K.1 aHazlewood, G.P.1 aBlack, G.W.1 aGilbert, H.J.1 aClarke, J.H.0 tBiochemical journal.g1995 Nov. 15, v. 312, no. pt.1 p.39-48aBiochemical journal (London, England : 1984)x0264-60217nnas  aDNAL  a19960202b19960208c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02694naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245010800166300001800274520159500292650002901887650001201916650001201928650002501940650002301965650003301988650002402021650001302045650001302058650005202071653001102123653002002134653001402154773008502168852000902253939003302262946001302295655001202308IND8805587920221119005043.0881123e198810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880558792DNAL7 a30495512pmid7 aPMC2115282pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBisson, L.F.10aHigh-affinity glucose transport in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is under general glucose repression control  ap. 4838-4845.  aSaccharomyces cerevisiae mutants defective in growth on low glucose concentration (lgn mutants) were isolated and screened for abnormal glucose transport. Nine complementation groups were identified, falling into two broad groups: those unable to significantly derepress high-affinity (low-Km) glucose uptake (lgn1, lgn4, lgn5, lgn7, and lgn8), and those with elevated repressed levels of high-affinity uptake that either derepress to normal or near normal levels of high-affinity uptake with loss of low-affinity transport (lgn2 and lgn3) or derepress only slightly, appearing to have an intermediate yet constitutive level of high-affinity transport (lgn6 and lgn9). Further analysis of the lgn mutations revealed pleiotropic phenotypes most consistent with the true defect being in regulation or expression of glucose repression and derepression. The kinetics of glucose uptake in strains carrying known mutations preventing derepression of glucose-repressible functions (snf1, snf2, snf4, and snf6 demonstrated that three of these mutations (snf1, snf4, and snf6) were similarly defective in derepression of high-affinity glucose uptake. The snf2 and snf5 mutations had no apparent effect on glucose uptake. Two mutations resulting in constitutive expression of glucose-repressible functions, cid1 and reg1, resulted in constitutive expression of high-affinity glucose uptake. These data support the conclusion that high-affinity glucose uptake in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is under general glucose repression control. The implications of other properties of these mutants are discussed. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3amutants 3aglucose 2aBiological Transport 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aMutation 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 0auptake 0agenetic control 0atransport0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1988 Oct., v. 170, no. 10 p.4838-4845x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02174naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002100136245012600157300001600283520106200299650001701361650002801378650001701406650002101423650001801444650001801462650001701480650001101497653001701508653001501525700001801540700001601558700001901574773012901593852000901722930003301731945001301764946001101777655001201788IND2053092620221119005151.0960918e19960601enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205309262DNAL7 ano direct match2pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastelluccio, C.10aDifferential distribution of ferulic acid to the major plasma constituents in relation to its potential as an antioxidant  ap. 691-694.  aThe hydroxycinnamates, intermediates in the phenylpropanoid synthetic pathway, are effective in enhancing the resistance of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to oxidation in the order caffeic acid > ferulic acid > p-coumaric acid. It is unclear whether the mode of action of ferulic acid as an antioxidant is based on its activities in the aqueous or the lipophilic phase. Partitioning of 14C-labelled ferulic acid into plasma and its components, LDL and the albumin-rich fractions, has been studied under conditions of maximum aqueous solubility. The majority of ferulic acid associates with the albumin-rich fraction of the plasma, although a proportion is also found to partition between the LDL and aqueous phases; however, ferulic acid does not associate with the lipid portion of the LDL particle, suggesting that it exerts its antioxidant properties from the aqueous phase. This is of particular interest since the results demonstrate that ferulic acid is a more effective antioxidant against LDL oxidation than the hydrophilic antioxidant ascorbic acid. 3aferulic acid 3alow density lipoprotein 3aantioxidants 3aisotope labeling 3aascorbic acid 3acinnamic acid 3ablood plasma 3ahumans 0adistribution 0ainhibition1 aBolwell, G.P.1 aGerrish, C.1 aRice-Evans, C.0 tBiochemical journal.g1996 June 1, v. 316, no. pt.2 p.691-694aBiochemical journal (London, England : 1984)x0264-60217nnas  aDNAL  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02318naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009900126300001600225520139600241650001901637650001401656650001601670650001801686650003701704653001401741653002601755653001101781653002501792700001701817700002001834773007101854852000901925939003301934946001301967655001201980IND8805588820221119005159.0881125e198809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880558882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReiners, S.10aUptake, translocation, and metabolism of thiobencarb in two lettuce, Lactuca sativa, cultivars  ap. 553-557.  aTwo lettuce cultivars exhibiting differential levels of tolerance to thiobencarb in soil and nutrient solution assays were examined. Seedlings of 'Dark Green Boston' (BOS), a susceptible cultivar, were found to show significant inhibitions in foliar growth compared to the tolerant 'Great Lakes 366' (GLA). Reductions of 57% occurred in BOS leaf dry weights at rates of 3 microM thiobencarb as soon as 4 days after treatment. In addition, growth abnormalities including fused leaves were observed in the BOS cultivar, indicating inhibition early in leaf development at the meristems twenty-nine and 22% of applied 14C-thiobencarb was absorbed from nutrient solution by BOS and GLA, respectively. This difference is probably due to BOS having a 50% greater root system at the time of treatment. Greater absorption and accumulation of radioactivity in the leaves, as well as significantly greater amounts of parent 14C-thiobencarb in the foliage of BOS compared to GLA (30 and 19%, respectively) may account for the selectivity observed. Metabolism of 14C-thiobencarb occurred within 1 day in both cultivars, with the apparent production of herbicide conjugates accounting for more than 90% of the extracted radiolabel 12 days after treatment. A thiobencarb sulfoxide metabolite was not identified in these studies, indicating sulfoxide production is not a mechanism of selectivity in lettuce. 3aLactuca sativa 3acultivars 3athiobencarb 3aphytotoxicity 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 0atolerance 0aherbicide selectivity 0auptake 0aherbicide metabolism1 aGorski, S.F.1 aDeSouza, J.J.V.0 tWeed science.g1988 Sept., v. 36, no. 5 p.553-557x0043-17457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02610naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120072001700138072001700155072001700172100002200189245014100211300001600352500001500368520114600383650001201529650001601541650001301557650002501570650001301595650001301608650002301621650002701644650004201671650001901713650001401732650001101746651001501757653002401772653001301796653001801809653002501827700002301852773007101875852000901946856007801955930003302033945002502066946001302091655001202104IND4372132820221119003347.0050708e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437213282DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-89-06192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The pathogen produces large masses of orange-colored macroconidia on stem lesions that extend up to 35 cm in length from the soil surface. Populations of macroconidia (97% viability) range from 1.1 x 10(8) to 1.9 x 10(8) per cm of infected stem tissue. An aboveground life stage for a soilborne pathogen could serve as a source for acquisition and aerial dissemination by adult shore flies, fungus gnats, and moth flies. Our results provide evidence that these three insects are attracted to and readily acquire (either externally and/or internally) macroconidia of F. avenaceum produced on naturally infected lisianthus stems and then disseminate acquired macroconidia to healthy plants, which subsequently died, or to an abiotic substrate (Komada's medium, KM). The high percentage of transmission, as evidenced by both the number of KM plates colonized by the pathogen (up to 68.5% within 18 h) and the number of plants infected (75% within 4 days), reflects the efficiency of these insects as vectors. 3aconidia 3ahost plants 3aBradysia 3adisease transmission 3aPsychoda 3astem rot 3aFusarium avenaceum 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aEustoma exaltatum subsp. russellianum 3ainsect vectors 3acrown rot 3aimagos 3aCalifornia 0aGibberella avenacea 0aScatella 0aadult insects 0aEustoma russellianum1 aStanghellini, M.E.0 tPlant disease.g2005 June, v. 89, no. 6 p.619-623x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-89-06193Available from publisher's Web site  a20060925b20061003c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/09/06  aOther US 7aarticle02412naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245010700145300001600252520099300268650001101261650001001272650001301282650001301295650002301308650002001331650001701351650001201368650001901380650002101399650001901420650001701439650001201456650004401468650001101512650004001523650004901563650001101612650003701623650003001660651001001690700001301700700001601713700001501729773008401744852000901828930003301837945001301870946001101883655001201894IND2052231520221119003319.0960722e199605  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205223152DNAL7 a87626102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatamoto, H.10aLipoprotein lipase activity of post-heparin plasma in Japanese black cattle affected with fat necrosis  ap. 339-345.  aPost-heparin plasma (PHP) lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity and serum lipoprotein concentration were examined in Japanese Black cows affected with fat necrosis. The PHP-LPL activity in the affected cows was significantly (P<0.001) higher than in normal animals and tended to reduce 4 weeks after treatment with isoprothiolane. This finding indicates that affected cows have a predisposition to deposit more fat into adipose tissue than normal animals. The serum concentrations of triglyceride in beta-lipo- protein and of cholesterol, phospholipid and total lipid in alpha-lipoprotein were significantly (P<0.05) lower in the affected cows. Elevated levels of phospholipid and total lipid in alpha-lipoprotein as well as decreased levels of non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) were observed after medication.

In this procedure, a set of four primers matching a total of six sequences of the coat protein (CP) gene of PVY were designed in such a way that a loop could be formed and elongated during DNA amplification. Using PVY CP complementary DNA clones as templates, the LAMP reaction was optimized by adjusting the concentrations of MgSO4, dNTPs, and Bst DNA polymerase. The effects of fragment length of target DNA on LAMP also were investigated. Two-step and one-step RT-LAMPs were performed using RNA extracts of various PVY cultures, and the results were correlated with two-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of PVY. Further, the turbidity caused by precipitation of magnesium pyrophosphate formed in positive RT-LAMP reactions was used to measure the amplification by utilizing a time-saving spectrophotometric method. The one-step RT-LAMP-turbidity method gave results comparable with the two-step RT-PCR method for detection of PVY from potato leaf and tuber samples. Of the total 240 samples, 234 were diagnosed similarly by both methods. 3areverse transcription 3aPotato virus Y 3aplant viruses 3acoat proteins 3aDNA primers 3adisease detection 3adisease diagnosis 3anucleotide sequences 0areverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplication0 tPlant disease.g2005 June, v. 89, no. 6 p.605-610wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-89-06053Available from publisher's Web site  a20060925b20061003c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/09/06  aOther US 7aarticle03477naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245013300203300002000336506007600356520177200432506003702204650003002241650001402271650001102285650002402296650002702320650002602347650001302373650001302386650001202399650002302411650001602434650001102450650001202461700002002473700001902493700001902512700002502531700002002556700001802576700002002594700001902614773017602633852000902809856008302818930003302901946001302934655001202947IND4438740520221207064447.0100619e20100615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443874052DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10036531072doi7 aPMC28907472pmcid7 a205344652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, Kyle C.10aProtein complexing in a methanogen suggests electron bifurcation and electron delivery from formate to heterodisulfide reductase  ap. 11050-11055.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn methanogenic Archaea, the final step of methanogenesis generates methane and a heterodisulfide of coenzyme M and coenzyme B (CoM-S-S-CoB). Reduction of this heterodisulfide by heterodisulfide reductase to regenerate HS-CoM and HS-CoB is an exergonic process. Thauer et al. [Thauer, et al. 2008 Nat Rev Microbiol 6:579-591] recently suggested that in hydrogenotrophic methanogens the energy of heterodisulfide reduction powers the most endergonic reaction in the pathway, catalyzed by the formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase, via flavin-based electron bifurcation. Here we present evidence that these two steps in methanogenesis are physically linked. We identify a protein complex from the hydrogenotrophic methanogen, Methanococcus maripaludis, that contains heterodisulfide reductase, formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase, F₄₂₀-nonreducing hydrogenase, and formate dehydrogenase. In addition to establishing a physical basis for the electron-bifurcation model of energy conservation, the composition of the complex also suggests that either H₂ or formate (two alternative electron donors for methanogenesis) can donate electrons to the heterodisulfide-H₂ via F₄₂₀-nonreducing hydrogenase or formate via formate dehydrogenase. Electron flow from formate to the heterodisulfide rather than the use of H₂ as an intermediate represents a previously unknown path of electron flow in methanogenesis. We further tested whether this path occurs by constructing a mutant lacking F₄₂₀-nonreducing hydrogenase. The mutant displayed growth equal to wild-type with formate but markedly slower growth with hydrogen. The results support the model of electron bifurcation and suggest that formate, like H₂, is closely integrated into the methanogenic pathway.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMethanococcus maripaludis 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aferredoxin hydrogenase 3aformate dehydrogenase 3aformates 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amodels 3amutants1 aWong, Phoebe M.1 aWang, Tiansong1 aLie, Thomas J.1 aDodsworth, Jeremy A.1 aSwanson, Ingrid1 aBurn, June A.1 aHackett, Murray1 aLeigh, John A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 June 15, v. 107, no. 24 p.11050-11055dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10036531073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100619b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02982naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002400184245012900208300002000337506007600357520125200433506003701685650001801722650001701740650001401757650001601771650001901787650001701806650001001823650001301833650001001846650001601856650001601872650000901888650001101897650001701908650001301925700002401938700001801962700002501980700002402005700002002029700002202049700001902071700002402090773017602114852000902290856008302299930003302382946001302415655001202428IND4438739120221207064441.0100619e20100615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443873912DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10052561072doi7 aPMC28907512pmcid7 a205344532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarrington, Emma M.10aBH3 mimetics antagonizing restricted prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins represent another class of selective immune modulatory drugs  ap. 10967-10971.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDeath by apoptosis shapes tissue homeostasis. Apoptotic mechanisms are so universal that harnessing them for tailored immune intervention would seem challenging; however, the range and different expression levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic molecules among tissues offer hope that targeting only a subset of such molecules may be therapeutically useful. We examined the effects of the drug ABT-737, a mimetic of the killer BH3 domain of the Bcl-2 family of proteins that induces apoptosis by antagonizing Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-W (but not Mcl-1 and A1), on the mouse immune system. Treatment with ABT-737 reduced the numbers of selected lymphocyte and dendritic cell subpopulations, most markedly in lymph nodes. It inhibited the persistence of memory B cells, the establishment of newly arising bone marrow plasma cells, and the induction of a cytotoxic T cell response. Preexisting plasma cells and germinal centers were unaffected. Notably, ABT-737 was sufficiently immunomodulatory to allow long-term survival of pancreatic allografts, reversing established diabetes in this model. These results provide an insight into the selective mechanisms of immune cell survival and how this selectivity avails a different strategy for immune modulation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3aallografting 3aapoptosis 3abone marrow 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3adeath 3adiabetes 3adrugs 3ahomeostasis 3alymph nodes 3amice 3amodels 3aplasma cells 3aproteins1 aVikstrom, Ingela B.1 aLight, Amanda1 aSutherland, Robyn M.1 aLondrigan, Sarah L.1 aMason, Kylie D.1 aHuang, David C.S.1 aLew, Andrew M.1 aTarlinton, David M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 June 15, v. 107, no. 24 p.10967-10971dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10052561073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100619b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02259naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072001700146072001700163100001600180245010900196300001600305500001500321520089700336650003101233650001801264650001801282650001501300650002201315650001601337650005201353650001201405650001501417650002301432650002401455653003701479700001601516700001201532700002001544773007101564852000901635856008601644930003301730945002501763946001301788655001201801IND4370892720221119003632.0050601e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437089272DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2004.88.8.8652doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Transformation was performed on the epicotyl segments obtained from a young seedling that was grown in the dark. Southern blot hybridization analysis showed that the transgene was stable in the transgenic lines after regeneration and propagation by grafting. Transgenic lines were screened for tolerance to CiMV by mechanical inoculation. Infection was monitored 30, 60, 90, and 120 days after inoculation by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The transgenic line 24 had the lowest infection rate (7.1%) at 60 days after inoculation, in contrast to that of nontransgenic plants (65.1%). The response of other lines to inoculation ranged from susceptibility to moderate tolerance. 3aCitrus yellow mosaic virus 3aplant viruses 3acoat proteins 3atransgenes 3atransgenic plants 3ahost plants 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aoranges 3arootstocks 3adisease resistance 3aPoncirus trifoliata 0aCitrus mosaic virus (Badnavirus)1 aShimizu, T.1 aIto, T.1 aHirabayashi, T.0 tPlant disease.g2004 Aug., v. 88, no. 8 p.865-868x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2004.88.8.8653Available from publisher's Web site  a20051024b20051102c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/10/24  aOther US 7aarticle02454naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245010600205300002000311506007600331520095900407506003701366650002101403650000801424650002001432650003201452650001901484650002201503650001401525650001101539650001301550650002701563700002401590700002801614700002601642700002601668773017601694852000901870856008301879930003301962946001301995655001202008IND4438737720221207072505.0100619e20100615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443873772DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10030151072doi7 aPMC28907292pmcid7 a205344942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKidmose, Rune T.10aStructure of the Qβ replicase, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase consisting of viral and host proteins  ap. 10884-10889.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe RNA-dependent RNA polymerase core complex formed upon infection of Escherichia coli by the bacteriophage Qβ is composed of the viral catalytic β-subunit as well as the host translation elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-Ts, which are required for initiation of RNA replication. We have determined the crystal structure of the complex between the β-subunit and the two host proteins to 2.5-Å resolution. Whereas the basic catalytic machinery in the viral subunit appears similar to other RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, a unique C-terminal region of the β-subunit engages in extensive interactions with EF-Tu and may contribute to the separation of the transient duplex formed between the template and the nascent product to allow exponential amplification of the phage genome. The evolution of resistance by the host appears to be impaired because of the interactions of the β-subunit with parts of EF-Tu essential in recognition of aminoacyl-tRNA.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aRNA 3aRNA replication 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3abacteriophages 3acrystal structure 3aevolution 3agenome 3aproteins 3atranslation (genetics)1 aVasiliev, Nikita N.1 aChetverin, Alexander B.1 aAndersen, Gregers Rom1 aKnudsen, Charlotte R.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 June 15, v. 107, no. 24 p.10884-10889dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10030151073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100619b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02532naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001700136245009300153300001600246520172300262650002101985650002302006700001202029700001802041773012902059852000902188930003302197945001302230946001102243655001202254IND2090713420221119003505.0980526e19971101enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND209071342DNAL7 ano direct match2pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibbon, B.C.10aCharacterization of maize (Zea mays) pollen profilin function in vitro and in live cells  ap. 909-915.  aProfilin is a small, 12-15 kDa, actin-binding protein that interacts with at least three different ligands. The 1:1 interaction of profilin with globular actin (G-actin) was originally thought to provide a mechanism for sequestering actin monomers in the cytoplasm. It has recently become clear that the role of profilin in the cell is more complex, perhaps due to interactions with polyphosphoinositides and proline-rich proteins, or due to the ability to lower the critical concentration for actin assembly at the fast-growing barbed end of actin filaments. Because actin-binding proteins have been shown to behave differently with heterologous sources of actin, we characterized the interaction between maize pollen profilins and plant G-actin. The equilibrium dissociation constants measured by tryptophan fluorescence quenching were similar to those of other CaATP-G-actin-profilin complexes (Kd = 1.0-1.5 micrometer). The ability of maize profilin isoforms to bind poly-L-proline was analysed, and the Kd values for recombinant pollen and human profilin were similar when determined by two independent methods. However, the affinity of native maize pollen profilin for poly-L-proline was substantially lower than that of any of the recombinant proteins by one of these assays. The possibility of post-translational modification of profilin in the mature pollen grain is discussed. Finally, we quantified the effects of microinjection of each profilin isoform on the cytoarchitecture of Tradescantia stamen hair cells and show that the resultant disruption can be used to compare proteins in living cells. The results are discussed in relation to a recent model of the interphase actin array in these plant cells. 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry1 aRen, H.1 aStaiger, C.J.0 tBiochemical journal.g1997 Nov. 1, v. 327, no. pt.3 p.909-915aBiochemical journal (London, England : 1984)x0264-60217nnas  aDNAL  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02764naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245008200143300001800225520148900243650001601732650001601748650001601764650001701780650001301797650000901810650001701819650003101836650001201867650001601879650000901895650003501904650002401939650000901963650000901972650002401981650002702005650001902032650001502051700001602066700001802082700001502100700001802115773008202133852000902215939003302224946001302257655001202270IND8805620020221119003431.0881123e198810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880562002DNAL7 a31837662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAubert, R.10aSerum lipoprotein profiles in mice: effects of early over- and undernutrition  ap. 1190-1196.  aEffects of early over- and undernutrition on lipoprotein profiles of adult Swiss male mice reared in litters of different sizes were investigated. Lipoproteins were isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation and defined by chemical composition. Protein moieties were defined by their charges. The lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in epididymal adipose tissue, heart and diaphragm was measured. Early feeding patterns induced permanent body weight differences in adult mice. Serum phospholipid content was significantly higher in obese than in control mice. Overfeeding led to significantly higher activity of LPL in adipose tissue; inversely, undernutrition induced a lower LPL activity. There was a trend toward variations of lipoprotein concentrations in relation to litter size, with significant differences being observed only between obese and undernourished mice for LDL-HDL1 (low density lipoprotein-high density lipoprotein) and HDL1 concentrations. Compared with normally fed mice the most notable alterations in plasma lipoprotein composition were, in LDL-HDL2, greater cholesteryl ester in obese and less phospholipid in undernourished mice. In contrast, tetramethyl-urea-soluble apolipoprotein distribution was unaffected by litter size. Although moderate differences were observed in lipoprotein compositions and levels in over- or undernourished mice, further investigations of lipoprotein metabolism and metabolic abnormalities in this animal model are required. 3aoverfeeding 3alitter size 3ablood serum 3alipoproteins 3aneonates 3amice 3amalnutrition 2aAdipose Tissuexenzymology 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aDiet 2aLipoprotein Lipasexmetabolism 2aLipoproteinsxblood 2aMale 2aMice 2aMusclesxenzymology 2aMyocardiumxenzymology 2aObesityxblood 2aOrgan Size1 aCamus, M.C.1 aBourgeois, F.1 aHerzog, J.1 aLemonnier, D.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1988 Oct., v. 118, no. 10 p.1190-1196x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02262naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245012500202300002000327506007600347520092200423506003701345650001601382650001801398650002801416650001701444650002001461650001401481650002601495700001701521700002401538773017601562852000901738856008301747930003301830946001301863655001201876IND4438741020221207072507.0100619e20100615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443874102DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10065841072doi7 aPMC28907372pmcid7 a205344702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraki, Yoichi10aPlasma membrane insertion of the AMPA receptor GluA2 subunit is regulated by NSF binding and Q/R editing of the ion pore  ap. 11080-11085.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe delivery of AMPA receptors to the plasma membrane is a critical step both for the synaptic delivery of these receptors and for the regulation of synaptic transmission. To directly visualize fusion events of transport vesicles containing the AMPA receptor GluA2 subunit with the plasma membrane we used pHluorin-tagged GluA2 subunits and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. We demonstrate that the plasma membrane insertion of GluA2 requires the NSF binding site within its intracellular cytoplasmic domain and that RNA editing of the Q/R site in the ion channel region plays a key role in GluA2 plasma membrane insertion. Finally, we show that plasma membrane insertion of heteromeric GluA2/3 receptors follows the same rules as homomeric GluA2 receptors. These results demonstrate that the plasma membrane delivery of GluA2 containing AMPA receptors is regulated by its unique structural elements.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA editing 3abinding sites 3afluorescence microscopy 3aion channels 3aplasma membrane 3areceptors 3asynaptic transmission1 aLin, Da-Ting1 aHuganir, Richard L.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 June 15, v. 107, no. 24 p.11080-11085dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10065841073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100619b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02962naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120072001700138072001700155072001700172072001700189100001800206245010200224300001600326520131200342650002701654650003001681650001901711650002301730650002001753650001201773650001601785650001301801650002501814650001901839650002501858650001801883650001601901650003001917650002501947650002701972650002301999650004302022650001302065650001202078700001602090700001802106700001602124700001602140773007002156852000902226856007802235930003302313945002502346946001302371655001202384IND4371071220221119003600.0050607e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437107122DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-89-05012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

After artificial inoculation with a local isolate of Ralstonia solanacearum, the progeny consisting of 90 lines was transplanted into a naturally infested field in Guadeloupe, Lesser Antilles. The 2 years of experimentation resulted in repeatable results, with a high heritability of the resistance, attesting the reliability of the evaluation procedure and the stability of the resistance over years. Two to five genes with additive effects were estimated to control the resistance, indicating an oligogenic control as observed in tomato sources of resistance. Relationships with resistance to other soilborne or tropical diseases were examined. Susceptibility to Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and to nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) were significantly linked with resistance to bacterial wilt, whereas neither resistance to Phytophthora capsici nor to Leveillula taurica were linked. The similarity of the genetics of resistance to bacterial wilt in pepper and tomato and linkage with TMV resistance locus warrant the comparative mapping of the resistance quantitative trait loci in the genomes of the two species. 3aRalstonia solanacearum 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3abacterial wilt 3adisease resistance 3aCapsicum annuum 3apeppers 3ahost plants 3ahaploidy 3aphenotypic variation 3aplant genetics 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3aplant viruses 3aMeloidogyne 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3aPhytophthora capsici 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aLeveillula taurica 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3atomatoes 3atropics1 aBeramis, M.1 aDaubeze, A.M.1 aBoissot, N.1 aPalloix, A.0 tPlant disease.g2005 May, v. 89, no. 5 p.501-506x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-89-05013Available from publisher's Web site  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/10/06  aOther US 7aarticle02367naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120072001700138072001700155100001700172245009200189300001600281520124000297650003101537650001801568650002201586650001201608650001701620650001501637650001601652651002401668651001401692700001701706700001801723773007001741852000901811856007801820930003301898945002501931946001301956655001201969IND4371071720221119003740.0050607e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437107172DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-89-05152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBooker, H.M.10aEffect of Cowpea severe mosaic virus on crop growth characteristics and yield of cowpea  ap. 515-520.  aField experiments were carried out in St. Augustine, Trinidad & Tobago, West Indies to determine the effects of time of inoculation of Cowpea severe mosaic virus (CPSMV) and cultivar on crop growth and yield in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata). Crop growth and yield loss were investigated through growth analysis and yield component analysis on three cultivars in two seasons (wet and dry). Time of inoculation had the most profound impact on yield. Inoculations during the early log phase (seedling stage), 12 days after seeding (DAS), consistently had the greatest impact (50 to 85% yield loss) compared with those inoculated during the exponential growth phase (24 DAS; 22 to 66% yield loss) or linear growth phase (35 DAS; 2 to 36% yield loss). The effects were particularly pronounced in the dry season and in the more determinate cultivar, H8-8-27. Reduction in maximum leaf area index, leaf area duration, or maximum vegetative dry matter explained reductions in yield. Yield reductions resulted primarily from reduced pod number per plant and, to a lesser extent, from reduced average pod dry weight. The results show that CPSMV control measures should be aimed at delaying infection by CPSMV to minimize the impact on cowpea yield. 3aCowpea severe mosaic virus 3aplant viruses 3aVigna unguiculata 3acowpeas 3aplant growth 3acrop yield 3acrop losses 3aTrinidad and Tobago 3aCaribbean1 aUmaharan, P.1 aMcDavid, C.R.0 tPlant disease.g2005 May, v. 89, no. 5 p.515-520x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-89-05153Available from publisher's Web site  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/10/06  aOther US 7aarticle03240naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245011100124300001600235500001500251520225200266650001502518650001502533650001402548650001602562650001102578650001502589650001402604650001702618650001802635650002202653650002702675653001402702773008402716852000902800930003302809945001302842946001102855655001202866IND2331177020221119003631.0030304e20021215ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233117702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreco, R.10aPreferential flow in macroporous swelling soil with internal catchment: model development and applications  ap. 150-168.  a2019-12-05  aA new model of infiltration in swelling and shrinking clay soil was developed. The model consisted of two flow domains: soil matrix, with flow modelled by means of Darcy equation, and macropores; the latter was divided in turn into two sub-domains: shrinkage cracks, with aperture dynamically depending on matrix water content, and permanent macropores, independent of matrix saturation. In the shrinkage cracks sub-domain, a kinematic wave equation was derived by considering laminar motion of thin water films, along two parallel nearly vertical walls; in the permanent macropores sub-domain, a kinematic wave equation was assumed, with parameters physically related with macropores shape and dimension. Exchange of water between macropore domains and matrix was introduced in form of sink terms in the macropores mass balance equations, and as source terms in the matrix continuity equation. Infiltration through macropore walls was modelled using a diffusivity function derived from aggregates sorptivity measurements. The internal catchment was included by considering at each layer a fraction of dead end permanent macropores. Water ponding at the bottom of dead end macropores, infiltrated into the corresponding matrix layer. The model was tested against the results of infiltration transients through a large undisturbed swelling and shrinking clay soil column. Outflow rate from column bottom surface was constantly measured, while water content profile was registered at regular time intervals by means of five TDR horizontal probes. In order to quantify model parameters, characterisation of soil matrix was carried out, providing hydraulic conductivity curve, water retention curve, shrinkage characteristic and aggregates diffusivity. All of the other model parameters, thanks to their clear physical meaning, were estimated from direct observation of soil structure, except macropores morphologic parameters, some of which, although measurable, were obtained by calibration due to lack of relevant experimental data. The proposed model proved to be able to adequately simulate measured breakthrough curves as well as temporal evolution of water content profiles along the sample, especially with internal catchment process included. 3amacropores 3aclay soils 3aequations 3adiffusivity 3amodels 3awatersheds 3ashrinkage 3aporous media 3awater content 3apreferential flow 3ahydraulic conductivity 0ahydrology0 tJournal of hydrology.g2002 Dec. 15, v. 269, no. 3/4 p.150-168x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02274naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001800136245011400154300001600268500001500284520116100299650002401460650001601484650001301500650002501513650002301538650001901561653001701580653002501597653002801622700001401650700001501664700001401679773012901693852000901822930003301831945001301864946001101877655001201888IND2045455820221119003625.0950407e19950201enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204545582DNAL7 ano direct match2pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeldwisch, J.10aIdentification of a 23 kDa protein from maize photoaffinity-labelled with 5-azido-[7-3H]indol-3-ylacetic acid  ap. 853-857.  a2019-12-05  aA 23 kDa protein (p23) was identified in microsomal extracts from maize coleoptiles by photoaffinity labelling with 5-azido[7-3H]indol-3-ylacetic acid ([3H]N3IAA). Labelling of p23 was blocked by unlabelled IAA, N3IAA, indol-3-ylbutyric acid and indol-3-yl-lactate. In addition, labelling was efficiently decreased by tryptophan, as well as by the scavenger p-aminobenzoic acid. Labelling was, however, not affected by synthetic auxins such as 1-naphthylacetic acid or 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Competition data suggest that the label was probably bound via the indole ring, and hence labelling was not specific for auxins. The 23 kDa protein was solubilized from crude microsomes by extraction with Triton X-100 and purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange, size-exclusion and reversed-phase chromatography. After electroblotting, the amino acid sequences of the p23 N-terminus as well as the several tryptic peptides were obtained. Database comparisons revealed sequence identity with a maize manganese superoxide dismutase. We conclude that photoaffinity labelling of p23 was pseudo-affinity, and therefore the binding site for IAA is not specific. 3alabeling techniques 3acoleoptiles 3aZea mays 3aamino acid sequences 3aindole acetic acid 3aplant proteins 0apurification 0an-terminal sequences 0amolecular sequence data1 aZettl, R.1 aCampos, N.1 aPalme, K.0 tBiochemical journal.g1995 Feb. 1, v. 305, no. pt.3 p.853-857aBiochemical journal (London, England : 1984)x0264-60217nnas  aDNAL  a19950501b19950505c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03112naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120072001700138100001100155245010300166300001600269520174900285650002702034650003002061650001902091650002202110650002002132650002102152650001102173650001902184650001402203650002002217650004302237650001302280650001602293653001802309700001602327700001602343700002102359700001602380773008802396852000902484856007802493930003302571945002502604946001302629655001202642IND4371070820221119003556.0050607e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437107082DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-89-04972doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aJi, P.10aEvaluation of thymol as biofumigant for control of bacterial wilt of tomato under field conditions  ap. 497-500.  aVolatile plant essential oils thymol and palmarosa oil, used at a concentration of 0.7%, were evaluated under field conditions for control of bacterial wilt of tomato caused by Ralstonia solanacearum. The experimental fields were artificially infested with the bacterial pathogen. Two hours after infestation, the plant essential oils were applied, then the plots were sealed with plastic mulch for 3 or 6 days. Tomato seedlings were transplanted into the field 7 days later. In fall of 2002, 92.5% of tomato plants (cv. Equinox) wilted in the untreated control plots. Both thymol and palmarosa oil soil treatments reduced bacterial wilt incidence significantly. Thymol was more effective than palmarosa oil based on the final assessment, when 33.1 and 48.1% of the plants had wilted in plots treated with thymol and palmarosa oil, respectively. Soil treatment with either thymol or palmarosa oil produced significantly higher yield of tomato than the untreated control. In 2003, only thymol was evaluated. Thymol application significantly reduced bacterial wilt incidence on the susceptible cultivar Solar Set. Disease incidence in untreated plots reached 65.5%, while in thymol treated plots only 12% of plants wilted. Thymol treatment also increased yield of Solar Set significantly compared with the untreated control. This is the first report on the use of thymol for controlling a plant disease under field conditions, which indicated that this compound provided effective control of bacterial wilt on susceptible tomato cultivars when used as preplant treatment of soils. Because of its volatile property and broad-spectrum functions, thymol shows potential to be used as a soil biofumigant for the management of various plant pathogens. 3aRalstonia solanacearum 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3abacterial wilt 3adisease incidence 3adisease control 3achemical control 3athymol 3aessential oils 3afumigants 3asoil fumigation 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3atomatoes 3ahost plants 0apalmarosa oil1 aMomol, M.T.1 aOlson, S.M.1 aPradhanang, P.M.1 aJones, J.B.0 tPlant disease.g2005 May, v. 89, no. 5 p.497-500wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-89-04973Available from publisher's Web site  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/10/06  aOther US 7aarticle02433naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120072001700138072001700155072001700172100002000189245006300209300001600272520119900288650002801487650002301515650003001538650002101568650002501589650001901614650001901633650001101652650001601663651001501679700001601694700001501710700001501725700001801740773007101758852000901829856007801838930003301916945002501949946001301974655001201987IND4369211220221119003540.0050423e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436921122DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-89-04192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAlmeida, R.P.P.10aVector transmission of Xylella fastidiosa to dormant grape  ap. 419-424.  aHomalodisca coagulata (Say) is a sharpshooter leafhopper vector of the bacterial plant pathogen Xylella fastidiosa. Introduced into California about 15 years ago, this insect triggered recent outbreaks of Pierce's disease of grapevine in the state. H. coagulata has been observed feeding on dormant grapevines during the winter, raising the possibility of X. fastidiosa transmission during that season. We tested whether H. coagulata can acquire X. fastidiosa from and inoculate the bacterium to dormant grape (Vitis vinifera) in the laboratory and in the field. Usually, >90% of H. coagulata survived on dormant plants in the laboratory and field. Field experiments showed that H. coagulata can inoculate X. fastidiosa into dormant plants, yet field acquisition experiments did not result in transmission. Transmission to dormant plants during the winter is a potential problem in California vineyards adjacent to citrus groves or other habitats with large overwintering populations of H. coagulata. Because dormant plants have positive root pressure, our findings provide evidence that X. fastidiosa transmission does not require negative pressure in plant xylem to be inoculated into plants. 3aHomalodisca vitripennis 3aXylella fastidiosa 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3aPierce's disease 3adisease transmission 3ainsect vectors 3aVitis vinifera 3agrapes 3afruit crops 3aCalifornia1 aWistrom, C.1 aHill, B.L.1 aHashim, J.1 aPurcell, A.H.0 tPlant disease.g2005 Apr., v. 89, no. 4 p.419-424x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-89-04193Available from publisher's Web site  a20080730b20080801c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/10/20  aOther US 7aarticle02935naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072001700148072001700165100001500182245008200197300001800279520163900297650003701936650001501973650002701988650001802015650002202033650002002055650003202075650002202107650001602129650001602145650002002161650001802181650001202199650001902211700001702230773007402247852000902321856008802330930003302418945002502451946001302476655001202489IND4369205620221119003535.0050423e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436920562DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2004.88.12.13572doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aZhou, X.G.10aSuppression of fusarium wilt of watermelon by soil amendment with hairy vetch  ap. 1357-1365.  aHairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) as a soil amendment was evaluated for suppression of Fusarium wilt of watermelon and soil populations of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum in greenhouse, microplot, and field studies. When mixed at 1 or 5% (wt/wt) in a loamy sand soil that was artificially or naturally infested with race 2 of F. oxysporum f. sp. niveum, pulverized dry hairy vetch, crab shell, and urea provided the best suppression (53 to 87% reduction) of Fusarium wilt on watermelon seedlings among 13 plant and animal residues screened. Soil amended with hairy vetch at 0.25 or 0.5% (wt/wt) in microplots resulted in 54 to 69% decreased wilt incidence and 100 to 220% increase of watermelon plant biomass. Hairy vetch winter cover crop incorporated into field plots under black plastic provided 42 to 48% reduction of wilt incidence, 64 to 100% increase of plant biomass, and a 34 to 68% increase in weight of fruit, comparable to improvements achieved by the soil fumigants methyl bromide or 1,3-dichloropropene plus 35% chloropicrin. Soil amendment with hairy vetch also increased the sugar content of watermelon fruit 10 to 15%. Significant reductions in the populations of F. oxysporum f. sp. niveum were not observed in hairy vetch-amended soil in microplots and field plots, but were observed in greenhouse pot soil amended with 5% (wt/wt) hairy vetch, which was attributed primarily to increased levels of fungicidal ammonia produced during decomposition. Incorporating hairy vetch into mulched soil can be an alternative or supplement to cultivar resistance and crop rotation for management of Fusarium wilt of watermelon. 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum 3asoil fungi 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aFusarium wilt 3adisease incidence 3adisease control 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aCitrullus lanatus 3awatermelons 3ahost plants 3asoil amendments 3aVicia villosa 3alegumes 3aplant residues1 aEverts, K.L.0 tPlant disease.g2004 Dec., v. 88, no. 12 p.1357-1365x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2004.88.12.13573Available from publisher's Web site  a20080730b20080801c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/10/22  aOther US 7aarticle03592naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002500184245012000209300002000329506007600349520166400425506003702089650001902126650001702145650003802162650002102200650001502221650002502236650001602261650002402277650002402301650002902325650001102354650001502365650001302380650001402393650001402407650002802421650002302449700002302472700001302495700002602508700001902534700002802553700001902581700002102600700001302621700002202634700002002656773017602676852000902852856008302861930003302944946001302977655001202990IND4438740120221207071049.0100619e20100615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443874012DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09142951072doi7 aPMC28907222pmcid7 a205344792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrugan, Katharine D.10aFibroblast-secreted hepatocyte growth factor plays a functional role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma invasion  ap. 11026-11031.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSquamous cell cancers comprise the most common type of human epithelial cancers. One subtype, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), is an aggressive cancer with poor prognosis due to late diagnosis and metastasis. Factors derived from the extracellular matrix (ECM) create an environment conducive to tumor growth and invasion. Specialized cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the ECM influence tumorigenesis. We have shown previously that the nature and activation state of fibroblasts are critical in modulating the invasive ability of ESCC in an in vivo-like organotypic 3D cell culture, a form of human tissue engineering. Dramatic differences in invasion of transformed esophageal epithelial cells depended on the type of fibroblast in the matrix. We hypothesize that CAFs create an environment primed for growth and invasion through the secretion of factors. We find that fibroblast secretion of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) fosters the ability of transformed esophageal epithelial cells to invade into the ECM, although other unidentified factors may cooperate with HGF. Genetic modifications of both HGF in fibroblasts and its receptor Met in epithelial cells, along with pharmacologic inhibition of HGF and Met, underscore the importance of this pathway in ESCC invasion and progression. Furthermore, Met activation is increased upon combinatorial overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and p53R¹⁷⁵H, two common genetic mutations in ESCC. These results highlight the potential benefit of the therapeutic targeting of HGF/Met signaling in ESCC and potentially other squamous cancers where this pathway is deregulated.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarcinogenesis 3acell culture 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3aextracellular matrix 3afibroblasts 3agene overexpression 3agenetic engineering 3ahepatocyte growth factor 3ahumans 3ametastasis 3amutation 3aprognosis 3asecretion 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3atissue engineering1 aMiller, Charles G.1 aYao, Yao1 aMichaylira, Carmen Z.1 aOhashi, Shinya1 aKlein-Szanto, Andres J.1 aDiehl, J.

O. korrae was isolated from 73% of the 204 bermudagrass cores collected and was the only SDS pathogen recovered at most sites. O. herpotricha was isolated at three locations in Kentucky and one in North Carolina, and O. narmari was found at two locations in North Carolina. Most O. korrae isolates collected from Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia clustered in an amplified fragment length polymorphism group (AFLP group II) that was distinct from Kentucky bluegrass isolates collected throughout North America and similar to bermudagrass isolates from Kansas and Oklahoma (AFLP group I). A third AFLP group (III) consisting of bermudagrass isolates from Mississippi and Virginia was identified. Isolates representing AFLP groups II and III grew more rapidly on potato dextrose agar at 25 and 30°C than those in group I. O. korrae isolates differed in their aggressiveness to two bermudagrass cultivars in greenhouse studies, but these differences were not associated with AFLP group, location, or host from which the isolate was collected. 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aCynodon dactylon 3afungal diseases of plants 3ahost plants 3apathogenicity 3aPleosporales 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aWest Virginia 3aAlabama 3aSouth Carolina 3aVirginia 3aTennessee 3aNorth Carolina 3aKentucky 3aMississippi 0aSoutheastern United States 0aspring dead spot 0aOphiosphaerella korrae 0aLeptosphaeria korrae1 aWetzel, H.C.

  1 aMertely, J.10aFirst report of Macrophomina phaseolina causing a crown rot of strawberry in Florida  ap. 434.  aStrawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duchesne) is produced as an annual winter crop in raised, plastic-mulched beds on 2,800 ha in west central Florida. In December 2001, a grower submitted collapsed and dying strawberry plants from a commercial field to the University of Florida in Dover. The cut crowns of affected plants revealed dark brown necrotic areas on the margins and along the woody vascular ring. Macrophomina phaseolina was isolated from pieces of infected tissue cut aseptically from the crowns and placed on a medium containing 12 g of Difco potato dextrose broth, 17 g of Bacto agar, 250 mg of ampicillin, and 100 mg of streptomycin sulfate per liter of water. The fungus produced numerous, dark, oblong sclerotia in the isolation medium after 4 to 5 days incubation at 24°C under constant fluorescent lighting. In 10-day-old cultures, sclerotia ranged in size from 55 to 190 μm long by 50 to 135 μm wide (average 105 x 74 μm). Ostiolate pycnidia bearing relatively large, broadly ellipsoidal, hyaline conidia occasionally developed on the host tissue after 8 to 10 days of incubation (2). During the 2003-2004 season, M. phaseolina was isolated from dying strawberry plants taken from the original field and two additional farms. Affected plants were often found along field margins or other areas inadequately fumigated with methyl bromide. Two single-spore isolates from different fields were tested for pathogenicity on nursery runner plants (cv. Strawberry Festival) grown for 4 weeks in the greenhouse on artificial potting soil. The fungal isolates were grown on corn meal agar at 24°C for 4 days and allowed to colonize sterile wooden toothpicks placed on the medium for an additional 5 days. Prior to use, the toothpicks were sterilized by autoclaving twice in deionized water and a third time in V8 juice. Six plants were inoculated with each isolate by inserting a colonized toothpick into each crown. Sterile, V8-infused toothpicks were inserted into the crowns of corresponding control plants. The plants were incubated in a greenhouse in a randomized complete block design with two replicates of three plants each. After 3 days, 33 to 100% of the inoculated plants developed wilting in one or more leaves. All inoculated plants collapsed or died within 2 weeks of inoculation, while the control plants remained healthy during the observation period. The pathogen was readily reisolated from inoculated plants. Charcoal rot disease caused by M. phaseolina has been reported on strawberry in France, India, and Illinois (2,3). To our knowledge, this is the first report from Florida. M. phaseolina may be an emerging threat as the Florida strawberry industry transitions from methyl bromide to other fumigants in 2005. 3aMacrophomina phaseolina 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3acrown rot 3aFragaria ananassa 3astrawberries 3ahost plants 3anew geographic records 3aFlorida1 aSeijo, T.1 aPeres, N.0 tPlant disease.g2005 Apr., v. 89, no. 4 p.434-434wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-89-0434A3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080730b20080801c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/10/21  aOther US 7aarticle04338naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121072001700139100001700156245010400173300001200277500001500289520311300304650001103417650001603428650002803444650001803472650001803490650004303508650003003551650002703581650002203608651001403630653001303644653002303657773008903680852000903769856007903778930003303857945002503890946001303915655001203928IND4369212220221119003604.0050423e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436921222DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-89-0432C2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGaetan, S.A.10aOccurrence of fusarium wilt on canola caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans in Argentina  ap. 432.  a2019-12-04  aCanola (Brassica napus) is a developing oleaginous crop grown commercially in Argentina, primarily in the southeastern region of Buenos Aires Province. Since 2002, plants exhibiting symptoms of wilt and xylem discoloration were observed in canola plants in experimental field plots located at the University of Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Average disease incidence in 5- to 6-month-old canola cultivars developed in different countries was 18% (range = 9 to 27%). Disease symptoms that included yellowing, wilting, stunting, and necrosis of leaf tissue and suppressed root development appeared in irregular-shaped patches following the rows of plants. The first symptom observed was leaf yellowing followed by an irregular, brown necrosis of the leaf margins. Lesions coalesced to form large necrotic areas that led to severe defoliation beginning with the lower leaves. As the disease developed, a pale brown discoloration girdled the stems that progressed from the basal tissues to the apex. Affected plants were stunted and had small pods with no seeds. Diseased plants eventually collapsed and died. From June to July 2003, six samples consisting of five affected plants per sample were randomly collected from experimental field plots. Pieces (1 cm long) of disease basal stem tissue were thoroughly washed, surface sterilized in 1% sodium hypochlorite for 1 min, rinsed in sterile distilled water, blotted dry on sterile Whatman's filter paper, and incubated on potato dextrose agar in the dark at 26°C for 10 days. Ten resulting colonies were examined microscopically and identified as Fusarium oxysporum Schlechtend.:Fr. f. sp. conglutinans (Wollenweb.) W.C. Snyder & H.N.Hans. (3). Pathogenicity tests for three single-spore isolates of the fungus were performed on 6-week-old canola plants of cvs. Impulse, Master, Mistral, Monty, Rivette, and Trooper. Koch's postulates were completed for each isolate by dipping the roots of seedlings in a conidial suspension (2 times; 10(5) conidia per ml) for 15 min. Plants were repotted in a sterilized soil mix (soil/sand, 2:1). The experiment, which included five inoculated plants and three noninoculated (roots dipped in sterile distilled water) control plants for each cultivar, was conducted in a greenhouse at 23 to 25°C and 75% relative humidity with no supplemental light. Characteristic symptoms, identical to the original observations, developed within 14 days after inoculation on 100% of the inoculated plants for all three isolates. The pathogen was successfully reisolated from internal diseased stem tissue in all instances. Symptoms included stunted seedlings, leaf necrosis, and external stem discoloration. None of the control plants developed disease. The experiment was repeated once with similar results. F. oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans, which has been reported to cause disease in canola in Canada (1) and the United States (2), represents a serious threat to the main canola cultivars grown in Argentina. To our knowledge, this is the first report of canola wilt incited by F. oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans in Argentina. 3acanola 3ahost plants 3apathogen identification 3apathogenicity 3aFusarium wilt 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans 3aBrassica napus var. napus 3anew geographic records 3adisease incidence 3aArgentina 0asymptoms 0aFusarium oxysporum0 tPlant disease.g2005 Apr., v. 89, no. 4 p.432-432wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-89-0432C3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080730b20080801c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/10/21  aOther US 7aarticle02732naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120072001700138072001700155100001100172245008500183300001600268520121200284650001801496650004201514650002001556650001201576650001801588650002201606650002401628650001801652650002501670650002301695650001101718650001601729650002501745650001901770651001501789651001401804651001001818653004101828653002201869653002801891700002001919700001601939773008901955852000902044856007802053930003302131945002502164946001302189655001202202IND4369210420221119003357.0050423e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436921042DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-89-03662doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKim Y.10aCharacterization of California isolates of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum  ap. 366-372.  aThirty isolates of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum from California, Australia, China, and the American Type Culture Collection were characterized by partial sequences of translational elongation factor (EF-1α), phosphate permase (PHO), and beta-tubulin (BT) genes, restriction digests of the intergenic spacer (IGS) region of nuclear rDNA, and pathogenicity tests. Based on phylogenetic analysis of combined sequences of EF-1α, PHO, and BT genes, California isolates represented four lineages. Lineage I contained race 3, lineage II contained races 1, 2, and 6, lineage III contained race 8, and lineage IV contained race 4. The Australian isolates formed a strongly supported independent clade. There were nine haplotypes based on restriction digests of the IGS region. In greenhouse pathogenicity tests with California isolates, those from the race 4 lineage were highly aggressive on certain Pima cotton (Gossypium barbadense) cultivars and less aggressive on Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) cultivars. All isolates belonging to the other lineages caused relatively mild symptoms on both Pima and Upland cultivars. This is the first report of the occurrence of races 3, 4, and 8 in California. 3aFusarium wilt 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum 3afungal proteins 3atubulin 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3arestriction mapping 3apathogenicity 3aGossypium barbadense 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acotton 3afiber crops 3anucleotide sequences 3aintergenic DNA 3aCalifornia 3aAustralia 3aChina 0atranslational elongation factor EF-1 0aphosphate permase 0amolecular sequence data1 aHutmacher, R.B.1 aDavis, R.M.0 tPlant disease.g2005 Apr., v. 89, no. 4 p.366-372wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-89-03663Available from publisher's Web site  a20080730b20080801c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/10/06  aOther US 7aarticle02644naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245011100204300002000315506007600335520120200411506003701613650001501650650002101665650001901686650001701705650001901722650001201741650001801753650001601771650001401787650001901801650002601820650001201846650002301858700001601881700002001897773017601917852000902093856008302102946001302185655001202198IND4439061720221207065933.0100625e20100622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443906172DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10066891072doi7 aPMC28950902pmcid7 a205344452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaley, Benjamin10aVectors and parameters that enhance the efficacy of RNAi-mediated gene disruption in transgenic Drosophila  ap. 11435-11440.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWhole-genome transgenic RNAi libraries permit systematic genetic screens in individual tissues of DROSOPHILA: However, there is a high incidence of nonspecific phenotypes because of off-target effects. To minimize such effects, it is essential to obtain a deeper understanding of the specificity of action of RNAi. Here, in vivo assays are used to determine the minimum, contiguous nucleotide pairing required between an siRNA and a target mRNA to generate a phenotype. We observe that as few as 16 nucleotides of contiguous homology are sufficient to attenuate gene activity. This finding provides an explanation for the high incidence of off-target effects observed in RNAi-based genetic screens. Toward improving the efficacy of RNAi-induced phenotypes in vivo, we describe siRNA expression vectors that allow coexpression of one or more siRNAs with a fluorescent reporter gene in cultured cells or transgenic flies. This expression system makes use of the small intron from the ftz segmentation gene to provide efficient processing of synthetic siRNAs from a reporter transcript. These studies provide a foundation for the specific and effective use of gene silencing in transgenic DROSOPHILA:0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3aRNA interference 3acultured cells 3afluorescence 3agene targeting 3aintrons 3amessenger RNA 3anucleotides 3aphenotype 3areporter genes 3asmall interfering RNA 3atissues 3atransgenic insects1 aFoys, Bryon1 aLevine, Michael0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 June 22, v. 107, no. 25 p.11435-11440dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10066891073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02432naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100003500184245014000219300002000359500001500379506007600394520093700470506003701407650001301444650001501457650001301472650001301485650002001498650001101518650001401529650001101543650001101554650002901565650002201594650001401616650001501630653002701645700002101672773017601693852000901869856008301878946001301961655001201974IND4439062220221207064143.0100625e20100622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443906222DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10062811072doi7 aPMC28950652pmcid7 a205345472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCulley, J.

Here, we examine genetic stability in tel1 mec1 diploid cells. In the absence of induced DNA damage, these yeast strains had very high frequencies of aneuploidy (both trisomy and monosomy) in addition to elevated rates of chromosome rearrangements. Although we found the aneuploidy in the tel1 mec1 diploids mimicked that observed in bub1 diploids, the tel1 mec1 diploids had a functional spindle assembly checkpoint. Restoration of wild-type telomere lengths in the tel1 mec1 strain substantially reduced the rate of chromosome rearrangements but had no effect on the frequency of aneuploidy.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aproteins 3aDNA damage 3ahaploidy 3adiploidy 3aDNA replication 3ahumans 3atelomeres 3agenome 3ayeasts 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3agenetic stability 3atrisomics 3amonosomics 0achromosome aberrations1 aPetes, Thomas D.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 June 22, v. 107, no. 25 p.11465-11470dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10062811073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02634naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002300144245006600167300001600233500001500249520129300264650001801557650002101575650001301596650002401609650002301633650001201656650002001668650001801688650001301706650002701719650002101746650002401767650002601791650001801817650001101835651001001846653002101856653001601877653003101893700002701924700002801951773006901979852000902048930003302057945002502090946001302115655001202128IND4439561820221119003642.0100706e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443956182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Osbeck x Poncirus trifoliata L. Raf.). Single-node cuttings taken from greenhouse-grown plants were cultured in petri dishes containing basal Murashige and Skoog medium. Shoots from nodal stem segments were excised and cultured in a multiplication medium (basal medium supplemented with 1.8 µM 6-benzylaminopurine) to promote the development of axillary buds. Individual shoots (15 mm long) were treated with different hormones at several concentrations for root induction evaluations. The addition of activated charcoal (AC) to the culture medium was also explored. The addition of auxins to the culture medium enhanced rooting percentage. Optimal results were obtained when 1-naphthalene acetic acid (10.8 µM) and gibberellic acid (0.3 µM) were added to the culture medium. The addition of AC to the rooting medium resulted in negative effects on the percentage of rooted shoots but had a positive effect on number of roots per rooted shoot. Chemical names used: activated charcoal (AC); 6-benzylaminopurine (BA); 1-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA); gibberellic acid (GA3); indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). 3adose response 3agibberellic acid 3aexplants 3aindole butyric acid 3aadventitious roots 3aoranges 3aCitrus sinensis 3abenzyladenine 3acharcoal 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3amicropropagation 3aPoncirus trifoliata 3ain vitro regeneration 3aculture media 3ashoots 3aSpain 0ain vitro culture 0amethodology 0aMurashige and Skoog medium1 aGomez-Cadenas, Aurelio1 aPerez-Clemente, Rosa M.0 tHortScience.g2010 June, v. 45, no. 6 p.988-990x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20100920b20101001c00000000  aINDd9CTe2010/08/17  aOther US 7aarticle01891naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001700136245010200153300001600255520089000271650001301161650001901174650000901193650003101202653001501233653001201248700001401260700001501274700001501289700001501304700001501319773012901334852000901463930003301472945001301505946001101518655001201529IND2045952320221119003339.0950508e19950401enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204595232DNAL7 ano direct match2pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobinson, K.10aExpression and characterization of maize ZBP14, a member of a new family of zinc-binding proteins  ap. 267-272.  aA maize gene (Mz2-12), with a deduced amino acid sequence similar to that of a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor from bovine brain, has been expressed in Escherichia coli and the protein (ZBP14) purified to homogeneity. The bovine protein was originally identified by Walsh's group and named PKC inhibitor-1 (PKCI-1). The recombinant maize protein (ZBP14) shares characteristics of bovine PKCI-1: it has similar secondary structure, is dimeric, and has a similar affinity for zinc. However, the maize ZBP14 had very little activity as an inhibitor of mammalian brain PKC, thus precluding zinc sequestration as the mechanism of inhibition. The biological role for the maize protein in plant kinase regulation is therefore unclear. In the presence of both maize ZBP14 and 14-3-3 protein (which inhibits PKC in the absence of diacylglycerol), the effects on PKC appeared to be synergistic. 3aZea mays 3aplant proteins 3azinc 3aphysicochemical properties 0ainhibition 0abinding1 aJones, D.1 aHowell, S.1 aSoneji, Y.1 aMartin, S.1 aAitken, A.0 tBiochemical journal.g1995 Apr. 1, v. 307, no. pt.1 p.267-272aBiochemical journal (London, England : 1984)x0264-60217nnas  aDNAL  a19950609b19950615c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01325naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001300138245010800151300001700259520049700276650002600773650002400799773009200823852000900915856007800924930003301002945001301035946001101048655001201059IND2056925720221119003428.0970506e199609  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205692572DNAL7 a10.1007/BF024594932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKmet, T.10aMaterial recycling in a closed aquatic ecosystem.

Here we show that the initiator-tRNA may also act, in a manner that is independent of its role in protein translation, as a pre-mRNA splicing regulator. Specifically, we show that alternative splicing events that are induced by mutations in the translation initiation AUG codon can be suppressed by expressing initiator-tRNA constructs carrying anticodon mutations that compensate for the AUG mutations. These mutated initiator-tRNAs appeared to be uncharged with an amino acid. Our results imply that recognition of the initiation AUG sequence by the anticodon triplet of initiator-tRNA in its unloaded state plays a role in quality control of splicing in the cell nucleus by a yet unresolved mechanism. Identifying the initiator-tRNA as a transacting splicing regulator suggests a novel involvement of this molecule in splicing regulation and provides a critical step toward deciphering this intriguing mechanism.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalternative splicing 3aamino acids 3acell nucleus 3aeukaryotic cells 3amessenger RNA 3amutagenesis 3aprotein synthesis 3aquality control 3astart codon 3atranslation (genetics)1 aRaitskin, Oleg1 aSperling, Ruth1 aSperling, Joseph0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 June 22, v. 107, no. 25 p.11319-11324dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09115611073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02669naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245006800132300001600200500014500216520124100361650001101602650001801613650002801631650001601659650002101675650001401696650001301710650001001723650001101733650002101744650001601765650001501781650001701796650001401813650002301827650001301850650001201863650001701875650002701892650002501919650001601944650000901960700001301969773014501982856005102127852000902178655001202187IND4511291220221119003645.0150417e20150120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451129122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCancalon, Paul F.10aHealth benefits of polyphenol-rich orange and grapefruit juices  ap. 727-734.  aPaper presented at the XII International Citrus Congress - International Society of Citriculture, held November 18-23, 2012, Valencia, Spain  aThe majority of the health benefits of fruits are believed to be due to a series of phytochemicals; among them, the polyphenols have been the most studied. Citrus fruit and juices are rich in flavonoids (primarily flavonones), with the two more prominent being hesperidin in oranges and naringin in grapefruit. Citrus products are also rich in other potentially beneficial compounds such as carotenoids, limonoids and vitamin C. Most beneficial effects of citrus phytochemicals seem to be related to specific steps of the chronic inflammation process. Persistent inflammation is considered to be at the root of most chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, dementia and some forms of cancer. The strongest clinical evidence to date has provided insight into both the physiological responses and mechanisms of response to citrus juice consumption in potentially reducing risk of development of cardiovascular disease, and to the role of citrus consumption on benefits to cognitive activities and function. However, it should be kept in mind that fruits and juices are not drugs, and that the beneficial effects will be mild and without the more dramatic effects expected with drug therapies. 3aCitrus 3aascorbic acid 3acardiovascular diseases 3acarotenoids 3achronic diseases 3acognition 3adementia 3adrugs 3afruits 3agrapefruit juice 3agrapefruits 3ahesperidin 3ainflammation 3alimonoids 3ametabolic syndrome 3anaringin 3aoranges 3aosteoporosis 3aphysiological response 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3apolyphenols 3arisk1 aKing, D.0 tActa horticulturae.g2015 Jan. 20, , no. 1065 p.727-734dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1065/1065_91.htm  aDNAL 7aarticle02178naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001800161245006800179300001600247500009600263520088200359650001601241650002301257650002801280650003001308650002301338650002201361650001401383650002201397650002101419650002401440650002701464650001701491651001701508653002201525700001901547773008601566852000901652930003301661945002501694946001301719655001201732IND4439552120221119003439.0100706e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443955212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

To assess the roles of class I PI3K isoforms in cell proliferation and survival, we generated immortalized mouse leukocyte and fibroblast models in which class I PI3Ks were inactivated by genetic and pharmacological approaches. In IL3-dependent hemopoietic progenitor cells (which express all four class I PI3K isoforms), genetic inactivation of either p110α or p110δ did not affect cell proliferation or survival or sensitize to p110β or p110γ inactivation. Upon compound inactivation of p110α and p110δ, which removed >90% of p85-associated PI3K activity, remarkably, cells continued to proliferate effectively, with p110β assuming an essential role in signaling and cell survival. Furthermore, under these conditions of diminished class I PI3K activity, input from the ERK pathway became important for cell survival. Similar observations were made in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (which mainly express p110α and p110β) in which p110α or p110β could sustain cell proliferation as a single isoform. Taken together, these data demonstrate that a small fraction of total class I PI3K activity is sufficient to sustain cell survival and proliferation. Persistent inhibition of selected PI3K isoforms can allow the remaining isoform(s) to couple to upstream signaling pathways in which they are not normally engaged. Such functional redundancy of class IA PI3K isoforms upon sustained PI3K inhibition has implications for the development and use of PI3K inhibitors in cancer.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3afibroblasts 3aleukocytes 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amodels 3aneoplasms 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3asignal transduction 3astem cells1 aBerenjeno, Inma M.1 aGray, Alexander1 aKhwaja, Asim1 aVanhaesebroeck, Bart0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 June 22, v. 107, no. 25 p.11381-11386dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09064611073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle03834naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245006300145300001600208500001500224520187500239650002402114650001802138650002102156650002602177650002302203650001102226650001302237650002302250650002002273650002402293650002402317650002602341650003902367650001202406650004802418650004802466650003002514650003702544650002302581650001102604650004202615650003802657650002302695650005202718650003202770650003902802650005902841650002402900653002302924653002002947700001702967700001902984700001303003700001703016773008503033852000903118930003303127945001303160946001103173655001203184IND2056918820221119003408.0970506e199611  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205691882DNAL7 a89794212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMusoke, A.J.10aProspects for subunit vaccines against tick-borne diseases  ap. 621-639.  a2019-12-05  aTick-borne parasites are a serious impediment to the improvement of livestock production in the developing world. The major parasites affecting cattle include Theileria parva, T. annulata, Babesia bigemina, B. bovis, Anaplasma marginale and Cowdria ruminantium. The control of these infections is dependent on the use of acaricides to decrease transmission by the tick vectors, and immunization of susceptible animals with live vaccines. The use of acaricide is hampered by the development of resistance, and live vaccines require cold chain facilities, which are generally unreliable in developing countries. There is therefore a need for improved vaccines that can circumvent these problems. There is a subunit vaccine being developed for T. parva based on the major surface antigen of the sporozoite (p67). A similar antigen, SPAG 1, has been identified as a candidate for T. annulata. Although several candidate antigens have been identified for Babesia spp., progress towards development of a subunit vaccine based on these antigens has been hampered by polymorphism among isolates and between species, and lack of knowledge of the immune effector mechanisms responsible for protection. The search for protective antigens of A. marginale has focused on outer membrane proteins; immunization with a variety of these antigens alone or in combination, has yielded promising results. As with Babesia, further definition of immune effector mechanisms is needed to optimize immunization strategies. The work on identifying the protective antigens of C. ruminantium is in its embryonic stages; however, two antigens have been identified and are currently being evaluated. There is high expectancy for subunit vaccines for all these diseases; however there is need for further work to elucidate the immune mechanisms in order to select appropriate antigen delivery systems. 3atick-borne diseases 3aBabesia bovis 3aBabesia bigemina 3aEhrlichia ruminantium 3adisease prevention 3acattle 3avaccines 3aTheileria annulata 3aTheileria parva 3aAnaplasma marginale 3avaccine development 2aAnaplasmaximmunology 2aAnaplasmosisxprevention & control 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Bacterialxchemistryximmunology. 2aAntigens, Protozoanxchemistryximmunology. 2aBabesia bovisximmunology 2aBabesiosisxprevention & control 2aBacterial Vaccines 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxprevention & control 2aEhrlichia ruminantiumximmunology 2aProtozoan Vaccines 2aRickettsiaceae Infectionsxprevention & control 2aTheileria parvaximmunology 2aTheileriasisxprevention & control 2aTick-Borne Diseasesxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aVaccines, Synthetic 0aliterature reviews 0adisease control1 aPalmer, G.H.1 aMcElwain, T.F.1 aNene, V.1 aMcKeever, D.0 tBritish veterinary journal.g1996 Nov., v. 152, no. 6 p.621-639x0007-19357nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle03715naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002100136245011600157300001600273500001500289520225400304650002902558650001702587650001802604650001902622650001002641650002202651650002502673650003702698650001502735650003202750650002502782650002602807653002702833653001702860653001202877653002802889653001602917700002002933700001402953700001302967700001602980700001802996773012903014852000903143930003303152945001303185946001103198655001203209IND2045951720221119003544.0950508e19950401enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204595172DNAL7 ano direct match2pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFontes, C.M.G.A.10aEvidence for a general role for non-catalytic thermostabilizing domains in xylanases from thermophilic bacteria  ap. 151-158.  a2019-12-05  aA genomic library of Clostridium thermocellum DNA constructed in lambda ZAPII was screened for xylanase-expressing clones. Cross-hybridization experiments revealed a new xylanase gene isolated from the gene library, which was designated xynY. The encoded enzyme, xylanase Y (XYLY), displayed features characteristic of an endo-,beta 1,4-xylanase: the enzyme rapidly hydrolysed oat spelt, wheat and rye arabinoxylans and was active against methyl-umbelliferyl-beta-D-cellobioside, but did not hydrolyse any cellulosic substrates. The pH and temperature optima of the enzyme were 6.8 and 75 degrees C respectively, and the recombinant XYLY, expressed by Escherichia coli had a maximum Mr of 116000. The nucleotide sequence of xynY contained an open reading frame of 3228 bp encoding a protein of predicted Mr 120105. The encoded enzyme contained a typical N-terminal 26-residue signal peptide, followed by a 164 amino acid sequence, designated domain A, that was not essential for catalytic activity. Downstream of domain A was a 351-residue xylanase Family F catalytic domain, followed by a 180-residue sequence that exhibited 28% sequence identity with a thermostable domain of Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum xylanase A. The C-terminal portion of XYLY comprised the 23-residue duplicated docking sequence found in all other C. thermocellum plant cell wall hydrolases that are constituents of the bacterium's multienzyme complex, termed the cellulosome, followed by a 286-residue domain which exhibited 32% sequence identity with the N-terminal region of C. thermocellum xylanase Z. The enzyme did not contain linker sequences found in other C. thermocellum plant cell wall hydrolases. Analysis of truncated forms of XYLY and hybrid proteins comprising segments of XYLY fused to the E. coli maltose binding domain, confirmed that XYLY contained a central catalytic domain and an adjacent thermostable domain. The C-terminal domain did not bind to cellulose or xylan. Western blot analysis using antiserum raised against XYLY showed that the xylanase was located in the cellulosome and did not appear to be extensively glycosylated. The non-catalytic domains of XYLY are discussed in relation to the general stability of thermophilic xylanases. 3aClostridium thermocellum 3aglycosidases 3aDNA libraries 3aheat stability 3axylan 3acomplementary DNA 3aamino acid sequences 3astructure-activity relationships 3ahydrolysis 3acellulolytic microorganisms 3anucleotide sequences 3athermophilic bacteria 0aO-glycoside hydrolases 0apurification 0acloning 0amolecular sequence data 0aembl/x832691 aHazlewood, G.P.1 aMorag, E.1 aHall, J.1 aHirst, B.H.1 aGilbert, H.J.0 tBiochemical journal.g1995 Apr. 1, v. 307, no. pt.1 p.151-158aBiochemical journal (London, England : 1984)x0264-60217nnas  aDNAL  a19950609b19950615c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02696naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245009900201300002000300506007600320520123100396506003701627650002101664650002001685650001801705650001301723650001201736650001801748650002001766650004201786650001901828650001401847650001501861650002101876650000901897650001801906650001401924700001901938773017601957852000902133856008302142946001302225655001202238IND4439058720221207063428.0100625e20100622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443905872DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10012941072doi7 aPMC28950892pmcid7 a205345652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Faping10aEngineered bacterial communication prevents Vibrio cholerae virulence in an infant mouse model  ap. 11260-11264.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo investigate the possibility of using commensal bacteria as signal mediators for inhibiting the disease cholera, we stably transformed Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (Nissle) to express the autoinducer molecule cholera autoinducer 1 (CAI-1) (shown previously to prevent virulence when present with another signaling molecule, autoinducer 2, at high concentrations) and determined the effect on Vibrio cholerae virulence gene expression and colonization in an infant mouse model. We found that pretreatment of mice for 8 h with Nissle engineered to express CAI-1 (Nissle-cqsA) greatly increased the mice's survival (92%) from ingestion of V. cholerae. Pretreatment with Nissle-cqsA for only 4 h increased survival by 77%, whereas ingesting Nissle-cqsA at the same time as V. cholerae increased survival rates by 27%. Immunostaining revealed an 80% reduction in cholera toxin binding to the intestines of mice pretreated for 8 h with Nissle-cqsA. Further, the numbers of V. cholerae in treated mouse intestines was reduced by 69% after 40 h. This finding points to an easily administered and inexpensive approach where commensal bacteria are engineered to communicate with invasive species and potentially prevent human disease.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aVibrio cholerae 3aanimal models 3abacteria 3acholera 3acholera toxin 3agene expression 3agenetically engineered microorganisms 3ahuman diseases 3aingestion 3aintestines 3ainvasive species 3amice 3asurvival rate 3avirulence1 aMarch, John C.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 June 22, v. 107, no. 25 p.11260-11264dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10012941073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle03045naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245012000143300001600263520145400279650002201733650002501755650001801780650002001798650005201818650001201870650004501882650006101927650001801988650004002006650005002046650005302096650001902149650004702168650003802215650001202253650004602265650001502311650002402326650001302350700001502363700001802378773008902396852000902485930003302494945001302527946001102540655001202551IND2057737920221119003547.0970616e199612  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205773792DNAL7 a89720852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Y.10aImmunological analysis of extracellular products and cell surface components of motile Aeromonas isolated from fish  ap. 585-593.  aThe present work describes the characterization of antigens present in the extracellular products (ECP) and cell wall of strains of motile Aeromonas isolated from rainbow trout culture systems. The relationships among virulence for fish, O-serogroup and profile of LPS were also examined. The slide agglutination test showed that most of the virulent strains of motile Aeromonas (72%) were included in the serotypes O3, O6, O11 and O19 (Guinee and Jensen System). However, there were also non-pathogenic strains within these groups. Electrophoretic analysis of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and proteins from cell envelope and ECP showed heterogeneity not only among the different serogroups but also within the same serotype. Immunoblot assays of cell envelope components, and of LPS present in the ECP demonstrated a close relationship among Aeromonas strains from the same serotype, while strains from different serotypes were not immunologically related. Moreover, this assay showed that motile Aeromonas belonging to distinct serotypes produced extracellular proteins immunologically related. On the other hand, antigenic cross reactivity was observed between the LPS obtained from cell envelope and those obtained from the ECP. The present results point out the need to include strains representative of each of the serotypes which predominates in a particular area and their ECPs in the formation of vaccines against motile Aeromonas septicaemia. 3aaquatic organisms 3abacterial infections 3aanimal health 3aanimal diseases 2aAeromonasxchemistryxclassificationxcytology. 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Surfacexanalysisximmunology. 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxanalysisximmunology. 2aCell Movement 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aExtracellular Spacexchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aFish Diseasesximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aImmunoblotting 2aLipopolysaccharidesxanalysisximmunology. 2aOncorhynchus mykissxmicrobiology 2aRabbits 2aSepsisximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aSerotyping 2aSpecies Specificity 2aVaccines1 aBandin, I.1 aToranzo, A.E.0 tJournal of applied bacteriology.g1996 Dec., v. 81, no. 6 p.585-593x0021-88477nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02569naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245013700202300002000339506007600359520116500435506003701600650002201637650002201659650001701681650001101698650001701709650002001726650001201746650001301758650000901771650001801780651001401798700002101812773017601833852000902009856008302018930003302101946001302134655001202147IND4438742020221207051140.0100619e20100615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443874202DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10005301072doi7 aPMC28907082pmcid7 a205115352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoh, Lian Pin10aSpatially explicit scenario analysis for reconciling agricultural expansion, forest protection, and carbon conservation in Indonesia  ap. 11140-11144.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPalm oil is the world's most important vegetable oil in terms of production quantity. Indonesia, the world's largest palm-oil producer, plans to double its production by 2020, with unclear implications for the other national priorities of food (rice) production, forest and biodiversity protection, and carbon conservation. We modeled the outcomes of alternative development scenarios and show that every single-priority scenario had substantial tradeoffs associated with other priorities. The exception was a hybrid approach wherein expansion targeted degraded and agricultural lands that are most productive for oil palm, least suitable for food cultivation, and contain the lowest carbon stocks. This approach avoided any loss in forest or biodiversity and substantially ameliorated the impacts of oil-palm expansion on carbon stocks (limiting net loss to 191.6 million tons) and annual food production capacity (loss of 1.9 million tons). Our results suggest that the environmental and land-use tradeoffs associated with oil-palm expansion can be largely avoided through the implementation of a properly planned and spatially explicit development strategy.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aElaeis guineensis 3aagricultural land 3abiodiversity 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3afood production 3aforests 3aland use 3arice 3avegetable oil 3aIndonesia1 aGhazoul, Jaboury0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 June 15, v. 107, no. 24 p.11140-11144dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10005301073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100619b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02954naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245010900129300001600238500002400254520201900278650001702297650002502314650001002339650001602349650000902365650001502374700001702389700001502406700001702421773012202438852000902560856007102569655001202640IND4462330420221119002808.0111118s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446233042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCardwell, J.M.10aDescriptive results from a longitudinal study of airway inflammation in British National Hunt racehorses  ap. 750-755.  aIncludes references  aReasons for performing study: Rates of airway inflammation in young racehorses decrease with time but it is not clear whether this is associated with increasing age or time exposed to the training environment. The structure of the British National Hunt (NH) population allowed closer examination of this relationship. Objectives: To compare rates of inflammatory airway disease diagnosed by tracheal sampling (trIAD), and its components, in NH racehorses by age and training history and with published rates in young racehorses. Methods: A prospective, longitudinal study was conducted on 5 NH yards over 2 years. Period sample prevalences of nasal discharge, tracheal mucus, airway neutrophilia and trIAD (defined by a combination of tracheal mucus and airway neutrophilia) were estimated and compared between horses with different ages and time in training. Results: Horses new to training had twice the odds of visible tracheal mucus as ex-flat trained horses (OR 2.0; 95% CI: 1.4–2.8; P<0.001) but no significantly increased odds of airway neutrophilia (OR 1.3; 95% CI: 0.8–1.9; P = 0.3) and inconclusive evidence of increased odds of trIAD (OR 1.8; CI: 0.9–3.5; P = 0.08). However, a lower median time in training was significantly associated with the presence of visible mucus (P<0.001), increased mucus (P = 0.005) and trIAD (P = 0.03). No disease measure varied significantly with age. Conclusions: Tracheal mucus and trIAD, but not neutrophilia detected in tracheal wash samples, were less prevalent in horses that had been exposed to the training environment for longer, explaining previously reported associations with age. Potential relevance: Neutrophil proportion in tracheal wash samples is not as useful a clinical tool as measures of visible tracheal mucus for identifying horses requiring treatment or changes in management. The inclusion of tracheal wash neutrophils in the assessment of equine airways, or at least their relative weighting in definitions of trIAD, should be re-evaluated. 3ainflammation 3alongitudinal studies 3amucus 3aneutrophils 3anose 3aracehorses1 aWood, J.L.N.1 aSmith, KC.1 aNewton, J.R.0 tEquine veterinary journal.g2011 Nov., v. 43, no. 6 p.750-755dBritish Equine Veterinary Associationx0425-16447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.evj.co.uk/archive/3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03020naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002400128245011800152300001600270520164400286650002001930650001801950650002301968650001601991650002902007650002902036650002802065650001402093650003902107650004602146650002902192650003402221650004702255650006702302700003002369700001502399700001802414773008802432852000902520930003302529945001302562946001102575655001202586IND2056172420221119002719.0970326e199605  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205617242DNAL7 a90725242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSelenska-Pobell, S.10aCharacterization of Rhizobium 'hedysari' by RFLP analysis of PCR amplified rDNA and by genomic PCR fingerprinting  ap. 517-528.  aThe taxonomic and discriminatory power of RFLP analysis of PCR amplified parts of rhizobial rrn operons was compared to those of genomic PCR fingerprinting with arbitrary and repetitive primers. For this purpose, the two methods were applied for characterization of a group of bacterial isolates referred to as Rhizobium 'hedysari'. As outgroups, representatives of the family Rhizobiaceae, belonging to the Rhizobium galegae, Rhizobium meliloti, Rhizobium leguminosarum and Agrobacterium tumefaciens species were used. By the RFLP analysis of the PCR products corresponding to the variable 5'-half of the 23S rRNA gene and of the amplified spacer region between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes all Rh. 'hedysari' strains studied were tightly clustered together while the outgroups were placed in an outer position. The PCR products of the 3' end parts of the 23S rDNA did not show significant RFL polymorphism and no species differentiation on their basis was possible. In parallel, analysis of the same strains was performed by PCR amplification of their total DNA with 19, 18 and 10 bp long arbitrary primers (AP-PCR) as well as with single primers corresponding to several bacterial repetitive sequences (rep-PCR). By both AP and rep-PCR an identification of every particular strain was achieved. In general, all primers provided taxonomic results that are in agreement with the species and group assignments based on the RFLP analysis of the rrn operons. On the basis of the results presented here it can be concluded that AP and rep-PCR are more informative and discriminative than rDNA and RFLP analysis of the rhizobial strains studied. 3aplant nutrition 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Fingerprinting 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysis 2aDNA, Ribosomalxanalysis 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aRNA, Bacterialxanalysis 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 23Sxanalysis 2aRandom Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique 2aRhizobiumxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification.1 aEvguenieva-Hackenberg, E.1 aRadeva, G.1 aSquartini, A.0 tJournal of applied bacteriology.g1996 May, v. 80, no. 5 p.517-528x0021-88477nnas  aDNAL  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02834naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010800126300001600234500002400250520173100274650002502005650001202030650002302042650000902065650000902074650001102083650001502094650001502109650001502124650001502139650001402154650001202168650001302180650001202193700001402205700001502219773012202234852000902356856007102365655001202436IND4462327620221119002709.0111118s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446232762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHobbs, S.J.14aThe difference in kinematics of horses walking, trotting and cantering on a flat and banked 10 m circle  ap. 686-694.  aIncludes references  aReasons for performing study: Locomotion adaptation mechanisms have been observed in horses, but little information is available in relation to banked and nonbanked curve locomotion, which might be important to optimise training environments. Objectives: To determine if adaptation mechanisms in horses existed when moving on a banked compared to a flat curve and whether adaptation was similar in different gaits. Methods: Eight infrared cameras were positioned on the outside of a 10 m lungeing circle and calibrated. Retroreflective markers were used to define left and right metacarpus (McIII) and proximal phalanges (P1), metatarsus (MtIII), head and sacrum. Data were recorded at 308 Hz from 6 horses lunged at walk, trot and canter on a flat and 10° banked circle in a crossover design. Measurements extracted were speed, stride length, McIII inclination, MtIII inclination, relative body inclination and duty factor. Data were smoothed with a fourth order Butterworth filter with 30 Hz cut-off. ANOVA was used to determine differences between conditions and limbs. Results: Adaptation mechanisms were influenced by gait. At canter inside forelimb duty factor was significantly longer (P<0.05) on a flat curve compared to a banked curve; at walk this was reversed. McIII inclination, MtIII inclination and relative body inclination were significantly greater (P<0.05) at trot and canter on a flat curve, so more inward tilt was found relative to the bearing surface. Conclusion: Adaptation to curved motion is gait specific. At faster gaits it appears that horses negotiate a banked curve with limb posture closer to body posture and probably with demands on the musculoskeletal system more similar to straight canter. 3aanalysis of variance 3acameras 3across-over studies 3agait 3ahead 3ahorses 3akinematics 3alocomotion 3ametacarpus 3ametatarsus 3aphalanges 3aposture 3atrotting 3awalking1 aLicka, T.1 aPolman, R.0 tEquine veterinary journal.g2011 Nov., v. 43, no. 6 p.686-694dBritish Equine Veterinary Associationx0425-16447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.evj.co.uk/archive/3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03343naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245016200126300001600288500002400304520193900328650002202267650001802289650001302307650001402320650002802334650002202362650001702384650000902401650001402410650002402424650001602448650002002464650001302484650001602497650002502513650001402538650001102552651001102563700001402574700001702588700001602605700001902621700001902640773012202659852000902781856007102790655001202861IND4462327720221119002731.0111118s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446232772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJonsson, L.10aEquine hospital data as a source for study of prevalence and heritability of osteochondrosis and palmar/plantar osseous fragments of Swedish Warmblood horses  ap. 695-700.  aIncludes references  aReasons for performing study: Disturbances in skeletal development, primarily osteochondrosis (OC) and palmar/plantar osseous fragments (POF), have been commonly reported as problems in young horses. However, there are few reports of such findings for epidemiological analyses or breeding purposes. Objectives: To evaluate equine hospital data as a possible source of information for genetic evaluations by estimating prevalence and heritability of OC in the stifle, hock and fetlock joints and of POF in the fetlock. Methods: Data on Swedish Warmblood (SWB) horses were obtained from a large equine hospital in south Sweden. Prevalences were based on radiographic examinations of 879 screened horses, mainly evaluated as part of a prepurchase examination and 3639 horses with a reported history of orthopaedic problems. For the heritability study the 2 data sources were pooled and 3199 examined horses with pedigree information were considered for the linear animal model analyses. Results: The overall prevalence of OC was 13% (stifle 9%, hock 6% and dorsal osseous fragments in fetlock [DOF] 10%) and POF 10%. The overall heritability of OC was 0.05 on the visible binomial scale. The corresponding heritabilities for OC in the stifle were 0.03, hock 0.08, DOF 0.10 and POF 0.13. These values correspond to heritabilities of 0.09–0.38 on the underlying quantitative scale. Conclusions and potential relevance: Obtained prevalences and heritabilities were in accordance with other studies, supporting the hypothesis that data regularly obtained from equine hospitals may be a valuable source in studies of inherited disorders such as OC and POF. There is a need for more standardised documentation of diagnoses and consistent recording of identity of examined horses using passports or breed databases. Compilation of results from major clinics is desired in order to cover most progenies of stallions used in a region or nation. 3aSwedish Warmblood 3aanimal models 3abreeding 3adatabases 3aepidemiological studies 3agenetic disorders 3aheritability 3ahock 3ahospitals 3ainformation sources 3aorthopedics 3aosteochondrosis 3apedigree 3aradiography 3askeletal development 3astallions 3astifle 3aSweden1 aDalin, G.1 aEgenvall, A.1 aNasholm, A.1 aRoepstorff, L.1 aPhilipsson, J.0 tEquine veterinary journal.g2011 Nov., v. 43, no. 6 p.695-700dBritish Equine Veterinary Associationx0425-16447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.evj.co.uk/archive/3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02392naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002800145245011500173300001600288500001900304500002400323520138400347650001501731650001901746650001401765650002201779650001301801650001201814650001001826650000901836651001101845700001901856773011001875852000901985856004801994655001202042IND4417075120221119002734.0090228e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441707512DNAL7 a10.1007/s10841-008-9141-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSverdrup-Thygeson, Anne10aWhat window traps can tell us: effect of placement, forest openness and beetle reproduction in retention trees  ap. 183-191.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIncludes references  aThe use of flight interception traps (window traps) has been criticized for catching too many species without affinity to the immediate surroundings. We study aspen retention trees left for conservation reasons in a boreal forest in south-eastern Norway, and investigate how placement of window traps affects the beetle species assemblage, abundance of habitat specialists, saproxylic species and vagrant species. We also test the correlation between beetle trappings and beetle exit holes in wood. The window traps clearly responded to the immediate surroundings of the trap. Traps located on tree trunks had a different species assemblage than traps hanging freely. Traps mounted on trees caught more aspen associated beetles and less vagrant species than their free-hanging counterparts. The differences were larger when trees were dead than alive. There was a significant positive correlation between presence of individuals in the trunk-window traps and presence of exit holes for three aspen associated species. Thus, the trapping results indicated successful reproduction, showing that aspen associated beetles are not only attracted to but also utilise aspen retention trees/high stumps left in clear-cuts. This indicates that this conservation measure in forest management can have positive, alleviating effects concerning the dead wood deficit in managed boreal forest. 3aColeoptera 3aboreal forests 3adead wood 3aforest management 3ahabitats 3ainsects 3atrees 3awood 3aNorway1 aBirkemoe, Tone0 tJournal of insect conservation.g2009 Apr., v. 13, no. 2 p.183-191dSpringer Netherlandsx1366-638X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-008-9141-x 7aarticle01897naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001500136245013500151300001600286500001500302520078800317650002001105650001801125650002501143650001801168650002501186650002901211653002201240653001401262653001401276653002201290700001501312773013001327852000901457930003301466945001301499946001101512655001201523IND2040728620221119002817.0940707e19940315enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204072862DNAL7 ano direct match2pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamada, K.10aCharacterization of the antimicrobial peptide derived from sapecin B, an antibacterial protein of Sarcophaga peregrina (flesh fly)  ap. 623-628.  a2019-12-05  aSapecin B, an antibacterial protein of Sarcophaga peregrina, was divided into four peptides. A hendecapeptide derived from its helix region was found to have comparable antibacterial activity with that of the complete protein. This peptide had a much wider spectrum of antimicrobial activity than that of sapecin B, exhibiting activity on not only Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive) and Escherichia coli (Gram-negative), but also some yeasts, including Candida albicans. The peptide was shown to bind to liposomes containing acidic phospholipids and cause release of entrapped glucose, suggesting that its primary site of action is the bacterial membrane. Its antimicrobial activity could be increased by substituting various amino acid residues for hydrophobic and/or basic ones. 3aanimal proteins 3aoligopeptides 3aamino acid sequences 3abinding sites 3aSarcophaga peregrina 3aantibacterial properties 0aprotein structure 0astructure 0aliposomes 0ahexical structure1 aNatori, S.0 tBiochemical journal.g1994 Mar. 15, v. 298, no. pt.3 p.623-628aBiochemical journal (London, England : 1984)x0264-60217nnas  aDNAL  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01877naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245014900161300001600310500002400326520078000350650002301130650001301153650001401166650001501180650002101195650001101216700001501227700001201242700001701254700001601271700001801287773012801305852000901433856008501442655001201527IND4457285820221119003210.0110429s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445728582DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-011-0249-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSankoda, K.10aIdentification of Triclosan Intermediates Produced by Oxidative Degradation Using TiO₂ in Pure Water and Their Endocrine Disrupting Activities  ap. 470-475.  aIncludes references  aThe photodegradation pathways of 2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-5-chlorophenol (triclosan) in water were studied. The main purposes were to identify structures of intermediates derived by radical reaction using TiO₂ advanced oxidation processes and to evaluate the endocrine disrupting activities in treated triclosan during oxidative reactions. Intermediates such as dichlorophenols, 2,8-dibenzo-p-dioxin, tetrachlorinated diphenyl ether (tetraclosan) and hydroxylated triclosan were produced by photoreaction. The estrogen, thyroid hormone and retinoid X receptor activities of the treated triclosan were measured with the yeast two-hybrid assay. It was found that tetraclosan and 2,4-dichlorophenol have stronger thyroid hormone activities than triclosan in the presence of S9. 3a2,4-dichlorophenol 3abiphenyl 3aoxidation 3aphotolysis 3athyroid hormones 3ayeasts1 aMatsuo, H.1 aIto, M.1 aNomiyama, K.1 aArizono, K.1 aShinohara, R.0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2011 May, v. 86, no. 5 p.470-475dSpringer-Verlagx0007-48617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-011-0249-43Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03710naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245011700164300002200281520212300303592002802426650002602454650001702480650001402497650001202511650001802523650002802541650001602569650001602585650002602601650001102627650002702638650001902665650001702684650002002701650001702721650001802738650001502756650001802771650001502789650001802804650002102822650002002843650001602863650002002879700002802899700001702927700001402944773012702958856007403085852000903159655001203168IND60641380220221120025138.0190505e20161128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064138022DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra23933a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatpati, Gour Gopal13aAn integrated salinity-driven workflow for rapid lipid enhancement in green microalgae for biodiesel application  ap. 112340-112355.  aA laboratory based integrated approach was undertaken for improvement of lipid accumulation in green microalgae under sodium chloride (NaCl) stress. The maximum biomass yields (1.22 ± 0.04 g L⁻¹ in Chlorella and 1.31 ± 0.04 g L⁻¹ in Chlorococcum) were obtained in the media with initial NaCl concentrations at 2 g L⁻¹ (for Chlorella) and 0.05 g L⁻¹ (for Chlorococcum) after 14 days of culture. Interestingly, maximum lipid accumulation obtained was 45.8 ± 0.4% w/v for Chlorella (on day eight) and 36.33 ± 0.56% w/v for Chlorococcum (on day ten) at an exposure of 5 g L⁻¹ and 1.5 g L⁻¹ NaCl concentrations, respectively. Fatty acid profiles of methyl esters for neutral and polar lipid fractions showed the presence of myristic (C14:0), palmitic (C16:0), palmitoleic (C16:1), oleic (C18:1) and linoleic (C18:2) acids as major fatty acids. Fluorescence intensities (% positive Nile red stained cells) of neutral and polar lipid fractions were also higher in NaCl stress conditions. A significant correlation between polar lipid and neutral lipid was found in both Chlorella (r² = 0.979) and Chlorococcum (r² = 0.972). Flow cytometric study demonstrated a positive fluorescence signal for neutral and polar lipid bodies related to Nile red fluorescence. Associated biochemical changes, like those in total chlorophyll, carotenoid, carbohydrate and protein contents, were determined under variable NaCl concentrations. The elemental compositions (CHNS) and CO₂ fixation rate were assessed using high lipid yielding cells under optimum NaCl concentrations. Biodiesel fuel properties were obtained from high lipid yielding cells of the test microalgae and compared with Indian and international diesel standards. Finally large-scale cultivation of Chlorella ellipsoidea was performed in a hybrid photobioreactor (800 L capacity) and the highest biomass and lipid content obtained was 1.66 ± 0.09 g L⁻¹ (at 8 days) and 54.73 ± 1.78% w/v (at 10 days) at 5 g L⁻¹ NaCl respectively. This optimized NaCl concentration makes it an economical substitute for biodiesel production on a large scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella ellipsoidea 3aChlorococcum 3abiodiesel 3abiomass 3acarbohydrates 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3aelemental composition 3aesters 3afatty acid composition 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3afuel production 3alipid bodies 3alipid content 3amicroalgae 3amyristic acid 3aoleic acid 3apalmitic acid 3aphotobioreactors 3aprotein content 3asalt stress 3asodium chloride1 aChandra Gorain, Prakash1 aPaul, Ishita1 aPal, Ruma0 tRSC advances.g2016 Nov. 28, v. 6, no. 113 p.112340-112355dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra23933a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03192naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245016200172500001900334520159900353592002801952650002501980650002002005650001402025650001102039650001402050650001402064650001902078650001302097650001102110650001302121650001602134650001502150650001202165650001502177650001502192651001502207651001702222653003302239653002402272653001802296653001602314700002302330700002602353700002202379700002002401700003202421773011502453856008502568852000902653655001202662IND60706631720221120161545.0201024e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070663172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2020.1044912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClouthier, Sharon10aMolecular phylogeny of sturgeon mimiviruses and Bayesian hierarchical modeling of their effect on wild Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) in Central Canada  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSturgeon mimiviruses can cause a lethal disease of the integumentary systems of sturgeon (Acipenseridae). Here we provide phylogeographic evidence that sturgeon mimivirus is endemic in endangered populations of wild Lake Sturgeon within Canada's Hudson Bay drainage basin. Namao virus (NV) variants were diagnosed in 24% of Lake Sturgeon samples (n = 1329) collected between 2010–2015. Lake Sturgeon populations with the highest virus prevalence were from the Nelson River (58%) in 2015, Saskatchewan River (41%) in 2010 and South Saskatchewan River (36%) in 2011. Bayesian phylogenetic reconstructions suggested that four NV variants, designated HBDB I-IV, co-circulate temporally and spatially within and between the genetically and biogeographically distinct Lake Sturgeon populations. Evidence from recapture studies suggested that Lake Sturgeon across the basin are persistently infected with NV at prevalence and titer (10³.⁶ equivalent plasmid copies per μg DNA) levels consistent with the hypothesis that wild Lake Sturgeon populations serve as a maintenance population and reservoir for sturgeon mimiviruses. Bayesian hierarchical modeling of NV in the Landing River population of Lake Sturgeon suggested that host weight and age were the best predictors of sturgeon mimivirus presence and titer, respectively, whereas water flow rate, level and temperature, and number of previous captures did not significantly improve model fit. A negative relationship was estimated between sturgeon mimivirus presence and Lake Sturgeon weight and between virus titer and Lake Sturgeon age.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcipenser fulvescens 3aBayesian theory 3aMimivirus 3abasins 3ainfection 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3aplasmids 3arivers 3asturgeon 3atemperature 3aviral load 3aviruses 3awater flow 3awatersheds 3aHudson Bay 3aSaskatchewan 0aBayesian hierarchical models 0aMolecular phylogeny 0aLake Sturgeon 0aNamao virus1 aCaskenette, Amanda1 aVan Walleghem, Elissa1 aSchroeder, Tamara1 aMacDonald, Don,1 aAnderson, E.

Herein, excess proton confinement effects are computationally investigated for sub-2 nm hydrophobic nanopores by varying the diameters (d = 0.81, 0.95, 1.09, 1.22, 1.36, 1.63, and 1.90 nm), lengths (l ∼3 and ∼5 nm), curvature, and chirality of cylindrical carbon nanotube (CNT) nanopores. CNTs with a combination of different diameter segments are also explored. The spatial distribution of water molecules under confinement is diameter-dependent; however, proton solvation and transport are consistently found to occur in the water layer adjacent to the pore wall, showing an “amphiphilic” character of the hydrated excess proton hydronium-like structure. The proton transport free energy barrier also decreases significantly as the nanopore diameter increases and proton transport becomes almost barrierless in the d > 1 nm nanopores. Among the nanopores studied, the Zundel cation (H₅O₂⁺) is populated only in the d = 0.95 nm CNT (7,7) nanopore. The presence of the hydrated excess proton and K⁺ inside the CNT (7,7) nanopore induces a water density increase by 40 and 20%, respectively. The K⁺ transport through CNT nanopores is also consistently higher in the free energy barrier than proton transport. Interestingly, the evolution of excess protonic charge defect distribution reveals a “frozen” single water wire configuration in the d = 0.81 nm CNT (6,6) nanopore (or segment), through which hydrated excess protons can only shuttle via the Grotthuss mechanism. Vehicular diffusion becomes relevant to proton transport in the “flat” free energy regions and in the wider nanopores, where protons do not primarily shuttle in the axial direction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3acarbon nanotubes 3acations 3ahydrophobicity 3ananopores 3aoptical isomerism 3asolvation1 aLi, Chenghan1 aMartinson, Alex B.

Is inbreeding depression occurring in wildcats (Felis silvestris silvestris) from Italy?  ap. 153-161.  aKnowledge of genetic diversity is important to wildlife conservation because genetically depleted populations experience an increased risk of extinction. Mammalian carnivores are characterized by small and fragmented populations and low dispersal, so that genetic erosion can lead to the fixation of deleterious genes relatively quickly, leading to morphological abnormalities. Kinked tails and cowlicks are indicative of inbreeding depression and have been described in two wild cat species so far, the puma (Puma concolor) and the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus). Here we report the first records of morphological abnormalities in five populations of the European wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris) in Italy by using (1) camera-trapping and (2) necropsy of road-killed individuals assessed through genetic analysis. We collected 24,055 trap-nights from 251 cameras and recorded 566 wildcat detections, from which we identified 148 wildcats. Among these, 11 individuals had a kinked tail and four displayed brachyuria, whereas three wildcats from Sicily had cowlicks on the thorax. We recovered 28 road-killed wildcats and two of them (from Sicily and Friuli Venezia Giulia) had a kinked tail. Among these, one female with a kinked tail had a male foetus with a kinked tail, which proved that this characteristic was genetically inherited. We are unsure why brachyuria or cowlicks were not detected across all monitored wildcat populations, given we found kinked tails throughout Italy. The frequencies at which we have detected these abnormalities in wildcats are far lower than reports from Florida panthers (Puma concolor). Future research is needed to verify whether these abnormalities are also associated with low genetic diversity or other morphological defects which might lower fitness. We recommend a nationwide effort, using these techniques within a standardized sampling design, to further understand the status of the wildcat in Italy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinonyx jubatus 3aFelis silvestris silvestris 3acamera trapping 3aextinction 3afemales 3afetus 3agenetic analysis 3agenetic erosion 3agenetic variation 3amales 3amammals 3anecropsy 3aresearch 3arisk 3atail 3athorax 3awildlife management 3aFlorida 3aItaly 3aSicily1 aFranculli, Donato1 aCalandri, Simone1 aFrancescangeli, David1 aPecorella, Stefano1 aGaudiano, Lorenzo1 aFilacorda, Stefano1 aValvo, Mario Lo1 aNielsen, Clayton K.1 aAnile, Stefano1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8871-96150 tMammal research.g2022 Apr., v. 67, no. 2 p.153-161dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:12555x2199-24017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13364-022-00627-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03253naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245012700160300002000287500001900307520180100326592002802127650001702155650002102172650001902193650001702212650001702229650001602246650001902262650003402281650001702315650001402332650001102346650001802357653001802375653001302393653001802406653001802424700002102442700001902463700001602482700005602498773014202554856007802696852000902774655001202783IND60733616920221119211144.0210408e20210325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073361692DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c008832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Yerin10aDesign of an Electro-Stimulated Hydrogel Actuator System with Fast Flexible Folding Deformation under a Low Electric Field  ap. 15633-15646.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSoft actuators have recently been widely studied due to their significant advantages including light weight, continuous deformability, high environment adaptability, and safe human–robot interactions. In this study, we designed electrically responsive poly(sodium 4-vinylbenzenesulfonate/2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate/acrylamide) (P(VBS/HEMA/AAm)) and poly(sodium 4-vinylbenzenesulfonate/2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate/acrylic acid) (P(VBS/HEMA/AAc)) hydrogels. A series of P(VBS/HEMA/AAm) and P(VBS/HEMA/AAc) hydrogels were prepared by adjusting the monomer composition and cross-linking density to systemically analyze various factors affecting the actuation of hydrogels under an electric field. All hydrogels exhibited more than 65% gel fraction and a high equilibrium water content (EWC) of more than 90%. The EWC of hydrogels gradually increased with decreasing cross-linker content and was also influenced by the monomer composition. The mechanical properties of hydrogels were proportional to the cross-linking density. Particularly, hydrogels showed bending deformation even at low voltages below 10 V, and the electrically responsive bending actuation of hydrogels can be modulated by cross-linking density, monomer composition, applied voltage, ion strength of the electrolyte solution, and geometrical parameters of the hydrogel. By controlling these factors, hydrogels showed a fast response with a bending of more than 100° within a minute. In addition, hydrogels did not show significant cytotoxicity in a biocompatibility test and exhibited more than 84% cell viability. These results indicate that P(VBS/HEMA/AAm) and P(VBS/HEMA/AAc) hydrogels with fast response properties even under a low electric field have the potential to be used in a wide range of soft actuator applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylic acid 3abiocompatibility 3acell viability 3acrosslinking 3acytotoxicity 3adeformation 3aelectric field 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrolytes 3ahydrogels 3asodium 3awater content 0aelectroactive 0ahydrogel 0asoft actuator 0asoft robotics1 aChoi, Moon-Young1 aChoi, Jongseon1 aNa, Jun-Hee1 aKim, So Yeon1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1233-20560 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Mar. 25, v. 13, no. 13 p.15633-15646dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c008833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02176naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009100168500001900259520101400278592002801292650002301320650002401343650005201367650002401419650001401443650001101457650001401468650001101482650001301493700001801506700005601524700002501580773011501605856008501720852000901805655001201814IND60706631920221120152347.0201024e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070663192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2020.1044932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrutos, Roger10aCOVID-19: Time to exonerate the pangolin from the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe emergence of COVID-19 has triggered many works aiming at identifying the animal intermediate potentially involved in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans. The presence of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses in Malayan pangolins, in silico analysis of the ACE2 receptor polymorphism and sequence similarities between the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the spike proteins of pangolin and human Sarbecoviruses led to the proposal of pangolin as intermediary. However, the binding affinity of the pangolin ACE2 receptor for SARS-CoV-2 RBD was later on reported to be low. Here, we provide evidence that the pangolin is not the intermediate animal at the origin of the human pandemic. Moreover, data available do not fit with the spillover model currently proposed for zoonotic emergence which is thus unlikely to account for this outbreak. We propose a different model to explain how SARS-CoV-2 related coronaviruses could have circulated in different species, including humans, before the emergence of COVID-19.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aPholidota (mammals) 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3acomputer simulation 3aevolution 3ahumans 3ainfection 3amodels 3apandemic1 aSerra, Jordi,1 aChen, Tianmu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0710-50861 aDevaux, Christian A.0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2020 Oct., v. 84 p.104493-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.1044933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01880naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245010900176300001600285520067100301592002800972650002001000650002401020650002301044650001401067650001901081650000901100650001801109650001401127650001801141651001401159653001201173653002301185653001801208653000901226653001401235700002501249773010301274856008401377852000901461655001201470IND60238479820221118233514.0150619e20150704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023847982DNAL7 a10.1080/15440478.2014.9295562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJankauskienė, Zofija10aScreening of Industrial Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.)

This study presents a framework to link LULC change with spatial changes in 3 key ESs in arid areas; this framework can contribute to sustainable ecological environment zoning management. In this study, taking the Heihe River Basin (HRB) as an example, we first assessed the spatiotemporal changes in 3 ESs, including soil conservation (SC), water yield (WY), and carbon storage (CS), from 1995 to 2020 using the InVEST model. Second, we used the (Future Land Use Simulation) FLUS model to predict future land-use variations in 2030 and 2050 under 4 scenarios (Basic Scenario (BS), Low-impact Scenario (LIS), High-impact Scenario (HIS), and Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS)). Third, we assessed the future spatial distributions of the 3 ESs with the InVEST model based on the output raster of the FLUS model. Spatial autocorrelation analysis was applied to ecological zoning management. The results showed that from 1995 to 2020, WY decreased slightly by 0.03%, and SC decreased by 2.6%, mainly in the midstream and upstream regions of the HRB. CS presented a trend of first decreasing by 1.3% from 1995 to 2010 and then increasing by 0.5% from 2010 to 2020; this trend was distributed in the upper reaches. In 2030 and 2050, under the HIS, CS increased by 14.7% and 22.0%, respectively, while WY increased by 0.20% and 0.47%, respectively. Under the SDS, CS increased by 1.1% and 1.3%, WY decreased by 0.21% and 0.45%, and SC decreased by 3.3% and 10%.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aautocorrelation 3acarbon sequestration 3acase studies 3aecosystems 3aland use 3aland use and land cover maps 3amodels 3asoil conservation 3asustainable development 3awater yield 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aLand use and land cover 0aKey Ecosystem services 0aFLUS-InVEST model 0aThe Heihe River Basin 0aLocal space autocorrelation analysis1 aShao, Zhuang1 aXia, Chuyu1 aFang, Kai1 aChen, Ran1 aZhou, Jun0 tEcological indicators.g2022 Oct., v. 143 p.109402-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1094023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245011600153300002200269520127200291592002801563650001401591650001001605650001901615650002101634650002301655650002501678650001601703650001101719650001501730650001001745700001701755700001701772700001901789700001501808700001601823773012701839856007401966852000902040655001202049IND60641376820221116160904.0190505e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064137682DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra23811d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yan10aIntegrated super-hydrophobic and antireflective PDMS bio-templated from nano-conical structures of cicada wings  ap. 108974-108980.  aInspired by cicada wings that can greatly minimize the reflectivity on their surfaces over broad angles or frequency ranges due to the presence of tapered pillar arrays, we fabricated a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) positive replica of cicada wings, which demonstrated antireflective and super-hydrophobic characters. Firstly, the cicada wings were selected as a template to duplicate a SiO₂ negative replica. Then, the SiO₂ negative replica was used as a secondary template to prepare a PDMS positive replica. The resultant PDMS replica inherited the nano-conical structures and thus exhibited outstanding antireflective effect. A suppression of reflectance to a minimum of 0.7% that benefits from nano-cones has been achieved, since the path length and quantity of the incident light irradiated onto PDMS could be increased by incorporating anti-reflective and light scattering patterns. In the meantime, the PDMS replica demonstrates super-hydrophobicity due to the presence of nano-cone structures. The PDMS replica of cicada wings that possesses both anti-reflective and superhydrophobic properties may hold great promise for applications in anti-reflection and self-cleaning windows, in photovoltaic cells, telescopes, camera lenses, glass windows and beyond.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCicadidae 3aglass 3ahydrophobicity 3alight scattering 3aphotovoltaic cells 3apolydimethylsiloxane 3areflectance 3asilica 3atelescopes 3awings1 aSong, Yunyun1 aNiu, Shichao1 aZhang, Yonglai1 aHan, Zhiwu1 aRen, Luquan0 tRSC advances.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 6, no. 110 p.108974-108980dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra23811d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245011800213300001600331520157600347592002801923650001601951650001201967650002401979650001502003650001502018650002202033650002702055650002002082650001302102650000902115650002402124651001102148700002302159700002402182700002302206700002002229700002202249700001702271700002102288773011602309856008302425852000902508655001202517IND60770402720221120043227.0220315e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077040272DNAL7 a10.1007/s13364-021-00614-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevillard, Sébastien1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6911-436210aGenetic variability and population size covary positively across nine badgers (Meles meles) populations in France  ap. 239-244.  aHow population size is related to genetic diversity is a long-standing debate in evolutionary ecology and conservation biology. Despite being theoretically expected, the positive relationships between these demographic and genetic components of the species’ ecology are not always found at both the inter- and the intra-specific levels. Numerous factors have been proposed to explain such a discrepancy including demographic, genetic, ecological, and methodological processes. Here, we investigated the link between the genetic diversity and the population size at the intra-specific level within nine badger (Meles meles) populations of similar area size, using both robust estimates of population size and genetic diversity indices obtained from neutral microsatellite loci. This allowed us to circumvent the main confounding factors likely hiding the positive relationship between population size and genetic diversity. As expected, we found that the larger the population size, the higher the genetic diversity, independent of the genetic diversity index used. The main implication of this result resides in the fact that low population size is associated with lowered genetic diversity, likely decreasing the adaptive potential of small populations and putting them at risk of an extinction vortex. It calls also for a joint demo-genetic study of badger populations, and more largely in carnivore populations, especially in a situation of rising over-exploitation such as the one suffered by the badger in the context of the bovine tuberculosis outbreak in Europe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeles meles 3abadgers 3abovine tuberculosis 3acarnivores 3aextinction 3agenetic variation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation size 3aresearch 3arisk 3awildlife management 3aFrance1 aJacquier, Mickaël1 aVandel, Jean-Michel1 aLéger, François,1 aDuhayer, Jeanne1 aPardonnet, Sylvia1 aSay, Ludovic1 aRuette, Sandrine0 tMammal research.g2022 Apr., v. 67, no. 2 p.239-244dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:12555x2199-24017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13364-021-00614-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02185naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245012800167300001600295520080600311592002801117650002301145650002601168650001501194650001201209650001701221650001501238650001601253650000701269650001101276650001401287653003101301653001501332653002001347653002901367653001401396700001401410700001701424700001501441700001801456700001701474700002201491773010601513856008701619852000901706655001201715IND60611591320221117013451.0190409e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061159132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2016.11.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Jin10aEnhancement of l-lactic acid production via synergism in open co-fermentation of Sophora flavescens residues and food waste  ap. 159-164.  aIn this study, Sophora flavescens residues (SFR) were used for l-lactic acid production and were mixed with food waste (FW) to assess the effects of different compositions of SFR and FW. Positive synergistic effects of mixed substrates were achieved with co-fermentation. Co-fermentation increased the proportion of l-lactic acid by decreasing the co-products of ethanol and other organic acids. A maximum l-lactic acid concentration of 48.4g/L and l-lactic acid conversion rate of 0.904g/g total sugar were obtained through co-fermentation of SFR and FW at the optimal ratio of 1:1.5. These results were approximately 6-fold those obtained during mono-fermentation of SFR. Co-fermentation of SFR and FW provides a suitable C/N ratio and pH for effective open fermentative production of l-lactic acid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSophora flavescens 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acoproducts 3aethanol 3afermentation 3afood waste 3alactic acid 3apH 3asugars 3asynergism 0aSophora flavescens residue 0aFood waste 0aCo-fermentation 0al-Lactic acid production 0aSynergism1 aGao, Ming1 aWang, Qunhui1 aWang, Juan1 aSun, Xiaohong1 aChang, Qiang1 aTashiro, Yukihiro0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Feb., v. 225 p.159-164dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2016.11.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03510naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245010400163300002000267520204800287592002802335650002202363650001502385650002602400650002502426650001902451650001502470650001302485650001102498650001902509650001802528650001902546650001102565650001302576650001502589650001602604650001502620700002102635700002602656700002502682700002202707700001902729700002102748700002002769773014402789856007402933852000903007655001203016IND60642412320221120131359.0190507e20170711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064241232DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta11237d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWåhlander, Martin10aTailoring dielectric properties using designed polymer-grafted ZnO nanoparticles in silicone rubber  ap. 14241-14258.  aPolymer grafts were used to tailor the interphases between ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) and silicone matrices. The final electrical properties of the nanocomposites were tuned by the grafted interphases, by controlling the inter-particle distance and the NP-morphology. The nanocomposites can be used in electrical applications where control of the resistivity is desired. Hansen's solubility parameters were used to select a semi-compatible polymer for grafting to obtain anisotropic NP morphologies in silicone, and the grafted NPs self-assembled into various morphologies inside the silicone matrices. The morphologies in the semi-compatible nanocomposites could be tuned by steering the graft length of poly(n-butyl methacrylate) via entropic matrix-graft wetting using surface-initiated atom-transfer radical polymerization. Image analysis models were developed to calculate the radius of primary NPs, the fraction of aggregates, the dispersion, and the face-to-face distance of NPs. The dielectric properties of the nanocomposites were related to the morphology and the face-to-face distance of the NPs. The dielectric losses, above 100 Hz, for nanocomposites with grafted NPs were approximately one decade lower than those of pristine NPs. The isotropic nanocomposites increased the resistivity up to 100 times compared to that of neat silicone rubber, due to the trapping of charge carriers by the interphase of dispersed NPs and nanoclusters. On the other hand, the resistivity of anisotropic nanocomposites decreased 10–100 times when the inter-particle distance in continuous agglomerates was close to the hopping distance of charge carriers. The electrical breakdown strength increased for compatible isotropic nanocomposites, and the temperature dependence of the resistivity and the activation energy were ∼50% lower in the nanocomposites with grafted NPs. These flexible dielectric nanocomposites are promising candidates for low-loss high-voltage transmission cable accessories, mobile electronic devices, wearables and sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aanisotropy 3adielectric properties 3aelectronic equipment 3aimage analysis 3ainterphase 3aisotropy 3amodels 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3apolymerization 3arubber 3asilicone 3asolubility 3atemperature 3azinc oxide1 aNilsson, Fritjof1 aAndersson, Richard L.1 aSanchez, Carmen Cobo1 aTaylor, Nathaniel1 aCarlmark, Anna1 aHillborg, Henrik1 aMalmström, Eva0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 July 11, v. 5, no. 27 p.14241-14258dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta11237d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03240naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245008300175246006600258300001600324520196200340592002802302650001802330650001502348650001302363650002202376650002202398650002002420650001402440650001302454650000902467650001402476650001702490650001902507650000902526650001502535651001202550700002002562700002302582700002102605773010402626856005502730852000902785655001202794IND4475736120221116210929.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447573612DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01750.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJACOBSON, SUSAN K.10aAnálisis del Contenido de la Cobertura Periodística de la Pantera de Florida3 aContent Analysis of Newspaper Coverage of the Florida Panther  ap. 171-179.  aPopulations of large carnivores are declining globally, and analysis of public discourse about carnivores is useful for understanding public opinion and influences on management and policy. Portrayal of carnivores in the media affects public perceptions and support for their conservation. We conducted a content analysis of 513 articles about Florida panthers (Puma concolor coryi) published from 2003 to 2006 in newspapers with local circulation in core panther habitat in southwest Florida and papers with statewide circulation to compare the differences in the amount of coverage and portrayals of panther risks to people and property on the basis of proximity of human communities to panthers. Local papers published significantly more news articles and significantly longer news articles primarily about panthers. Articles in local and statewide papers used both episodic frames, which focus on specific occurrences (e.g., a panther sighting or predation) and thematic frames, which focus on general trends (e.g., abundance of panthers over time). Local articles more often emphasized risks that panthers might harm people, pets, or livestock than statewide papers. Our results are consistent with theory that proximity to human–carnivore conflict influences perceptions and salience of risks posed by large carnivores. Most articles mentioned panthers as a secondary topic, which we believe was a result of the relevance an endangered carnivore has in discussions of public land management, development, and regulations in Florida. Claims made by sources quoted in each article had a neutral to positive depiction of panthers, and most quotations were from federal and state agency scientists. We suggest continued use by the media of agency sources provides the opportunity for clear, concordant messages about panther management. Content analysis provides a way to monitor media portrayal of carnivores for consistency with agency outreach goals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPuma concolor 3acarnivores 3ahabitats 3ahuman communities 3aissues and policy 3aland management 3alivestock 3aoutreach 3apets 3apredation 3apublic lands 3apublic opinion 3arisk 3ascientists 3aFlorida1 aLANGIN, CYNTHIA1 aCARLTON, J.

In shallow water coastal systems, eutrophication typically manifests as shifts in sediment oxygen horizons and accumulation of toxic reduced compounds in the porewater, which have direct, negative effects on the benthic fauna that live in these sediments. To catalog, prevent, and remediate these stressors, the coastal zone management community has expressed a need to identify targets for biostimulatory compounds and products in the environment that are protective of biological integrity of coastal waters. In response to this need, the present study identified and validated a series of sediment total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations associated with changes in macrobenthic community composition across the estuaries and embayments of the Southern California Bight (SCB). Using data from a regional monitoring program, benthic community condition, quantified using the M-AMBI condition assessment index, was modelled as a function of TOC or TN concentration using logistic regression. Then, we evaluated eutrophication thresholds at concentrations corresponding to several relative probabilities (from 0.6 to 0.8), reflecting a range of policy makers’ potential tolerance for risk of failing to meet biointegrity goals. Organic matter thresholds were extracted from the regressions that were predictive of healthy macrobenthic community condition at a 0.8 probability (1.23 mg g⁻¹ TN, 15.51 mg g⁻¹ TOC), 0.7 probability (2.58 mg g⁻¹ TN, 22.9 mg g⁻¹ TOC), or 0.6 probability (3.68 mg g⁻¹ TN, 28.96 mg g⁻¹ TOC) – as an illustration of how these types of stressor response models could be used to set targets for management of these ecosystems. These thresholds were subsequently validated by applying them to data held back from the model creation and by comparing them to taxon-specific inflection points identified from TITAN changepoint analysis of the macrobenthic/TOC/TN calibration data. The different TOC and TN thresholds correctly classified between 67 and 86% of the validation samples, with most of the misclassifications being instances of low organic matter concentration but poor community condition (i.e., false positives). The TOC thresholds identified from our Southern California dataset fell within a similar range (10–35 mg g⁻¹) that has been linked to benthic community impacts from a variety of coastal ocean sites across the Northern Hemisphere. The consistency in thresholds across multiple habitats and different types of biota is suggestive of a general, quantitative threshold for organic matter accumulation in near shore sediment habitats and could be useful for informing the management of coastal ecosystems and setting targets biostimulatory stressors in these systems.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abenthic organisms 3acoastal ecosystems 3acoastal zone management 3acommunity structure 3adata collection 3aeutrophication 3aissues and policy 3aoxygen 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asediments 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal organic carbon 3atoxicity 3aCalifornia 0aTotal nitrogen 0aTotal organic carbon 0aEutrophication 0aMacrofauna 0aBiointegrity 0aM-AMBI1 aGillett, David J.1 aSutula, Martha0 tEcological indicators.g2022 Oct., v. 143 p.109404-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1094043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245015100164300001600315520145900331592002801790650001901818650001101837650001201848650001301860650001301873650001501886650001301901650001101914650002301925650002001948650002201968650001601990650001902006650001402025650001102039650002002050650002502070650003702095700001702132700001702149700001902166773008202185856008502267961001202352852000902364655001202373IND60088656320221118013921.0141102e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008865632DNAL7 a10.1016/S1002-0160(12)60008-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Tao,10aEnhancement of Superoxide Dismutase and Catalase Activities and Salt Tolerance of Euhalophyte Suaeda salsa L. by Mycorrhizal Fungus Glomus mosseae  ap. 217-224.  aArbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)-mediated plant physiological activities could contribute to plant salt tolerance. However, the biochemical mechanism by which AM fungi enhance salt tolerance of halophytic plants is unclear. A pot experiment was conducted to determine whether salt tolerance of the C3 halophyte Suaeda salsa was enhanced by the AM fungus Glomus mosseae. When 60-day-old S. salsa seedlings were subjected to 400 mmol L⁻¹ NaCl stress for 35 days, plant height, number of leaves and branches, shoot and root biomass, and root length of G. mosseae-colonized seedlings were significantly greater than those of the nonmycorrizal seedlings. Leaf superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity at all sampling times (weekly for 35 days after salt stress was initiated) and leaf catalase (CAT) activity at 2 and 3 weeks after salt stress was initiated were also significantly enhanced in G. mosseae-colonized S. salsa seedlings, while the content of leaf malondialdehyde (MDA), a product of membrane lipid peroxidation, was significantly reduced, indicating an alleviation of oxidative damage. The corresponding leaf isoenzymes of SOD (Fe-SOD, Cu/Zn-SOD1, and Cu/Zn-SOD2) and CAT (CAT1 and CAT2) were also significantly increased in the mycorrhizal seedlings after 14 days of 400 mmol L⁻¹ NaCl stress. Our results suggested that G. mosseae increased salt tolerance by increasing SOD and CAT activities and forming SOD and CAT isoforms in S. salsa seedlings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlomus mosseae 3aSuaeda 3abiomass 3abranches 3acatalase 3ahalophytes 3aisozymes 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3amycorrhizal fungi 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asodium chloride 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aLIU, Run-Jin1 aHe, Xin-hua,1 aWANG, Bao-Shan0 tPedosphere.g2012 Apr., v. 22, no. 2 p.217-224dElsevier Ltdx1002-01607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(12)60008-33Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245016000168300001600328520109500344592002801439650002101467650001801488650001101506650002701517650002001544650003201564650001701596650001701613650001501630650001201645650001301657650001701670650002501687653002001712653002501732653003501757653003001792653002201822700001501844700001301859700001801872700001801890700001801908773010601926856008702032852000902119655001202128IND60611591420221117014122.0190409e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061159142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2016.11.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Yiding10aEffects of hydraulic retention time (HRT) on denitrification using waste activated sludge thermal hydrolysis liquid and acidogenic liquid as carbon sources  ap. 147-156.  aWaste activated sludge (WAS) internal carbon source can efficiently and economically enhance denitrification, and hydraulic retention time (HRT) is one of the most important operational parameters for denitrification.

These results suggest that rice roots actively release many metabolites in response to P deficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3aphosphorus 3arhizosphere 3arice 3aroot exudates 3aroots 3ashoots 0adeficiency 0ametabolite 0aphosphorus 0arice 0aroot exudate1 aHorie, Ryota1 aSaitō, Akiko,1 aShinano, Takuro1 aWagatsuma, Tadao1 aSaito, Kazuki1 aOikawa, Akira0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2013 Jan. 1, v. 36, no. 7 p.1138-1159dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2013.780613  aDNAL 7aarticle01477naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001200145245009000157300001600247520047800263592002800741650002300769650002300792650002900815650002200844700001600866700001300882700001800895700001500913700001700928773011600945856008101061852000901142655001201151IND60560760720221121063802.0170106e20170106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056076072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.6b026392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Di10aSynthesis of Benzyltributylstannanes by the Reaction of N-Tosylhydrazones with Bu3SnH  ap. 624-632.  aAn efficient stannylation process with N-tosylhydrazones or directly with carbonyl compounds has been developed.

Measured valence and Ti 2p core-level binding energies, together with the Ti 2p resonant photoelectron (RPE) spectra and the derived partial electron-yield L-edge X-ray absorption (PEY-XA) spectra, reveal mixing between metal 3d and water orbitals. Specifically, ligand states with metal character are identified through the enhancement of signal intensities in the RPE spectra. An observed satellite 3d peak structure is assigned to several different metal–ligand states. Experimental energies and the delocalized nature of the respective orbitals are supported by ground-state electronic structure calculations. We also show that by choice of the detected Auger-electron-decay channel, from which different PEY-XA spectra are obtained, the experimental sensitivity to the interactions of the metal 3d electrons with the solvent can be varied. The effect of such a state-dependent electronic relaxation on the shape of the PEY-XA spectra is discussed in terms of different degrees of electron delocalization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aabsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3aelectrons 3ahybridization 3aligands 3amixing 3asolvents 3aspectroscopy1 aAtak, Kaan1 aThürmer, Stephan1 aAziz, Emad F.1 aWinter, Bernd0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2015 Aug. 20, v. 119, no. 33 p.10607-10615dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.5b033373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245011400162300001800276500001900294520121900313592002801532650001201560650001801572650002001590650003301610650001901643653003401662653001701696653001701713653001501730700002101745700002101766700002001787773018401807856007501991852000902066655001202075IND60691792120221121230634.0200502e19990101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069179212DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.63.10112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYAJIMA, Hirofumi10aInhibitory Effect of the Conformation of Amylose as a Function of I₂ Concentration on Glucoamylase Activity  ap. 1011-1016.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn order to gain a better understanding of the adaptability of glucoamylase to the conformational change in the substrate related with the specificity of the enzyme action, the effect of the solution conformation of amylose (the substrate) as a function of the I₂ concentration on enzyme activity was studied in the initial state by using amyloses with a wide range of average degree of polymerization (DP) in the presence of excess KI. The enzyme activity for the amylose oligomers in the DP range of 20 to 100 decreased monotonically with increasing I₂ concentration. This inhibition of the enzyme activity is ascribed to the effect of the conformational change in amylose of the random coil or worm-like chain to a helix that is induced by the binding of I₃ ⁻ ions responsible for inclusion complexation in combination with direct effect of free I₃ ⁻ ions. In a rapidly mixed complex system for amylose with a large DP of 1,000, however, a significant two-step form of the inhibition of enzyme activity appeared with increasing I₂ concentration, corresponding to the two-step conformational change of amylose in a random coil or worm-like chain to a helix and then to a rod-like compact structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylose 3abiotechnology 3aenzyme activity 3aglucan 1,4-alpha-glucosidase 3apolymerization 0aamylose-iodine-iodide complex 0aconformation 0aglucoamylase 0ainhibition1 aWatanabe, Kazuo,1 aTAKEMURA, Tetsuo1 aISHII, Tadahiro0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g1999 Jan. 1, v. 63, no. 6 p.1011-1016dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.63.10113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02156naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245011900169300002000288520117800308592002801486650001101514650002601525650001401551650001801565650001601583700001801599700002301617773012301640856008201763852000901845655001201854IND60560670620170927000000.0170105e20150820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056067062DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b036082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía, Gregorio,10aTheoretical Study on the Solvation of C60 Fullerene by Ionic Liquids II: DFT Analysis of the Interaction Mechanism  ap. 10616-10629.  aAs a continuation of our previous work (J. Phys. Chem. B, 2014, 118, 11330) on the solvation of C₆₀ by ionic liquids (ILs) using Molecular Dynamic simulations, this paper reports a systematic density functional theory (DFT) analysis on the interaction mechanism between C₆₀ and 24 different ionic liquids (belonging to the imidazolium, piperazinium, and cholinium groups). Properties such as binding energies, charge distributions, intermolecular interactions, or electronic structure were analyzed as a function of the selected ILs. The stronger IL-C₆₀ interactions would be related with π–π stacking between the C₆₀ surface and anions such as salycilate ([SA]). Likewise, the electronic structure analysis pointed to a well-defined relationship between the energetics of IL-C₆₀ systems and IL features. Therefore, ILs with deep HOMO energies as well as weak interaction between both ions would be a priori good candidates for C₆₀ solvation. Although only short-range interactions are studied in the framework of DFT, this work provides useful information for the rational design of ILs that could exhibit suitable features as C₆₀ solvents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3achemical interactions 3afullerene 3aionic liquids 3amethodology1 aAtilhan, Mert1 aAparicio, Santiago0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2015 Aug. 20, v. 119, no. 33 p.10616-10629dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.5b036083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02324naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245014800161300002000309500001900329520119400348592002801542650002401570650001501594650001401609650002301623650001301646700001601659700001101675700001701686700005601703773013801759856008001897852000901977655001201986IND60704301020221119234317.0200723e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070430102DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c047862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xuming10a2D Mn₂C₆Se₁₂ and Mn₂C₆S₆Se₆: Intrinsic Room-Temperature Dirac Spin Gapless Semiconductors and Perfect Spin Transport Properties  ap. 16127-16135.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTwo-dimensional intrinsic ferromagnets with high spin polarization and high Curie temperature are rare and very important for developing novel nanoscale spintronic materials and devices. In this work, by using the first-principles calculations, we confirm that Mn₂C₆Se₁₂ and Mn₂C₆S₆Se₆ monolayers are perfect and nearly Dirac spin gapless semiconductors with 100% spin polarization, high Fermi velocities, high Curie temperatures, and large magnetic anisotropic energies. Within the spin–orbit coupling, the Mn₂C₆Se₁₂ monolayer has nontrivial topological properties with a nonzero Chern number, which is confirmed by the calculated Berry curvature, anomalous Hall conductance, and chiral edge states. We also reveal from the first-principles combined with the nonequilibrium Green’s function method that both monolayers exhibit perfect spin transport properties such as the spin-filtering effect, the negative differential resistance effect, and high magnetoresistance. These results suggest that Mn₂C₆Se₁₂ and Mn₂C₆S₆Se₆ monolayers are promising candidates for the realization of the quantum anomalous Hall effect and the 2D spintronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aanisotropy 3amagnetism 3aphysical chemistry 3atopology1 aFeng, Yulin1 aLi, Si1 aZhang, Boqun1 aGao, Guoying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0606-35930 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 July 01, v. 124, no. 29 p.16127-16135dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c047863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04354naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245013000163300001500293520229200308592002802600650002302628650002302651650001702674650002102691650002502712650001502737650001902752650001802771650001202789650001602801650001302817650001002830650001602840650002302856650002002879650001302899650001502912650001502927650002202942650001802964650001202982650002802994650000903022650002103031650002503052651001003077653000703087653000703094653000703101653000703108653000603115653000703121653000803128653000803136653000803144653002703152653002603179653002503205653001803230653002303248653001103271700001403282700001903296700001703315700001403332700001703346700001503363773009903378856008603477852000903563655001203572IND60564759220221120113940.0190412e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056475922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Shu14aThe antioxidation-related functional structure of plant communities: Understanding antioxidation at the plant community level  ap. 98-107.  aIn the case of ecological stresses, reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be overproduced in plant cells, leading to lipid peroxidation that causes damage or death to cells. To prevent damage, plant tissues contain several antioxidants that scavenge ROS. However, antioxidation at the plant community level still remains unknown and may provide an insight into ecosystem functioning regarding stress resistance. To understand the property, we established the antioxidation-related functional structure based on the concept of the functional structure and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH), carotenoid (Car) and proline (Pro) and the relative abundance of component species in natural plant communities on the Chinese hilly-gullied Loess Plateau. An information-theoretic (I-T) approach was used to infer the effects of antioxidation-related functional components and stresses that we investigated on lipid peroxidation at the plant community level quantified by the community-weighted mean of malondialdehyde (MDA). We found that the induction of lipid peroxidation was more closely associated with a soil available nitrogen deficiency than it was with an available phosphorus deficiency. However, the inducing effect of soil available nitrogen was finite. The prevention of lipid peroxidation was more closely associated with the community-weighted means of GSH and Pro (CWM GSH and CWM Pro) than it was with other antioxidation-related functional components. However, the efficiency of CWM Pro was quite low; CWM GSH exhibited inefficiency. In addition, antioxidation-related functional components were affected by neither soil available nitrogen nor available phosphorus. Furthermore, by estimating the relative weights of the antioxidants and considering the feasibility of community assemblages, we proposed that Stipa grandis, Leymus secalinus, Stipa bungeana, Phragmites australis, Potentilla tanacetifolia, Artemisia gmelinii, Artemisia scoparia, Heteropappus altaicus and Syringa oblata could be utilized in community assemblages to achieve an antioxidation-functional target. Additionally, appropriate phosphorus application for A. gmelinii and H. altaicus might contribute to maintaining their antioxidation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia gmelinii 3aArtemisia scoparia 3aHeteropappus 3aLeymus secalinus 3aPhragmites australis 3aPotentilla 3aStipa bungeana 3aStipa grandis 3aSyringa 3acarotenoids 3acatalase 3adeath 3aglutathione 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3anitrogen 3aperoxidase 3aphosphorus 3aplant communities 3aplant tissues 3aproline 3areactive oxygen species 3asoil 3astress tolerance 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aChina 0aAN 0aAP 0aSM 0aND 0aD 0aNB 0aMNO 0aI-T 0aMMI 0aVegetation restoration 0aEcosystem functioning 0aFunctional structure 0aAntioxidation 0aLipid peroxidation 0aStress1 aLi, Yujin1 aWang, Wanzhong1 aJiao, Juying1 aKou, Meng1 aYin, Qiulong1 aXu, Haiyan0 tEcological indicators.g2017 July, v. 78 p.98-107dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001700147245013200164300001600296500000900312520142200321592002801743650001301771650000901784650001901793650002501812650003001837650002301867650001801890650003301908650002301941650002301964650002301987650001702010650001702027650001202044650001602056650002202072650002102094651001102115700002402126700001702150700001902167773012102186852000902307856008402316655001202400IND4418440220221123033653.0191228e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441844022DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2008.03.01622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbalo, Grace12aA Comparative Analysis of Conventional and Marker-Assisted Selection Methods in Breeding Maize Streak Virus Resistance in Maize  ap. 509-520.  aepub  aReliable information regarding comparative advantage of marker-assisted selection (MAS) over conventional selection (CS) in breeding for maize streak virus (MSV) resistance in maize (Zea mays L.) is scarcely available. A comparative study was, therefore, conducted to determine the efficiency of both methods in breeding for MSV resistance in Uganda. Backcross and selfed-progenies were derived from inbred lines CML202 (resistant), CML321, and CML384 (susceptible) using MAS and CS. The experimental lines and their testcross progenies were evaluated for MSV resistance and yield across three locations. Although both breeding approaches were effective in generating MSV-resistant lines, disease incidence was higher in populations under CS (79%) than MAS (62%). A similar trend was observed for area under disease progress curve. However, an equal number of lines generated by MAS and CS displayed high yield potential and MVS resistance in testcrosses. Because all required DNA analysis was performed in an existing laboratory and on a well-characterized quantitative trait locus, costs of capital, equipment maintenance, and marker development were excluded in costing the MAS procedure. Considering total running costs, MAS was cheaper than CS by 26%, which was realized by using fewer plants. Therefore, when laboratory facilities are already established MAS would be recommended in breeding for MSV resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aplant breeding 3aartificial selection 3amarker-assisted selection 3aMaize streak virus 3aplant viruses 3aplant diseases and disorders 3adisease resistance 3agenetic resistance 3aselection criteria 3ainbred lines 3abackcrossing 3aselfing 3agrain yield 3adisease incidence 3adisease severity 3aUganda1 aTongoona, Pangirayi1 aDerera, John1 aEdema, Richard0 tCrop science.g2009 Mar., v. 49, no. 2 p.509-520dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2008.03.01623Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02773naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245007100182300001600253500001500269520098400284592002801268650001501296650000901311650002001320650001701340650001401357650001901371650001301390650001201403650001801415650001601433650001201449650004601461650002801507650003901535650003801574650001101612650002501623650004601648650004001694650002801734650003001762650002901792650004301821650003601864653001701900700002101917700001901938700001901957773012901976856008102105852000902186655001202195IND4411326320221121122101.0151023e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441132632DNAL7 a183478402pmid7 a10.1007/s00244-008-9150-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBohn, Thomas,10aReduced Fitness of Daphnia magna Fed a Bt-Transgenic Maize Variety  ap. 584-592.  a2019-12-05  aGenetically modified (GM) maize expressing the Bt-toxin Cry1Ab (Bt-maize) was tested for effects on survival, growth, and reproduction of the water flea Daphnia magna, a crustacean arthropod commonly used as a model organism in ecotoxicological studies. In three repeated experiments, D. magna were fed 100% ground maize in suspension, using either GM or isogenic unmodified (UM) maize. D. magna fed GM-maize showed a significantly reduced fitness performance: The mortality was higher, a lower proportion of females reached sexual maturation, and the overall egg production was lower compared to D. magna fed UM isogenic maize. We conclude that the tested variety of Bt-maize and its UM counterpart do not have the same quality as food sources for this widely used model organism. The combination of a reduced fitness performance combined with earlier onset of reproduction of D. magna fed Bt-maize indicates a toxic effect rather than a lower nutritional value of the GM-maize.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarthropods 3acorn 3anutritive value 3aSiphonaptera 3amortality 3aegg production 3atoxicity 3afemales 3aDaphnia magna 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aBody Sizexdrug effects 2aDaphniaxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aEndotoxinsxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aFemale 2aGrowthxdrug effects 2aHemolysin Proteinsxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aInsecticidesxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aLongevityxdrug effects 2aOvipositionxdrug effects 2aPest Control, Biological 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxtoxicity 2aZea maysxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0areproduction1 aPrimicerio, Raul1 aHessen, Dag O.1 aTraavik, Terje0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2008 Nov., v. 55, no. 4 p.584-592dSpringer-Verlagx0090-43417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-008-9150-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01400naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245009000161300001800251520033500269592002800604650001700632650002200649650001800671650002100689650002300710650001300733650002100746650001200767650002900779650001100808700002100819773012900840856007200969852000901041655001201050IND60657293020221119065701.0190816e20021119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065729302DNAL7 a10.1039/b206746c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsse, Abdirisak A.10aElectrocatalytic carboxylation of benzyl chlorides at silver cathodes in acetonitrile  ap. 2798-2799.  aSilver exhibits powerful electrocatalytic activities towards the reductive carboxylation of benzyl chlorides (RCl): in CO₂-saturated CH₃CN, reduction of RCl occurs at potentials that are about 0.6 V more positive than those of the same process at Hg or carbon electrodes and gives carboxylic acids in good to excellent yields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3acarbon electrodes 3acarboxylation 3acarboxylic acids 3acatalytic activity 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3amercury 3aorganochlorine compounds 3asilver1 aGennaro, Armando0 tChemical communications.g2002 Nov. 19, , no. 23 p.2798-2799dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b206746c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03300naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245009200172506011100264506007600375520166300451592002802114506003702142650001102179650001402190650001502204650001002219650001602229650001202245650001302257650001502270650001202285650002102297650002102318653001702339653001702356653001502373653002802388653001602416700001602432700001302448700001602461700001602477700001502493700001202508700001902520700001502539773011902554856008802673852000902761655001202770IND60792343320221207050219.0220914e20221215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079234332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1582682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurivalova, Z.10aLoss of temporal structure of tropical soundscapes with intensifying land use in Borneo  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aConservation and sustainable management efforts in tropical forests often lack reliable, effective, and easily-communicated ways to measure the biodiversity status of a protected or managed landscape. The sounds that many tropical species make can be recorded by pre-programmed devices and analysed to yield measures of biodiversity. Interpreting the resulting soundscapes has developed along two paths: analysing the whole soundscape using acoustic indices, used as a proxy of biodiversity, or focusing on individual species that can be either manually or automatically recognized from the soundscape. Here we develop an intermediate approach to divide the soundscape into frequency categories belonging to broad taxonomic groups of vocalizing animals. While the method was unable to distinguish between amphibian and mammal communities, it was successful in assigning parts of the soundscape as likely produced by birds and insects. Applying the approach in Borneo revealed that, with increasing land use intensity, i) the spectral saturation of the soundscape, a proxy of species richness, loses dawn and dusk peaks, ii) bird acoustic communities lose recurrent diurnal patterns, becoming less synchronized across sites, and that iii) insect Soundscape Saturation increases at night. If soundscapes are partitioned similarly in different regions, our method could be used to bridge soundscape-level and individual-species level analyses. Regaining dawn and dusk peaks, the synchrony of bird acoustic communities, and losing nocturnal dominance of insect could be used as a set of simple indicators of tropical forest retaining high levels of biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBorneo 3aacoustics 3aamphibians 3abirds 3aenvironment 3ainsects 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amammals 3aspecies richness 3atropical forests 0aBioacoustics 0aConservation 0aMonitoring 0aRainforest biodiversity 0aSoundscapes1 aMaeda, T.M.1 aPurnomo,1 aRayadin, Y.1 aBoucher, T.1 aChoksi, P.1 aRoe, P.1 aTruskinger, A.1 aGame, E.T.0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Dec. 15, v. 852 p.158268-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1582683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010800167300001200275520139400287592002801681596003701709596005201746596007601798650002701874650001101901650001701912650001801929650001801947650001501965650002001980650003102000650004302031650002202074650001802096700001702114700001702131700002302148700006002171700002702231700006102258773010502319856008302424852000902507655001202516IND60784331920221121102637.0221005e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078433192DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-022-03756-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkazaki, Karin10aGene expression profiling before and after internode culture for adventitious shoot formation in ipecac  ap. 361.  aBACKGROUND: In ipecac (Carapichea ipecacuanha (Brot.) L. Andersson), adventitious shoots can be induced simply by placing internodal segments on phytohormone-free culture medium. The shoots form locally on the epidermis of the apical region of the segments, but not the basal region. Levels of endogenous auxin and cytokinin transiently increase in the segments after 1 week of culture. RESULTS: Here, we conducted RNA-seq analysis to compare gene expression patterns in apical and basal regions of segments before culture and after 1 week of culture for adventitious shoot formation. The results revealed 8987 differentially expressed genes in a de novo assembly of 76,684 genes. Among them, 276 genes were upregulated in the apical region after 1 week of culture relative to before culture and the basal region after 1 week of culture. These genes include 18 phytohormone-response genes and shoot-formation-related genes. Validation of the gene expression by quantitative real-time PCR assay confirmed that the expression patterns were similar to those of the RNA-seq data. CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptome data show that expression of cytokinin biosynthesis genes is induced along with the acquisition of cellular pluripotency and the initiation of cell division by wounding in the apical region of internodal segments, that trigger adventitious shoot formation without callusing.  aPublisher supplied data  a2022-4085cJapan Science Society  aJPMJSP2159cJapan Science and Technology Agency  a19-416, 20-418, 21-313, 22NIBB408cNational Institute for Basic Biology 3aCarapichea ipecacuanha 3aauxins 3abiosynthesis 3acell division 3aculture media 3acytokinins 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3atranscriptome1 aKoike, Imari1 aKera, Sayuri1 aYamaguchi, Katushi1 aShigenobu, Shuji1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4640-23231 aShimomura, Kōichirō,1 aUmehara, Mikihisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9711-82990 tBMC plant biology.g2022 Dec., v. 22, no. 1 p.361-361dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-022-03756-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03313naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245015100167300001400318520181200332592002802144650002202172650002402194650002102218650001502239650001102254650001002265650001502275650002202290650002602312650002402338650001102362650002002373650001502393651001002408653002202418653003102440653003402471653002002505653003202525653002402557653001002581700001902591700001602610773009802626856008602724852000902810655001202819IND60564759320221120113833.0190412e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056475932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHua, Xiaobo10aEvaluating the role of livelihood assets in suitable livelihood strategies: Protocol for anti-poverty policy in the Eastern Tibetan Plateau, China  ap. 62-74.  aAlthough numerous studies have been conducted on the relationship between livelihood assets and strategies, only a few quantitative studies exist on the topic for anti-poverty policies with regard to the Tibetan Plateau. This study investigated 357 households in the upper reaches of the Dadu River watershed in the Eastern Tibetan Plateau, China, using the participatory rural appraisal method. Then, applying a multinomial logistic regression model, we quantitatively analyzed the relationship between livelihood assets and livelihood strategies, the findings of which have implications for local agricultural policy interventions. The preliminary results indicate that of the four classifications of livelihood strategies used in this study, the main livelihood strategy is that of the non-farming-dependent household type (i.e., Type III in our study) that combines agricultural and non-farm activities or practices self-employment for wages. There are significant differences in the livelihood assets owned by households with different livelihood strategies. Human, natural, and financial assets have significant influences on livelihood strategies, and the choice of livelihood strategy varies by livelihood assets. Further, with improvements in household labor capacity and cash income per capita, the livelihood strategies of non-agricultural and non-farming households may shift away from agriculture, while an increase in farmland cultivated per capita, cash income per capita, and household labor capacity may encourage households to adopt agriculture-dependent livelihood strategies. These findings contribute to research on livelihood and related development strategies and anti-poverty policies in not only the Eastern Tibetan Plateau but also other regions with similar livelihood strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural policy 3afinancial assets 3ahouseholds 3ahumans 3alabor 3alivelihood 3aper-capita income 3aquantitative analysis 3aregression analysis 3arivers 3aself-employment 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aLivelihood assets 0aLivelihood diversification 0aClassification of livelihoods 0aTibetan Plateau 0aNon-agricultural households 0aPoverty alleviation 0aChina1 aYan, Jianzhong1 aZhang, Yili0 tEcological indicators.g2017 July, v. 78 p.62-74dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006100146245008200207300002000289500001900309520137800328592002801706650001601734650002201750650001501772650001201787650001301799650001401812650001501826650001301841650003701854700002201891700006501913700002601978700002302004700002602027700002602053700001702079700001802096700001802114700002102132700002202153700005602175700005702231700002102288700002302309700002102332773013802353856008002491852000902571655001202580IND60704301120210618000000.0200723e20200625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070430112DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c050772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFornari, Celso I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1765-299910aIncorporation of Europium in Bi₂Te₃ Topological Insulator Epitaxial Films  ap. 16048-16057.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the field of topological materials, the interaction between band topology and magnetism remains a current frontier for the advancement of new topological states and spintronic functionalities. Doping with rare-earth elements with large magnetic moments is a current approach to exploit the phenomenology of such interaction. However, dopant solubility into the main matrix plays a major role. In this sense, the present work is focused on elucidating how Eu incorporates into Bi₂Te₃ lattice as a function of doping. This work reports a systematic investigation of the structural and electronic properties of bismuth telluride epitaxial layers doped with Eu. Bi₂Te₃ films were grown by molecular beam epitaxy on (111) BaF₂ substrates with nominal Eu doping ranging from 0% up to 9%. X-ray diffraction analysis and scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal that Eu atoms enter substitutionally on Bi sites up to 4% of Eu doping. In contrast, the 9% Eu-doped sample contains epitaxially oriented nanoclusters of EuTe. X-ray photoelectron and absorption spectroscopies show that Eu atoms enter the Bi₂Te₃ crystal matrix in the divalent Eu²⁺ state for all Eu concentrations.

Sprouting of legumes enhances the bioavailability and digestibility of nutrients and therefore plays an important role in human nutrition. Improved varieties of grain cowpea viz. Pant Lobia-1 (PL-1) and Pant Lobia-2 (PL-2) and Pant Lobia-3 (PL-3) were examined for sprouting characteristics and associated changes in nutritional quality. Soaking time, sprouting time and sprouting temperature combinations for desirable sprout length of ¼ to ½ inch for cowpea seed samples were standardized. All the observations were taken in triplicate except soaking time, where six observations were taken in a completely randomized design of three treatments. Results revealed that optimum soaking time of PL-1 and PL-2 seed was 3 h whereas PL-3 required 9 h. Sprouting period of 24 h at 25 °C was found to be desirable for obtaining good sprouts. Significant improvement in nutritional quality was observed after sprouting at 25 °C for 24 h; protein increased by 9–12 %, vitamin C increased by 4–38 times, phytic acid decreased by 4–16 times, trypsin inhibitor activity decreased by 28–55 % along with an increase of 8–20 % in in-vitro protein digestibility.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVigna unguiculata 3aascorbic acid 3abioavailability 3acowpeas 3acultivars 3adietary fiber 3adietary minerals 3adigestibility 3adigestible protein 3aenergy 3ahuman nutrition 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aphytic acid 3asoaking 3asprouting 3atemperature 3atrypsin inhibitors1 aKushwaha, Archana1 aAnil Kumar,0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2015 Oct., v. 52, no. 10 p.6821-6827dSpringer Indiax0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-015-1832-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01952naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100002300151245008400174300001400258520100400272592002801276650002001304650001901324650001101343650001301354700002201367700002001389700002101409700002401430773008801454856008701542852000901629655001201638IND4475797220221119051557.0150808e20120824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447579722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2012.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarton, C.

Yet the sparse and incomplete nature of this record often makes it impossible to inferentially reconstruct past societies in sufficient detail for them to serve as more than very general cautionary tales of coupled socio-ecological systems. However, when formal and computational modeling is used to experimentally simulate human socioecological dynamics, the empirical archaeological record can be used to validate and improve dynamic models of long term change. In this way, knowledge generated by archaeology can play a unique and valuable role in developing the tools to make more informed decisions that will shape our future. The Mediterranean Landscape Dynamics project offers an example of using the past to develop and test computational models of interactions between land-use and landscape evolution that ultimately may help guide decision-making.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3adynamic models 3ahumans 3aland use1 aUllah, Isaac I.T.1 aBergin, Sean M.1 aMitasova, Helena1 aSarjoughian, Hessam0 tEcological modelling.g2012 Aug. 24, v. 241 p.42-53dElsevier B.V.x0304-38007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2012.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014400169300001800313520123700331592002801568650002201596650001501618650001501633650001601648650001101664650002001675650002301695650001801718650001301736650002401749650003301773650001201806650003701818650001101855650000901866650002001875653001501895653001801910653002601928653003601954653002701990700001602017700001602033700001702049773013002066856008502196852000902281655001202290IND60530884320221119123903.0160723e20150803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053088432DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b002432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Liaoyuan10aWood-Derived Carbons with Hierarchical Porous Structures and Monolithic Shapes Prepared by Biological-Template and Self-Assembly Strategies  ap. 1724-1731.  aNovel wood-derived hierarchical porous carbons (HPCs) with biomimicry macro-/microporous and ordered mesostructures have been successfully prepared by using wood processing residues, such as poplar powder/or shavings, as a mimic-template to reproduce the wood cellular structures, resol as a precursor, and triblock copolymer F127 as a soft-template to construct the mesostructure onto the wood scaffold. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and N₂ adsorption results indicate that the obtained HPCs not only faithfully reproduce the wood cellular structures but also possess ordered mesostructures (p6 mm) with uniform pore sizes (∼4.0 nm) and high surface areas (∼463m²/g). Furthermore, the pore texture and properties of HPCs could be regulated by simply varying the dosages of resol precursor to poplar shavings. A formation process for wood-derived HPCs with controlled hierarchical nanostructures through wood-template and interface self-assembly approaches is proposed in this work. In addition, HPCs exhibit good adsorption properties toward organic vapors, demonstrating that this kind of HPCs could be used as a promising material for adsorbents and separation systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abiomimetics 3acarbon 3acell structures 3acomposite polymers 3ananomaterials 3anitrogen 3aprocessing residues 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atexture 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avapors 3awood 3awood processing 0aBiomimetic 0aDual-template 0aOrdered mseostructure 0aHierarchically porous structure 0aCarbonaceous materials1 aLi, Xianjun1 aWu, Yiqiang1 aRong, Minzhi0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2015 Aug. 03, v. 3, no. 8 p.1724-1731dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b002433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007500169300001600244520148200260592002801742650002501770650001701795650001401812650001801826650001801844650002401862650001201886650001701898650001201915653001701927653002001944653001801964653001701982653003101999700005402030700003202084700001702116700005902133773009702192856008402289852000902373655001202382IND60561246320221118064500.0170607e20140815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056124632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2014.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSagiv, Abraham10aAnalysis of forward osmosis desalination via two-dimensional FEM model  ap. 161-172.  aForward osmosis (FO) desalination was investigated via 2-D numerical model of the fully coupled hydrodynamics and mass transfer equations. The model was formulated for a detailed composite channel structure (feed and draw channels, membrane skin layer and porous support) being capable of describing co-current or counter current cross operation where the membrane skin faces the salt feed solution (SFF) or where the membrane skin faces the draw solution (SFD). Simulations based on existing experimental FO data confirmed that FO operation in a counter-current/SFD mode provides slight improvement with respect to water flux, and reduced cross migration of feed and draw solutes relative to the co-current mode of operation. Analysis of existing FO data also revealed the dependence of the intrinsic membrane water permeability and solute transport coefficients on draw solute concentration. Simulation results indicated significant cross membrane migration of feed and draw solutes for long (~1m) relative to short (~10cm) FO channels. Moreover, up to an order of magnitude decline of draw solute concentration difference (along the membrane) can be encountered at the draw channel exit region. Simulation results suggest that accurate assessment of FO performance in long channels is critical for full-scale plant design in order to minimize salt leakage, optimize recovery, and setting accurate inlet/outlet conditions to enable simulations of membrane elements in series.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3adesalination 3aequations 3ahydrodynamics 3amass transfer 3amathematical models 3aosmosis 3apermeability 3asolutes 0aDesalination 0aForward osmosis 0aMass transfer 0aFEM modeling 0aConcentration polarization1 aZhu, Aihua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1060-72741 aChristofides, Panagiotis D.1 aCohen, Yoram1 aSemiat, Raphael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0640-39300 tJournal of Membrane Science.g2014 Aug. 15, v. 464 p.161-172dElsevier B.V.x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2014.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245014000163300002000303520137700323592002801700650001601728650002601744650001901770650002101789650001401810650002101824650001201845650002101857650001301878700002001891773012901911856008202040852000902122655001202131IND60565950420221119233258.0170329e20151105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056595042DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b066752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Hongbo10aEffects of the Dielectric Response of Single-Component Liquids and Liquid Mixtures on Electrochemical Properties between Charged Plates  ap. 24714-24723.  aWe study the dielectric properties of single-component liquids and liquid mixtures between charged plates and develop a modified Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) equation using Booth’s theory. Our theory accounts for the permanent dipole moment and polarizability of solvents and the hydrogen bonds between solvents. We demonstrate that these key parameters are crucial for capturing the reorientation of solvent dipoles under external electrostatic fields. Our results show that variations in the capacitance of ionic solutions can be nonmonotonic, whereas the conventional PB theory predicts monotonic behavior. Specifically, the effect of hydrogen bonding produces highly nonmonotonic behavior that depends on the surface charge density and applied voltage. The resultant capacitance can be enhanced by hydrogen bonding, but a significant decline in the capacitance can also occur as the applied voltage is increased. Furthermore, our novel finding is that field-induced changes in the dielectric value may cause the unconventional order–order phase transition of two immiscible liquids. Thus, the dielectric interface may preferentially become parallel to the charged plates, whereas the linear-dielectric theory predicts that the parallel interface is always energetically unfavored. We then demonstrate that a favored orientation generally exhibits a larger capacitance.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3adielectric properties 3aelectric power 3aelectrochemistry 3aequations 3ahydrogen bonding 3aliquids 3aphase transition 3asolvents1 aNakamura, Issei0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2015 Nov. 05, v. 119, no. 44 p.24714-24723dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b066753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03031naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001600147245016400163300001800327520170900345592002802054650002202082650002202104650001502126650001102141650002502152650001202177650002602189650002002215650001602235650001802251650000902269650001102278650000902289650002102298650002502319651001702344700001602361700002302377773010502400856008302505852000902588655001202597IND4460481620221122020302.0150810e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446048162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2011.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMzezewa, J.10aYield and seasonal water productivity of sunflower as affected by tillage and cropping systems under dryland conditions in the Limpopo Province of South Africa  ap. 1641-1648.  aSustainable food production in semi-arid tropical countries can be achieved through efficient utilization of rainwater. A field experiment to assess the grain yield, seasonal water use (WU), water use efficiency (WUE) and precipitation use efficiency (PUE) of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) intercropped with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) on two tillage systems was conducted during the 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 cropping seasons at the University of Venda (22°58′ S, 30°26′ E at 596m above sea level). The experiment was configured as a 2×2×2 factorial design with three replications. The tillage treatments were conventional tillage (CT) (control) and in-field rainwater harvesting (IRWH) system. The IRWH is a special crop production technique that promotes runoff on 2.0-m wide no-till strip between crop rows and collects the runoff water in basins where it infiltrates into the soil profile. The treatments in the cropping system (CS) consisted of a sole crop (sunflower or cowpea) and an intercrop (sunflower×cowpea). Results of the experiment revealed that IRWH led to a significant (P<0.05) increase in sunflower grain yield in the second season but cowpea grain yield was not influenced by tillage systems. IRWH resulted in significantly higher WU, WUE and PUE of both crops compared to CT system in the second season. The CS had significant effects on sunflower grain yield in both seasons but none on the cowpea grain yield. WU was significantly higher in intercrops than in sole cowpea and sole sunflower in the first and second season, respectively. WUE and PUE were significantly greater in sole sunflower than in the intercrops but less in the sole cowpea than in the intercrops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3aVigna unguiculata 3aarid lands 3abasins 3aconventional tillage 3acowpeas 3afield experimentation 3afood production 3agrain yield 3aintercropping 3arain 3arunoff 3asoil 3awater harvesting 3awater use efficiency 3aSouth Africa1 aGwata, E.T.1 avan Rensburg, L.D.0 tAgricultural water management.g2011 Aug., v. 98, no. 10 p.1641-1648dElsevier B.V.x0378-37747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2011.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245008800211300001600299520176100315592002802076596005402104650002202158650002302180650001902203650001002222650002002232650002602252650001002278650002102288650001702309650002202326650002202348650001402370650002202384650001002406700006002416700002302476700001902499700005702518773013102575856008302706852000902789655001202798IND60735440120221120225115.0210731e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073544012DNAL7 a10.1007/s12686-020-01182-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteinmetz, Kristina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3050-440510aEnabling pinniped conservation by means of non-invasive genetic population analysis  ap. 131-142.  aConservation and management of protected species, particularly of elusive species such as pinnipeds, is hampered by knowledge gaps. In the case of studies using genetic data these are often attributed to a lack of representative samples. Therefore, there is a pressing need for the development of minimally invasive sampling protocols suitable for genetic analyses of pinnipeds. The present study evaluated the applicability of various protocols for the collection and processing of samples from harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) and grey seals (Halichoerus grypus), encompassing seven source sample types (blood, skin, hair (plucked/moulted), urine, buccal swabs, scat) and three different extraction methods. Protocols were designed for minimally invasive sampling, but also to evaluate differences in their performance based on cost and time of execution in comparison to traditional sampling approaches. The performance of each protocol was measured following successful DNA isolation, molecular sex determination and sequencing of a mitochondrial DNA fragment (control region). Protocols using plucked hair, urine and buccal swab samples proved effective for collection from individuals in captivity, whereas scat was most applicable for non-invasive sampling in the wild. Furthermore, following a pilot study on scat samples, DNA was found to be viable for genetic analysis after exposure to ambient conditions for up to four weeks. This study provides a useful assessment of the suitability of various minimal and non-invasively collected samples for DNA isolation, amplification and mitochondrial sequencing, enabling the effective design of future sampling strategies and a significant increase of samples available for genetic analysis of pinnipeds.  aPublisher supplied data  aSPU G07-2017cNational Parks and Wildlife Service 3aDNA fragmentation 3aHalichoerus grypus 3aPhoca vitulina 3ablood 3acaptive animals 3aconservation genetics 3afeces 3agenetic analysis 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3aprotected species 3aprotocols 3asex determination 3aurine1 aMurphy, Sinéad,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3810-64391 aÓ Cadhla, Oliver,1 aBarnett, James1 aMirimin, Luca1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9601-14570 tConservation genetics resources.g2021 June, v. 13, no. 2 p.131-142dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000001672x1877-72527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12686-020-01182-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02341naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012900171300001600300520091900316592002801235650002001263650001901283650002701302650001801329650001101347650001601358650001401374650002501388650001101413650001601424650002101440650002401461653001901485653002301504653002901527653001801556653002001574700001601594700001701610700002101627700002101648773010601669856008701775852000901862655001201871IND60611591820221117014158.0190409e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061159182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2016.11.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Jong-Min10aEstimating total lipid content of Camelina sativa via pyrolysis assisted in-situ transesterification with dimethyl carbonate  ap. 121-126.  aDirect derivatization of C. sativa seed into FAMEs without lipid extraction was conducted for the quantification of lipid analysis via in-situ thermal methylation with dimethyl carbonate as an acyl acceptor on silica (SiO2). The introduced method had an extraordinarily high tolerance against impurities such as pyrolytic products and moisture. To ensure the technical completeness of in-situ methylation, thermal cracking of FAMEs transformed from C. sativa seed was also explored. Thermal cracking of unsaturated FAMEs such as C18:1, C18:2, C18:3 and C20:1 occurred at temperatures higher than 365°C due to their thermal instability. Thus, experimental findings in this study suggests not only that qualitative analysis of fatty acid profile in C. sativa seed via in-situ methylation using SiO2 could be achieve, but also that the total lipid content (42.65wt.%) in C. sativa seed could be accurately estimated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamelina sativa 3aderivatization 3afatty acid composition 3alipid content 3alipids 3amethylation 3apyrolysis 3aqualitative analysis 3asilica 3atemperature 3athermal cracking 3atransesterification 0aDerivatization 0aDimethyl carbonate 0aFatty acid methyl esters 0aTriglycerides 0aCamelina sativa1 aLee, Jechan1 aOh, Jeong-Ik1 aKim, Hyung Wook,1 aKwon, Eilhann E.0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Feb., v. 225 p.121-126dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2016.11.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245010500166300002000271520145900291592002801750650002201778650001901800650002201819650001701841650002101858650001101879650002301890650002501913650001301938650001901951700003201970700002202002773012302024856008202147852000902229655001202238IND60560670920221119110417.0170105e20150820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056067092DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b039702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonhemi, Hassan10aEffects of Natural Osmolytes on the Protein Structure in Supercritical CO2: Molecular Level Evidence  ap. 10406-10416.  aProtein instability in supercritical CO₂ limits the application of this green solvent in enzyme-catalyzed reactions. CO₂ molecules act as a protein denaturant at high pressure under supercritical conditions. Here, for the first time, we show that natural osmolytes could stabilize protein conformation in supercritical CO₂. Molecular dynamics simulation is used to monitor the effects of adding different natural osmolytes on the conformation and dynamics of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) in supercritical CO₂. Simulations showed that CI2 is denatured at 200 bar in supercritical CO₂, which is in agreement with experimental observations. Interestingly, the protein conformation remains native after addition of ∼1 M amino acid- and sugar-based osmolyte models. These molecules stabilize protein through the formation of supramolecular self-assemblies resulting from macromolecule–osmolyte hydrogen bonds. Nevertheless, trimethylamine N-oxide, which is known as a potent osmolyte for protein stabilization in aqueous solutions, amplifies protein denaturation in supercritical CO₂. On the basis of our structural analysis, we introduce a new mechanism for the osmolyte effect in supercritical CO₂, an “inclusion mechanism”. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that introduces the application of natural osmolytes in a supercritical fluid and describes mechanistic insights into osmolyte action in nonaqueous media.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical elements 3achymotrypsin 3ahydrogen bonding 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3aprotein denaturation 3asolvents 3atrimethylamine1 aHousaindokht, Mohammad Reza1 aNakhaei Pour, Ali0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2015 Aug. 20, v. 119, no. 33 p.10406-10416dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.5b039703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03116naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001100151245012500162300001600287520169500303592002801998650001902026650001702045650002002062650001602082650001102098650002402109650001702133650002902150650002202179650001702201651001002218653007102228653001502299653001602314653003002330653001002360700001702370700001602387700001502403700001902418700001402437773010002451856008602551852000902637655001202646IND60564759520221120103545.0190412e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056475952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.03.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Ge14aThe elasticity of the potential of emission reduction to energy saving: Definition, measurement, and evidence from China  ap. 395-404.  aBased on energy and CO2 emission efficiencies, this paper proposes a definition of the elasticity of the potential of emission reduction to energy saving (Eperes), and measures the elasticity in China’s 30 provincial regions. Although Eperes is a relative definition, it can be used (1) to measure the amount of reduced CO2 emissions per unit fossil energy saving, (2) to reflect the effectiveness of fossil energy saving for CO2 emission reduction in different regions, and (3) to provide decision-making criteria for selecting pathways for emission reductions in different regions. The results show that compared with energy saving, emission reduction is a more serious issue in China. This indicates that energy saving policies have been highly effective since their implementation during the 11th “Five-Year Plan”. With respect to provincial disparities, the emission reductions caused by fossil energy saving are not significant in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong. Fujian province has significant Eperes, indicating that emission reduction causing by fossil energy saving is effective. Eperes has been increasing over time in Hunan and Hubei. Hainan’s Eperes has remained less than 1, indicating that its emission-reduction effect of fossil energy saving is worse than in other provinces. Moreover, the elasticity of Eastern China is greater than that of Central China and Western China. This finding sheds light on pathway selection for energy saving and emission reduction in China: it would be more appropriate to encourage fossil energy saving in Eastern China, and to promote clean energy use (e.g., water electricity and solar energy) in Central China and Western China.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aclean energy 3adecision making 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3afossil fuels 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aissues and policy 3asolar energy 3aChina 0aElasticity of the potential of emission reduction to energy saving 0aDefinition 0aMeasurement 0aData envelopment analysis 0aChina1 aMiao, Zhuang1 aShao, Shuai1 aGeng, Yong1 aSheng, Jichuan1 aLi, Dejia0 tEcological indicators.g2017 July, v. 78 p.395-404dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.03.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01292naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245018200160300001800342520025000360592002800610650002300638650002000661650001400681650002300695650002000718700002100738700002100759773012900780856007200909852000900981655001200990IND60657293220221119065758.0190816e20021021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065729322DNAL7 a10.1039/b206751j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoskovic, Colette12aA new synthetic method to Mn carboxylate clusters: reductive fragmentation of [Mn₁₂O₁₂(O₂CR)₁₆(H₂O)₄] to [Mn₈O₂(O₂CR)₁₄(RCO₂H)₄] (R = CH₂Buᵗ)  ap. 2502-2503.  aThe reaction of [Mn₁₂O₁₂(O₂CCH₂Buᵗ)₁₆(H₂O)₄] (1) with a reducing agent followed by recrystallization from CH₂Cl₂/MeNO₂ affords the novel octanuclear complex [Mn₈O₂(O₂CCH₂Buᵗ)₁₄(BuᵗCH₂CO₂H)₄] (2).  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3acrystallization 3amanganese 3amethylene chloride 3areducing agents1 aHuffman, John C.1 aChristou, George0 tChemical communications.g2002 Oct. 21, , no. 21 p.2502-2503dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b206751j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011000166300001800276520165500294592002801949650001601977650001601993650001002009650001402019650002802033650002702061650003102088650001102119650001302130650002502143650001402168650001502182650002702197650002702224650001402251650001102265650000902276650001702285653001002302653002302312653001602335653002602351653002402377700001702401700001802418773011202436856005102548852000902599655001202608IND50086070620221121002602.0140412e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008607062DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2013.7806122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Xinkai10aMorphological and physiological responses of winter wheat seedlings to nitrogen and phosphorus deficiency  ap. 1234-1246.  aNitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deficiencies are major yield limiting factors in many parts of the world. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to study the effects of both N and P deficiency on morphological and physiological responses of wheat cultivars with and without purple coleoptiles in three types of soils. Before the 3-leaf stage, cultivar ‘Jagger’ with greenish coleoptile showed typical green color in leaves even if grown in soils known to be deficient in N and P. After 3-leaf stage, however, ‘Jagger’ grown in the same soils exhibited purple on leaves, which was considered a typical symptom of P deficiency. Before 3-leaf stage, cultivar ‘2174’ with purplish coleoptile showed purple on the tips of leaves even if grown in a soil not deficient in P, indicating that the leaf purple color is genetically controlled. Pre-plant P but not N fertilizer application could alleviate the purple severity of young seedlings (before 3 leaf stage). Top-dressing N fertilizer could alleviate the purple severity, but top-dressing P fertilizer could enable the severe purple leaves to return green at older seedlings (5–6 leaf stage), indicating that N and P had different effects on the morphological phenotype. There was a correlation between the purple severity and leaf chlorophyll readings, and N and P accumulation. The various responses of the cultivars to N and P deficiency resulted in significant differences in tiller occurrence and shoot and root dry matter production. Purple coloration is not only a visible symptom due to P deficiency but also a phenotype that can be used to diagnose N deficiency in wheat seedlings.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3acoleoptiles 3acolor 3acultivars 3adry matter accumulation 3afertilizer application 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aphenotype 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aphysiological response 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asoil 3awinter wheat 0awheat 0apurple coleoptiles 0apurple leaf 0aphosphorus deficiency 0anitrogen deficiency1 aYan, Liuling1 aZhang, Hailin0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2013 Jan. 1, v. 36, no. 8 p.1234-1246dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2013.780612  aDNAL 7aarticle02035naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245015200170300001600322520068800338592002801026650001601054650002501070650001801095650002001113650001301133650001801146650002101164650002101185650001001206650002501216653001701241653002501258653002501283653001901308700002001327700001701347700001701364700001801381773010601399856008701505852000901592655001201601IND60611591920221117014054.0190409e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061159192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2016.11.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Bo-Yang10aFractionation of rapeseed straw by hydrothermal/dilute acid pretreatment combined with alkali post-treatment for improving its enzymatic hydrolysis  ap. 127-133.  aThe aim of the research was to evaluate the effect of combined treatments on fermentable sugar production from rapeseed straw.

GWQIs are plagued by discrete values which are attributed to excellent, good, poor, very poor, and unsuitable for drinking purpose classes. Furthermore, the existence of chemical parameters with low weights but high concentration values (or vice versa) reduces equilibrium of evaluations. Based on the literature review, MCDMs have not been applied so far to validate groundwater quality indexes. This simple yet practical structure assists the analysts to investigate robustness of a water quality index. In order to validate the classes, the intervals of classic GWQI were modified to figure out what changes were made to the classes of samples in the ranking table considering quality of 92 wells in the Varamin plain, Iran. After employment of the MCDMs, the results revealed that WQI could rarely evaluate water quality classes accurately. Several wells which were classified as “excellent quality” were belonged to the lower quality class. It also came true for other classes. The results demonstrated that TOPSIS could present a more precise analysis for the classes with a low number of wells. Moreover, increases in value of the sensitivity parameter of CP technique reduced the accuracy of results. Owing to proper application of MCDMs, one can suggest the use and development of MCDM-based water quality assessment models for future researches.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrinking 3amodels 3amulti-criteria decision making 3awater quality 3awells 3aIran 0aGroundwater 0aMulti Criteria Decision Making 0aWater Quality Index (WQI) 0aArid region 0aDrinking purpose1 aAzarnivand, Ali1 aChitsaz, Nastaran0 tEcological indicators.g2017 July, v. 78 p.243-252dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.03.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245015000173300001400323500001500337520146300352592002801815650002001843650001701863650001301880650000801893650001301901650002601914650001801940650002501958650001901983650001002002650001202012653002402024653001502048653001502063653002202078653001102100653001802111700001502129700001502144700001702159700001502176700001602191700001702207773012002224856008802344852000902432655001202441IND60563849020221119190053.0190318e20170528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056384902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.02.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhenzhen10aValidation and in situ application of a modified thermal dissipation probe for evaluating standing water use of a clumped bamboo: Bambusa chungii  ap. 15-23.  a2019-12-06  aTo assess the water use of a clumped bamboo species, Bambusa chungii, we modified original 20mm long thermal dissipation probes (TDPs) by shortening each prototypical probe to 5mm in length. Before applying the modified TDPs in the field, we calibrated the measured sap flow (JS) against gravimetric measurements (Jg) with a cut experiment with B. chungii culm and corrected JS derived transpiration with actual water loss from a pot experiment under outdoor conditions. The validated TDP underestimated JS by 27.5% compared with the actual water loss from the pot. The optimal sample sizes of JS and culm area (AC) were evaluated to be 17 and 8 with random sampling, respectively. Meanwhile, the former was shown to be a lower value based on the stratified method (n=15), mirroring the age effect on the JS variances. As a result, the annual stand transpiration for three clumps during the field experiment (January 2014–December 2014) was 397.0mm with an error of 7.77% (considering the individual variance of JS and AC) when all of the sample culms (n=45) were pooled together. This transpiration value was lower than that of a native broadleaf species Schima superba stand (461mm) and higher than a widely planted Eucalyptus urophylla stand (327.4mm) that grew nearby when the same microclimatic conditions were assumed. However, the unlimited transpiration with increased VPD indicated the potentially increased pressure on the regional water balance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBambusa chungii 3amicroclimate 3avariance 3aage 3asap flow 3afield experimentation 3atranspiration 3aEucalyptus urophylla 3aSchima superba 3aculms 3abamboos 0aCarbon assimilation 0aSenescence 0aTDP method 0aHydraulic balance 0aBamboo 0awater balance1 aZhou, Juan1 aZhao, Ping1 aZhao, Xiuhua1 aZhu, Liwei1 aOuyang, Lei1 aNi, Guangyan0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2017 May 28, v. 239 p.15-23dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.02.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100002200159245014700181520111200328592002801440650003001468650002101498650001901519650001201538650002201550650001501572650001301587650001301600650001701613650001601630653003001646653004901676653001501725653002601740653001801766653003601784700001601820700002001836773011401856856009401970852000902064655001202073IND60751845320221120094532.0211030e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075184532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2021.1097192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKomiyama, Katsuya10aEffect of morphology and molecular orientation on environmental water biodegradability of poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-(R)-3-hydroxyvalerate]  aThe biodegradation behaviors of several forms of poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-(R)-3-hydroxyvalerate] (P(3HB-co-3HV)) in seawater and freshwater, namely, powder, cast film, undrawn fiber, and fivefold-drawn fiber, were analyzed via biochemical oxygen demand, weight loss, and scanning electron microscopy measurements. The powder showed the highest degradation rate, attributed to its larger surface area, which allows microorganisms to attach to the surface and form a biofilm that begins to degrade sooner. The fivefold-drawn fibers degraded more slowly than the undrawn fibers owing to the higher crystallinity caused by the orientation of the former. Moreover, the degradation results of the fivefold-drawn fibers in seawater and freshwater showed that the degradation rate depended on the number of microorganisms in both environmental water types. The analysis of the degradation behavior in the freshwater revealed that the crystalline and amorphous phases in the film degraded simultaneously, whereas the degradation of the fibers started from the amorphous phase, followed by the crystalline phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abiodegradability 3abiodegradation 3abiofilm 3acrystal structure 3afreshwater 3apolymers 3aseawater 3asurface area 3aweight loss 0aEnvironmental degradation 0aPoly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) 0aMorphology 0aMolecular orientation 0aCrystallinity 0aBiochemical oxygen demand (BOD)1 aOmura, Taku1 aIwata, Tadahisa0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2021 Nov., v. 193 p.109719-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2021.1097193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02091naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005600146245008100202300002000283500001900303520098800322592002801310650002201338650001701360650002101377650001101398650001701409700005601426700006801482773013801550856008001688852000901768655001201777IND60704301420221119234228.0200723e20200703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070430142DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c052682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Menglu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0052-931010aSize Distribution Effects on Mobility and Intraband Gap of HgSe Quantum Dots  ap. 16216-16221.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this work, we investigate the effect of size distribution on the mobility, the conductivity gap, and the intraband photoconduction of HgSe colloidal quantum dots (CQDs). Using electrochemistry, we measure the mobility for a series of ethandithiol cross-linked n-doped HgSe quantum dot films with different size distribution but a similar average size. The results show that mobility is exponentially dependent on size dispersion. This is interpreted as the size dispersion causing an increase in the average activation energy for hopping transport and the effect is reproduced by a model and a simulation. Comparing with the interband HgTe where the optical gap is between the valence and the conduction band, the conductivity gap in n-doped HgSe between the 1Se and 1Pe states is more strongly softened by the size distribution. This harms the intraband photoconductive properties and it implies that improved size distribution will be needed when using intraband photodetectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acrosslinking 3aelectrochemistry 3amodels 3aquantum dots1 aShen, Guohua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1734-06611 aGuyot-Sionnest, Philippe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0178-62550 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 July 03, v. 124, no. 29 p.16216-16221dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c052683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245018200158300001600340500001900356520131300375592002801688650001801716650001601734650002101750650002001771650001201791650001801803650002101821650002201842650002101864650002101885653001401906653001301920653002701933653002001960700002101980700001802001700002202019700002102041773018202062856007402244852000902318655001202327IND60691792720221123032944.0200502e19990101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069179272DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.63.1042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTSUZUKI, Aiko10aIncrease of Hematopoietic Responses by Triple or Single Helical Conformer of an Antitumor (1→3)-β-D-Glucan Preparation, Sonifilan, in Cyclophosphamide-induced Leukopenic Mice  ap. 104-110.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIt has been suggested that the immunopharmacological activity of soluble (1→3)-β-D-glucan depends on its conformation in mice. In this study, we examined the relationship between the conformation of Sonifilan (SPG) and hematopietic responses in cyclophosphamide (Cy)-induced leukopenic mice. SPG, a high molecular weight (1→3)-β-D-glucan, has a triple helical conformation in water, and it was changed by treatment with aqueous sodium hydroxide to the single helical conformer (SPG-OH). The effects of SPG or SPG-OH on hematopoietic responses in cyclophosphamide induced leukopenic mice were investigated by monitoring i) gene expression of cytokines by RT-PCR, ii) protein synthesis of interleukin 6 (IL-6) by ELISA and iii) colony formation of bone marrow cells (BMC). The mice administered Cy and SPG or SPG-OH expressed and produced higher levels of IL-6 mRNA and protein than the mice administered only Cy. Gene expression of NK1.1 was also induced by Cy/SPG (or SPG-OH) treatment. Induced gene expression of stem cell factor (SCF) and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) by SPG/SPG-OH were also found in in vitro culture of BMC from Cy treated mice. These results strongly suggested that conformation of the glucans, single and triple helix, are independent of the hematopietic response.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3abone marrow 3acyclophosphamide 3agene expression 3aglucans 3ainterleukin-6 3amolecular weight 3aprotein synthesis 3asodium hydroxide 3astem cell factor 0aβ-glucan 0acytokine 0ahematopoietic response 0atransplantation1 aTATEISHI, Tomoko1 aOHNO, Naohito1 aADACHI, Yoshiyuki1 aYADOMAE, Toshiro0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g1999 Jan. 1, v. 63, no. 1 p.104-110dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.63.1043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03918naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006600153245006700219520214100286592002802427650001202455650001802467650001302485650001102498650001602509650001402525650002402539650002202563650001602585650001602601650001602617650001302633650001702646650001802663650001902681650001402700650001902714650002802733650003802761650002502799650002502824653001902849653002802868653001902896653002802915653002402943700001502967700001602982700001602998700002403014700002003038700002103058700002103079773011903100856008803219852000903307655001203316IND60792343620221119083456.0220914e20221215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079234362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1583522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgathokleous, Evgenios1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0058-485710aMechanisms of cerium-induced stress in plants: A meta-analysis  aA comprehensive evaluation of the effects of cerium on plants is lacking even though cerium is extensively applied to the environment. Here, the effects of cerium on plants were meta-analyzed using a newly developed database consisting of approximately 8500 entries of published data. Cerium affects plants by acting as oxidative stressor causing hormesis, with positive effects at low concentrations and adverse effects at high doses. Production of reactive oxygen species and its linked induction of antioxidant enzymes (e.g. catalase and superoxide dismutase) and non-enzymatic antioxidants (e.g. glutathione) are major mechanisms driving plant response mechanisms. Cerium also affects redox signaling, as indicated by altered GSH/GSSG redox pair, and electrolyte leakage, Ca²⁺, K⁺, and K⁺/Na⁺, indicating an important role of K⁺ and Na⁺ homeostasis in cerium-induced stress and altered mineral (ion) balance. The responses of the plants to cerium are further extended to photosynthesis rate (A), stomatal conductance (gₛ), photosynthetic efficiency of PSII, electron transport rate, and quantum yield of PSII. However, photosynthesis response is regulated not only by physiological controls (e.g. gₛ), but also by biochemical controls, such as via changed Hill reaction and RuBisCO carboxylation. Cerium concentrations <0.1–25 mg L⁻¹ commonly enhance chlorophyll a and b, gₛ, A, and plant biomass, whereas concentrations >50 mg L⁻¹ suppress such fitness-critical traits at trait-specific concentrations. There was no evidence that cerium enhances yields. Observations were lacking for yield response to low concentrations of cerium, whereas concentrations >50 mg Kg⁻¹ suppress yields, in line with the response of chlorophyll a and b. Cerium affects the uptake and tissue concentrations of several micro- and macro-nutrients, including heavy metals. This study enlightens the understanding of some mechanisms underlying plant responses to cerium and provides critical information that can pave the way to reducing the cerium load in the environment and its associated ecological and human health risks.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acarboxylation 3acatalase 3acerium 3achlorophyll 3adatabases 3aelectrolyte leakage 3aelectron transfer 3aenvironment 3aglutathione 3ahomeostasis 3ahormesis 3ahuman health 3ameta-analysis 3aphotosystem II 3aphytomass 3aplant response 3areactive oxygen species 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3astomatal conductance 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aCerium effects 0aEnvironmental pollution 0aNanotechnology 0aPlant stress mechanisms 0aRare earth elements1 aZhou, Boya1 aGeng, Caiyu1 aXu, Jianing1 aSaitanis, Costas J.1 aFeng, Zhaozhong1 aTack, Filip M.G.1 aRinklebe, Jörg,0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Dec. 15, v. 852 p.158352-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1583523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02886naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245008500172300001600257520133200273592002801605650001401633650001501647650002401662650001501686650001501701650001801716650002301734650002001757650001401777650000901791650001101800650001201811650001101823650000701834650003401841650001601875650001601891653002901907653001601936653001401952653003801966653003702004653002202041700005802063700005702121773009102178856009002269852000902359655001202368IND60645439520221120090020.0200210e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064543952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.05.1872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jiwei,10aPersistent organic pollutant lindane degradation by alkaline cold-brew green tea  ap. 281-286.  aThe environmental persistence of hazardous organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) such as lindane has resulted in a need for the development of reliable remediation technology for the removal of OCPs. Green tea extract/Fe²⁺ under alkaline conditions is a potential green chemistry technology proven to be effective in reducing lindane. This study investigated the feasibility of directly using green tea leaves (GT-leaf) or cold-brew tea solution (GT-sol) with Fe²⁺ additives at (bi)carbonate buffered pH 10 to treat lindane in the aqueous phase. The polyphenol was gradually released in the GT-leaf system and reached a similar concentration as that in the GT-sol system (∼800 mg L⁻¹ at pH 6.5). Based on the analytical results of lindane degradation byproducts, it was recognized that the reductive mechanism acts as a major pathway and alkaline hydrolysis is a minor pathway. However, physical adsorption rapidly removes lindane from the GT-leaf system. A comprehensive evaluation of lindane degradation, chlorobenzene formation, degradation kinetics, and chloride liberation were conducted for the alkaline GT-sol/Fe²⁺ system. The nonlinear simulations of the models developed showed good fits, with R² > 0.96.

Deoxynivalenol (DON) is the most important Fusarium toxin in Swedish wheat and has previously been shown to be produced mainly by Fusarium graminearum. However, less is known about the co-occurrence of DON and F. graminearum with other toxins and Fusarium species in Sweden.This study examined the distribution of the most important toxigenic Fusarium species and their toxins in winter wheat (2009 and 2011) and spring wheat (2010 and 2011). DNA from seven species was quantified with qPCR and the toxin levels were quantified with a multitoxin analysis method based on liquid chromatography/electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS/MS). The method enabled detection of many fungal metabolites, including DON, zearalenone (ZEA), nivalenol (NIV), T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxins, moniliformin (MON), beauvericin (BEA), and enniatins (ENNs).It was found that Fusarium poae and Fusarium avenaceum were present in almost all samples. Other common Fusarium species were F. graminearum and F. culmorum, present in more than 70% of samples. Several species occurred at lower DNA levels in 2011 than in other years, but the reverse was true for F. graminearum and Fusarium langsethiae. The most prevalent toxins were ENNs, present in 100% of samples. DON was also common, especially in spring wheat, whereas ZEA and NIV were common in 2009 and in winter wheat, but less common in 2011 and in spring wheat. Only three samples of spring wheat contained T-2 or HT-2 above LOQ. Annual mean levels of several mycotoxins were significantly lower in 2011 than in other years, but the reverse applied for DON.The strongest correlations between mycotoxin and Fusarium DNA levels were found between F. avenaceum and ENNs (r2=0.67) and MON (r2=0.62), and F. graminearum and DON (r2=0.74).These results show that several Fusarium species and toxins co-occur in wheat. The highest toxin levels were detected in spring wheat and DON and ENNs, the latter belonging to the group of so called “emerging toxins”, which were the most prevalent toxins and those occurring at the highest levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3awinter wheat 3aFusarium graminearum 3aT-2 toxin 3asampling 3ahumans 3aDNA 3aFusarium avenaceum 3aspring wheat 3azearalenone 3amass spectrometry 3anivalenol 3aFusarium poae 3aliquid chromatography 3adeoxynivalenol 3ametabolites 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aCyclobutanesxisolation & purification 2aDNA, Fungalxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aDepsipeptidesxisolation & purification 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFusariumxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aT-2 Toxinxanalogs & derivativesxisolation & purification. 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 2aTrichothecenesxisolation & purification 2aTriticumxmicrobiology 2aZearalenonexisolation & purification 0aSweden 0aFusarium graminearum 0aGibberella avenacea 0aGibberella zeae 0aFusarium tricinctum 0aBeauvericin 0aqPCR 0aEnniatins1 aGidlund, Ann1 aSulyok, Michael1 aBörjesson, Thomas1 aKrska, R.q(Rudolf),1 aOlsen, M.q(Monica),1 aFredlund, Elisabeth0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2013 Oct. 15, v. 167, no. 2 p.284-291dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2013.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245014300162300001200305520122200317592002801539650002101567650001301588650001201601650001201613650001401625650001301639650001801652650001401670650000901684650000901693650001901702650003701721700001301758773010501771856008301876852000901959655001201968IND60784332320221121070434.0221005e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078433232DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-022-03741-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Yan10aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi reduce potassium, cadmium and ammonium losses but increases nitrate loss under high intensity leaching events  ap. 365.  aBACKGROUND: Nutrients and heavy metals can be lost from soils via leaching, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can influence these events. Soil column experiments were carried out to examine whether leaching intensity and AMF can alter nutrient and Cd uptake in white clover plants and the extent of their losses through leaching. RESULTS: The presence of AMF significantly increased shoot and total biomass, as well as increased N, P, Cu and Zn uptake independent of water amount applied; while root P and Cu uptakes were promoted by AMF at any water amount treatments. Higher water amounts led to reductions in total N, K and Zn uptake for AMF-colonized plants in comparison to moderate water amount treatments. In the absence of AMF, white clover at low water amount treatment exhibited maximal root Cd uptake. At high water amount treatments, the presence of AMF significantly decreased leachate volumes and the amount of leached NH₄⁺, K and Cd while AMF significantly increased the amounts of leached NO₃⁻. CONCLUSIONS: Overall we found that AMF-colonized white clover plants reduced NH₄⁺, K and Cd loss from soils but increased the risk of NO₃⁻ loss under high intensity leaching conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrifolium repens 3aammonium 3abiomass 3acadmium 3aleachates 3anitrates 3aplant biology 3apotassium 3arisk 3asoil 3atotal nitrogen 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aChen, Lu0 tBMC plant biology.g2022 Dec., v. 22, no. 1 p.365-365dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-022-03741-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03397naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009400171300001600265520177700281592002802058650001902086650001702105650000902122650001902131650001802150650001002168650001102178650001202189650001302201650001402214650001102228650002402239650001202263650001602275650001102291650001702302650001802319650001802337650001902355650002302374650002402397650001802421650001602439650001502455650001002470650001402480651001002494651001802504700002002522700001902542700001602561700001302577700001702590773008202607856008502689852000902774655001202783IND60088656920221118014035.0141102e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008865692DNAL7 a10.1016/S1002-0160(12)60026-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCHUAI, Xiao-Wei10aSpatial Variability of Soil Organic Carbon and Related Factors in Jiangsu Province, China  ap. 404-414.  aSoil organic carbon (SOC) plays a key role in the global carbon cycle. In this study, we used statistical and geostatistical methods to characterize and compare the spatial heterogeneity of SOC in soils of Jiangsu Province, China, and investigate the factors that influence it, such as topography, soil type, and land use. Our study was based on 24 186 soil samples obtained from the surface soil layer (0–0.2 m) and covering the entire area of the province. Interpolated values of SOC density in the surface layer, obtained by kriging based on a spherical model, rang ed between 3.25 and 32.43 kg m⁻³. The highest SOC densities tended to occur in the Taihu Plain, Lixia River Plain, along the Yangtze River, and in high-elevation hilly areas such as those in northern and southwest Jiangsu, while the lowest values were found in the coastal plain. Elevation, slope, soil type, and land use type significantly affected SOC densities. Steeper slope tended to result in SOC decline. Correlation between elevation and SOC densities was positive in the hill areas but negative in the low plain areas, probably due to the effect of different land cover types, temperature, and soil fertility. High SOC densities were usually found in limestone and paddy soils and low densities in coastal saline soils and alluvial soils, indicating that high clay and silt contents in the soils could lead to an increase, and high sand content to a decrease in the accumulation of SOC. SOC densities were sensitive to land use and usually increased in towns, woodland, paddy land, and shallow water areas, which were strongly affected by industrial and human activities, covered with highly productive vegetation, or subject to long-term use of organic fertilizers or flooding conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalluvial soils 3acarbon cycle 3aclay 3acoastal plains 3ageostatistics 3ahills 3ahumans 3akriging 3aland use 3alimestone 3amodels 3aorganic fertilizers 3apaddies 3apaddy soils 3arivers 3asaline soils 3asand fraction 3asilt fraction 3asoil fertility 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil sampling 3atemperature 3atopography 3atowns 3awoodlands 3aChina 3aYangtze River1 aHUANG, Xian-Jin1 aWANG, Wan-Jing1 aZhang, Mei,1 aLai, Li,1 aLIAO, Qi-Lin0 tPedosphere.g2012 June, v. 22, no. 3 p.404-414dElsevier Ltdx1002-01607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(12)60026-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01646naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245013100201300001800332506007600350520030800426592002800734506003700762650001100799650001200810650001400822650002600836650001500862650002100877700002600898700001900924700001400943700002300957700001500980700001600995773014201011856007401153852000901227655001201236IND60642413120221207074546.0190507e20160413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064241312DNAL7 a10.1039/c6tb00021e2doi7 aPMC49509972pmcid7 a274537812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassanzadeh, P.10aUltrastrong and flexible hybrid hydrogels based on solution self-assembly of chitin nanofibers in gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA)  ap. 2539-2543.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe demonstrate the formation of ultrastrong and flexible hydrogels via self-assembly of chitin nanofibers in the presence of gelatin methacryloyl.

The aim of this work is to evaluate the free radical scavenging capacity of methanolic extracts from marine fungi and their relationship to their total phenolic content. For this, the radical tests ABTS, DPPH, and Galvinoxyl were used, comparing these results with the antioxidant Trolox as reference. The total phenol content was quantified using the Folin-Ciocalteu method. All data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc tests (p < 0.001).The results indicate that Fusarium oxysporum broth extract (Apl) showed a greater capacity for free radical scavenging when compared with the Trolox standard (128% ABTS) as well as the biomass extract of Cladosporium cladosporioides (A.c) with values of (107 % ABTS and 102% Galvinoxyl). In addition, the variation found in the total phenolic content for each bioactive extract suggests that their antioxidant activity is not exclusively related to phenolic compounds and hence might be attributed to other types of metabolites.This work is the first to report the antioxidant capacity of marine fungi isolated from sponges and corals in Mexico.

Fusca) in Relation to Clam Density: Inferring Food Availability and Habitat Quality  ap. 149-157.  aBirds are known to modify their foraging behavior in relation to food availability. Once understood, these relationships can be used to draw inferences about relative food availability and habitat quality. We measured foraging behavior of Surf Scoters (Melanitta perspicillata) and White-winged Scoters (M. fusca) feeding on clams during winter in the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, to evaluate the relative quality of the foraging landscape for wintering scoters. Because clam biomass does not increase appreciably during winter through growth or recruitment, scoters are faced with a depleting and potentially exhaustible food supply. Along with this temporal variation, clam densities vary widely by site. We considered the influence of variation in clam density on scoter foraging behavior, along with other factors known to affect foraging in other sea duck species, such as season, sex, age, and environmental attributes. Clam-capture success (clams captured per dive) and foraging effort (minutes underwater per hour) of Surf Scoters were not related to variation in clam density. Clam-capture success of White-winged Scoters was unrelated to clam density; however, their foraging effort was negatively related to clam density, though varying by only 4 min across the range of observed clam densities. For both species, foraging behavior was generally more strongly related to other factors, especially seasonal and age effects. These results suggest that (1) observed variation in clam density was relatively minor from the perspective of foraging scoters and (2) our study site constituted high-quality winter habitat in which scoters were not constrained by food availability.Comportamiento de Forrajeo de Melanitta perspicillata y M. fusca con Relacióón a la Densidad de Almejas: Inferencias sobre la Disponibilidad de Alimento y la Calidad del Háábitat  aPublisher supplied data 0aclam density 0afood availability 0aMelanitta fusca 0aM. perspicillata 0ascoter foraging behavior 0asea duck 0aSurf Scoter 0aWhite-winged Scoter1 aEsler, Danq(Daniel),1 aBoyd, W.

Herein, the microstructures at high pH of several fatty acid soap systems were investigated systematically. We found that palmitic acid/KOH/H₂O, palmitic acid/CsOH/H₂O, stearic acid/KOH/H₂O, and stearic acid/CsOH/H₂O systems can form bilayers at high pH. The bilayer structure was demonstrated by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance (²H NMR), and molecular dynamics simulation was used to confirm the formation of bilayers. The influence of fatty acids with different chain lengths (n = 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18) and different counterions including Li⁺, Na⁺, K⁺, Cs⁺, (CH₃)₄N⁺, (C₂H₅)₄N⁺, (C₃H₇)₄N⁺, and (C₄H₉)₄N⁺ on the formation of bilayers was discussed. The stability of foam and emulsification properties were compared between bilayers and micelles, drawing the conclusion that bilayer structures possess a much stronger ability to foam and stronger emulsification properties than micelles do.  aPublisher supplied data 3acesium 3adeuterium 3aemulsifying properties 3aemulsions 3afoaming 3afoams 3alithium 3amicelles 3amicrostructure 3amolecular dynamics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3apalmitic acid 3apotassium 3asoaps 3asodium 3astable isotopes 3astearic acid 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aZhang, Heng1 aZhong, Yingping1 aJiang, Liwen1 aXu, Mengxin1 aZhu, Xionglu1 aHao, Jingcheng0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2015 Aug. 20, v. 119, no. 33 p.10760-10767dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.5b045533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245012100185300001600306520135000322592002801672650002201700650000801722650001601730650001101746650002101757650003101778650002501809650001401834650001801848650002201866650008501888650002101973650002801994650003702022650002802059650001402087700002102101700001902122700002102141700002302162700002502185773009902210856004802309852000902357655001202366IND4473505520221119145214.0120716e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447350552DNAL7 a225437492pmid7 a10.1007/s10482-012-9742-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamada, Moriyuki10aSediminihabitans luteus gen. nov., sp. nov., a new member of the family Cellulomonadaceae isolated from sea sediment  ap. 325-333.  aTwo novel Gram-positive actinobacteria, designated H97-3T and H83-5, were isolated from marine sediment samples and their taxonomic positions were investigated by a polyphasic approach. Both strains formed vegetative hyphae in the early phase of growth but the hyphae eventually fragmented into coccoid cells. The peptidoglycan type was found to be A4α. The predominant menaquinone was MK-9(H4), and the major fatty acids were anteiso-C15:0, anteiso-C17:0 and C16:0. The DNA G+C content was 74.0–74.9 mol %. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis revealed that strains H97-3T and H83-5 represented novel members of the family Cellulomonadaceae. Their nearest phylogenetic neighbours were the members of the genus Oerskovia, with a similarity of 98.3–98.4 %. However, strains H97-3T and H83-5 were distinguishable from the members of the genus Oerskovia and the other genera of the family Cellulomonadaceae in terms of chemotaxonomic characteristics and phylogenetic relationship. The result of the DNA–DNA hybridization indicated that strains H97-3T and H83-5 belonged to the same species. Therefore, strains H97-3T and H83-5 represent a novel genus and species of the family Cellulomonadaceae, for which the name Sediminihabitans luteus gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of S. lutes is H97-3T (=NBRC 108568T = DSM 25478T).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCellulomonadaceae 3aDNA 3afatty acids 3ahyphae 3amarine sediments 3anucleic acid hybridization 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 2aActinomycetalesxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aBase Composition 2aFatty Acidsxmetabolism 2aGeologic Sedimentsxmicrobiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny1 aTamura, Tomohiko1 aShibata, Chiyo1 aYamamura, Hideki1 aHayakawa, Masayuki1 aSuzuki, Ken'ichirō,0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2012 Aug., v. 102, no. 2 p.325-333dSpringer-Verlagx0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-012-9742-y  aDNAL 7aarticle03166naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245018000158300002200338520174800360592002802108650002202136650002002158650001702178650003302195650002002228650001002248650004202258650001802300650002602318650001302344650001702357650002902374650004302403650001102446700001802457700001702475700001202492700001802504773012702522856007402649852000902723655001202732IND60641377920221120050143.0190505e20161124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064137792DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra23865c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuanyue10aDeciphering the evolution of the functional genes and microbial community of the combined partial nitritation-anammox process with nitrate build-up and its in situ restoration  ap. 111702-111712.  aThe operation of a combined partial nitritation-anammox (CPNA) process was hampered by the overgrowth of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB), which was then successfully in situ restored by the combination of hydroxylamine (NH₂OH) dosing and sludge retention time (SRT) control. To elucidate the microbial evolution on gene level and the microbial mechanism responding to the NO₃⁻ build-up and in situ restoration in the CPNA process, the qPCR and high-throughput sequencing were used to investigate the evolution of the N-transformation genes and microbial community in this paper. Results showed that the concentrations of amoA and hao were both decreased as well as the hzo along with the NO₃⁻ build-up, however, the nitrite-oxidation encoding gene nxrA was increased. Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated that the gene nxrA was significantly correlated with the NO₃⁻. After restoration, the abundances of amoA, hao and hzo were increased to 26.58%, 43.56% and 26.17%, respectively, while the growth of nxrA was effectively limited. The obtained high abundance of narG gene (37.85%) as well as the significant correlation of hzo–narG and hzo–nirS illustrated the in situ restoring mechanism, i.e., the intensive denitrification of the accumulated NO₃⁻ to NO followed by the stimulation of the anammox by NO. Additionally, MiSeq sequencing showed a new microbial community was rebuilt after restoration and the Haliscomenobacter and Nitrosomonas were the dominant genera. The abundance of anammox genus Candidatus Kuenenia was also increased to 8.0%. The significant correlation between nirK and Ignavibacterium indicated that the filaments played an important role in the denitrification of the accumulated NO₃⁻.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaliscomenobacter 3aIgnavibacterium 3aNitrosomonas 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3adenitrification 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahydroxylamine 3amicrobial communities 3anitrates 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asludge1 aWang, Hongyan1 aZhang, Junya1 aYao, Li1 aWei, Yuansong0 tRSC advances.g2016 Nov. 24, v. 6, no. 113 p.111702-111712dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra23865c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02299naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002600141245007000167300001800237500001900255520096300274592002801237650002901265650001701294650001801311650002701329650001001356650001601366650001201382650001301394650001601407650001301423653001201436653002001448700001601468700002101484700002001505700002101525700001901546700002001565773018401585856007501769852000901844655001201853IND60691793220221121145718.0200502e19990101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069179322DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.63.10752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBHUIYAN, M.

We isolated a number of nystatin-sensitive mutants by ethylmethane sulfonate mutagenesis. One of these mutants, the nss1 mutant, was characterized in detail. The mutant was sensitive to stresses such as high temperature or high concentrations of monovalent and divalent cations. The nss1 mutants showed severe vacuolar protein sorting and vacuolar morphology defects. The nss1 mutant was demonstrated to have a mutational lesion in the known VPS16 gene, which is essential for vacuolar protein sorting in S. cerevisiae. All of the vacuolar deficient mutants (vps11, vps16, vps18, and vps33) were sensitive to nystatin. Nystatin was found to cause extensive enlargement of the vacuole in wild-type S. cerevisiae cells. These results are discussed with special reference to the vacuolar function of S. cerevisiae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abiochemistry 3abiotechnology 3aethyl methanesulfonate 3agenes 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3anystatin 3atemperature 3avacuoles 0avacuole 0aprotein sorting1 aItō, Yuji,1 aNAKAMURA, Atsuko1 aTANAKA, Naotaka1 aFUJITA, Kiyotaka1 aFUKUI, Hiroshi1 aTAKEGAWA, Kaoru0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g1999 Jan. 1, v. 63, no. 6 p.1075-1082dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.63.10753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03505naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012200167300001600289500001900305520198000324592002802304650002802332650001702360650002302377650003302400650001002433650002002443650002402463650003202487650001102519650001802530650001302548650001702561650001402578650002102592650002002613650001402633650001902647700001602666700001802682700002102700700001902721700005902740773012102799856008202920852000903002655001203011IND60734641020221118145220.0210421e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073464102DNAL7 a10.1007/s00299-021-02682-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNandakumar, M.10aRole of miRNAs in the host–pathogen interaction between sugarcane and Colletotrichum falcatum, the red rot pathogen  ap. 851-870.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aKEY MESSAGE: Sugarcane microRNAs specifically involved during compatible and incompatible interactions with red rot pathogen Colletotrichum falcatum were identified. We have identified how the miRNAs regulate their gene targets and elaborated evidently on the underlying molecular mechanism of sugarcane defense response to C. falcatum for the first time. Resistance against the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum falcatum causing red rot is one of the most desirable traits for sustainable crop cultivation in sugarcane. To gain new insight into the host defense mechanism against C. falcatum, we studied the role of sugarcane microRNAs during compatible and incompatible interactions by adopting the NGS platform. We have sequenced a total of 80 miRNA families that comprised 980 miRNAs, and the putative targets of the miRNAs include transcription factors, membrane-bound proteins, glutamate receptor proteins, lignin biosynthesis proteins, signaling cascade proteins, transporter proteins, mitochondrial proteins, ER proteins, defense-related, stress response proteins, translational regulation proteins, cell proliferation, and ubiquitination proteins. Further, qRT-PCR analyses of 8 differentially regulated miRNAs and 26 gene transcript targets expression indicated that these miRNAs have a regulatory effect on the expression of respective target genes in most of the cases. Also, the results suggest that certain miRNA regulates many target genes that are involved in inciting early responses to the pathogen infection, signaling pathways, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and resistance gene activation through feedback response from various cellular processes during the compatible and incompatible interaction with the red rot pathogen C. falcatum.

Seventy hyperprolific sows of a commercial genetic line were selected according to their reproductive history. Sows were assigned to two treatments, no increase of feed (control, 2.4 kg/d of 3.25 Mcal/kg diet) or with increased feed (Bump feeding, 3.0 kg/d) from 81 days of gestation to farrowing with 35 replicates per treatment. No differences were observed for treatments on sow weight, weight gain, piglet birth weight, litter birth weight, coefficient of variation, number of total births, stillbirths, live births, and placental efficiency. The treatments also did not influence the calcium, phosphorus, ash, lactose, crude protein, zinc, ether extract, and crude energy content of the colostrum. Based on the results of the present study, the use of bump feeding in the final phase of gestation of sows becomes questionable, due the lack of effect on sow and litter performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirth weight 3acalcium 3acolostrum 3acrude protein 3adiet 3aenergy content 3agenetic lines 3alactose 3anutritive value 3aphosphorus 3apiglets 3apregnancy 3aweight gain 3azinc 0aNutrition 0aSwine1 ade Oliveira, Rafael Aquino1 aVieira, Maria de Fátima Araújo1 aSilveira, Hebert1 aFonseca, Leonardo da Silva1 aAlves, Laya Kannan Silva1 aGuimarães, Eduarda Buck Bernardes1 aSchinckel, Allan Paul1 aGarbossa, Cesar Augusto Pospissil0 tLivestock science.g2020 Oct., v. 240 p.104184-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2020.1041843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03981naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245010300184300001800287500001500305520174800320592002802068650002802096650002702124650001402151650001402165650001602179650001302195650005202208650000902260650002702269650001602296650001202312650002202324650002602346650002202372650002502394650001002419650001402429650003502443650001202478650001802490650002102508650004502529650003002574650002002604650002202624650001302646650001702659650002002676650002402696650001402720650001402734650003902748650003602787650002302823651001102846651001802857653001002875700002202885700001902907700002102926700002002947700003302967700002203000700002303022773010903045856004803154852000903202655001203211IND4477968620221120213417.0120426e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447796862DNAL7 a223500862pmid7 a10.1007/s00122-012-1807-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZerjal, Tatiana10aMaize genetic diversity and association mapping using transposable element insertion polymorphisms  ap. 1521-1537.  a2019-12-06  aTransposable elements are the major component of the maize genome and presumably highly polymorphic yet they have not been used in population genetics and association analyses. Using the Transposon Display method, we isolated and converted into PCR-based markers 33 Miniature Inverted Repeat Transposable Elements (MITE) polymorphic insertions. These polymorphisms were genotyped on a population-based sample of 26 American landraces for a total of 322 plants. Genetic diversity was high and partitioned within and among landraces. The genetic groups identified using Bayesian clustering were in agreement with published data based on SNPs and SSRs, indicating that MITE polymorphisms reflect maize genetic history. To explore the contribution of MITEs to phenotypic variation, we undertook an association mapping approach in a panel of 367 maize lines phenotyped for 26 traits. We found a highly significant association between the marker ZmV1-9, on chromosome 1, and male flowering time. The variance explained by this association is consistent with a flowering delay of +123 degree-days. This MITE insertion is located at only 289 nucleotides from the 3′ end of a Cytochrome P450-like gene, a region that was never identified in previous association mapping or QTL surveys. Interestingly, we found (i) a non-synonymous mutation located in the exon 2 of the gene in strong linkage disequilibrium with the MITE polymorphism, and (ii) a perfect sequence homology between the MITE sequence and a maize siRNA that could therefore potentially interfere with the expression of the Cytochrome P450-like gene. Those two observations among others offer exciting perspectives to validate functionally the role of this region on phenotypic variation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative trait loci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aflowering 3alandraces 3achromosomes 3avariance 3aminiature inverted repeat transposable elements 3acorn 3alinkage disequilibrium 3anucleotides 3asurveys 3asequence homology 3asmall interfering RNA 3agenetic variation 3aphenotypic variation 3aexons 3aheat sums 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aAlleles 2aBayes Theorem 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aCytochrome P-450 Enzyme Systemxgenetics 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aHeterozygote 2aModels, Genetic 2aModels, Statistical 2aPhenotype 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aPolymorphism, Geneticxgenetics 2aZea maysxgenetics 0aEurope 0aUnited States 0agenes1 aRousselet, Agnès1 aMhiri, Corinne1 aCombes, Valérie1 aMadur, Delphine1 aGrandbastien, Marie-Angèle,1 aCharcosset, Alain1 aTenaillon, Maud I.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2012 May, v. 124, no. 8 p.1521-1537dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-012-1807-9  aDNAL 7aarticle01604naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245016400161300001800325500001900343520033800362592002800700650001300728650001000741650001800751650001600769650002800785650001000813650001200823653001400835653002000849700002100869700001900890700002100909700002000930773018400950856007501134852000901209655001201218IND60691793420221121082957.0200502e19990101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069179342DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.63.10912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTAKASHIMA, Shou10aIsolation and Characterization of the Actin Gene from the Cellulolytic Fungus Humicola grisea and Analysis of Transcription Levels of Actin and Cellulase Genes  ap. 1091-1095.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAn actin gene was isolated from the cellulolytic fungus Humicola grisea.

Several attempts to eradicate this invasive species have been carried out since its spread. In the Iberian Peninsula, an eradication program has started since 2001, as part of the national action plan for the conservation of European mink Mustela lutreola. Proper detection is crucial for management, both for monitoring variation in mink abundance and prevent the recolonization of cleared areas. Mink scats can be confounded with those of several same-sized mustelids, and with the spraints of Eurasian otter Lutra lutra, which also occur along watercourses. However, these difficulties can be overcome by non-invasive genetic methods. With the aim of providing a cost-effective and reliable technique for differentiating mink scats from those of the largest possible number of species with morphologically similar scats, we tested the effectiveness of an already available faecal mtDNA-based PCR–RFLP method for distinguishing mink- and otter faeces. We then applied the method for analysing scats collected and identified in the field by trained surveyors for monitoring the success of mink control operations. The PCR–RFLP method clearly differentiated mink scats from those of otters, as restriction enzymes produced well-defined different patterns. Eighty-five percent of 94 faecal samples could be assigned to a mustelid species. Only three out of seven putative mink samples were confirmed, suggesting that the accuracy of the visual identification of scats is questionable and genetic methods are needed for the reliable assessment of the success of eradication programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLutra lutra 3aMustela lutreola 3aNeovison vison 3aconservation genetics 3acost effectiveness 3afeces 3ainvasive species 3amink 3aIberian Peninsula 3aSpain1 aBalestrieri, Alessandro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5444-28061 aRomán, Loreto García1 aZapata-Perez, Victor Manuel1 aRuiu, Angelo1 aCarcangiu, Laura1 aRobledano Aymerich, Francisco,0 tConservation genetics resources.g2021 June, v. 13, no. 2 p.143-149dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000001672x1877-72527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12686-020-01183-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245006800210300001800278506007600296520145000372592002801822506003701850650002901887650002301916650002401939650002301963650001001986650001801996650001002014650001902024650001102043650002802054650001902082650003402101650001502135650001502150650002302165650002402188650002002212650001102232700002902243700002402272700002302296700002502319773011402344856008102458852000902539655001202548IND60440683220221207063832.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044068322DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-014-1471-y2doi7 aPMC44865312pmcid7 a261399342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrisón, Laura N.10aEffect of different sanitizers against Zygosaccharomyces rouxii  ap. 4619-4624.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMicrobial contamination is a problem in food industry. The effects produced by the metabolic activity of yeasts are diverse. If they are found in high numbers it might affect the organoleptic quality of the product. Zygosaccharomyces is the most frequent contaminant genus in sweetened juices that are not properly processed and stored. The aim of this work was to compare the action of five commercial sanitizers against isolates of Z. rouxii and to determine appropriate concentrations and time of action for the inactivation. Peracetic acid, monochloramine, iodophor and quaternary ammonium compounds were evaluated on different surfaces (stainless steel, plastic and glass) at room temperature for 30 and 60 s. It was possible to achieve a 99.99 of death Efficiency corresponding to 4 log₁₀ of reduction for a contact time of 60 s for 0.5% (v/v) of peracetic acid, monochloramines and 0.5% (w/v) of iodophors, 1% for compound with a base of 8% (v/v) of benzyl chloride and 7.5% (v/v) of glutaraldehyde and 5% for sodium hypochlorite (55 g/L active compound). Stainless steel was successfully sanitized with all the compounds tested, and then it would be the most appropriate for the food industry because this material is also highly resistant to abrasion, to impact and to different chemical treatments. In view of the great variety of sanitizing products, the selection of the best sanitizer will depend on efficiency, safety and cost.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aZygosaccharomyces rouxii 3aactive ingredients 3aambient temperature 3achemical treatment 3adeath 3afood industry 3aglass 3aglutaraldehyde 3ajuices 3amicrobial contamination 3aperacetic acid 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3asanitizers 3asanitizing 3asensory properties 3asodium hypochlorite 3astainless steel 3ayeasts1 aChiericatti, Carolina A.1 aAríngoli, Elena E.1 aBasílico, Juan C.1 aBasílico, María Z.0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2015 July, v. 52, no. 7 p.4619-4624dSpringer Indiax0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-014-1471-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245014000163300001600303500001900319520154600338592002801884650001401912650001001926650001101936650001401947650001401961650001401975650001301989700002002002700002202022773013702044856007302181852000902254655001202263IND60704301820221119234256.0200723e20200519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070430182DNAL7 a10.1643/CE-19-2122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, Thomas L.10aFunctional Responses of Larval Marbled Salamanders (Ambystoma opacum) and Adult Lesser Sirens (Siren intermedia) on Anuran Tadpole Prey  ap. 341-346.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPredation can have strong effects on the structure of pond-breeding amphibian communities. Many factors can influence the outcome of predator–prey interactions, including differences in densities, identities, and body sizes of both predator and prey. These different mediating factors can impart synergistic impacts on predation rates, though distinguishing such interactions among multiple factors are underexplored. We examined whether different body sizes of two predators, larval Marbled Salamanders (Ambystoma opacum) and adult Lesser Sirens (Siren intermedia), varied in their ability to forage on larval anurans across a range of prey densities. We specifically tested whether attack rates and handling times, the two main parameters of functional response models, varied across three size classes in both predator species. We found that larval Marbled Salamanders exhibited a Type II (saturating) functional response and that larger individuals had higher attack rates and shorter handling times, resulting in greater prey mortality at higher prey densities with larger predators. In contrast, Lesser Sirens were largely ineffective predators despite being an order of magnitude larger in body size than Marbled Salamanders; tadpole mortality was largely unrelated to their own density. Predator body size was a significant predictor of prey mortality for both predator species. Overall, our study shows that species identity could be as important as predator body size when predicting the outcomes of predator–prey interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmbystoma 3aAnura 3aadults 3abody size 3amortality 3apredation 3atadpoles1 aStemp, Kenzi M.1 aDavenport, Jon M.0 tCopeia.g2020 May 19, v. 108, no. 2 p.341-346dAmerican Society of Ichthyologists and HerpetologistswJournal:19631x0045-85117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1643/CE-19-2123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03243naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006100155245015100216300001600367520178500383592002802168650001502196650001802211650001202229650001102241650001902252650002602271650001902297650002102316650001502337650001302352650000902365650001602374650001202390653001902402653001902421653001802440653002102458653001202479653000802491700002102499700006302520773009102583856009002674852000902764655001202773IND60645439920221120085902.0200210e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064543992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.05.1922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBordoloi, Achinta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4600-168814aThe impact of environmental parameters on the conversion of toluene to CO2 and extracellular polymeric substances in a differential soil biofilter  ap. 304-314.  aThe fraction of pollutant converted to CO₂ versus biomass in biofiltration influences the process efficacy and the lifetime of the bed due to pressure drop increases. This work determined the relative quantitative importance and potential interactions between three critical environmental parameters: toluene concentration (Tol), matric potential (ψ) and temperature (T) on % CO₂, elimination capacity (EC) and the production rate of non-CO₂ products. These parameters are the most variable in typical biofilter operation. The data was fit to a non-linear model of the form y=a(Tol)bTcψd. A rigorous carbon balance (100.5 ± 7.0%) tracked the fate of degraded toluene as CO₂ and non-CO₂ carbon endpoints. The % CO₂ mineralization varied from (34–91%) with environmental parameters: temperature (20–40 °C), matric potential, (−10 to −100 cmH₂O) and residual toluene, (20–180 ppm). The highest conversion to CO₂ was at the wettest conditions (−10 cmH₂O) and lowest residual toluene concentration (18 ppm). Matric potential had twice the impact of toluene concentration on % CO₂, while temperature had less impact. The elimination capacity varied from 11 to 50 gC⋅m⁻³h⁻¹ and was highest at 40 °C, the wettest conditions with limited impact by toluene concentrations. Temperature increased the EC and non-CO₂ production rates strongly while matric potential and toluene concentration had less influence (4x - 10x less). This study illustrated the quantitative significance and simultaneous interaction between critical environmental parameters on carbon endpoints and biofilter performance. This kind of multivariable parameter study provides valuable insights which can address performance and clogging issues in biofilters.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofilters 3abiofiltration 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aenvironmental factors 3amineralization 3anonlinear models 3apollutants 3apolymers 3asoil 3atemperature 3atoluene 0aCarbon balance 0aCO2 end-points 0aBiofiltration 0aMatric potential 0aToluene 0aEPS1 aGapes, Daniel J.1 aGostomski, Peter A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6001-71280 tChemosphere.g2019 Oct., v. 232 p.304-314dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.05.1923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03234naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245012800180500001900308520188300327592002802210650001202238650001502250650001202265650002002277650001802297650001302315650001002328650003002338650001202368650001902380650001002399650001302409650001002422653001202432653002002444653003102464653002002495700002002515700002602535700002002561773010102581856008502682852000902767655001202776IND60706633520221122225205.0201115e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070663352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2020.1041892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBogusławska-Tryk, Monika10aSmall intestine morphology and ileal biogenic amines content in broiler chickens fed diets supplemented with lignocellulose  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIt is well known that nutritional factors, including bioactive substances and fiber fractions, may have an impact on the development, structure and function of the gastrointestinal tract, intestinal microflora composition as well as synthesis of putrefactive compounds, such as ammonia or biogenic amines. The study was conducted to determine the effect of lignocellulose supplemented diet on small intestine morphology and ileal biogenic amines (BA) content in broiler chickens. A total of 48, 21-day-old male Ross 308 chickens were divided into four groups. From 21 to 42 d of age, the broilers were fed experimental diets varied in the amount of lignocellulose: 0, 0.25, 0.5 and 1%. In chickens fed a diet with 0.5% lignocellulose there was shortening of the villi (p<0.05) and shallowing of the crypts in duodenum. In the jejunum, increasing lignocellulose in the diet resulted in a reduction (p<0.05) in the crypt depth (CD) in experimental birds compared to the control group. Elongation of the villi (p<0.05) was observed in the ileum of broilers receiving 0.5 and 1.0% addition of lignocellulose. A gradual, dose-dependent increase in villus height/crypt depth ratio (VH/CD) was observed in all sections of the small intestine. The study showed a significantly higher concentration of spermine and a lower content of cadaverine in the ileal digesta of chickens fed a diet with the addition of lignocellulose 0.5 to 1% compared with control. Changes in intestinal mucosal morphology, reported in the experiment, i.e. mainly shallowing of crypts and an increase in the villus height to crypt depth ratio in the jejunum and ileum, as well as increase spermine content and decrease cadaverine level in ileal digesta may indicate the beneficial effects of small amounts of lignocellulose contained in the diet of broiler chickens on the digestive tract health of these birds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3acadaverine 3adigesta 3adigestive tract 3adose response 3aduodenum 3aileum 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ajejunum 3alignocellulose 3amales 3aspermine 3avilli 0aBroiler 0aInsoluble fiber 0aSmall intestine morphology 0aBiogenic amines1 aBogucka, Joanna1 aDankowiakowska, Agata1 aWalasik, Konrad0 tLivestock science.g2020 Nov., v. 241 p.104189-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2020.1041893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245009200162300001800254520196400272592002802236650001902264650001402283650001202297650001902309650001702328650001202345650001702357650001502374650002302389650001502412650001502427650001802442700002502460700003102485700001702516700002002533700001802553773014102571856007402712852000902786655001202795IND60642413620221116154859.0190507e20160518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064241362DNAL7 a10.1039/c6tb00035e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeslie, Shirae K.10aDevelopment of a cell delivery system using alginate microbeads for tissue regeneration  ap. 3515-3525.  aAlginate microbeads incorporating adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) have potential for delivering viable cells capable of facilitating tissue regeneration. These microbeads are formed in calcium crosslinking solutions containing organic osmolytes to ensure physiological osmolality, but the comparative effects of these osmolytes on the microencapsulated cells are not known. In addition, delivery parameters needed to use microencapsulated cells for tissue regeneration remain unknown. We investigated the following parameters: (1) osmolyte effects on microbead diameter, cell viability and growth factor production; (2) the effect of the number of cells per microbead and the number of microbeads per unit volume on cell viability, growth factor production, and microbead degradation; (3) the ability of both degradable and non-degradable alginate microbeads to localize cells at the delivery site in vivo; and (4) whether alginate microbeads containing alginate-lyase elicit an inflammatory response after repeated exposure. Smallest microbead diameters were achieved using glucose as the osmolyte but cell viability and growth factor production did not depend on osmolyte type. As cell number per microbead or microbead number per well increased, growth factor production per cell decreased although percent cell viability was unchanged. The rate of cell release varied with the number of beads per well and with the number of cells per microbead. At the highest microbead density and at the lowest density of cells per microbead, cell release was delayed. Therefore fewer microbeads may be sufficient for clinical applications. Both degradable (0.22 U g⁻¹) and non-degradable (0 U g⁻¹) alginate microbeads localized cells at the delivery site. Degradable alginate microbeads delivered subcutaneously elicited a mild chronic inflammatory response on second exposure, but how this might impact repeated use of the technology remains to be determined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginate lyase 3aalginates 3acalcium 3acell viability 3acrosslinking 3aglucose 3ainflammation 3amicrobeads 3amicroencapsulation 3aosmolality 3astem cells 3atissue repair1 aNicolini, Anthony M.1 aSundaresan, Gobalakrishnan1 aZweit, Jamal1 aBoyan, Barbara,1 aSchwartz, Zvi0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2016 May 18, v. 4, no. 20 p.3515-3525dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6tb00035e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002900139245025400168300001400422500001400436520115900450592002801609650002901637650002601666650001801692650001901710650001501729650002301744650001301767650001401780650000701794653004301801653002301844700001601867700002201883700002801905700002301933773018001956856007302136852000902209655001202218IND60691793620221121151122.0200502e19990101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069179362DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.63.102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMACHADO, Sonia Salgueiro10aCharacterization of the Enantioselective Properties of the Quinohemoprotein Alcohol Dehydrogenase of Acetobacter pasteurianus LMG 1635. 1.

Distinctly lower values (E=7-9) are observed for the ferricyanide-coupled oxidation of glycidol by the isolated quinohemoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase, QH-ADH, which is responsible for the enantiospecific oxidation step in whole cells. The accuracy of E-values from conversion experiments could be verified using complementary methods for the measurement of enantiomeric ratios. Effects of pH, detergent, the use of artificial electron acceptors, and the presence of intermediate aldehydes, could be accounted for. Measurements of E-values at successive stages of the purification showed that the drop in enantioselectivity correlates with the separation of QH-ADH from the cytoplasmic membrane. It is argued that the native arrangement of QH-ADH in the membrane-associated complex favors the higher E-values. The consequences of these findings for the use of whole cells versus purified enzymes in biocatalytic kinetic resolutions of chiral alcohols are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcetobacter pasteurianus 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3abiotechnology 3acell membranes 3adetergents 3aenantioselectivity 3aglycidol 3aoxidation 3apH 0aquinohemoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase 0akinetic resolution1 aWANDEL, Ute1 aJONGEJAN, Jaap A.1 aStraathof, Adrie J.

Modification of native starch at variant concentrations of acetic anhydride (6, 8 and 10 %, w/w) resulted in modified starch with 2.14, 3.35, 4.47% acetyl content and 0.082, 0.130 and 0.176° of substitution (DS) respectively. The acetyl esterification of native starch brought significant changes in physicochemical properties with respect to pasting behavior, granule morphology, thermal properties and retrogradation profile. Acetyl modifications of native starch increased swelling capacity, water absorption power and oil absorption capability by 17, 13 and 20 % respectively. Acetylation has decreased pasting temperature, pasting time, final viscosity and set back viscosity due to increase in amylsoe content, hydrogen bonding and porosity of starch granule. The acetyl modification was confirmed by IR spectra with the presence of an ester carbonyl group (C = O) at 1720.3 cm⁻¹ and absorption band at 174.8 cm⁻¹.

Newer laboratory protocols using high throughput sequencing platforms can now generate µsat data more efficiently than ever before. Yet, there is a dearth of easy to use, interactive software reliably converting raw sequencing data into individual-based multi-locus µsat genotypes suitable for typical downstream analyses. We describe the development and application of NGS-µsat, an R-based software workflow capable of converting raw µsat sequence data produced using next-generation sequencing platforms into multi-locus genotypes. Because the algorithm identifies repeat motifs, it does not rely on identifying and removing extraneous sequence fragments from sequenced reads to score loci. Accordingly, the software scores ‘true’ µsat repeats and provides an accurate, and clean picture of locus information without the typical assessment ambiguity based on fragment lengths. In comparative analyses, results show that NGS-µsat leads to cleaner, more reliable genotypes that are more repeatable than those made by scoring the same data using other software based on fragment lengths. This increased reliability/reproducibility of generated data may expand the use of high throughput sequencing-based techniques to routine DNA profiling, DNA fingerprinting and parentage/pedigree analyses and revitalise the application of µsats more broadly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aalgorithms 3abioinformatics 3acomputer software 3aconservation genetics 3acost effectiveness 3agenotyping 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparentage 3apedigree1 aLehnert, Sarah J.1 aVenney, Clare J.1 aWalter, Ryan1 aHeath, Daniel D.,0 tConservation genetics resources.g2021 June, v. 13, no. 2 p.161-173dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000001672x1877-72527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12686-020-01186-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03514naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245009800164506011700262506007600379520189500455592002802350506003702378650002302415650001102438650001902449650001202468650001702480650002202497650001202519650001702531650001602548650001602564650001002580651001002590653001802600653001402618653001802632653001702650653001202667700001602679700001502695700001402710700001702724700001802741700001202759700001702771773010102788856008602889852000902975655001202984IND60792145120221207135705.0221004e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079214512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1094232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ai10aDynamic responses of tree-ring growth to drought over Loess Plateau in the past three decades  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSince the 1990s, global warming has substantially affected the dynamic responses of forest ecosystems to drought by altering tree growth and ecosystems carbon cycling. The Loess Plateau is a typical vegetation recovery region with an arid and semiarid climate. However, the responses of the vegetation in this region to drought have not been fully studied. We therefore aimed to characterize these responses in tree-ring samples, which were obtained by drilling tree cores with a growth cone, for establishing the tree-ring width chronologies. In addition, we investigated the main factors controlling the radial growth of Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) and its dynamic responses to drought in the Loess Plateau using correlation analysis. Our results show that radial growth in Chinese pine had a positive correlation with precipitation during the last growing season, pre-growing season, and entire current growing season. The correlation between the radial growth and temperature was inconsistent between different sampling sites and time periods. These suggest that precipitation was more likely to affect radial vegetation growth than temperature. Moreover, the drought indices calculated using data before the year 2000 more accurately reflected the vegetation drought situation in Loess Plateau than data from the last 20 years. The drier the place, the more accurately the drought indices represented the responses of vegetation to drought. However, these indices cannot satisfactorily capture the drought responses of vegetation in wet regions. Furthermore, the PDSI was more accurate than the SPEI at capturing the effects of drought on radial vegetation growth. Understanding the response mechanism of the radial growth of Chinese pine to drought can provide theoretical support for ecological protection, forest management, and ecological construction under climate change.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPinus tabuliformis 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3adrought 3adry climates 3aforest management 3aforests 3agrowth rings 3atemperature 3atree growth 3atrees 3aChina 0aLoess Plateau 0aTree ring 0aRadial growth 0aChinese pine 0aDrought1 aGao, Xuerui1 aZhou, Zeyu1 aYang, Hao1 aZhao, Xuehua1 aWang, Yuemeng1 aLi, Min1 aZhao, Xining0 tEcological indicators.g2022 Oct., v. 143 p.109423-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1094233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013300168300001600301520102300317592002801340650001401368650001601382650002101398650001501419650001201434650002501446650001701471650001201488650001801500650001501518650001601533650001201549650001201561650001201573650001501585650001401600650001101614653001501625653001601640653002501656653002201681653001701703700001401720700001301734700001501747700001701762773010601779856008701885852000901972655001201981IND60611589920221117014015.0190409e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061158992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2016.11.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíaz, A.B.10aValorization of exhausted sugar beet cossettes by successive hydrolysis and two fermentations for the production of bio-products  ap. 225-233.  aExhausted sugar beet cossettes (ESBC) show an enormous potential as a source of sugars for the production of bio-products. Enzyme hydrolysis with the combined effect of mainly cellulases, xylanases and pectinases, turned out to be very efficient, obtaining almost double the concentration of sugars measured with the sole action of Celluclast® and β-glucosidase, and increasing 5 times the hydrolysis rate. As the sole pretreatment, ESBC soaked in the hydrolysis buffer were autoclaved, avoiding the application of severe conventional biomass pretreatments. Moreover, a promising alternative for the complete utilization of glucose, xylose, arabinose, mannose and maltose contained in ESBC is proposed in this paper. It consists of sequential fermentation of sugars released in the hydrolysis step to produce bioethanol and lactic acid as main bio-products. Compared to separate fermentations, with this strategy glucose and hemicellulose derived sugars were completely consumed and the 44% of pectin derived sugars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarabinose 3aautoclaving 3abeta-glucosidase 3abioethanol 3abiomass 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afermentation 3aglucose 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrolysis 3alactic acid 3amaltose 3amannose 3apectins 3asugar beet 3axylanases 3axylose 0aBioethanol 0aLactic acid 0aSugar beet cossettes 0aEnzyme hydrolysis 0aFermentation1 aMarzo, C.1 aCaro, I.1 ade Ory, I.1 aBlandino, A.0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Feb., v. 225 p.225-233dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2016.11.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03302naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245015100210300001800361506007600379520145600455592002801911506003701939650002201976650002101998650002502019650001702044650002702061650002002088650002502108650001702133650002102150650002302171650002002194650002002214650001802234650001502252650001402267650001402281650002002295650003202315650002302347650001402370700002502384700002202409700001702431700002002448700003002468700002102498773011502519856008102634852000902715655001202724IND60440680620221207072320.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044068062DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-015-1783-62doi7 aPMC45731512pmcid7 a263964202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetrović, Jovana10aNutritional value, chemical composition, antioxidant activity and enrichment of cream cheese with chestnut mushroom Agrocybe aegerita (Brig.)

Sing, was the subject of chemical profiling, antioxidant assays and sensory evaluation test in cream cheese. Methanolic extract obtained from a wild sample of A. aegerita fruiting body was fully chemically identified. Sample was found to be rich in carbohydrates (84.51 g/100 g dw), ash and proteins (6.69 g/100 g dw and 6.68 g/100 g dw, respectively). Trehalose was the main free sugar while malic acid was the most abundant organic acid. Four isoforms of tocopherols were identified; γ- tocopherol was the dominant isoform with 86.08 μg/100 g dw, followed by β- tocopherol, δ-tocopherol and α-tocopherol (8.80 μg/100 g dw, 3.40 μg/100 g dw and 2.10 μg/100 g dw, respectively). Polyunsaturated fatty acids were predominant, with linoleic acid as the most prominent one (78.40 %). Methanolic extract of chestnut mushroom exhibited high antioxidant activity. Sensory evaluation test included grading by panelists and comparing the overall acceptability of cream cheese alone and enriched cream cheese with dry powder of A. aegerita. General conclusion of the participants was that the newly developed product was more likeable in comparison to cream cheese alone. Due to the health-beneficial effects of antioxidants and wealth of chemically identified nutrients, A. aegerita is a promising starting material for incorporation on larger scale products.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAgrocybe aegerita 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aash (inorganic matter) 3abeta-tocopherol 3achemical composition 3acream cheese 3adelta-tocopherol 3afood acceptability 3afruiting bodies 3afungal proteins 3alinoleic acid 3amalic acid 3amushrooms 3anutrients 3anutritive value 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3asensory evaluation 3atrehalose1 aGlamočlija, Jasmina1 aStojković, Dejan1 aĆirić, Ana1 aBarros, Lillian1 aFerreira, Isabel C.

After 120days of feeding, ruminal fluid and digesta were harvested from each lamb for FA composition and fermentation characteristic analysis, respectively. QPCR was undertaken for determining the relative contents of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus in ruminal fluid. Compared with CONT, both SFO and FOSFO did not influence the major ruminal fermentation parameters except for total volatile FA (TVFA), however FO fed alone shifted rumen fermentation toward propionate at the expense of acetate with no change in molar proportions of other individual volatile FA (VFA). Dietary oil supplements resulted in the accumulation of trans-11 C18:1 in ruminal digesta, and FO inclusion simultaneously induced a marked decrease in C18:0 concentrations. Sunflower oil inclusion resulted in a small decrease in the relative proportion of B. fibrisolvens, however, the relative proportion of B. proteoclasticus was substantially less for lambs fed fish oil supplements compared with CONT. QPCR analysis indicated that a weak relationship between the number of B. proteoclasticus and C18:0 concentrations (P<0.01, R2=0.3293). In general, unprotected FO, SFO, or FOSFO affected ruminal fermentation and produced series of bio-hydrogenation intermediates. Alterations in ruminal bio-hydrogenation were associated with changes in the abundance of B. proteoclasticus, but B. proteoclasticus was not the dominant bacterium in producing C18:0.  aPublisher supplied data 3aButyrivibrio fibrisolvens 3aacetates 3abacteria 3adietary fat 3adigesta 3afatty acid composition 3afermentation 3afinishing 3afish oils 3ahay 3ahydrogenation 3alambs 3apropionic acid 3arumen bacteria 3arumen fermentation 3arumen fluids 3asunflower oil 3aunsaturated fatty acids 0aOil source 0aFatty acid 0aBio-hydrogenation 0aBacteria 0aRumen 0aLamb1 aMa, Yong1 aQu, Yanghua1 aLuo, Hailing1 aLiu, Kun1 aZuo, Zhaoyun1 aLu, Xiaonan0 tSmall ruminant research.g2016 Nov., v. 144 p.126-134dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2016.06.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245007600169520164100245592002801886650002001914650002401934650001801958650002301976650001801999650001802017650002202035650001902057650001902076650001402095650002202109650001102131650001802142650002102160650002002181650001602201650001202217653001802229653001402247653001902261653002102280653001102301700002002312773013002332856008402462852000902546655001202555IND60792141320221118135724.0220914e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079214132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2022.1031402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBondu, Caroline10aNanoliposomes, from food industry to nutraceuticals: Interests and uses  aNanoliposomes are a form of vector used both in the pharmaceutical and food industries. In food industry, these lipid nanostructures are incorporated during the manufacturing process of food products, primarily to improve texture, flavors and for food preservation. Because of their natural lipid composition, and their ability to encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds, nanoliposomes represent an interesting form of carrier for bioactive molecules. Encapsulation in these lipid-based vectors of molecules known for their beneficial effects on certain organs or tissues can be envisaged in nutraceutical applications to create functional foods designed for disease prevention. To achieve this objective, however, it is necessary to control certain parameters during preparation and storage of nanoliposomes to ensure optimal digestibility and bioavailability. Indeed, challenges still exist to ensure the stability of nanoliposomes during storage, as well as following ingestion. Many preparation techniques are available, but the oxidative nature of lipids and their phase transition temperature all affect the stability of nanoliposomes. These issues and the feasibility for use of nanoliposomes in industrial applications for nutraceuticals, as well as the importance of establishing product specifications and the claims for using nanoliposomes in nutraceuticals are discussed in this review. Finally, although industrial scale-up raises questions of quality control and reproducibility, investigations nevertheless suggest a promising future for the use of these lipid nanostructures in nutraceutical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3adietary supplements 3adigestibility 3adisease prevention 3aencapsulation 3afood industry 3afood preservation 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aingestion 3alipid composition 3alipids 3ananomaterials 3aphase transition 3aquality control 3atemperature 3atexture 0aNanoliposomes 0aLiposomes 0aNutraceuticals 0aFunctional foods 0aVector1 aYen, Frances T.0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2022 Oct., v. 81 p.103140-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl69720x1466-85647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2022.1031403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04823naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024004100138024004800179040001800227100005800245245009700303300001400400506002800414506003600442506007600478506003100554520204500585592002802630596008302658596016302741596004502904596004602949596013902995506003703134650002103171650001503192650002003207650003703227650002303264650005003287650004003337650001503377650002403392650002303416650001703439650002303456650001603479650001903495650002103514651002903535653003003564653002003594653001603614653002003630653001903650653003903669700002703708700002003735700002003755700002403775700001803799700001403817773013603831856008803967903002404055961001304079852000904092655001204101IND60563846820221207110735.0190318e20170115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056384682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2016.08.0052chorus7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2016.08.0052doi7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2016.08.0052chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWagle, Pradeep1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7444-046110aAnalysis and estimation of tallgrass prairie evapotranspiration in the central United States  ap. 35-47.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aUnderstanding the factors controlling evapotranspiration (ET) of spatially distributed tallgrass prairie is crucial to accurately upscale ET and to predict the response of tallgrass prairie ecosystems to current and future climate. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and ground-based climate variables were integrated with eddy covariance tower-based ET (ETEC) at six AmeriFlux tallgrass prairie sites in the central United States to determine major climatic factors that control ET over multiple timescales and to develop a simple and robust statistical model for predicting ET. Variability in ET was nearly identical across sites over a range of timescales, and it was most strongly driven by photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at hourly-to-weekly timescales, by vapor pressure deficit (VPD) at weekly-to-monthly timescales, and by temperature at seasonal-to-interannual timescales at all sites. Thus, the climatic drivers of ET change over multiple timescales. The EVI tracked the seasonal variation of ETEC well at both individual sites (R2>0.70) and across six sites (R2=0.76). The inclusion of PAR further improved the ET-EVI relationship (R2=0.86). Based on this result, we used ETEC, EVI, and PAR (MJm−2 d−1) data from four sites (15 site-years) to develop a statistical model (ET=0.11 PAR+5.49 EVI − 1.43, adj. R2=0.86, P<0.0001) for predicting daily ET at 8-day intervals. This predictive model was evaluated against additional two years of ETEC data from one of the four model development sites and two independent sites. The predicted ET (ETEVI+PAR) captured the seasonal patterns and magnitudes of ETEC, and correlated well with ETEC, with R2 of 0.87-0.96 and RMSE of 0.35-0.49mmd−1, and it was significantly improved compared to the standard MODIS ET product. This study demonstrated that tallgrass prairie ET can be accurately predicted using a multiple regression model that uses EVI and PAR which can be readily derived from remote sensing data.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Science Foundation EPSCoR programdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005714  cOffice of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Programdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006206  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUSDOEdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000015  cUSDA National Institute for Food and Agriculture (NIFA)'s Agriculture and Food Research Initiativedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimatic factors 3aecosystems 3aeddy covariance 3aenterotoxigenic Escherichia coli 3aevapotranspiration 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3aseasonal variation 3aspatial data 3astatistical models 3atemperature 3avapor pressure 3avegetation index 3aMidwestern United States 0aArtificial neural network 0aEddy covariance 0aET modeling 0aEmpirical model 0aRemote sensing 0aWavelet cross-correlation analysis1 aXiao, X.q(Xiangming),1 aGowda, Prasanna1 aBasara, Jeffrey1 aBrunsell, Nathaniel1 aSteiner, Jean1 aK.C, Anup0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 232 p.35-47dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2016.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03159naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245012100203300001200324500001900336520177500355592002802130650001502158650001302173650001102186650001602197650002502213650002202238650001302260650001302273650001402286650001202300650003302312650001102345650001802356650001802374650001802392700002302410700002002433700001802453773015002471856008302621852000902704655001202713IND60735437920221120053253.0210608e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073543792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-021-09045-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaul, Varun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6313-584810aEvaluating hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater and surface water in the Upper Pearl River Watershed, USA  ap. 296.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe groundwater quality of the Upper Pearl River Watershed (UPRW) and surface water quality of the basin’s outlet, Ross Barnett Reservoir (RBR), are critically important because of growing demands for drinking, agriculture, and industrial use in the region. To identify factors affecting water quality and characterize the surface water outlet and the watershed’s groundwater, geochemical and statistical analyses were performed using results from various hydrogeochemical parameters. Based on surface geology, groundwater samples analyzed (n = 51) within the watershed were partitioned into three recharge zones: North, Mid, and South. Precipitation and rock-water interactions were identified to dominantly influence the groundwater chemistry in the region. The chemistry of the surface water samples (n = 9), on the other hand, was influenced more by precipitation with minor contribution from the proximal aquifer system. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that two groundwater recharge zones and RBR samples exhibited significant clustering. The groundwater had a complex array of parameters influencing its chemistry owing to diverse properties, including Na, Ca, Mg, alkalinity, and conductivity. Comparing land use at the sub-watershed level with the water quality parameters showed that agriculture and development could have contributed nitrate, especially to the groundwater in the south zone. However, a general lack of distinct relationship between land use and water quality, along with detection of excess nitrate in select wells suggested that the water in the region was likely affected by point sources, such as poultry farms. The research recommends evaluating point sources of pollution to cater to future water management in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalinity 3aaquifers 3abasins 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3ahydrogeochemistry 3aland use 3anitrates 3apollution 3apoultry 3aprincipal component analysis 3arivers 3asubwatersheds 3asurface water 3awater quality1 aVattikuti, Shannon1 aDash, Padmanava1 aArslan, Zikri0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2021 May, v. 193, no. 5 p.296-296dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09045-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245007000212300001600282520129800298592002801596650002101624650002001645650001401665650002001679650001301699650002101712650002901733650001101762651001901773653001601792653002001808653002501828653002001853653002701873653001701900700006301917700002601980700002202006700001902028773009002047856008502137852000902222655001202231IND60645547420221119025859.0191214e20190815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064554742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.05.1752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠomplák, Radovan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5714-453710aBulky waste for energy recovery: Analysis of spatial distribution  ap. 827-839.  aThe data regarding the current potential of unrecyclable waste and its spatial distribution play an essential role in the planning process. As per the circular economy strategies, especially the bulky waste streams suitable for energy recovery are to be identified. The public databases, however, collect data from a variety of sources (production and handling reports), which implies the presence of errors. This paper therefore proposes a multi-objective approach to identification and elimination of such errors to improve the accuracy of the assessment of potential energy recovery. The discussed model tracks the flow of waste from producers to processing nodes and minimises the deviation from the original data. Economic aspects are considered as well by preferring the shortest transport distance. The combination of data reconciliation and network flow enhances performance, as objective functions are solved separately, and only then the normalised individual optima are used in the multi-objective function. The model was tested using a Czech Republic regional-level dataset from 2015. A new perspective on the current state of waste management was provided, and valuable information for future planning was revealed, which can be useful for modelling of flows of other commodities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircular economy 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aenergy recovery 3aplanning 3apotential energy 3aproducts and commodities 3awastes 3aCzech Republic 0aBulky waste 0aEnergy recovery 0aSpatial distribution 0aWaste-to-energy 0aMaterial flow analysis 0aSupply chain1 aNevrlý, Vlastimír1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6613-03401 aSmejkalová, Veronika1 aŠmídová, Zlata1 aPavlas, Martin0 tEnergy.g2019 Aug. 15, v. 181 p.827-839dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.05.1753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02612naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245014800213300001200361500001900373520125700392592002801649650001501677650002101692650001201713650001301725650001301738650001801751650001901769650001501788650001401803650000901817650001701826650002501843700003101868700002801899700003301927773015001960856008302110852000902193655001202202IND60735438020221120065548.0210608e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073543802DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-021-09088-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreira, Ailton José1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0741-884010aN-compounds speciation analysis in environmental samples using ultrasound-assisted solid–liquid extraction and non-chromatographic techniques  ap. 297.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA fast, efficient, and non-chromatographic method was presented in this study for nitrite, nitrate, and p-nitrophenol (N-compounds) extraction and speciation analysis of environmental samples. By applying ultrasound-assisted solid–liquid extraction (USLE), analytes were efficiently extracted from water, soil, or sediment collected in areas of environmental disaster. These analytes were selectively converted to NO₍g₎ through UV photolysis (NO₃⁻), H₂O₂/UV photocatalysis (PNP), and direct conversion (NO₂⁻). Following conversion, NO₍g₎ was separated from the liquid phase and determined by high-resolution continuum source molecular absorption spectrometry (HR-CS MAS). The LODs obtained were 0.097 ± 0.004 mg L⁻¹ for nitrite, 0.119 ± 0.004 mg L⁻¹ for nitrate, and 0.090 ± 0.006 mg L⁻¹ for p-nitrophenol. On applying this speciation method to environmental samples, concentrations were found to be up to 0.99 ± 0.03 mg L⁻¹ (NO₂⁻), 49.80 ± 2.5 mg L⁻¹ (NO₃⁻), and 0.10 ± 0.02 mg L⁻¹ (PNP). Finally, addition/recovery study of real water, soil, and sediment samples showed 101 ± 2% recovery for NO₂⁻, 100 ± 1% for NO₃⁻, and 96 ± 5% for PNP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3achemical species 3aliquids 3anitrates 3anitrites 3ap-nitrophenol 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotolysis 3asediments 3asoil 3aspectroscopy 3aultrasonic treatment1 aFreschi, Carolina Dakuzaku1 aPereira, Ernesto Chaves1 aFreschi, Gian Paulo Giovanni0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2021 May, v. 193, no. 5 p.297-297dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09088-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245007700166300002000243520158900263592002801852650001501880650002801895650002201923650001701945650001201962650001901974650001301993650002102006650001902027650001302046650003302059650001602092650001702108700002202125700002002147700001602167700002502183773012302208856008202331852000902413655001202422IND60560669020170927000000.0170105e20150813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056066902DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b047572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYenice, Zuleyha10aThermoresponsive PDMAEMA Brushes: Effect of Gold Nanoparticle Deposition  ap. 10348-10358.  aThe paper addresses the effect of gold nanoparticle (Au-NP) deposition on the thermoresponsive volume phase transition of the weak polyelectrolyte poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) brushes. PDMAEMA brushes were synthesized via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP). The PDMAEMA/Au-NP composite brushes were fabricated by immersing the brush modified wafer in the Au-NP suspension. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), ellipsometry, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) have been employed to characterize the neat PDMAEMA brushes and PDMAEMA/Au-NP composite brushes. All neat PDMAEMA brushes swelled below the volume phase transition temperature and collapsed with increasing temperature over a broad temperature range independent of the initial brush thickness. Water uptake of the brushes is also independent of initial brush thickness. The adsorption of the charged Au-NPs significantly affects the degree of swelling and the thermoresponsive properties of the brushes. PDMAEMA/Au-NP composite brushes do not exhibit any noticeable phase transition at the experimental temperature range irrespective of the initial brush thickness. The reason for this behavior is attributed to a combination of the following: the decreased conformational entropy of the Au-NP adsorbed polymer chains, the increased hydrophilicity of the system due to the charged Au-NPs, and the ≈13 nm diameter Au-NPs causing steric hindrance. We have also shown that the AFM full-indentation method can be successfully applied to determine the polymer brush thicknesses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aatomic force microscopy 3achemical elements 3aelectrolytes 3aentropy 3ahydrophilicity 3ananogold 3aphase transition 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3awater uptake1 aSchön, Sebastian1 aBildirir, Hakan1 aGenzer, Jan1 avon Klitzing, Regine0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2015 Aug. 13, v. 119, no. 32 p.10348-10358dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.5b047573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245011600174520149100290592002801781650001301809650002601822650001601848650001501864650001101879650003901890650001101929650001501940650002401955650001701979650001101996650001102007650001102018651001802029653001802047653000802065653002502073653002102098653001802119700001202137700005902149700001802208700001702226773009102243856009002334852000902424655001202433IND60792341620221119083517.0220914e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079234162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1363012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Youliang14aThe relationship between air quality and MODIS aerosol optical depth in major cities of the Yangtze River Delta  aThe AOD derived from the MODIS deep blue(DB) algorithm and AQI were used to investigate the correlation between AOD and AQI in seven major cities of Yangtze River Delta (YRD) from January to December 2019.

Ⅳ) Among the five models, the cubic model obtained the best results with R² ˃ 0.55. In the sub-seasonal regression model, the cubic model outperformed other models in spring (R² ˃ 0.57), summer (R² ˃ 0.76) and autumn (R² ˃ 0.38). However, in winter the composite model outperformed others (R² ˃ 0.68). Ⅴ) Considering annual data, the AOD can predict over 70% of the variations in AQI (0.41＜R² ＜0.81). These results demonstrate the feasibility of AOD derived from the MODIS DB algorithm in AQI prediction. The method used in this study can be applied as an aid for air pollution control programs in different regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair pollution control 3aair quality 3aalgorithms 3aautumn 3agovernmental programs and projects 3amodels 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3ariver deltas 3aspring 3asummer 3awinter 3aYangtze River 0aDeep blue AOD 0aAQI 0aCorrelation analysis 0aRegression model 0aAir pollution1 aLi, Dan1 aKarimian, Hamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6332-16271 aWang, Shiteng1 aFang, Shuwei0 tChemosphere.g2022 Dec., v. 308 p.136301-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1363013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02918naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245011200211300001200323500001900335520159200354592002801946650001201974650002901986650002202015650001902037650001602056650002902072650001602101651000902117700006302126700006402189700006102253773015002314856008302464852000902547655001202556IND60735438120221120065400.0210608e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073543812DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-021-09095-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahimizadeh, Naimeh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8001-539710aEstimation of trees height and vertical structure using SAR interferometry in uneven-aged and mixed forests  ap. 298.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEstimation of forest height is an important parameter of stands structure that aids in the determination of forest biomass, successional stage dynamics, and the decision of the type of forest management. In addition, estimating the height of trees especially in uneven-aged, massive, and multi-storied forest stands always faces challenges in kind of inventory and accuracy of the assessment. In this research, the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry technique was used to estimate the height of trees for determining the vertical structure of forest. For this purpose, we focused on an area at the mixed and uneven-aged forest in Iran and evaluated the potential of Envisat ASAR data to characterize the tree height in the forest patches and the digital surface model (DSM) was produced via SAR interferometry. The height of trees and the vertical structure of the forest stands were estimated using produced DSM and Digital elevation Model (DEM). Furthermore, the accuracy of estimated parameters was evaluated with real ground data (11 × 1 ha (100 × 100 m) sample plots). The results indicated that the estimated height of trees was meanly 7.69 m with a 22 m STDV over the reality. Furthermore, the vertical structure in all the plots was three-storied that they are the same as ground truth, but the percentage of the share of trees in the under and middle story was different from the ground truth. In conclusion, the tree height and vertical structure of forest stands can be determined with acceptable accuracy via SAR interferometry and Envisat ASAR data.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3adigital elevation models 3aforest management 3ainterferometry 3ainventories 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atree height 3aIran1 aSahebi, Mahmod Reza1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7742-39741 aBabaie Kafaky, Sasan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3161-42381 aMataji, Asadollah1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6903-22870 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2021 May, v. 193, no. 5 p.298-298dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09095-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02325naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013500168300001800303520129000321592002801611650001401639650001001653650001001663650002201673650001601695650001201711650000701723650001301730700002501743700002101768700002301789773010601812856004801918852000901966655001201975IND50059568720221119051615.0131017e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005956872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-011-0632-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAïder, Mohammed10aPurification of Whole Brown Flaxseed Meal from Coloring Pigments by Treatment in Hydrogen Peroxide Solutions: Impact on Meal Color  ap. 3051-3065.  aThe main objective of the present project was the purification of brown flaxseed meal from coloring pigments in order to improve its potential use as ingredient in food formulations. Thus, this work was aimed to study the bleaching of non-defatted brown flaxseed meal in dilute hydrogen peroxide solutions. Bleaching was evaluated according to the Hunter L, (a), and (b) color scale as function of the hydrogen peroxide concentration (1%, 2%, and 3% v/v), the meal concentration (2.5%, 5%, and 10% w/w), the bleaching time (10, 20, and 30 min), and the pH (3, 7, and 9). Effect of all the independent variables was significant. The L value was the most significantly affected parameter and increased as the concentration of hydrogen peroxide increased, but decreased as the concentration of flaxseed meal increased. The L value was observed to be higher at pH 9 than at pH 3 and 7. The b value, which represents the yellowness, was significantly increased from 18.70 ± 0.01 (control sample) to 35.45 ± 0.04 after the meal was treated with a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution at pH 9. Total phenolics content significantly decreased when the meal was treated with 3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide solution. This concentration yielded the higher L color value (highly bleached meal).  aPublisher supplied data 3ableaching 3acolor 3afoods 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aingredients 3alinseed 3apH 3apigments1 aMartel, Andrée-Anne1 aFerracci, Joanny1 ade Halleux, Damien0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2012 Nov., v. 5, no. 8 p.3051-3065dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-011-0632-5  aDNAL 7aarticle03499naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245013000209300001200339500001900351520215900370592002802529650002102557650001502578650001402593650001502607650002302622650002402645650002302669650002102692650002502713650001502738651000902753700002002762700002002782700002402802700002102826773015002847856008302997852000903080655001203089IND60735438220221120065535.0210608e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073543822DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-021-09078-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKazemzadeh, Majid1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0172-007X10aSoil moisture change analysis under watershed management practice using in situ and remote sensing data in a paired watershed  ap. 299.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSoil moisture, vegetation cover, and land surface temperature are vital variables in water-energy balance, eco-hydrological processes, and water resources management, which can be influenced by watershed management activities. This research focused on the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture, vegetation cover, land surface temperature, and Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) under a biological watershed management practice in the Taleghan paired watershed, namely, treated (TW) and control watersheds (CW), in Alborz province, Iran. In this research, along with the remote sensing techniques, the soil moisture and vegetation cover data were measured and statistically analyzed in the three aspects of both TW and CW during a growth period from May to October 2017. The results indicated that soil moisture, vegetation cover, and land surface temperature values in the paired watershed were significantly different at the 0.01 level during the study period. The increased vegetation cover in the TW had an inverse effect on the land surface temperature and TVDI, while directly impacted the soil moisture content. The average TVDI in the CW was 0.83, while this index was found to be 0.69 in the TW. Unlike the vegetation cover and soil moisture, the results revealed that the southern aspects had the highest TVDI and land surface temperature compared to the northern and eastern aspects of both watersheds. However, the increased vegetation cover as a biological watershed management activity in the steep terrain and mountainous areas of TW led to an increased soil moisture and a decreased land surface temperature and soil dryness. As a result, decreasing soil dryness in the TW can exert vital controls on the water resources and increasing water availability. In the arid and semiarid countries such as Iran, a proper watershed management activity can effectively increase soil moisture and water availability in the watersheds. In particular, the vegetation cover protection and biological practices can be considered as practical solutions in the rehabilitation of exhausted watersheds in arid and semiarid environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrologic cycle 3alandscapes 3amountains 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asurface temperature 3atemporal variation 3avegetation cover 3awatershed management 3awatersheds 3aIran1 aSalajegheh, Ali1 aMalekian, Arash1 aLiaghat, Abdolmajid1 aHashemi, Hossein0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2021 May, v. 193, no. 5 p.299-299dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09078-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011300167300001600280520134900296592002801645650001201673650002201685650001801707650002301725650001501748650001101763650001901774650001801793650001101811650001701822650001301839650001601852650002501868650001101893653003401904653001601938653001901954653003201973653002502005700001302030700001802043700001802061773009002079856008502169852000902254655001202263IND60645547720221119025721.0191214e20190815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064554772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.05.1842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Mengyi10aNumerical study and enhancement of Ca(OH)2/CaO dehydration process with porous channels embedded in reactors  ap. 417-428.  aThermochemical energy storage has drawn great attention due to its advantages such as high energy density, little heat loss, and long term and distance storage. The present study aims to enhance reactive transport processes during the dehydration process of Ca(OH)2/CaO. A physicochemical model is developed for the dehydration process occurring in porous reactant, including vapor flow, heat transfer and endothermic chemical reaction. Distributions of temperature and Ca(OH)2 concentration in cylinder reactors are discussed, and complicated coupling mechanisms are revealed between multiple processes. In addition, the results show that increasing temperature can efficiently enhance the reactive transport. Effects of reactant porosity are also explored and different reaction patterns are observed. Finally, porous channels with high thermal conductivity and permeability are embedded into the reactor. On the one hand, the porous channel with high permeability serves as highway for the vapor generated to be discharged out of the reactor, thus pushing the reaction towards dehydration direction. On the other hand, the porous channel with high thermal conductivity also enhances local heat transfer, thus accelerating the dehydration chemical reaction. In summary, with porous channels added, the dehydration process is greatly enhanced.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acalcium hydroxide 3acalcium oxide 3achemical reactions 3aendothermy 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3aheat transfer 3amodels 3apermeability 3aporosity 3atemperature 3athermal conductivity 3avapors 0aThermochemical energy storage 0aDehydration 0aPorous channel 0aEnhanced reactive transport 0aNumerical simulation1 aChen, Li1 aChi, Lingjun,1 aTao, Wen-Quan0 tEnergy.g2019 Aug. 15, v. 181 p.417-428dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.05.1843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03364naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003800188245012600226300001800352506007600370520183200446592002802278506003702306650001502343650002702358650001002385650001102395650002802406650001702434650001602451650002602467650001102493650000902504650002402513650003302537650004802570650001102618650001102629700002702640700002202667773011502689856008102804852000902885655001202894IND60440681020221207065227.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044068102DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-015-1776-52doi7 aPMC45731292pmcid7 a263963722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNitcheu Ngemakwe, Patrick Hermaan10aEffects of yeast, carboxymethylcellulose, yoghurt, transglutaminase and cyclodextrinase on mixing properties of oat dough  ap. 6266-6277.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe effects of yeast, carboxylmethylcellulose (CMC), plain yoghurt (YG), transglutaminase (TG) and cyclodextrinase (CG) on the mixing properties of oat dough were investigated through the use of DoughLab. A 2⁵⁻²fractional factorial design resolution III with yeast (1.25, 3.25 %), CMC (1, 2 %), YG (10.75, 33.75 %), TG (0.5, 1.5 %) and CG (10, 40 μl) as independent variables was implemented. The parameters measured were water absorption, arrival time, stability, energy at peak, peak resistance, development time, departure time, softening and bandwith at peak. CMC significantly (p < 0.05) increased stability, energy at peak, development and departure times, but significantly (p < 0.05) decreased water absorption, peak resistance, softening and bandwidth at peak. TG signficantly increased water absorption, peak resistance and softening, but significantly decreased energy and development time. YG significantly (p < 0.05) decreased all the parameters measured, with the exception of softening, which was significantly increased. In contrast, yeast and cyclodextrinase did not significantly affect the oat dough during mixing. Principal component analysis indicated that 85.5 % of the variation in the data could be explained by two components. Component 1 explaining 52.3 % of the variation loaded highly on dough strength (stability and departure time). Component 2 contributing 33.2 % of the variation loaded on dough resistance (water absorption and peak resistance). CMC significantly increased dough strength while yoghurt reduced it significantly. TG significantly (p < 0.05) increased the resistance of the dough to mixing while CMC and yoghurt reduced it significantly (p < 0.05). Hence, CMC, TG and yoghurt are ingredients of choice when modifying oat dough mixing properties.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3adough 3aenergy 3afood processing quality 3aglycosidases 3aingredients 3amechanical properties 3amixing 3aoats 3aphysical properties 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3ayeasts 3ayogurt1 aLe Roes-Hill, Marilize1 aJideani, Victoria0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2015 Oct., v. 52, no. 10 p.6266-6277dSpringer Indiax0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-015-1776-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02068naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245013200168300001400300520088800314592002801202650001501230650002001245650002601265650000901291650001301300650001001313650001301323650001401336650001401350653001101364653002001375653001001395653001001405653001201415700002001427700001801447773010101465856008301566852000901649655001201658IND60530880520221119123932.0190411e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053088052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2016.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSledge, Dodd G.10aCanine cutaneous mast cell tumors: A combined clinical and pathologic approach to diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment selection  ap. 43-54.  aIn view of the varied biologic behavior and the costs of treatment for canine cutaneous mast cell tumors, development of appropriate treatment plans for individual affected dogs can be difficult, but decisions regarding treatment should be made using a systematic, evidence-based approach. This manuscript reviews the current state of diagnostics and prognostication of canine cutaneous mast cell tumors, and suggests a combined approach based on clinical and pathologic assessment for decision making regarding treatment choices. The current state of histologic grading, evaluation of proliferation indices, evaluation of mutations in the c-kit gene and KIT expression, evaluation of excision and clinical staging are examined. On the basis of the current understanding of prognostication and treatment response, algorithms for selection of local and systemic therapy are presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adecision making 3adiagnostic techniques 3adogs 3aexcision 3agenes 3amutation 3aneoplasms 3aprognosis 0aCanine 0aMast cell tumor 0aKi-67 0ac-kit 0aStaging1 aWebster, Joshua1 aKiupel, Matti0 tveterinary journal.g2016 Sept., v. 215 p.43-54dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl55231x1090-02337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2016.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03265naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245010700167300002000274520184100294592002802135650001302163650001202176650002102188650001302209650001302222650001302235650001202248650004402260650001402304650002702318700001902345700002102364700002602385700001902411700002202430700001902452700002102471700002102492700002102513700002602534700002102560773012302581856008202704852000902786655001202795IND60560669620221119130657.0170105e20150813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056066962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b052302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVoinov, Maxim
A.10aCysteine-Specific Labeling of Proteins with a Nitroxide Biradical for Dynamic Nuclear Polarization NMR  ap. 10180-10190.  aDynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhances the signal in solid-state NMR of proteins by transferring polarization from electronic spins to the nuclear spins of interest. Typically, both the protein and an exogenous source of electronic spins, such as a biradical, are either codissolved or suspended and then frozen in a glycerol/water glassy matrix to achieve a homogeneous distribution. While the use of such a matrix protects the protein upon freezing, it also reduces the available sample volume (by ca. a factor of 4 in our experiments) and causes proportional NMR signal loss. Here we demonstrate an alternative approach that does not rely on dispersing the DNP agent in a glassy matrix. We synthesize a new biradical, ToSMTSL, which is based on the known DNP agent TOTAPOL, but also contains a thiol-specific methanethiosulfonate group to allow for incorporating this biradical into a protein in a site-directed manner. ToSMTSL was characterized by EPR and tested for DNP of a heptahelical transmembrane protein, Anabaena sensory rhodopsin (ASR), by covalent modification of solvent-exposed cysteine residues in two ¹⁵N-labeled ASR mutants. DNP enhancements were measured at 400 MHz/263 GHz NMR/EPR frequencies for a series of samples prepared in deuterated and protonated buffers and with varied biradical/protein ratios. While the maximum DNP enhancement of 15 obtained in these samples is comparable to that observed for an ASR sample cosuspended with ∼17 mM TOTAPOL in a glycerol-d₈/D₂O/H₂O matrix, the achievable sensitivity would be 4-fold greater due to the gain in the filling factor. We anticipate that the DNP enhancements could be further improved by optimizing the biradical structure. The use of covalently attached biradicals would broaden the applicability of DNP NMR to structural studies of proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnabaena 3abuffers 3achemical bonding 3acysteine 3afreezing 3aglycerol 3amutants 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3arhodopsin 3atransmembrane proteins1 aGood, Daryl B.1 aWard, Meaghan E.1 aMilikisiyants, Sergey1 aMarek, Antonin1 aCaporini, Marc A.1 aRosay, Melanie1 aMunro, Rachel

Recent applications of soil erosion gradation have focused on monitoring soil erosion with models or simulation of soil erosion through gradation trends. However, soil erosion simulation accuracy is generally being reduced due to the rare consideration of the relationship between soil erosion gradation and erosion evolution. In this study, we investigated different soil erosion intensity grades to demonstrate their sensitivity to types and rates of erosion. Specifically, the objective was to define the relationship between soil erosion gradation and soil erosion evolution in Changting, an undeveloped area in Fujian Province, China, for four time intervals (1975, 1990, 1999, and 2006). The time series of erosion gradation were developed by modeling analysis with integration of several erosion indicators, and the relationships between the erosion grades and evolution types and rates were quantified. Comparison of the collapsing forces with natural and restoring forces based on human activity demonstrated that there existed an obvious spatial uncertainty in the erosion evolution types, both positive and negative succession coexisted, and the evolution rates were mostly influenced by the force of policy orientation. The impacts of these driving forces were eventually reflected in the erosion intensity gradation and erosion evolution. The correlation between the negative succession rate and erosion intensity gradation was weak and showed a poor contribution to the average succession rate, while the negative correlation between the positive succession rate and erosion intensity gradation would be increasingly clear as time passed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3amonitoring 3asimulation models 3asoil erosion 3asoil erosion models 3asoil formation 3asoil treatment 3atime series analysis 3auncertainty 3aChina1 aZHOU, Sheng-Lu1 aWu, Shaohua,d1949-1 aLIAO, Fu-Qiang0 tPedosphere.g2012 Apr., v. 22, no. 2 p.243-253dElsevier Ltdx1002-01607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(12)60011-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01668naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001900148245012400167300001600291520071100307592002801018650001001046650001201056650001601068650001401084650001601098700002601114700002001140773011301160856008401273852000901357655001201366IND4449727920221119051724.0141110e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444972792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2010.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, Ryan S.10aM-DEC: A spreadsheet program for producing multiple decrement life tables and estimating mortality dynamics for insects  ap. 363-367.  aIn the single decrement life table, an individual exits the table in only one way: through death undifferentiated by cause. In the multiple decrement life table (MDLT), an individual can exit the table through differentiated causes of death. Because of its structure, numerous calculations of demographic importance can be produced from the data in the MDLT, including estimates of the probability of death in the presence or absence of a combination of causes. Producing these life tables using manual calculations can be tedious and time consuming. Therefore, we present here a spreadsheet program, M-DEC, which automatically calculates many of the demographic variables in the MDLT for use with insects.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeath 3ainsects 3alife tables 3amortality 3aprobability1 aPeterson, Robert K.D.1 aHigley, Leon G.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2011 Feb., v. 75, no. 2 p.363-367dElsevier B.V.x0168-16997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2010.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04554naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245017800165520258000343592002802923650001902951650002302970650003402993650001703027650000803044650001403052650001503066650001903081650001603100650001903116650002103135650002103156650001303177650002003190650001003210650001403220650001203234650001003246650001503256650000903271650001703280650001103297650001403308650002603322650005303348650002203401650000903423650001003432650001903442653001303461653002303474653001203497700001803509700001303527700001403540700001603554700001303570700001803583700001703601700001803618700001303636773011603649856008203765852000903847655001203856IND60757248820221121173206.0211227e20220301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075724882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2021.1148472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Tianlong10aSystematic exploration of the potential material basis and molecular mechanism of the Mongolian medicine Nutmeg-5 in improving cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction  aNutmeg-5, which consists of Myristica fragrans Houtt., Aucklandia lappa Decne., Inula helenium L., Fructus Choerospondiatis and Piper longum L., is an ancient and classic formula in traditional Mongolian medicine that is widely used in the treatment of ischemic heart disease. However, its material basis and pharmacological mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.The aim of this study was to explore the potential material basis and molecular mechanism of Nutmeg-5 in improving cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI).The constituents of Nutmeg-5 absorbed into the blood were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). A mouse MI model was induced in male Kunming mice by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LDA) ligation. Echocardiography was performed to assess cardiac function. The protective effect of Nutmeg-5 and compound Danshen dripping pills as positive control medicine on post-MI cardiac remodeling was evaluated by tissue histology and determination of the serum protein levels of biomarkers of myocardial injury. RNA sequencing analysis of mouse left ventricle tissue was performed to explore the molecular mechanism of Nutmeg-5 in cardiac remodeling after MI.A total of 27 constituents absorbed into blood were identified in rat plasma following gavage administration of Nutmeg-5 (0.54 g/kg) for 1 h. We found that ventricular remodeling after MI was significantly improved after Nutmeg-5 treatment in mice, which was demonstrated by decreased mortality, better cardiac function, decreased heart weight to body weight and heart weight to tibia length ratios, and attenuated cardiac fibrosis and myocardial injury. RNA sequencing revealed that the protective effect of Nutmeg-5 on cardiac remodeling after MI was associated with improved heart metabolism. Further study found that Nutmeg-5 treatment could preserve the ultrastructure of mitochondria and upregulate gene expression related to mitochondrial function and structure. HIF-1α (hypoxia inducible factor 1, alpha subunit) expression was significantly upregulated in the hearts of MI mice and significantly suppressed in the hearts of Nutmeg-5-treated mice. In addition, Nutmeg-5 treatment significantly activated the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha signaling pathway, which was inhibited in the hearts of MI mice.Nutmeg-5 attenuates cardiac remodeling after MI by improving heart metabolism and preserving mitochondrial dysfunction by inhibiting HIF-1α expression in the mouse heart after MI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInula helenium 3aMyristica fragrans 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aPiper longum 3aRNA 3aSaussurea 3abiomarkers 3ablood proteins 3abody weight 3acardiac output 3acoronary vessels 3aechocardiography 3afibrosis 3agene expression 3aheart 3ahistology 3ahypoxia 3amales 3ametabolism 3amice 3amitochondria 3amodels 3amortality 3amyocardial infarction 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha 3aprotective effect 3arats 3atibia 3aultrastructure 0aNutmeg-5 0aCardiac remodeling 0aHIF-1α1 aYan, Tingting1 aJia, Xin1 aLiu, Jing1 aMa, Ruilian1 aWang, Yi1 aWang, Xianjue1 aLiang, Yabin1 aXiao, Yunfeng1 aDong, Yu0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2022 Mar. 01, v. 285 p.114847-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2021.1148473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02536naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245014400206300001800350506007600368520110400444592002801548506003701576650001701613650002901630650001601659650001601675650001301691650002001704650002101724650002201745650002801767650001401795650001501809700001901824700002201843700003201865773011501897856008102012852000902093655001202102IND60440681520221207065038.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044068152DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-015-1796-12doi7 aPMC45731262pmcid7 a263964212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, Divya10aStudy of kinetic parameters and development of a voltammetric sensor for the determination of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) in oil samples  ap. 6719-6726.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aElectrochemical behavior of artificial antioxidant, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), was investigated at a glassy carbon electrode modified with poly L- cysteine [poly (L- Cys/GCE)]. BHA exhibits a pair of well - defined redox peak on L- cysteine modified GCE with Eₚₐ = 69 mV and Eₚc = 4 mV. The modified electrode showed good electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of BHA under optimal conditions and exhibited a linear response in the range from 1.0 × 10⁻⁵ to 1.0 × 10⁻⁶ M with a correlation coefficient of 0.998. The limit of detection was found to be 4.1 × 10⁻⁷ M. The kinetics parameters of the proposed sensor such as heterogeneous electron transfer rate, k ₛ , and charge transfer coefficient,α, was calculated and found to be 1.20 s⁻¹ and 0.575 respectively. The average surface concentration of BHA on the surface of poly (L- Cys/GCE) was calculated to be 3.18 × 10⁻⁴ mol cm⁻². The analytical utility of the proposed sensor was evaluated by the successful determination of BHA in coconut oil and sesame oil samples.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantioxidants 3abutylated hydroxyanisole 3acoconut oil 3acorrelation 3acysteine 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aglassy carbon electrode 3aoxidation 3asesame oil1 aRasheed, Zafna1 aJagan, Jesny Siri1 aKumar, Krishnapillai Girish0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2015 Oct., v. 52, no. 10 p.6719-6726dSpringer Indiax0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-015-1796-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245009900213300001600312520134400328592002801672596008101700596008301781596007901864650001501943650002401958650002801982650001202010650001102022650001502033650001802048650001302066650002302079650001002102700003202112700002902144700002302173700003002196700002602226773011102252856008302363852000902446655001202455IND60735438820221120053319.0210731e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073543882DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-021-01132-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Mateus Cardoso1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4281-340014aThe enemy within: the effects of mistletoe parasitism on infected and uninfected host branches  ap. 639-645.  aTo comprehend how mistletoes affect their host functioning is a key matter in plant ecology. As yet, it is not clear whether the impact of mistletoes is confined to infected branches or the entire host is compromised as well. Here, we compared leaf functional traits between branches infected by mistletoes (infected), uninfected branches yet close to mistletoe attachment (neighbour), and branches of trees without any mistletoe (control). Our model species pairs were Phoradendron crassifolium infecting Eremanthus erythropappus tree and Psittacanthus robustus infecting Vochysia thyrsoidea tree. The study was carried out in the Brazilian savannah, Cerrado. We found that neighbour branches of E. erythropappus suffered a greater reduction in specific leaf area compared to infected branches. Control branches occupied an intermediary position between infected and neighbour branches. On the other hand, both infected and neighbouring branches of V. thyrsoidea suffered a reduction in carbon assimilation rate compared to control trees. As far as we know, our study is the first to describe the presence of mistletoe affecting the healthy branches neighbouring the mistletoe attachment. This finding sheds light on the need to consider both infected and neighbouring branches when evaluating the effects of parasitism on tropical trees.  aPublisher supplied data  aCRA PPM-00374/13cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais  a478086/2008-3cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  aBP/MS 19/24619-6cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo 3aEremanthus 3aVochysia thyrsoidea 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3acerrado 3aleaves 3aparasitism 3aplant ecology 3asavannas 3aspecific leaf area 3atrees1 aGuimarães, Aretha Franklin1 aTeodoro, Grazielle Sales1 aBastos, Sara Souza1 ade Castro, Evaristo Mauro1 avan den Berg, Eduardo0 tPlant ecology.g2021 May, v. 222, no. 5 p.639-645dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl55230x1385-02377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-021-01132-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245009900207300001600306520137000322592002801692650002201720650003001742650003201772650003801804650002501842650001701867650001101884650001701895650001101912650001101923650003301934650001801967653001401985653002201999653001802021653002502039653002902064653000802093653000802101653000902109653000902118700005902127700003402186700002602220773014702246856008302393852000902476655001202485IND60610306720221117080931.0191231e20180903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061030672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZambrano, Pablo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5499-609110aα1-and β-adrenergic antagonist labetalol induces morphological changes in human erythrocytes  ap. 209-214.  aLabetalol is one of the most used drugs for the treatment of hypertension. This molecule is able to bind to both alpha-1 (α1) and beta (β) adrenergic receptors present in vascular smooth muscle among other tissues. It has been determined that human erythrocytes possess both alpha receptors and beta-adrenergic receptors expressed on their surface. The objective of this work was to study the effect of labetalol on the morphology of human erythrocytes. To accomplish this goal, human erythrocytes and model membranes built of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DMPE) were used. These lipid species are present in the outer and inner monolayers of the red blood cell membrane, respectively. Our findings obtained by X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicate that labetalol interacted with both lipids in a process dependent on concentration. In fact, at low concentrations labetalol preferentially interacted with DMPE. On the other hand, results obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that labetalol alters the normal biconcave form of erythrocytes to stomatocytes and knizocytes (cells with one or more cavities, respectively). According to the bilayers couple hypothesis, this result implied that the drug inserted in the inner monolayer of the human erythrocyte membrane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3abeta adrenergic receptors 3abeta-adrenergic antagonists 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aerythrocyte membrane 3aerythrocytes 3ahumans 3ahypertension 3alipids 3amodels 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asmooth muscle 0aLabetalol 0aHuman erythrocyte 0aCell membrane 0aPhospholipid bilayer 0aβ-adrenergic antagonist 0aSEM 0aDSC 0aDMPC 0aDMPE1 aSuwalsky, Mario1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8289-978X1 aJemiola-Rzeminska, Malgorzata1 aStrzałka, Kazimierz,0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Sept. 03, v. 503, no. 1 p.209-214dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01461naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009100170300001600261500001500277520043400292592002800726650002300754650001600777650000900793650001500802650001500817650001900832650002100851653001800872653001700890773009000907856008200997990002301079852000901102655001201111IND60092896420221122005724.0141103e20130905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009289642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.stem.2013.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaBarge, Mark A.10aBreaking the Canon: Indirect Regulation of Wnt Signaling in Mammary Stem Cells by MMP3  ap. 259-260.  a2019-12-06  aMatrix metalloproteases promote tumor cell invasion, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions, and metastases, but whether they directly regulate stem cells is unknown.

Such avoidance, in turn, affects the optimal enforcement policy. This paper studies how the optimal standard of proof is affected by a specific type of avoidance, namely investments by guilty defendants to mimic innocent individuals. We show that when mimicking is possible the optimal standard of proof is weaker than preponderance of the evidence. This stands in contrast to much of the literature, which shows that non-deterrence costs usually cause the standard of proof to be stronger than preponderance. Thus, it is important not to ignore criminals’ secondary behavior when determining the optimal standard of proof.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomics 3aissues and policy 0aStandard of proof 0aAvoidance 0aMimicking 0aDeterrence 0aEvidence 0aJudicial errors1 aSamuel, Andrew0 tEconomics letters.g2019 Jan., v. 174 p.18-21dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2018.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02664naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245008400161300001600245500001900261500002000280520138000300592002801680650002601708650001101734650000901745650001501754650002301769650002101792650002101813650001501834650001901849650001801868650002001886650001701906650001501923650001701938651001001955700002501965700002401990773012302014856007202137852000902209655001202218IND60701229820221117011518.0200708e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070122982DNAL7 a10.1002/ird.24182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPadhiary, Jagadish10aOptimized irrigation scheduling using swat for improved crop water productivity  ap. 387-397.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe agricultural sector is the largest consumer of the water resources potential of India. The ever‐increasing demand for this finite resource has led to water shortage in the Anandapur sub‐basin of the Baitarani River basin, which comes under the hot and subhumid region of India. The yield of maize, green gram and winter wheat in the basin was simulated for the Rabi season (October–February) using SWAT, considering both rainfed and irrigated scenarios. As observed, water stress progressively increased with a shift in the sowing period of crops from 15 October to 5 November at an interval of 10 days. In the present work, irrigation was scheduled considering the early sowing period, i.e. 15 October. Model performance was evaluated in terms of Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), coefficient of determination (R²) and percentage bias (PBIAS). The performance of the model was found to be satisfactory for crop yield simulation during the calibration and validation periods. An optimal irrigation strategy was analysed considering three irrigation settings, i.e. S₂ (sufficient irrigation), S₃ (50% depletion of available water content, i.e. AWC) and S₄ (70% depletion of AWC). The reduction in crop yield in S₄ (deficit irrigation) was found to be relatively insignificant compared to full irrigation under scenario S₂. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3abasins 3acorn 3acrop yield 3adeficit irrigation 3airrigation rates 3amodel validation 3amung beans 3asubhumid zones 3awater content 3awater shortages 3awater stress 3awatersheds 3awinter wheat 3aIndia1 aSwain, Janaki Ballav1 aPatra, Kanhu charan0 tIrrigation and drainage.g2020 July, v. 69, no. 3 p.387-397dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl69714x1531-03537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ird.24183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245010300174300001400277520108900291592002801380650000901408650001201417650002101429650001201450650001001462650001101472650002201483650001301505650002301518650001901541650002001560650003401580650001201614650001401626650002401640650002001664650001101684650001501695700002901710700002401739773008701763856008601850852000901936655001201945IND50067573220221118011810.0141111e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006757322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.08.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Yuan H. Brad10aEffect of calcium lactate on m-calpain activity and protein degradation under oxidising conditions  ap. 73-78.  aIn two experiments, the effects of calcium lactate (CAL) on calpain activity were determined. In the model system, purified porcine skeletal muscle m-calpain was pre-incubated with various combinations of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), calcium chloride, and/or different CAL concentrations. The m-calpain was activated by CAL, and the extent of m-calpain oxidation by H₂O₂ was significantly decreased with increasing CAL concentrations. In the muscle system, a beef longissimus lumborum (1day postmortem) from each carcass (n=6) was cut in half, randomly assigned to either 0.2M CAL or water injection (WAT), and then packaged in a high-oxygen modified atmosphere. The CAL injected steaks resulted in less intact desmin and greater production of a 30-kDa troponin-T compared to the steaks in the WAT group. The CAL injection did not affect colour and lipid oxidation of steaks during display. These results suggest that CAL addition may improve tenderness of meat by enhancing activation of endogenous calpain and by protecting against calpain oxidation under oxidative conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3acalcium 3acalcium chloride 3acalpain 3acolor 3adesmin 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alactates 3alipid peroxidation 3ameat carcasses 3ameat tenderness 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3amuscles 3aoxidation 3aprotein degradation 3askeletal muscle 3asteaks 3atroponin T1 aHuff-Lonergan, Elisabeth1 aLonergan, Steven M.0 tFood chemistry.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 131, no. 1 p.73-78dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.08.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03505naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245009900173300001600272500001500288520194000303592002802243650001402271650001502285650001202300650001302312650001102325650002602336650001402362650001502376650002202391650001602413650001202429650001202441650002502453650002202478650001702500650001602517650001202533650001002545653002702555653002102582653001502603653002202618653001802640653001702658653001602675653002202691700002102713773012502734856008302859852000902942655001202951IND60532393120221121230955.0190318e20140115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053239312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2013.10.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosa García, Rocío10aRole of floral resources in the conservation of pollinator communities in cider-apple orchards  ap. 118-126.  a2019-12-06  aPollinators are generally assumed to be in decline but a proper habitat management could help to conserve pollination services. In 2012 we surveyed the groundcover in nine cider-apple orchards to (I) identify the floral and faunal communities present in the ground floor, (II) assess the attractiveness of the local spontaneous flowers to insects and (III) determine the role that the flower community may play for the conservation of the associated arthropods in general and of pollinators in particular. The apple orchards provided a continuous succession of floral resources in the groundcover with differences among orchards in the abundance, richness and diversity of flowers. Flowering plant species were visited by a wide variety of insects, mostly from the orders Hymenoptera (70%) and Diptera (25%). Wild bees accounted for 27% of hymenopterans and hoverflies for 30% of dipterans. Flowering plants differed in the number of taxa they attracted and in their attractiveness for particular insect groups and for insects as a whole. A total of 16,159 arthropods were collected from the groundcover, and 2064 individuals belonged to taxa involved in the pollination. Pollinators and arthropods (exemplified by hemipterans and coleopterans) differed between orchards and periods and were affected by the plant community. Plant species richness and the abundance of some plant species favored the presence of both pollinators and arthropod assemblages while flower abundance had only a marginal effect on those communities. Pollinators were also affected by plant diversity. Among-orchard differences in the plant community suggest that management recommendations must be site-specific to ensure the permanent availability of diverse floral resources for the arthropod community and for pollinators in particular. Therefore, a proper groundcover management could provide benefits for apple growers by improving pollination services.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSyrphidae 3aColeoptera 3agrowers 3aorchards 3aapples 3aarthropod communities 3aHemiptera 3aarthropods 3aplant communities 3apollinators 3aflowers 3aApoidea 3ahabitat conservation 3aspecies diversity 3aAngiospermae 3apollination 3ainsects 3afauna 0aGroundcover management 0aFlowering plants 0aArthropods 0aEcosystem service 0aMagnoliophyta 0aBiodiversity 0aPollination 0aMalus x domestica1 aMiñarro, Marcos0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2014 Jan. 15, v. 183 p.118-126dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2013.10.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245009100161300001600252500002000268520171500288592002802003596006502031596005502096650000802151650001702159650002102176650002002197650001202217650005202229650001402281700002402295700002002319700002202339773013302361856007602494852000902570655001202579IND60786386620221118205615.0220803e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078638662DNAL7 a10.3732/ajb.16003032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshikawa, Naoko10aMolecular bases for phyllomorph development in a one‐leaf plant, Monophyllaea glabra  ap. 233-240.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPREMISE OF THE STUDY: The aboveground part of one‐leaf plants (Gesneriaceae) consists of a unique shoot‐like unit called a phyllomorph, which is composed of a growing lamina and one petiolode (a stem‐ and petiole‐like organ). The phyllomorph has three meristems: a basal meristem (BM; involved in lamina growth), a petiolode meristem (PM; required for midrib and petiolode growth), and a groove meristem (GM; contributes to inflorescence and new phyllomorph development). Although the GM has a tunica‐corpus structure like a conventional shoot apical meristem (SAM), the vegetative GM of a one‐leaf plant does not form any organ primordia and has been considered a defective or suppressed SAM. In this study, we evaluated the nature of the three meristems to reconsider their roles in phyllomorph development in the one‐leaf species Monophyllaea glabra. METHODS: Mitotic activities of meristem cells were monitored by incorporation of a thymidine analog (EdU) into DNA. Orthologs of SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM) and PHANTASTICA, ROUGH SHEATH2, ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (PHAN/RS2/AS1) were isolated from M. glabra, and their expression patterns were investigated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in combination with a laser microdissection technique. KEY RESULTS: Mitotic activities were detected in all three phyllomorph meristems. Strong expression of the STM and PHAN/RS2/AS1 orthologs was detected in the vegetative GM and BM, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The vegetative GM is an active meristem that expresses the STM ortholog. We postulate that the GM is required for growth of a phyllomorph by providing undifferentiated cells and/or growth regulators to the BM and/or PM.  aPublisher supplied data  a25113002cMonbusho International Scientific Research Program  cMinistry of Education, Science, and Culture, Japan 3aDNA 3aGesneriaceae 3aapical meristems 3amicrodissection 3amitosis 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3athymidine1 aTakahashi, Hirokazu1 aNakazono, Mikio1 aTsukaya, Hirokazu0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2017 Feb., v. 104, no. 2 p.233-240dBotanical Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44651x0002-91227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.16003033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04236naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002600192245011600218300001600334500001500350506007600365520237200441592002802813506003702841650002102878650001702899650000802916650002602924650002402950650000902974650003002983650001103013650002103024650001703045650001503062650001903077650003003096650002603126650001003152650002203162653002003184653001003204653002603214653001503240653001403255653002403269653001603293700002303309700002103332700001703353700002103370700001803391773011803409856008603527852000903613655001203622IND60535894220221207115249.0190318e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053589422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2014.11.0162doi7 aPMC42728162pmcid7 a254817852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAluru, Neelakanteswar10aTargeted mutagenesis of aryl hydrocarbon receptor 2a and 2b genes in Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus)  ap. 192-201.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUnderstanding molecular mechanisms of toxicity is facilitated by experimental manipulations, such as disruption of function by gene targeting, that are especially challenging in non-standard model species with limited genomic resources. While loss-of-function approaches have included gene knock-down using morpholino-modified oligonucleotides and random mutagenesis using mutagens or retroviruses, more recent approaches include targeted mutagenesis using zinc finger nuclease (ZFN), transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALENs) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 technology. These latter methods provide more accessible opportunities to explore gene function in non-traditional model species. To facilitate evaluation of toxic mechanisms for important categories of aryl hydrocarbon pollutants, whose actions are known to be receptor mediated, we used ZFN and CRISPR-Cas9 approaches to generate aryl hydrocarbon receptor 2a (AHR2a) and AHR2b gene mutations in Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) embryos. This killifish is a particularly valuable non-traditional model, with multiple paralogs of AHR whose functions are not well characterized. In addition, some populations of this species have evolved resistance to toxicants such as halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons. AHR-null killifish will be valuable for characterizing the role of the individual AHR paralogs in evolved resistance, as well as in normal development. We first used five-finger ZFNs targeting exons 1 and 3 of AHR2a. Subsequently, CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNAs were designed to target regions in exon 2 and 3 of AHR2a and AHR2b. We successfully induced frameshift mutations in AHR2a exon 3 with ZFN and CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNAs, with mutation frequencies of 10% and 16%, respectively. In AHR2b, mutations were induced using CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNAs targeting sites in both exon 2 (17%) and exon 3 (63%). We screened AHR2b exon 2 CRISPR-Cas9-injected embryos for off-target effects in AHR paralogs. No mutations were observed in closely related AHR genes (AHR1a, AHR1b, AHR2a, AHRR) in the CRISPR-Cas9-injected embryos. Overall, our results demonstrate that targeted genome-editing methods are efficient in inducing mutations at specific loci in embryos of a non-traditional model species, without detectable off-target effects in paralogous genes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aoligonucleotides 3aRetroviridae 3aRNA 3aFundulus heteroclitus 3aframeshift mutation 3aloci 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amodels 3atoxic substances 3amutagenicity 3apollutants 3agene targeting 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3aexons 3azinc finger motif 0aGene knock-outs 0agenes 0aZinc finger nucleases 0aAdaptation 0aMummichog 0aNon-model organisms 0aCRISPR-Cas91 aKarchner, Sibel I.1 aFranks, Diana G.1 aNacci, Diane1 aChamplin, Denise1 aHahn, Mark E.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2015 Jan., v. 158 p.192-201dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2014.11.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245009000175300001400265520122400279592002801503596005201531650000801583650001901591650001201610650001601622650001701638650001601655650000701671650003001678650002701708650001301735650001801748650002201766650002001788651001801808700001601826700001601842773012701858856008101985852000902066655001202075IND60627242820221122053002.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062724282DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-018-1574-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaudhary, Dhiraj Kumar10aFlavobacterium dasani sp. nov., a psychrotolerant bacterium isolated from Arctic soil  ap. 81-86.  aA novel yellow-colored, Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, non-motile, catalase- and oxidase-positive, and rod-shaped psychrotolerant bacterium, designated strain PLR-18-3ᵀ, was isolated from Arctic soil and was subjected to polyphasic taxonomic study.

However, the consequences of afforestation for soil nitrogen (N) dynamics remain poorly quantified. We investigated soil net N mineralization and nitrification rates as well as the inorganic N (NH4+-N and NO3−-N) concentration in the top soil (0–10cm) in a woodland, shrubland and adjacent cropland in the Danjiangkou Reservoir region of central China using the in situ closed-top tube incubation technique over one year. Afforestation significantly decreased the soil net N mineralization rate and soil inorganic N concentration but increased the soil NH4+-N concentration and soil ammonification rate. The major form of soil inorganic N was NO3−-N in the cropland versus NH4+-N in the woodland. The soil net N mineralization and nitrification rates were more sensitive to soil moisture than to soil temperature and were positively correlated with soil moisture. In contrast, the soil net N mineralization and nitrification rates were negatively related to SOC and the C:N ratio. These results suggest that afforestation could decrease N mineralization and availability due to increasing the recalcitrant C input and plant N uptake, which might in turn cause progressive N limitation over the long term.  aPublisher supplied data 3aafforestation 3aammonification 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acorrelation 3acropland 3amineralization 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen cycle 3ashrublands 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3atopsoil 3awoodlands 3aChina 0aAfforestation 0aDanjiangkou Reservoir 0aLand use change 0aNet N mineralization rate 0aNitrification rate 0aSoil inorganic N1 aZhou, Xuhui1 aZhang, Quanfa1 aCheng, Xiaoli0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2014 Jan. 15, v. 183 p.40-46dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2013.10.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04448naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245015400163300001800317500001900335520236200354592002802716650004302744650002702787650001902814650001802833650001602851650003502867650001302902650003502915650002002950650001602970650001602986650001603002650001603018650001003034650003703044650001003081650001403091650001403105650003003119650001803149650002203167650001603189650001803205650002103223650001603244653003703260653002803297653002903325700002303354700001903377700002103396700002203417700002203439700002203461700001703483700001803500773018403518856007503702852000903777655001203786IND60691896820221120054349.0200502e20010101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069189682DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.65.17482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTAKEUCHI, Hisanao10aComparative Effects of Dietary Fat Types on Hepatic Enzyme Activities Related to the Synthesis and Oxidation of Fatty Acid and to Lipogenesis in Rats  ap. 1748-1754.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe effects of different types of dietary fat on the activities of hepatic enzymes related to fatty acid synthesis {glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase ACC)}, oxidation {acyl-CoA synthetase (AST), carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT), and peroxisomal β-oxidation (P βOX)}, and lipogenesis {phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (PAP), diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT), and phosphocholine diacylglycerol transferase (PCDGT)}, and plasma and liver lipid levels were investigated in male Wistar rats. The animals were 6 weeks old and about 120 g of body weight, and were fed on test diets containing 20% of a mixture of tripalmitin, tristearin and corn oil (SFA), olive oil (OLI), sunflower oil (SUN), linseed oil (LIS), and sardine oil (SAR) for 2 weeks. The concentrations of plasma total cholesterol (T-CHOL), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-CHOL), triacylglycerol (TG) and phospholipid (PL) were generally higher in the rats fed on SEA and OLI than in those given SUN, LIS and SAR. The rats fed on OLI had a higher level of liver T-CHOL than those fed on the other fats. The liver TG content was nearly higher from the intake of SFA and OLI than from SUN, LIS and SAR, although the liver PL level was not affected by the type of dietary fat. The SFA and OLI groups had the highest activities of hepatic G6PDH and ACC, and the SAR group, the lowest activities. The activities of AST and CPT, and peroxisomal P βOX in the liver were higher in the rats fed on the LIS and SAR diets than in those given the other diets. The hepatic PAP activity was higher from the intake of OLI and SUN, and tended to be higher from SFA than from LIS and SAR. The activity of liver DGAT was higher from SFA and inclined to be higher from OLI, SUN, and LIS than from SAR, while the PCDGT activity in the liver was not effected by the type of dietary fat. The concentrations of plasma and liver TG were generally positively correlated with the activities of liver enzymes related to the synthesis of fatty acids and lipids, and negatively with those involved in fatty acid oxidation. Based on these results, it is suggested that the levels of plasma and liver TG were controlled by different types of dietary fat through changes in the hepatic enzyme activities related to fatty acid synthesis, lipogenesis, and fatty acid oxidation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3abeta oxidation 3abiotechnology 3abody weight 3acarnitine palmitoyltransferase 3acorn oil 3adiacylglycerol acyltransferase 3adiacylglycerols 3adietary fat 3afatty acids 3alinseed oil 3alipogenesis 3aliver 3along-chain-fatty-acid-CoA ligase 3amales 3aolive oil 3aoxidation 3aphosphatidate phosphatase 3aphospholipids 3aphosphorylcholine 3asardine oil 3asunflower oil 3atriacylglycerols 3atripalmitin 0aenzymes for fatty acid synthesis 0aenzymes for lipogenesis 0aenzymes for β-oxidation1 aNakamoto, Takeshi,1 aMORI, Yoshiaki1 aKAWAKAMI, Masako1 aMABUCHI, Hiroyuki1 aOHISHI, Yoshinori1 aICHIKAWA, Natsuko1 aKOIKE, Akiko1 aMASUDA, Keiko0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2001 Jan. 1, v. 65, no. 8 p.1748-1754dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.65.17483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007500169300001600244520170800260592002801968596007401996650001202070650001902082650002602101650001102127650002502138650002402163773012402187856008202311852000902393655001202402IND60631667320221119051307.0190512e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063166732DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-018-4146-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBröcker, Jochen,10aWhat is the correct cost functional for variational data assimilation?  ap. 389-399.  aVariational approaches to data assimilation, and weakly constrained four dimensional variation (WC-4DVar) in particular, are important in the geosciences but also in other communities (often under different names). The cost functions and the resulting optimal trajectories may have a probabilistic interpretation, for instance by linking data assimilation with maximum aposteriori (MAP) estimation. This is possible in particular if the unknown trajectory is modelled as the solution of a stochastic differential equation (SDE), as is increasingly the case in weather forecasting and climate modelling. In this situation, the MAP estimator (or “most probable path” of the SDE) is obtained by minimising the Onsager–Machlup functional. Although this fact is well known, there seems to be some confusion in the literature, with the energy (or “least squares”) functional sometimes been claimed to yield the most probable path. The first aim of this paper is to address this confusion and show that the energy functional does not, in general, provide the most probable path. The second aim is to discuss the implications in practice. Although the mentioned results pertain to stochastic models in continuous time, they do have consequences in practice where SDE’s are approximated by discrete time schemes. It turns out that using an approximation to the SDE and calculating its most probable path does not necessarily yield a good approximation to the most probable path of the SDE proper. This suggest that even in discrete time, a version of the Onsager–Machlup functional should be used, rather than the energy functional, at least if the solution is to be interpreted as a MAP estimator.  aPublisher supplied data  aEP/L012669/1cEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (GB) 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3adifferential equation 3aenergy 3astochastic processes 3aweather forecasting0 tClimate dynamics.g2019 Jan., v. 52, no. 1-2 p.389-399dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4146-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245006500170300001400235500001900249520138100268592002801649650001101677650001801688650000901706650001801715650001701733653002601750653002501776653002501801653001301826653002301839653002101862773011601883856008501999852000902084655001202093IND60694029420221119173549.0200509e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069402942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.01.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDruker, Eugene10aAirborne gamma-ray spectra processing: Extracting photopeaks  ap. 22-31.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe acquisition of information from the airborne gamma-ray spectra is based on the ability to evaluate photopeak areas in regular spectra from natural and other sources. In airborne gamma-ray spectrometry, extraction of photopeaks of radionuclides from regular one-second spectra is a complex problem. In the region of higher energies, difficulties are associated with low signal level, i.e. low count rates, whereas at lower energies difficulties are associated with high noises due to a high signal level. In this article, a new procedure is proposed for processing the measured spectra up to and including the extraction of evident photopeaks. The procedure consists of reducing the noise in the energy channels along the flight lines, transforming the spectra into the spectra of equal resolution, removing the background from each spectrum, sharpening the details, and transforming the spectra back to the original energy scale. The resulting spectra are better suited for examining and using the photopeaks. No assumptions are required regarding the number, locations, and magnitudes of photopeaks. The procedure does not generate negative photopeaks. The resolution of the spectrometer is used for the purpose. The proposed methodology, apparently, will contribute also to study environmental problems, soil characterization, and other near-surface geophysical methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aradioactivity 3asoil 3aspectrometers 3aspectroscopy 0aAirborne spectrometry 0aPhotopeak extracting 0aPhotopeak sharpening 0aBaseline 0aCompton background 0aEqual resolution0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2018 July, v. 187 p.22-31dElsevier LtdwJournal:2014x0265-931X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.01.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03465naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013400165300001600299520172700315592002802042650002002070650001702090650001702107650001602124650001702140650002002157650001802177650003602195650001002231650001802241650001902259650002202278650004002300650002502340650003002365650001602395650001702411650002202428650000902450650001702459650002102476653001702497653001902514653001702533653002002550700001202570700001602582700001802598700001802616700001602634773014602650856008202796852000902878655001202887IND60628040920221116194939.0190129e20180415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062804092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.03.0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yanmao10aBeneficial effects of paeoniflorin on osteoporosis induced by high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet-associated hyperlipidemia in vivo  ap. 981-987.  aOsteoporosis is linked to reduced bone mineral density (BMD) as a major risk factor for fragility fractures. Recent studies indicated an association between BMD and abnormally elevated lipid levels in blood as common indicators for hyperlipidemia. In this study, we assessed the protective effect of paeoniflorin, a phytochemical compound with multiple pharmacological activities, against hyperlipidemia-induced osteoporosis in rats fed a high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet (HCHF). The special diet-fed rats were subjected to an 8-week treatment with either paeoniflorin (20 mg/kg, daily) or vehicle. The control group received a normal diet during the entire study. At study conclusion, serum markers of lipid metabolism and bone turnover were measured. Bone strength was assessed by biomechanical testing, and femurs were scanned using micro-computed tomography to analyze trabecular and cortical bone structure. Interestingly, paeoniflorin controlled the serum lipid profile by significantly decreasing HCHF-induced high levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Paeoniflorin significantly improved trabecular and cortical parameters as well as femur length and width that were negatively affected by HCHF diet. Biomechanical strength testing showed that femurs of HCHF diet-fed rats endured significantly lower force but higher displacement and strain than those of control rats, whereas paeoniflorin reversed the negative effects. Moreover, paeoniflorin rescued osteoblast differentiation and cell spreading activities along with bone turnover markers. In conclusion, HCHF-induced hyperlipidemia caused adverse effects on the bone that were rescued by paeoniflorin treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abiomechanics 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3abone density 3abone metabolism 3abone strength 3achemical constituents of plants 3afemur 3ahigh fat diet 3ahyperlipidemia 3alipid composition 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3amedicinal properties 3amicro-computed tomography 3aosteoblasts 3aosteoporosis 3aprotective effect 3arats 3arisk factors 3atriacylglycerols 0aPaeoniflorin 0aHyperlipidemia 0aOsteoporosis 0aBone remodeling1 aZhu, Yu1 aLu, Shengdi1 aHu, Chengfang1 aZhong, Wanrun1 aChai, Yimin0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Apr. 15, v. 498, no. 4 p.981-987dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.03.0933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02724naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245011300203300001600316520155500332592002801887650001201915650001201927650001201939650001901951650002601970650001501996650002202011650001902033650001502052650001102067650003002078650000902108700001802117773012402135856008202259852000902341655001202350IND60631667420221119051530.0190512e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063166742DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-018-4136-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Haikun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1771-146110aOn the relationship between ENSO and tropical cyclones in the western North Pacific during the boreal summer  ap. 275-288.  aThe present paper uses the satellite era data from 1979 to 2015 to examine the relationship between El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and tropical cyclones (TCs) in the western North Pacific (WNP) during the boreal summer from June to August. It is found that WNP TC variability is characterized by two major feature changes: (1) a significant reduction of the TC number since 1998 and (2) a stronger interannual relationship between ENSO and TCs since 1998. Results suggested that such changes are largely due to the synergy effects of a shifting ENSO and the Pacific climate regime shift. Since 1998 with a cool Pacific decadal oscillation phase switching from a warm phase, more La Niña and central Pacific (CP) El Niño events occur. The decreased low-level relative vorticity and increased vertical wind shear during 1998–2015 compared to 1979–1997 are responsible for the TC reduction. The stronger interannual relationship between ENSO and TCs since 1998 is closely associated the change of CP sea surface temperature. It enhances the associations of environmental factors including vertical wind shear and mid-level relative humidity with TCs and thus increases the interannual relationship between ENSO and TCs. These two feature changes also manifest in the mean TC genesis location, with a northwestward shift of the TC genesis location during 1998–2015 and an increased relation to El Niño Modoki index since 1998. This study has an important implication for TC outlooks in the WNP based on climate predictions and projections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aLa Nina 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3aenvironmental factors 3ahurricanes 3arelative humidity 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asummer 3asurface water temperature 3awind1 aWang, Chunzai0 tClimate dynamics.g2019 Jan., v. 52, no. 1-2 p.275-288dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4136-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03346naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245011600208300001400324520145300338592002801791650001601819650002501835650002101860650002101881650001801902650001801920650000901938650001601947650000901963650001401972650001501986650001302001650000902014650002602023650002102049650001802070650001702088650002802105650001802133650004302151650005202194650001302246650001902259650002002278650003202298650001302330650002002343653001802363653001402381653002102395653003002416653001102446700002002457700001802477700001702495773010102512856008602613852000902699655001202708IND60535894420221122203702.0190318e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053589442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2014.11.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wen-Der1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2647-265810aAryl hydrocarbon receptor 2 mediates the toxicity of Paclobutrazol on the digestive system of zebrafish embryos  ap. 13-22.  aPaclobutrazol (PBZ), a trazole-containing fungicide and plant growth retardant, has been widely used for over 30 years to regulate plant growth and promote early fruit setting. Long-term usage of PBZ in agriculture and natural environments has resulted in residual PBZ in the soil and water. Chronic exposure to waterborne PBZ can cause various physiological effects in fish, including hepatic steatosis, antioxidant activity, and disruption of spermatogenesis. We have previously shown that PBZ also affects the rates of zebrafish embryonic survival and hatching, and causes developmental failure of the head skeleton and eyes; here, we further show that PBZ has embryonic toxic effects on digestive organs of zebrafish, and describe the underlying mechanisms. PBZ treatment of embryos resulted in dose-dependent morphological and functional abnormalities of the digestive organs. Real-time RT-PCR and in situ hybridization were used to show that PBZ strongly induces cyp1a1 expression in the digestive system, and slightly induces ahr2 expression in zebrafish embryos. Knockdown of ahr2 with morpholino oligonucleotides prevents PBZ toxicity. Thus, the toxic effect of PBZ on digestive organs is mediated by AhR2, as was previously reported for retene and TCDD. These findings have implications for understanding the potential toxicity of PBZ during embryogenesis, and thus the potential impact of fungicides on public health and the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aantioxidant activity 3achronic exposure 3adigestive system 3adose response 3aembryogenesis 3aeyes 3afatty liver 3afish 3afruit set 3afungicides 3ahatching 3ahead 3ain situ hybridization 3aoligonucleotides 3apaclobutrazol 3aplant growth 3aplant growth substances 3apublic health 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3askeleton 3asoil pollution 3aspermatogenesis 3atetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin 3atoxicity 3awater pollution 0aPaclobutrazol 0aZebrafish 0aDigestive organs 0aAryl hydrocarbon receptor 0aCyp1a11 aChen, Guan-Ting1 aHsu, Hwei-Jan1 aWu, Chang-Yi0 tAquatic toxicology.g2015 Feb., v. 159 p.13-22dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2014.11.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01841naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007400169300001400243520068200257592002800939650002100967650001200988650001101000650001601011653000801027653000801035653000801043653000801051653000801059653002701067653002201094653001901116653002601135653002901161653003101190700001901221773009601240856008601336852000901422655001201431IND60626485320221119114121.0190325e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062648532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2018.10.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jin Yeub10aDoes higher firm profit dispersion reflect greater micro uncertainty?  ap. 35-38.  aCountercyclical dispersion of firm outcomes (micro dispersion) is commonly used as a proxy for micro uncertainty. In this paper, we characterize conditions under which micro dispersion and micro uncertainty co-move positively in the context of a large Cournot economy with dispersed information and a financial market that aggregates private information. We also show that the parameter region supporting the positive co-movement shrinks when (1) public signal is endogenous through financial asset prices or (2) strategic substitutability in firms’ output decisions is weak. Our analysis raises a cautionary note on using micro dispersion as a measure of uncertainty shocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3afinancial assets 3amarkets 3aprices 3auncertainty 0aD82 0aD83 0aE32 0aG12 0aG14 0aFirm profit dispersion 0aMicro uncertainty 0aCournot market 0aDispersed information 0aEndogenous public signal 0aStrategic substitutability1 aShim, Myungkyu0 tEconomics letters.g2019 Mar., v. 176 p.35-38dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2018.10.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245013000170300001600300520110900316592002801425650004401453650002701497650002601524650001601550650003701566650001501603650002901618650002801647650001301675650001501688650001801703650001301721650001501734650001301749650002901762650003301791650002301824650001901847653001401866653001101880653001501891653002701906653001801933700001701951700001801968700002001986700001502006700001402021700001802035700001502053700002302068773010802091856008602199852000902285655001202294IND60553017820221119143511.0170607e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055301782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.01.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorrêa, G.G.10aEffects of the sol–gel route on the structural characteristics and antibacterial activity of silica-encapsulated gentamicin  ap. 510-517.  aThe effects of sol–gel processes, i.e., acid-catalyzed gelation, base-catalyzed gelation and base-catalyzed precipitation routes, on the encapsulation of gentamicin were investigated. The resulting xerogels were characterized using a series of complementary instrumental techniques, i.e., the adsorption/desorption of nitrogen, small-angle X-ray scattering, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The encapsulated gentamicin samples were tested against a series of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. The best antimicrobial activity was observed with the encapsulated gentamicin that was prepared via the precipitation route, even in comparison with the neat antibiotic, especially in the case of the Gram-positive strain Staphylococcus aureus. The gentamicin concentration on the outermost surface and the zeta potential were identified as factors that affected the highest efficiency, as observed in the case of encapsulation via the base-catalyzed process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aantibacterial properties 3aatomic force microscopy 3acolloids 3adesorption 3aencapsulation 3agelation 3agentamicin 3anitrogen 3areflectance spectroscopy 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asol-gel processing 3azeta potential 0aSol–gel 0aSilica 0aGentamicin 0aAntibacterial activity 0aEncapsulation1 aMorais, E.C.1 aBrambilla, R.1 aBernardes, A.A.1 aRadtke, C.1 aDezen, D.1 aJúnior, A.V.1 aFronza, N.1 aSantos, J.H.Z.

The detection of long-lived actinide isotopes and possibly the identification of their origin is particularly interesting and valuable if ultrasensitive measurement of the relative abundance of U isotopes is performed via Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS). In this paper we present an investigation carried out on the structural materials of the Garigliano NPP aiming to determine the abundance of ²³⁵,²³⁶,²³⁸U in the various compartments of the plant buildings under decommissioning. Since the expected values both for isotopic ratios and total U concentrations range over different orders of magnitude, we have developed a novel methodology for the measurement of ²³⁴,²³⁵U/²³⁸U isotopic ratios in low U concentration samples. This allowed a systematic investigation of the distribution of all U isotopes in concrete and metal matrices of the NPP. The behavior of ²³⁵,²³⁶U/²³⁸U isotopic ratios in the different compartments of the NPP is discussed. The correlation of these ratios with ⁶⁰Co and ¹³⁷Cs specific activities is also studied to show a different behavior for concrete and metal samples. These data represent a very valuable information to direct the decommissioning procedures under course.  aPublisher supplied data 3acesium radioisotopes 3aconcrete 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear power 3apower plants 3aradioactivity 0aAccelerator mass spectrometry 0aNuclear power plants 0aActinides1 aBuompane, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3369-94231 aD'Onofrio, A.1 aEsposito, A.1 aGialanella, L.1 aMarzaioli, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2676-40551 aPetraglia, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8409-37391 aPorzio, G.1 aSabbarese, C.1 aScolamacchia, F.1 aSirignano, C.0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2018 July, v. 187 p.144-150dElsevier LtdwJournal:2014x0265-931X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.01.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245015500167300001600322520110500338592002801443650002801471650001301499650001601512650001801528650001701546650002101563650001901584650001801603650001601621650001901637650000701656650001701663650001101680650001601691650001301707653002601720653001301746653001601759653001701775653001701792700001801809700001301827773010801840856008601948852000902034655001202043IND60553017920221119143253.0170607e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055301792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.01.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGui, Rijun10aEmbedding fluorescent mesoporous silica nanoparticles into biocompatible nanogels for tumor cell imaging and thermo/pH-sensitive in vitro drug release  ap. 518-525.  aThermo/pH-sensitive/fluorescent/biocompatible nanospheres consisting of quantum dots-embedded mesoporous silica nanoparticles (Q-MS) as a core and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM))-graft-chitosan (CS) nanogels as a shell (PNIPAM-g-CS) were prepared via temperature-regulated one-pot copolymerization of NIPAM monomer and CS in the presence of Q-MS. The prepared nanospheres exhibited remarkable fluorescence/thermo/pH-sensitivity. HepG2 cells treated with nanospheres displayed bright fluorescence imaging. Loading efficiency and capacity of Doxorubicin (Dox) into nanospheres were regularly increased with the increment of Dox concentration. At a high temperature and a low pH, cumulative in vitro release of Dox from Dox-loaded nanospheres was much great and fast. Released Dox still retained high anticancer activity, and blank nanosphere carriers produced neglectful toxicity to HepG2 cells.

The dynamical response is generally in good agreement with the Gill–Matsuno theory. The mechanisms analyzed are (1) the stabilization of the tropical troposphere outside the heating region, (2) the Walker circulation modification and (3) Ekman pumping induced by the low-level circulation responses. It is demonstrated that all three mechanisms, and in particular (2) and (3), contribute to the remote rainfall teleconnections. However, mechanism (3) best coincides with the overall horizontal structure of rainfall responses. It is shown by using the models boundary layer parameterization that low-level vertical velocities are indeed caused by Ekman pumping and that this induces vertical velocities in the whole tropospheric column through convective feedbacks. Also the modification of the responses due to the presence of idealized warm pools is investigated. It is shown that warm pools modify the speed of the tropical waves, consistent with Doppler shifts and are thus able to modify the Walker circulation adjustments and remote rainfall responses. The sensitivity of the responses, and in particular the importance of the Ekman pumping mechanism, to large variations in the drag coefficient is also tested, and it is shown that the Ekman pumping mechanism is robust for a wide range of values.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adrag coefficient 3aheat 3amodels 3arain 3asurface water temperature 3atroposphere1 aKucharski, Fred0 tClimate dynamics.g2019 Jan., v. 52, no. 1-2 p.697-711dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4169-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03532naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245008600172300001400258520199400272592002802266650001902294650002302313650001702336650001202353650001102365650002502376650001702401650002402418650001302442650002302455650001702478650001602495650001302511650002202524650001502546650001702561650002002578650001302598650001202611650001502623651001402638653003302652653001802685653001802703653001102721700002202732700002102754773012302775856008302898852000902981655001202990IND60532393620221122015836.0190318e20140115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053239362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2013.10.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD’Acunto, Luciana10aUncropped field margins to mitigate soil carbon losses in agricultural landscapes  ap. 60-68.  aAgricultural intensification is a major cause of habitat transformation. Continuous cropping alters ecosystem services, such as biodiversity and carbon sequestration. Empirical evidence from agricultural lands in Argentina has shown that permanently vegetated areas imbedded in the agricultural matrix (uncropped margins) play a critical role in plant and animal communities compared to the usual situation of crops surrounded by other crops (cultivated margins). However, the potential impact of uncropped margins on their own carbon stocks and fluxes and on those of their neighbouring cropped fields remains unknown. We investigated the impact of uncropped (herbaceous and woody) and cropped margins (cultivated fields) on their own topsoil carbon stocks and fluxes and on those of their neighbouring croplands (soybean fields). We identified soybean fields adjacent to one of three possible margin types: herbaceous or woody permanent vegetation, and field crop, which acted as control because it is the most frequent situation in the region. In each of these margin–soybean pairs, we sampled transects from the margin towards the centre of the soybean field (50m). Woody margins showed the greatest soil carbon content, the least decomposable plant litter and the greatest influence on the neighbouring crop. Conversely, herbaceous margins had the lowest litter accumulation and the most decomposable litter. Only woody margins influenced soil properties in the first metres of the cropped neighbourhood. Centres of soybean fields were similar, irrespective of margin type. The decomposition of common substrates was not affected by margin type. These findings suggest that woody margins are the unique element of the current landscape with a potential to mitigate soil carbon loss from agroecosystems, albeit spatially limited. In contrast, the low biomass and highly decomposable litter of herbaceous margins reveal the urgent need to re-think their current management strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecosystems 3aanimal communities 3abiodiversity 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3acontinuous cropping 3acropland 3aecosystem services 3aedge effects 3afield crops 3ahabitats 3aintensive farming 3alandscapes 3aplant litter 3asoil properties 3asoybeans 3atopsoil 3avegetation 3aArgentina 0aAgricultural intensification 0aField margins 0aDecomposition 0aPampas1 aSemmartin, María1 aGhersa, Claudio,0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2014 Jan. 15, v. 183 p.60-68dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2013.10.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245008500174300001600259520132100275592002801596650002101624650004401645650003501689650001801724650001201742650001601754650001601770650001201786650003701798650001701835650001301852650001501865650001101880650000701891650003401898650003301932650001501965650002301980650001502003653002202018700002502040700002502065773011302090856008502203852000902288655001202297IND60696820120221119082351.0200601e20200527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069682012DNAL7 a10.1080/02757540.2020.17521992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoawad, Madelyn N.10aBiosorption of cadmium and nickel ions using marine macrophyte, Cymodocea nodosa  ap. 458-474.  aSeagrass (Cymodocea nodosa) ability to remove cadmium and nickel ions from single metal solutions was investigated in the present study. Metal ions were measured in the solution using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Various operational parameters (initial pH, biomass dose, metal ion concentration, and contact time) were tested and found to affect the uptake capacity of Cd (II) and Ni (II). More than 70% of biosorption capacity occurred in the first few minutes for both metal ions. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir model were found to best fit the experimental data of Cd (II) and Ni (II) biosorption. The maximum uptake capacity (qₘₐₓ) was 11.6 and 16.7 mg.g⁻¹ for Cd (II) and Ni (II), respectively. The biosorbent was characterised using Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The infrared spectrum demonstrated that hydroxyl, carboxyl, and phenolic functional groups are the major binding sites for Cd (II) and Ni (II) metals. The ion exchange mechanism plays an important role during biosorption process as shown in EDX analysis. Our results conclude that marine macrophyte C. nodosa can be used as a low-cost biosorbent for the removal of Cd (II) and Ni (II) in wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCymodocea nodosa 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abinding sites 3abiomass 3abiosorbents 3abiosorption 3acadmium 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aion exchange 3akinetics 3ametal ions 3anickel 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aseagrasses 3asorption isotherms 3awastewater 0aLangmuir isotherm1 aEl-Sayed, Abeer A.M.1 aEl-Naggar, Naglaa A.0 tChemistry in ecology.g2020 May 27, v. 36, no. 5 p.458-474dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12214x1029-03707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540.2020.17521993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03280naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014900165520151600314592002801830650003401858650002401892650002101916650001401937650001401951650001401965650001001979650002201989650001902011650003702030650001102067650002102078650003402099650002202133650002402155650001302179650003602192650001802228653001902246653001902265653001202284653001402296653003102310653003002341700001802371700001602389700001202405700001502417700001602432700001602448700002102464700001602485773009802501856008202599852000902681655001202690IND60688972820221118203050.0210911e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068897282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1176662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Chaofeng10aEuscaphic acid and Tormentic acid protect vascular endothelial cells against hypoxia-induced apoptosis via PI3K/AKT or ERK 1/2 signaling pathway  aEuscaphic acid and Tormentic acid are aglycones of Kaji-ichigoside F1 and Rosamultin, respectively. These four compounds are pentacyclic triterpenoid, isolated from the subterranean root of the Potentilla anserina L. Based on the protective roles against hypoxia-induced apoptosis of Euscaphic acid and Tormentic acid in vascular endothelial cells, this study was designed to determine the mechanisms.The model of hypoxic injuries in EA. hy926 cells was established. Through applications of PI3K/AKT inhibitor, LY294002 and ERK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059, we explored the relationships between pharmacodynamic mechanisms and PI3K/AKT or ERK 1/2 signaling pathway. The anti-hypoxic effects were studied by methyl-thiazolyl-tetrazolium (MTT) assay, Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining, DAPI staining, and flow cytometry. The mechanisms of anti-mitochondrial apoptosis were explored by western blot. The expressions of p-ERK 1/2, ERK 1/2, p-AKT, AKT, p-NF-κB, NF-κB, Bcl-2, Bax, Cyt C, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3 were detected.Euscaphic acid protected vascular endothelial cells against hypoxia-induced apoptosis via ERK1/2 signaling pathway, and Tormentic acid brought its efficacy into full play via PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. In addition, PI3K/AKT signaling pathway positively regulated ERK1/2 pathway, and ERK1/2 pathway negatively regulated PI3K/AKT pathway.This evidence provides theoretical and experimental basis for the following research on anti-hypoxic drugs of Potentilla anserina L.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 3aPotentilla anserina 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acaspase-9 3adrugs 3aendothelial cells 3aflow cytometry 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amodels 3apharmacodynamics 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aprotective effect 3asignal transduction 3astaining 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atriterpenoids 0aEuscaphic acid 0aTormentic acid 0aHypoxia 0aApoptosis 0aPI3K/AKT signaling pathway 0aERK 1/2 signaling pathway1 aLi, Zhengchao1 aWu, Yuqiang1 aLi, Xia1 aLi, Yaxiao1 aWei, Jinxia1 aLi, Jianyu,1 aZhang, Yongliang1 aLi, Lingzhi0 tLife sciences.g2020 July 01, v. 252 p.117666-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1176663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02508naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011900171300001600290520108100306592002801387650001501415650001201430650002401442650000901466650001501475650002901490650001601519653002501535653002601560653002401586653004301610700005401653700001701707700006701724700005601791700006001847773009701907856008502004852000902089655001202098IND60768912120221121004841.0220314e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076891212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2022.02.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenon, Govind S.10aExperimental investigations on unglazed photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) system using water and nanofluid cooling medium  ap. 986-996.  aThe electrical and thermal performance of an unglazed photovoltaic thermal (PVT) system integrated with a serpentine coil configured sheet and tube thermal absorber setup was evaluated using water and copper oxide-based nanofluid. An uncooled PVT system reached a maximum panel temperature of 68.4 °C at noon and obtained an average electrical efficiency of 12.98%. Water and nanofluid cooling of the PVT system reduced the panel temperature by 15 °C and 23.7 °C at noontime, respectively. Compared to the uncooled PVT system, the average electrical efficiency of water and nanofluid cooled PVT system increased by 12.32% and 35.67% to obtain 14.58% and 17.61%, respectively. The thermal efficiency of the nanofluid cooled PVT system (71.17%) was significantly higher than water cooling (58.77%) due to maximum heat absorption by nanoparticles. It was also observed that the overall efficiency of the nanofluid cooled PVT system was 21% higher than the water-cooled system. Also, obtained the highest primary energy-saving efficiency for the nanofluid cooled PVT system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acooling 3aenergy conservation 3aheat 3ananofluids 3arenewable energy sources 3atemperature 0aOpen circuit voltage 0aShort circuit current 0aReduced temperature 0aPrimary energy saving efficiency (PES)1 aMurali, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6614-22021 aElias, Jacob1 aAniesrani Delfiya, D.S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4259-43801 aAlfiya, P.V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7790-55001 aSamuel, Manoj P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2403-45900 tRenewable energy.g2022 Apr., v. 188 p.986-996dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.02.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03192naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245018500168300001800353520146300371592002801834596005701862650004201919650002201961650001001983650001701993650002102010650001802031650001502049650001102064650001302075650001202088650001702100650003102117650001002148650001002158650001202168650004302180650005202223650002202275650002402297650002002321650001702341700001802358700002102376700005602397773013002453856008202583852000902665655001202674IND60675125620221119033201.0191104e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067512562DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-019-01808-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYanagisawa, Ryo10aTranscriptomic analysis under ethylene precursor treatment uncovers the regulation of gene expression linked to sexual reproduction in the dioecious red alga Pyropia pseudolinearis  ap. 3317-3329.  aThe marine red algal genus Pyropia, class Bangiophyceae, includes dioecious and monoecious species; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying control of their sexual reproduction are still poorly understood. In the present study, we demonstrated that application of the ethylene precursor, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), promoted the formation of spermatangia and parthenosporangia in male and female gametophytes, respectively, of the dioecious species Pyropia pseudolinearis. In addition, we determined expression profiles of ACC-responsive genes in the gametophytes during sexual reproduction using RNA-Seq and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Genes involved in the regulation of cell division and cell wall organization, such as high-mobility group (PpHMG) and glycosyltransferase family (PpGT14), were found to be upregulated in male and female gametophytes treated with ACC. In addition, the relatively rapid ACC-response of the vesicular-trafficking-related genes, flotillin (PpFLOT), charged multivesicular body protein 5 (PpCHMP5), and peptidase family S8 (PpS8) was shown to occur during male and female sexual reproduction. Expression levels of these six genes in the monoecious species P. yezoensis, which are homologs to ACC-responsive genes in P. pseudolinearis, also increased in gametophytes treated with ACC. These findings could provide new insights into the ACC-regulation of the sexual life cycle in Pyropia species.  aPublisher supplied data  a16K18740cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid 3aPyropia yezoensis 3aalgae 3abody protein 3acarboxylic acids 3acell division 3acell walls 3adioecy 3aethylene 3afemales 3agametophytes 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amales 3amonoecy 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3asexual reproduction 3atranscriptomics 3atransferases1 aSekine, Naoki1 aMizuta, Hiroyuki1 aUji, Toshiki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2925-79130 tJournal of applied phycology.g2019 Oct., v. 31, no. 5 p.3317-3329dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-019-01808-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245005200164300001800216520106500234592002801299650002201327650002801349650002201377650002301399650001101422650001001433650001101443650001301454650002201467650001601489650003301505650001701538650003701555650001601592700001701608773015401625856008001779852000901859655001201868IND60624209320221122140257.0190722e199704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062420932DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10185037287422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDE SOUZA, E.

Film optical properties were characterized by diffuse reflectance spectrophotometry; morphological film features were examined by SEM, TEM, STM and AFM. Domain organization and void formation were detected, with dimensions of the same order of magnitude as the wavelength of visible light and can thus account for the film optical properties. Calcium carbonate consumption was monitored by X-ray diffraction and is assigned to a chemical reaction with aluminium polyphosphate, in which a mixed Al-Ca carbonate-polyphosphate is formed. The process of film opacification is interpreted as a result of dispersion, chemical reaction and orientation of solid inorganic particles within the polymer network during the film drying process. A model is proposed for void formation, based on volume contraction of the swollen inorganic particles, at a stage when their rigid surfaces are bound to the polymeric matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aatomic force microscopy 3acalcium carbonate 3achemical reactions 3adrying 3alatex 3amodels 3apolymers 3apolyvinyl acetate 3areflectance 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspectroscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awavelengths1 aGALEMBECK, F0 tJournal of materials science.g1997 Apr., v. 32, no. 8 p.2207-2213dKluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum PublisherswJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10185037287423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01384naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245012400168300001800292520033800310592002800648650001700676650002100693650001800714650001900732700002600751700002200777700002800799700002500827773013400852856007500986852000901061655001201070IND60658919220221119044313.0190826e20110419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065891922DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc10391a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMota-Morales, Josué D.10aFrontal polymerizations carried out in deep-eutectic mixtures providing both the monomers and the polymerization medium  ap. 5328-5330.  aDeep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) based upon mixtures of Acrylic Acid (AA) or Methacrylic Acid (MAA) and Choline Chloride (CCl) demonstrated superior performance than regular organic solvents and even ionic liquids for frontal polymerizations (FPs).

Three soil concentrations (0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mg/kg) were used for both endosulfan and endosulfan sulfate. Both earthworm coelomic fluid (CF) and tissues were extracted and then analyzed using 1H and 1H–13C NMR techniques. A similar separation trajectory was observed for endosulfan and endosulfan sulfate-exposed earthworms in the mean principal component analysis (PCA) scores plot for both the earthworm CF and tissue extracts.A neurotoxic and apoptotic MOA was postulated for both endosulfan and endosulfan sulfate exposed earthworms as significant fluctuations in glutamine/GABA–glutamate cycle metabolites and spermidine were detected respectively. This study highlights the application of NMR-based metabolomics to understand molecular-level toxicity of persistent organochlorine pesticides and their degradation products directly in soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3amechanism of action 3aneurotoxicity 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aEisenia fetida 3aspermidine 3aprincipal component analysis 3ametabolites 3asoil 3aendosulfan sulfate 3aearthworms 3ametabolomics 3aapoptosis 2aAnimals 2aEndosulfanxanalogs & derivativesxanalysisxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aInsecticidesxanalysisxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aMetabolome 2aMetabolomics 2aOligochaetaxmetabolism 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysisxmetabolismxtoxicity. 0aDegradation products 0aMetabolic profiling 0aMetabonomics 0aEcotoxicology 0aendosulfan1 aSimpson, Myrna J.1 aSimpson, Andre J.,0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2013 Apr., v. 175 p.35-44dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2012.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02138naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245008900165300001600254500001400270520097100284592002801255650003101283650002101314650001201335650001001347650001501357650001201372650001201384650000901396650000901405651001001414653000801424653001301432653001501445653001601460653002301476653001801499700001701517773007901534856008201613852000901695655001201704IND60704965620221119060403.0200728s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070496562DNAL7 a10.1163/1568541067788778482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Ren E10aSeinura lii n. sp. and S. wuae n. sp.

However, the essential role of MyD88 during activations mediated by germline-encoded NK cell receptors (NKRs), such as Ly49H or NKG2D, has yet to be investigated. To define the NK cell-intrinsic function of MyD88, we generated a novel NK cell conditional knockout mouse for MyD88 (Myd88ᶠˡ/ᶠˡNcr1Cʳᵉ/⁺). Phenotypic characterization of these mice demonstrated that MyD88 is dispensable for NK cell development and maturation. However, the MyD88-deficient NK cells exhibited significantly reduced cytotoxic potentials in vivo. In addition, the lack of MyD88 significantly reduced the NKG2D-mediated inflammatory cytokine production in vitro. Consistent with this, mice lacking MyD88 were unable to respond and clear MCMV infection. Transcriptomic analyses of splenic NK cells following MCMV infection revealed that inflammatory gene signatures were upregulated in Ly49H⁺. In contrast, Ly49H⁻ NK cells have significant enrichment in G2M checkpoint genes, revealing distinct transcriptomic profiles of these subsets. Our results identify a central role for MyD88 in Ly49H-dependent gene signatures, including alterations in genes regulating proliferation in Ly49H⁺ NK cells. In summary, our study reveals a previously unknown function of MyD88 in Ly49H-dependent signaling and in vivo functions of NK cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytokines 3acytotoxicity 3agenes 3aknockout mutants 3aphenotype 3atranscriptomics 0aMyD88 0aNK cells 0aLy49H 0aMCMV 0aGene regulation 0aAntiviral immunity1 aSiebert, Jason R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3777-79161 aWang, Dandan1 aAbel, Alex M.1 aJohnson, Kaitlin E.1 aRiese, Matthew J.1 aTerhune, Scott S.1 aTarakanova, Vera L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9499-088X1 aThakar, Monica S.1 aMalarkannan, Subramaniam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7511-27310 tMolecular immunology.g2021 Sept., v. 137 p.94-104dElsevier LtdwJournal:12510x0161-58907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2021.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245010000162300001600262520176300278592002802041650002702069650001102096650001302107650001702120650001202137650002102149650001302170650001202183650001102195650001202206650001402218650001502232650001202247650001202259650002302271700001902294700002002313773007802333856007302411852000902484655001202493IND60408511320221119084427.0150905e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040851132DNAL7 a10.1111/eth.124132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrumbo, Stephen T.10aInfluences of Parental Care and Food Deprivation on Regulation of Body Mass in a Burying Beetle  ap. 985-993.  aChanges in adult body mass during breeding can reveal how parents prepare energetically for care, the stress of care, and the need to terminate care in a state conducive for future reproduction. Interpreting changes in parent mass can be difficult, however, because temporal variation in body mass may reflect a constraint imposed by the stress of care, revealing conflict within the family, or a shift to a new body mass optimum adaptive for a different stage of the breeding cycle. Here, we examined the effect of food deprivation and parenting on variation in female body mass of Nicrophorus orbicollis, an insect in which parents and offspring share a common food resource (a prepared carrion ball). Female parents demonstrated a remarkable degree of regulation of body mass: Despite varied periods of food deprivation (0–8 d) prior to discovery of a carcass, females attained a similar body mass (108.3–109.2% of pre‐deprivation mass) at the time of larval hatching. Females attained a greater body mass in anticipation of rearing a greater number of young. Mothers lost mass during active parental care, and mass at the end of caregiving was less in mothers that reared more and heavier young. Body mass at the end of care was less than the preferred mass for females searching for a carcass, indicating that the mothers sacrificed self‐maintenance and future reproductive potential for their current brood. Contrary to prediction, pre‐breeding food deprivation had no effect on offspring size or on female condition at the end of care. We conclude that there is a limited degree of conflict over the sharing of food among N. orbicollis parents and offspring, but that this conflict is not exacerbated by food deprivation prior to breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNicrophorus orbicollis 3aadults 3abreeding 3adead animals 3afemales 3afood deprivation 3ahatching 3ainsects 3alarvae 3amothers 3aparenting 3aprediction 3aprogeny 3arearing 3atemporal variation1 aXhihani, Ervis1 aEbensperger, L.0 tEthology.g2015 Oct., v. 121, no. 10 p.985-993dP.

Two probability density functions were introduced for modelling the fibre-length distribution and the fibre-orientation distribution. By taking into account the effect of snubbing friction between fibres and matrix at the fibre exit point during fibre pull-out, and that of the fracture stress of fibres obliquely crossing the fracture plane (i.e. the inclined strength of fibres), the fibre pull-out energy of composites has been derived as a function of fibre-length distribution and fibre-orientation distribution, as well as interfacial properties. The previously existing fibre pull-out energy theories can be deduced from the present model. The effects of fibre-length distribution, fibre-orientation distribution, interfacial properties, snubbing-friction coefficient and parameter A for determining the inclined strength of fibres on the fibre pull-out energy, have been studied in detail. The present study provides the necessary information as to which fibre-length distribution, fibre-orientation distribution and interfacial property are required to achieve a desired fibre pull-out energy and hence a desired composite toughness. High-strength fibres, a large fibre-volume fraction and a large fibre diameter for a comparatively large mean fibre length, are shown to be favourable for achieving a high fibre pull-out energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3afriction 3amechanical stress 3amodels 3aprobability distribution1 aLauke, Bernd,0 tJournal of materials science.g1997 Apr., v. 32, no. 8 p.1985-1993dKluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum PublisherswJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10185939319513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03152naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245012800215300001100343520168900354592002802043596010802071650002302179650002002202650002602222650002202248650001102270650001702281650002102298650001902319650001502338650001202353650002002365650001602385651001102401700005202412700005902464773012702523856008302650852000902733655001202742IND60707140820221120200451.0210812e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070714082DNAL7 a10.1007/s11295-020-01461-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNielsen, Ulrik Braüner1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7198-192410aGenetics in and opportunities for improvement of Nordmann fir (Abies nordmanniana (Steven) Spach) Christmas tree production  ap. 66.  aChristmas tree is an important specialty crop. In Europe, the main Christmas tree species is Nordmann fir (Abies nordmanniana (Steven) Spach) and nearly 42 million trees are sold each year. This paper focuses on three key traits for Christmas tree production: growth (including branching), commercial tree quality, and post-harvest needle retention. The objectives of the study are to estimate genetic variation and heritability, genotype-by-site interaction, and genetic correlations among traits, and to illustrate and discuss potential gains from selection. The field trial series comprises 10 sites, 7 provenances, and 128 single-tree open-pollinated offspring from five Danish seed sources (in total 45,531 trees). At year 7 from planting, growth and quality were assessed on all sites. A subset of three sites were sampled twice (in October and November) for evaluation of post-harvest needle retention. Heritabilities across sites were 0.23, 0.21, and 0.13 for tree height, number of branches, and Christmas tree score, respectively. Heritability for post-harvest needle retention increased from 0.28 in October to 0.55 in November. Average additive genetic site-by-site correlation for tree height was 0.72, for number of branches 0.86, and for Christmas tree score 0.72, indicating that the genotype-by-site interaction is small and not important. Post-harvest needle retention did not correlate to any other traits. Potential gains from backward selection and grafting superior plus-trees in clonal seed orchards, e.g. the 15–20 best ones, were estimated to be 20% in Christmas tree score, number of branches, and height, and 65% in November post-harvest needle retention.  aPublisher supplied data  a2003-0007cThe work has partially been financed by The Christmas Tree Growers Production Fee Foundation 3aAbies nordmanniana 3aChristmas trees 3afield experimentation 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3aheritability 3aopen pollination 3aplant genetics 3aplus trees 3aprogeny 3aspecialty crops 3atree height 3aEurope1 aXu, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4238-14491 aHansen, Ole Kim1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6646-12620 tTree genetics & genomes.g2020 Oct., v. 16, no. 5 p.66-66dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949857x1614-29427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11295-020-01461-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02054naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245011600208300001400324520095700338592002801295650002301323650001001346650002101356650001401377651001001391653002501401653001701426653001001443653001901453653002101472700002201493773009501515856008501610852000901695655001201704IND60568567420221120031415.0190318e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056856742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2017.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSummers, Lucia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8674-536910aSpatial conjunctive analysis of (crime) case configurations: Using Monte Carlo methods for significance testing  ap. 55-63.  aWhile research has repeatedly demonstrated how spatial distributions of crime can be shaped by the presence of facilities such as bars and public transport hubs, the joint influence of different facility types has rarely been explored. Spatial conjunctive analysis of case configurations (also known as qualitative comparative analysis) offers a means to identify the combinations of facility types that are most commonly found around crime events, and has been used in a small number of studies focusing on street robbery. This study extends this limited evidence base by implementing a significance test based on the Monte Carlo method using street robbery data for Austin, Texas. The results show that some of the top-ranking facility type combinations had observed frequencies that were not significantly greater than chance expectations. The accurate identification of the highest-risk environments has important implications for crime prevention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3acrime 3acrime prevention 3ageography 3aTexas 0aConjunctive analysis 0aRisky places 0aCrime 0aStreet robbery 0aMonte Carlo test1 aCaballero, Monica0 tApplied geography.g2017 July, v. 84 p.55-63dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2017.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02343naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245006900156300001700225520132000242592002801562650001201590650002001602650001401622650001201636650001301648650001001661650001601671650001401687650001601701650001601717700003601733700001901769700002001788773007901808856007301887852000901960655001201969IND60408511420221119084356.0150905e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040851142DNAL7 a10.1111/eth.124142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMestre, Laia10aFemales of the Cellar Spider Discriminate Against Previous Mates  ap. 994-1001.  aMate choice for novel partners should evolve when remating with males of varying genetic quality provides females with fitness‐enhancing benefits. We investigated sequential mate choice for same or novel mating partners in females of the cellar spider Pholcus phalangioides (Pholcidae) to understand what drives female remating in this system. Pholcus phalangioides females are moderately polyandrous and show reluctance to remating, but double‐mated females benefit from a higher oviposition probability compared to single‐mated females. We exposed mated females to either their former (same male) or a novel mating partner and assessed mating success together with courtship and copulatory behaviours in both sexes. We found clear evidence for mate discrimination: females experienced three‐fold higher remating probabilities with novel males, being more often aggressive towards former males and accepting novel males faster in the second than in the first mating trial. The preference for novel males suggests that remating is driven by benefits derived from multiple partners. The low remating rates and the strong last male sperm precedence in this system suggest that mating with novel partners that represent alternative genotypes may be a means for selecting against a former mate of lower quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPholcus 3aanimal behavior 3acourtship 3afemales 3agenotype 3amales 3aoviposition 3apolyandry 3aprobability 3aspermatozoa1 aRodríguez‐Teijeiro, José D.1 aTuni, Cristina1 aHerberstein, M.0 tEthology.g2015 Oct., v. 121, no. 10 p.994-1001dP.

Further to this, an Adaptive Neuro-fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) clustered with fuzzy c-means (FCM) was developed to predict organic dry matter biogas yield (oDMBY), fresh mass biogas yield (FMBY), organic dry matter methane yield (oDMMY), and fresh mass methane yield (FMMY). Relevant statistical metrics like root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute deviation (MAD), and correlation coefficient (R²) were used to evaluate the performance of the developed ANFIS model. The performance of both RSM and ANFIS were compared based on the performance metrics. The R² values of RSM for oDMBY, FMBY, oDMMY and FMMY are 0.6268, 0.5875, 0.6109 and 0.5547 respectively; and 0.9601, 0.9486, 0.9626 and 0.9172 respectively for ANFIS model. The results revealed the better performance of the ANFIS than the RSM, with lesser prediction error and higher accuracy. It is concluded that RSM and ANFIS are practical models for predicting particle size limits in a multiple-input parameter without attempting any experiment within a short period with a tiny error rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArachis hypogaea 3abiogas 3afuzzy logic 3amethane 3amethane production 3aparticle size 3aprediction 3aresponse surface methodology 3atemperature 0aBiogas 0aOptimization 0aYields 0aPrediction 0aRSM 0aANFIS1 aAhmed, Noor A.1 aMadyira, Daniel M.1 aAdebayo, Ademola O.1 aOgunkunle, Oyetola1 aAdeleke, Oluwatobi0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Apr., v. 189 p.288-303dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.02.0883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245012800177300001800305520158400323592002801907596009101935650001602026650001002042650002402052650001602076650002402092650002102116650001602137650001802153650001902171650002002190650001602210650001502226650002102241650001402262650001502276650002102291650001002312700003002322700002102352700001502373700007102388773013002459856008202589852000902671655001202680IND60675126120221119033042.0191104e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067512612DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-019-01785-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCañedo-Castro, Betsabé10aPrebiotic effect of Ulva rigida meal on the intestinal integrity and serum cholesterol and triglyceride content in broilers  ap. 3265-3273.  aMarine algae contain large amounts of bioactive compounds and dietary fiber; thus, when used as feed for poultry, they could be an alternative to improve intestinal integrity and reduce lipid serum concentrations. Few studies have assessed the prebiotic properties of this marine resource. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prebiotic effects of different concentrations of the green alga Ulva rigida as feed additive to enhance the morphology of intestinal villi and reduce total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in chickens. One hundred and forty-one-day-old Arbor Acres broilers were randomized to one of four treatments: 0, 2, 4, and 6% Ulva meal, respectively, including seven replicates of five broilers each, in a completely randomized design. The assay was run for 6 weeks. Body weight gain and carcass percentage were not affected by the treatment, but feed intake, feed conversion ratio, and mortality showed significant differences (p < 0.05). Width, height, and contour length of intestinal villi were higher (p < 0.05) in all U. rigida meal treatments compared to the control group. The highest (p < 0.05) intestinal villus height and contour length were recorded with 2% Ulva. Serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were significantly lower in Ulva treatments vs. control (p < 0.05). The addition of U. rigida to broilers meal improved the growth of intestinal villi and reduced serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, thus confirming that it could be considered as a prebiotic that can enhance the broiler health.  aPublisher supplied data  aSIP20161094cSecretaría de Investigación y Posgrado, Instituto Politécnico Nacional 3aUlva rigida 3aalgae 3abioactive compounds 3ablood serum 3abody weight changes 3abroiler chickens 3acholesterol 3adietary fiber 3afeed additives 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3aintestines 3amarine resources 3amortality 3aprebiotics 3atriacylglycerols 3avilli1 aPiñón-Gimate, Alejandra1 aCarrillo, Silvia1 aKid Ramos,1 aCasas Valdez, M.

Additionally, urban water system needs a novel perspective for upgradation with urbanization. This perspective presents a novel 5R approach for managing urban water resources: Recover (storm water), Reduce (toilet flushing water), Recycle (gray water), Resource (black water), and Reuse (advanced-treated wastewater). The 5R generation incorporates the latest ideas for harvesting storm water, gray water, and black water in its several forms. This paper has briefly demonstrated each R of 5R generation for water treatment and reuse. China has the chance to upgrade its urban water systems according to 5R principles. Already, a demonstration project of 5R generation has been installed in Qingdao International Horticultural Exposition, and Dalian International Convention Center (China) has applied 5R, achieving over 70% water saving. The 5R offers promise for moving solutions for urban water scarcity from “hoped for in the future” to “realistic today”.  aPublisher supplied data 3agreywater 3ahorticulture 3astormwater 3aurbanization 3awater shortages 3awater treatment 3aChina1 aWang, Hongwu1 aZhang, Zhiqiang1 aZhang, Jian1 aChen, Hongbin1 aBi, Xuejun1 aDai, Xiaohu1 aXia, Siqing1 aAlvarez-Cohen, Lisa1 aRittmann, Bruce E.0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2021 Feb., v. 15, no. 1 p.16-16dHigher Education PresswJournal:J000001686x2095-22017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-020-1308-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245013500180300001600315500001900331520131500350592002801665650002601693650002301719650001201742650001301754650001801767650002801785650002501813650002101838650001501859650001501874650002201889650002401911650001301935650001701948650001801965650001801983651001402001653002302015653002802038653001402066700002302080700002602103700002402129700002202153700003202175773011002207856008502317852000902402655001202411IND60696820820221119081952.0200601e20200503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069682082DNAL7 a10.1080/08920753.2020.17479142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadarasinghe, Sanduni K.10aInland Irrigation Project Causes Disappearance of Coastal Lagoon: The Trajectory of Kalametiya Lagoon, Sri Lanka from 1956 to 2016  ap. 188-209.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe increase of freshwater inflow to Kalametiya lagoon, Sri Lanka, as a result of Udawalawe irrigation project that came into operation in 1967, has caused heavy siltation and reduction of salinity in the lagoon. The present investigation attempted to study and convey the current situation of Kalametiya lagoon and its future trajectory in response to unremitting disturbances. About 86% of the water surface area has been sacrificed to Sonneratia caseolaris and Typha angustifolia as dominant riparian vegetation and the water quality of the remaining water body has also deteriorated as evident by increased acidity, reduced dissolved oxygen and increased ammonium content. If the present trend continues, chances of losing the remaining water surface area in 2-3 years are predictably high. These spatio-temporal changes apparently diminished the uses and services of the coastal lagoon. Improper planning and lack of institutional coordination have caused such a menace. As many coastal lagoons worldwide experience similar degradation due to ill-planned development projects, careful considerations should be given to long-term impact assessment of a development project before implementation. This case-study can, therefore, be taken as a lesson in coastal zone management in other parts of the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSonneratia caseolaris 3aTypha angustifolia 3aacidity 3aammonium 3acoastal water 3acoastal zone management 3adevelopment projects 3adissolved oxygen 3afreshwater 3airrigation 3along term effects 3ariparian vegetation 3asalinity 3asurface area 3asurface water 3awater quality 3aSri Lanka 0aecosystem services 0ainstitutional fragility 0asiltation1 aYapa, Kanthi K.A.S1 aSatyanarayana, Behara1 aUdayakantha, P.M.P.1 aKodikara, Sunanda1 aJayatissa, Loku Pulikuttige0 tCoastal management.g2020 May 3, v. 48, no. 3 p.188-209dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12309x1521-04217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08920753.2020.17479143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012600165300001100291520167100302592002801973650001802001650002102019650001302040650001102053650002002064650001102084650001702095650001402112650001502126650001202141650003102153650002002184650001602204700001702220700001702237700001902254700001702273700001702290700001602307773014802323856008202471852000902553655001202562IND60707141120221120192155.0220323e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070714112DNAL7 a10.1007/s11783-020-1304-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Yanqing10aAcceleration of the particulate organic matter hydrolysis by start-up stage recovery and its original microbial mechanism  ap. 12.  aTo address the availability of carbon sources for denitrification, the accelerated hydrolysis of the most abundant but low-availability fraction of particulate organic matter (POM) was investigated. Mesh sieves with different pore sizes were used as primary pretreatment at the start-up-stage of the biological process to separate some POM from the liquid system. The changes in soluble carbohydrates and proteins were monitored to investigate the hydrolysis performance of the sieved POM, with waste activated sludge (WAS) as the control test. The results showed that an average of 35% POM could be entrapped before filtrate mat development. In addition, benefiting from the high polysaccharides concentration, as well as the high availability due to the relatively loose physical structure, a 23% hydrolysis efficiency of POM was obtained, in contrast to that of WAS (3.4%), with a hydrolysis constant of 0.39 h⁻¹. The prominent performance was also attributed to the unique microbial communities having been domesticated at a lower temperature, especially the cellulose-degrading bacteria Paraclostridium and psychrophile Psychrobacter, making up 6.94% and 2.56%, respectively. Furthermore, the potential benefits and application of improved POM hydrolysis by start-up stage recovery via mesh sieves combined with anaerobic fermentation were evaluated, including selective POM entrapment, alleviation of blockage and wear, and a reduction in aeration energy. By the proposed strategy, carbon availability for biological nutrient removal (BNR) processes is anticipated to be improved more economically than that can be achieved by primary clarifier elimination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPsychrobacter 3aactivated sludge 3aaeration 3acarbon 3adenitrification 3aenergy 3afermentation 3afiltrates 3ahydrolysis 3aliquids 3aparticulate organic matter 3apolysaccharides 3atemperature1 aZhou, Aijuan1 aYue, Xiuping1 aZhang, Zhichun1 aGao, Yanjuan1 aLuo, Yanhong1 aZhang, Xiao0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2021 Feb., v. 15, no. 1 p.12-12dHigher Education PresswJournal:J000001686x2095-22017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-020-1304-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245006700164300001400231520141700245592002801662650001101690650001501701650001401716650001001730650001201740650001401752650001501766650001801781650005001799650004301849650001301892650001001905650001501915650001601930650002701946650002501973650001001998651001402008651001302022653000902035653001002044653001302054653001402067700002202081700001302103700002302116700001902139700001902158700001602177773009502193856008502288852000902373655001202382IND60568567720221120024411.0190318e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056856772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2017.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoyos, N.14aThe environmental envelope of fires in the Colombian Caribbean  ap. 42-54.  aFire is an important disturbance agent for terrestrial ecosystems, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions where its occurrence is controlled by multiple biophysical and anthropogenic variables. We assessed the temporal and spatial patterns of active fire detections (MODIS product MCD14ML) in the Caribbean region of Colombia between 2003 and 2015, using time series, cross-correlation, hot spot and density techniques. We also assessed the environmental envelope of active fires by evaluating the effect of multiple biophysical and anthropogenic variables on fire presence/absence using generalized linear models (GLMs). Results show that fires follow a clear intra-annual cycle, with 86% of fire events taking place during the region's main dry season (December–March). There is also inter-annual variability related to the Tropical North Atlantic (TNA) quasi-decadal climatic oscillation. Active fires exhibit a distinctive spatial pattern, with regional hotspots. The set of variables that best explain fire presence/absence include biophysical (TNA, temperature annual range, dry quarter precipitation), anthropogenic (minimum distance to towns and roads) and composite (NDVI) variables. The extensive and ongoing land cover transformation of this region, from forest to pasture and agriculture, will likely increase the extent of burned areas and future carbon fire emissions to the atmosphere.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adry season 3aemissions 3afires 3aforests 3ageography 3aland cover 3alinear models 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apastures 3aroads 3asubtropics 3atemperature 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3atime series analysis 3atowns 3aCaribbean 3aColombia 0aFire 0aMODIS 0aColombia 0aCaribbean1 aCorrea-Metrio, A.1 aSisa, A.1 aRamos-Fabiel, M.A.1 aEspinosa, J.M.1 aRestrepo, J.C.1 aEscobar, J.0 tApplied geography.g2017 July, v. 84 p.42-54dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2017.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02052naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001700179245008200196300001600278506007600294520075300370592002801123506003701151650002001188650002601208650001601234650001801250650002001268650001201288650002001300650002201320650002201342650001601364700003301380700002401413773011801437856007801555852000901633655001201642IND4534370120221207114954.0160420e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453437012DNAL7 a10.1093/icb/icr0992doi7 aPMC32234812pmcid7 a218567332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoch, Henner10aNetwork Reconfiguration and Neuronal Plasticity in Rhythm-Generating Networks  ap. 856-868.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNeuronal networks are highly plastic and reconfigure in a state-dependent manner. The plasticity at the network level emerges through multiple intrinsic and synaptic membrane properties that imbue neurons and their interactions with numerous nonlinear properties. These properties are continuously regulated by neuromodulators and homeostatic mechanisms that are critical to maintain not only network stability and also adapt networks in a short- and long-term manner to changes in behavioral, developmental, metabolic, and environmental conditions. This review provides concrete examples from neuronal networks in invertebrates and vertebrates, and illustrates that the concepts and rules that govern neuronal networks and behaviors are universal.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abehavior change 3aenvironmental factors 3ahomeostasis 3ainvertebrates 3aneural networks 3aneurons 3aneuroplasticity 3aneurotransmitters 3asynaptic vesicles 3avertebrates1 aGarcia, Alfredo J., IIIcIII1 aRamirez, Jan-Marino0 tIntegrative and comparative biology.g2011 Dec., v. 51, no. 6 p.856-868dOxford University Pressx1540-70637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icb/icr0993Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02076naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245008800161300001800249520094800267592002801215650002001243650002001263650002901283650001301312650001601325650002601341650002201367650000901389650002101398650002601419651001001445700001601455773015401471856008001625852000901705655001201714IND60624210120221120225743.0190722e199704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062421012DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10185501169302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKITAGAWA, M10aMechanical properties of dragline and capture thread for the spider Nephila clavata  ap. 2005-2012.  aMechanical properties of the dragline and the capture thread for the spider Nephila clavata, called Jorougumo in Japan, were investigated and the effect of ultraviolet rays and acid rain on their strength was studied to consider the applicability to the environmental assessment of the habitat of the spider.

However, how to further amplify the detection signal to improve the sensitivity and accuracy of detecting cancer cells by portable devices remains a challenge. To solve the problem, we, for the first time, synthesized folic-acid-conjugated Au nanoframes (FA-Au NFs) with amplification of pressure and temperature signals for highly sensitive and accurate detection of cancer cells by portable pressure meters and thermometers. The resulting Au NFs exhibit excellent near-infrared (NIR) photothermal performance and catalase activity, which can promote the decomposition of NH₄HCO₃ and H₂O₂ to generate corresponding gases (CO₂, NH₃, and O₂), thereby synergistically amplifying pressure signals in a closed reaction vessel. At the same time, Au NFs with excellent peroxidase-like activity can catalyze the oxidation of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to produce TMB oxide (oxTMB) with a strong photothermal effect, thereby cooperating with Au NFs to amplify the photothermal signal. In the presence of cancer cells with overexpressing folate receptors (FRs), the molecular recognition signals between FA and FR can be converted into amplified pressure and temperature signals, which can be easily read by portable pressure meters and thermometers, respectively. The detection limits for cancer cells using pressure meters and thermometers are 6 and 5 cells/mL, respectively, which are better than other reported methods. Moreover, such Au NFs can improve tumor hypoxia by catalyzing the decomposition of H₂O₂ to produce O₂ and perform photothermal therapy of cancer. Together, our work provides new insight into the application of Au NFs to develop a dual-signal sensing platform with amplification of pressure and temperature signals for portable and ultrasensitive detection of cancer cells as well as personalized cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3acancer therapy 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalase 3afolic acid 3ahypoxia 3aneoplasms 3aoxidation 3aphotothermotherapy 3apoint-of-care systems 3atemperature1 aLu, Siyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4538-78461 aSun, Shihao1 aHai, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2137-51701 aMeng, Genping1 aWang, Baodui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1600-65570 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Oct. 12, v. 93, no. 42 p.14307-14316dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c034863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005300148245011200201300001800313520143700331592002801768650002401796650001701820650002201837650001401859650001701873650001001890650001601900650001901916650001501935650001301950650003601963650002001999650001302019650001302032650001502045650001602060650002102076650001602097650002902113650001802142650002002160650002702180700001902207700001902226700001702245700001602262700001702278773013002295856008202425852000902507655001202516IND60675126420221119033325.0191104e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067512642DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-019-01813-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Fuli1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2287-991X10aDynamic profile of proteome revealed multiple levels of regulation under heat stress in Saccharina japonica  ap. 3077-3089.  aSaccharina japonica is a typical seaweed that has been domesticated and cultivated at a large scale for a long time worldwide. Compared to the wild populations, the Saccharina cultivars have significant greater high-temperature tolerance. However, the molecular mechanisms of high temperature tolerance are still unknown. This study characterized the protein expression profile under heat stress using the iTRAQ strategy integrated with transcriptome data to identify the candidate genes involved in the heat stress tolerance. A total of 104 and 107 proteins were identified as the differential expressed proteins (DEPs) in sporophyte and gametophyte, respectively. Only 14 DEPs identified both in sporophyte and gametophyte indicated that the two generations have different protein expression in response to the heat stress. The correlation between proteome and transcriptome profile under heat stress was very low, with only six genes were identified both on the transcription and protein levels. However, 23 pathways, including multiple cellular processes such as nitrogen and carbon metabolism, transcription, translation, posttranslational modification, antioxidant system etc., were identified. This study is the first exploration into the molecular mechanism of Saccharina heat tolerance on both transcriptomic and proteomic levels, which provides new insight into the regulation mechanism in response to heat stress in kelp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharina japonica 3aantioxidants 3acarbon metabolism 3acultivars 3agametophytes 3agenes 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3amacroalgae 3anitrogen 3apost-translational modification 3aprotein content 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asporophytes 3astress tolerance 3atemperature 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3atranslation (genetics)1 aZhang, Pengyan1 aLiang, Zhourui1 aWang, Wenjun1 aSun, Xiutao1 aWang, Feijiu0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2019 Oct., v. 31, no. 5 p.3077-3089dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-019-01813-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002600169245012100195300001600316520095400332592002801286650001601314650001701330650001101347650000901358650001401367650002201381650001101403650001901414650001001433650001001443650000901453650002901462650003401491650002801525650003401553650003001587650002001617650002201637650004301659653002601702653002701728653002501755653000901780653002401789700002801813700002201841700002801863700002201891700003501913773008901948856008402037852000902121655001202130IND60086729220221117225950.0160903e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008672922DNAL7 a233697532pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2012.12.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrłowska, Elżbieta,10aMycorrhizal colonization affects the elemental distribution in roots of Ni-hyperaccumulator Berkheya coddii Roessler  ap. 100-109.  aThe effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on the distribution and concentration of elements in roots of Ni-hyperaccumulating plant Berkheya coddii was studied. Micro-PIXE (particle-induced X-ray emission) analysis revealed significant differences between AMF-inoculated and non-inoculated plants as well as between main and lateral roots. The accumulation of P, K, Mn and Zn in the cortical layer of lateral roots of inoculated plants confirmed the important role of AMF in uptake and accumulation of these elements. Higher concentration of P, K, Fe, Ni, Cu and Zn in the vascular stele in roots of AMF-inoculated plants than in the non-inoculated ones indicates more efficient translocation of these elements to the aboveground parts of the plant. These findings indicate the necessity of including the influence of AMF in studies on the uptake of elements by plants and in industrial use of B. coddii for Ni extraction from polluted soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aaerial parts 3acopper 3airon 3amanganese 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anickel 3apolluted soils 3aroots 3astele 3azinc 2aAsteraceaexmicrobiology 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aMycorrhizaexphysiology 2aNickelxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiology 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysisxmetabolism. 0aArbuscular mycorrhiza 0aElemental distribution 0aNi-hyperaccumulation 0aRoot 0aX-ray microanalysis1 aPrzybyłowicz, Wojciech1 aOrlowski, Dariusz1 aMongwaketsi, Nametso P.1 aTurnau, Katarzyna1 aMesjasz-Przybyłowicz, Jolanta0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2013 Apr., v. 175 p.100-109dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2012.12.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245012400173300001600297520131300313592002801626650001701654650001301671650002301684650001301707650002201720650001301742650001201755650001601767650001001783650001301793651001001806653001001816653002001826653003101846653002201877700001501899773011001914856009002024852000902114655001202123IND60084085620221119174710.0190318e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008408562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2013.08.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Minghong14aThe changing settlements in rural areas under urban pressure in China: Patterns, driving forces and policy implications  ap. 170-177.  aRural areas under urban pressure (rural areas under pressure) in China face a growing conflict between the expansion of developed areas and the protection of cropland. The concentration of rural settlements has been embraced by local governments as a strategy to alleviate the conflict between these two land-use needs. This paper used Daxing District, Beijing, China as a case study to discuss the evolution of rural settlements in China over the past three decades and to consider the policy implications for rural settlement concentration. The results showed that: (1) over the past three decades, rural settlements have remained evenly distributed, and in 2007 each settlement had an average of 609 inhabitants; (2) the area of rural settlements has increased by approximately 100% because of various factors such as decreasing household size, increasing numbers of migrants, and improvements in living conditions; and (3) the shape of rural settlements has become more regular. These factors pose challenges to concentrating rural settlements. This study recommends that rural settlement concentration and restructuring should pay special attention to the economies of scale of market towns and large and merged villages, which can house larger populations and better accommodate industry in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acropland 3aeconomies of scale 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3amarkets 3arural areas 3atowns 3avillages 3aChina 0aChina 0aDaxing District 0aRural areas under pressure 0aRural settlements1 aLi, Xiubin0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2013 Dec., v. 120 p.170-177dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2013.08.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01099naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245005100174520024300225592002800468653000700496653000800503653002200511653001200533653002100545700006100566773009900627856008600726852000900812655001200821IND60743711320221118224023.0210820e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074371132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2021.1099732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbanese, Giuseppe10aIndustrialization, turnout, and left-wing vote  aBy using an instrumental-variable framework for municipality-level data referring to Italy’s First Republic (1951–1991), we show that industrialization caused an increase in voter turnout and a very pronounced rise in left-wing votes.  aPublisher supplied data 0aO1 0aP16 0aIndustrialization 0aTurnout 0aElection results1 aDe Blasio, Guido,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2800-20380 tEconomics letters.g2021 Sept., v. 206 p.109973-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2021.1099733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002800171245011200199300001600311500001100327500001500338520119300353592002801546650001601574650001901590650001801609650001101627650001501638650002301653650001101676653001601687700001701703700002901720700002601749700003001775773009901805856005501904852000901959655001201968IND4475876620221121054030.0120318e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447587662DNAL7 a223213142pmid7 a10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01743.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoropoulos, Christopher10aOcean acidification reduces coral recruitment by disrupting intimate larval‐algal settlement interactions  ap. 338-346.  aLETTER  a2019-12-06  aEcology Letters (2012) 15: 338–346 ABSTRACT: Successful recruitment in shallow reef ecosystems often involves specific cues that connect planktonic invertebrate larvae with particular crustose coralline algae (CCA) during settlement. While ocean acidification (OA) can reduce larval settlement and the abundance of CCA, the impact of OA on the interactions between planktonic larvae and their preferred settlement substrate are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that CO2 concentrations (800 and 1300 μatm) predicted to occur by the end of this century significantly reduce coral (Acropora millepora) settlement and CCA cover by ≥ 45%. The CCA important for inducing coral settlement (Titanoderma spp., Hydrolithon spp.) were the most deleteriously affected by OA. Surprisingly, the only preferred settlement substrate (Titanoderma) in the experimental controls was avoided by coral larvae as pCO2 increased, and other substrata selected. Our results suggest OA may reduce coral population recovery by reducing coral settlement rates, disrupting larval settlement behaviour, and reducing the availability of the most desirable coralline algal species for successful coral recruitment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHydrolithon 3acarbon dioxide 3aacidification 3acorals 3aecosystems 3aAcropora millepora 3alarvae 0arecruitment1 aWard, Selina1 aDiaz‐Pulido, Guillermo1 aHoegh‐Guldberg, Ove1 aMumby, P.

Changes in survivorship and stand structure characteristics (diameter (DBH), basal area, height, age, and crown length ratio) of nearly 2500 spatially-referenced trees located in 64 long-term survey plots were compared over four time periods that spanned the duration of the outbreak disturbance event. Stand structure characteristics, topographic factors (slope, elevation, and aspect), and solar equinox radiation were tested as predictors of mortality for multiple stages in the outbreak using boosted regression tree modeling. Our findings showed that: (1) spatial synchrony was not reflective of mortality severity; (2) mortality rates increased significantly as the outbreak progressed; (3) the stand’s structure was altered significantly by the outbreak (larger trees were killed most frequently); (4) stand structure characteristics were the best predictors of mortality in all stages of the outbreak, though topographic factors and solar equinox radiation also exhibited moderate to strong predictive power in some stages; and (5) stand complexity decreased significantly as the outbreak progressed. This illustrates the inherently complex nature of bark beetle outbreaks on fine spatial scales and suggests that the extent and severity of spruce mortality during an outbreak event is largely dependent on the relative stage of the outbreak and the structure of the stand.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeetle infestations 3anational parks 3asurvival rate 3abark beetles 3amountains 3amodels 3asurveys 3aregression analysis 3aPicea abies 3atrees 3astand basal area 3aIps typographus 3astand structure 3aforests 3aPoland 0aStand complexity 0aBoosted regression trees 0aOutbreak 0aTree mortality 0abasal area1 aAdamus, Michał1 aBukowski, Marcin1 aKrzyżanowski, Tomasz1 aSzewczyk, Janusz1 aStatwick, Joseph1 aSzwagrzyk, Jerzy0 tForest ecology and management.g2015 Oct. 15, v. 354 p.261-271dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2015.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02190naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005900149245014500208520102100353592002801374650001001402650001401412650001701426650001601443650001701459650001601476653001601492653001701508653003301525653002201558653001801580700002301598773012601621856008401747852000901831655001201840IND60736463420221116152706.0210729e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073646342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cocis.2021.1014632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aExner, Agata A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3913-706610aBursting microbubbles: How nanobubble contrast agents can enable the future of medical ultrasound molecular imaging and image-guided therapy  aThe field of medical ultrasound has undergone a significant evolution since the development of microbubbles as contrast agents. However, because of their size, microbubbles remain in the vasculature and therefore have limited clinical applications. Building a better—and smaller—bubble can expand the applications of contrast-enhanced ultrasound by allowing bubbles to extravasate from blood vessels—creating new opportunities. In this review, we summarize recent research on the formulation and use of nanobubbles (NBs) as imaging agents and as therapeutic vehicles. We discuss the ongoing debates in the field and reluctance to accepting NBs as an acoustically active construct and a potentially impactful clinical tool that can help shape the future of medical ultrasound. We hope that the overview of key experimental and theoretical findings in the NB field presented in this article provides a fundamental framework that will help clarify NB–ultrasound interactions and inspire engagement in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3aevolution 3amicrobubbles 3ananobubbles 3atherapeutics 3aultrasonics 0aNanobubbles 0aMicrobubbles 0aContrast-enhanced ultrasound 0aMolecular imaging 0aDrug delivery1 aKolios, Michael C.0 tCurrent opinion in colloid & interface science.g2021 Aug., v. 54 p.101463-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12032x1359-02947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cocis.2021.1014633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02046naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245008500157300001600242520111700258592002801375650001401403650002501417650001101442650001301453650001101466650001301477650001401490650001101504700001801515700001501533773007801548856007301626852000901699655001201708IND60408512020221119084753.0150905e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040851202DNAL7 a10.1111/eth.124152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoha, Jill A.10aVocal Learning in Songbirds and Humans: A Retrospective in Honor of Peter Marler  ap. 933-945.  aPeter Marler made a number of significant contributions to the field of ethology, particularly in the area of animal communication. His research on birdsong learning gave rise to a thriving subfield. An important tenet of this growing subfield is that parallels between birdsong and human speech make songbirds valuable as models in comparative and translational research, particularly in the case of vocal learning and development. Decades ago, Marler pointed out several phenomena common to the processes of vocal development in songbirds and humans—including a dependence on early acoustic experience, sensitive periods, predispositions, auditory feedback, intrinsic reinforcement, and a progression through distinct developmental stages—and he advocated for the value of comparative study in this domain. We review Marler's original comparisons between birdsong and speech ontogeny and summarize subsequent progress in research into these and other parallels. We also revisit Marler's arguments in support of the comparative study of vocal development in the context of its widely recognized value today.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aanimal communication 3ahumans 3alearning 3amodels 3aontogeny 3asongbirds 3aspeech1 aPeters, Susan1 aFoster, S.0 tEthology.g2015 Oct., v. 121, no. 10 p.933-945dP.

Their activity for the catalytic flameless combustion of methane was tested and the results interpreted focusing on the effect of doping at A and/or B position. It was found that Ce doping of lanthanum ferrite catalysts could suppress suprafacial activity and slightly enhance intrafacial activity, due to the change of oxygen mobility. However, catalytic activity seems independent of the type of electronic conductivity (p- or n-type), the activity of an analogously Sr-doped sample being similar to that of the Ce-doped one. Mixed B-metal composition can help in modulating both oxygen mobility and catalyst stability under reducing reaction conditions. High Fe content allows to optimise this last parameter. However, depression of oxygen mobility and hence of activity has to be prevented by proper doping at A-position.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acerium 3acitrates 3acombustion 3adesorption 3aferrimagnetic materials 3airon 3alanthanum 3amethane 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3atemperature1 aTavares, A.

Often, quasi-reference electrodes (QREs) such as Ag wires and Li metal strips are used. However, small changes in electrolyte composition can cause large potential drifts, and their surfaces may be reactive to the solution. Here, we propose an alternative QRE based on polypyrrole electrodeposited on Pt wire (PPyQRE) encased in a glass tube with the open end sealed with commercial frits. While freestanding PPyQRE wires have been reported in the literature, simple encasing of the PPyQRE overcomes the above-mentioned drawbacks of QREs while providing a reliable reference potential that is closer to the performance of an RE. During cyclic voltammetric and bulk electrolysis testing of a redox mediator in solution, the encased PPyQRE exhibited stable reference potentials over multiple charge/discharge cycles with minimal drift (∼5 mV) after ∼2.25 days of operation. We also tested the reliability of our reference during the testing of multilayer graphene Li-ion anodes, which often involve cycling samples at highly reducing potentials (<−3 V vs Fc/Fc⁺) over long durations (>1 day). In the same testing conditions, the Ag/Ag⁺ electrode led to observable Ag deposits on the graphene and large potential drifts (∼50 mV), while the PPyQRE exhibited no measurable drift and revealed changes in voltammetric features that were obscured by reference drift when using Ag/Ag⁺. Minor reference drifts of ∼30 mV over long usage of the PPyQRE (∼2 months) can be addressed by calibration with a ferrocene couple at the end of experiments. These results highlight the advantages of using an encased PPyQRE as a simple and practical reference electrode for electrochemical measurements in the field of nonaqueous energy storage research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3acalibration 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aelectroplating 3aenergy 3aferrocenes 3aglass 3agraphene 3apyrroles 3avoltammetry1 aMishra, Abhiroop1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3403-44551 aRodríguez López, Joaquín,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4346-46680 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Oct. 13, v. 93, no. 42 p.14048-14052dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c035523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245010900204300001600313500001400329520161000343592002801953650002701981650002202008650003002030650002602060650001902086650002302105650002402128650001602152650001802168650001702186650001102203650002202214650001402236650001502250650000902265650002002274650001402294650001302308650002602321650000902347650001002356650001202366650001702378650002002395650001702415650001302432700002002445773011302465856008202578852000902660655001202669IND60707141720221120192030.0200814e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070714172DNAL7 a10.1007/s12571-020-01074-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAiyar, Anaka1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3525-753810aPandemics and food systems - towards a proactive food safety approach to disease prevention & management  ap. 749-756.  aNAL-light  aRecent large-scale pandemics such as the covid19, H1N1, Swine flu, Ebola and the Nipah virus, which impacted human health and livelihoods, have come about due to inadequate food systems safeguards to detect, trace and eliminate threats arising from zoonotic diseases. Such diseases are transmitted to humans through their interaction with animals in the food value chain including through the consumption of bush meat. Climate change has also facilitated the emergence of new zoonotic diseases. The lack of adequately enforced food-safety standards in managed agricultural production systems creates the necessary conditions for diseases to mutate into highly contagious strains. The lack of food safety measures in handling, packaging and sales of food increases risks of cross-species contamination. Finally, increasing anti-microbial resistance, combined with rapid urbanization and global interconnectedness allows diseases to spread rapidly among humans. Thus, part of the reconstruction efforts, post covid19, should include prioritizing proactive investments in food safety. The key to stave off another such pandemic lies in integrating one-health knowledge on zoonotic diseases along with food safety measures along the food value chain. Refocusing policy priorities from disease control to prevention will improve international coordination efforts in pandemic prevention. Implementing such proactive actions will cost a very small fraction of the reconstruction budgets. However, the expected benefits of the food-safety approach will include preventing global economic losses due to pandemics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoronavirus infections 3aNipah henipavirus 3aadministrative management 3aantibiotic resistance 3aclimate change 3adisease prevention 3afinancial economics 3afood safety 3afood security 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3aknowledge 3alivelihood 3ameat 3anutritive value 3apackaging 3apandemic 3aproduction technology 3arisk 3asales 3astrains 3asupply chain 3aswine influenza 3aurbanization 3azoonoses1 aPingali, Prabhu0 tFood security.g2020 Aug., v. 12, no. 4 p.749-756dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000074x1876-45177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-020-01074-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02539naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245011300212520133600325592002801661650001101689650001401700650001101714650001401725650001401739650001101753650001001764650001301774650001301787650001201800653000801812653000801820653002601828653002201854653003801876653003301914773009901947856008602046852000902132655001202141IND60743711620221118223946.0210820e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074371162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2021.1099762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeah, Kelvin K.C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3231-520510aDo ethnically-congruent teachers really matter little for Hispanic​ students? A re-examination of the data  aWhile there is now much evidence in the literature that assignment to ethnically-congruent teachers results in better student outcomes like achievement and teachers’ evaluations of their behavior for Black and White students, findings appear to be noticeably mixed for Hispanic students. This paper shows that a potential explanation for the mixed findings for Hispanic students lies in the fact that previous studies have not adequately accounted for the cultural background of students and teachers. Unlike existing studies, which define matches to occur when a student and teacher report having the same race, I define matches to occur only if the student and teacher report having both the same race and native language. The rationale is that race and native language together provide a more complete picture of ethnic identity compared to only race. Employing a student fixed effects strategy, and comparing two different teachers’ evaluations of the same student, I find that Hispanic students receive significantly more favorable evaluations from Hispanic teachers who share the same native language than Hispanic teachers who speak a different native language or non-Hispanic teachers. This suggests that more coherent findings may emerge if researchers additionally consider native language in defining ethnic matches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlacks 3aHispanics 3aWhites 3aeconomics 3alanguages 3amixing 3araces 3astudents 3ateachers 3awhiting 0aI21 0aJ15 0aEducational economics 0aHispanic students 0aRace and native language matching 0aStudent–teacher assignment0 tEconomics letters.g2021 Sept., v. 206 p.109976-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2021.1099763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01335naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245016500158300001800323520026500341592002800606650002300634650002000657650001700677650001900694650001100713650001700724700002100741700001500762700002100777773012800798856007400926852000901000655001201009IND60656703320221122232757.0190814e20131121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065670332DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ay41335g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhen, Shu Jun10aDual-aptamer-based sensitive and selective detection of prion protein through the fluorescence resonance energy transfer between quantum dots and graphene oxide  ap. 6904-6907.  aWe developed a new dual-aptamer based strategy to detect cellular prion protein through the fluorescence resonance energy transfer between quantum dots and graphene oxide, in which the distance between the energy donor and the acceptor ranges from 14 to 27 nm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3agraphene oxide 3aprions 3aquantum dots1 aZhuang, Hong Lin1 aWang, Jian1 aHuang, Cheng Zhi0 tAnalytical methods.g2013 Nov. 21, v. 5, no. 24 p.6904-6907dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ay41335g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03310naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245018800164300001800352520167200370592002802042596006902070596005002139650002102189650003302210650001702243650001602260650001802276650002302294650001702317650001002334650002202344650002302366650001502389650001602404650001802420650001302438700001802451700001302469700001602482700001702498700001502515700001902530700001602549700001802565773013002583856008202713852000902795655001202804IND60675126720221119032902.0191104e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067512672DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-019-01778-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Xuexue10aMolecular cloning of the cpeT gene encoding a bilin lyase responsible for attachment of phycoerythrobilin to Cys-158 on the β-subunit of phycoerythrin in Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis  ap. 3331-3340.  aPhycobilin lyase plays an important role in the binding of phycobilin chromophores to phycobiliprotein. The bilin lyase cpeT gene was cloned from Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis to study the synthesis of fluorescent phycobiliprotein. Two recombinant plasmids, one containing the genes (ho1 and pebA, pebB) that produce phycoerythrobilin and the other containing the two subunit genes (rpeB, rpeA) of phycoerythrin (R-PE), as well as the lyase gene cpeT, were constructed and transformed into Escherichia coli. The recombinant strain with lyase CpeT and the β-subunit of phycoerythrin (R-PeB) enhanced the optical activity of R-PE, indicating that lyase CpeT catalyzes the synthesis of the R-PeB with optical activity. Another two recombinant plasmids, one containing the genes (ho(314), pcyA(314)) that produce phycocyanobilin and the other containing the two subunit genes (rpcB, rpcA) of phycocyanin (R-PC), as well as the lyase gene cpeT, were constructed and transformed into Escherichia coli. However, there was no enhancement in fluorescence in this recombinant strain, revealing that lyase CpeT cannot catalyze the synthesis of optically active R-PC. Thereafter, Cys-82 and Cys-158 of R-PeB were individually mutated to identify the possible binding sites of apoproteins with phycobilins catalyzed by CpeT. We found that there was a significant decrease in the fluorescence of the mutated Cys-158 recombinant strain, suggesting that Cys-158 is the active site for the binding of the β-subunit with CpeT-catalyzed phycoerythrobilin in G. lemaneiformis. The results of this study lay the foundation for understanding the synthesis of fluorescent phycobiliprotein.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant No. 31872555cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aCRAS-50cAgriculture Research System of China 3aEscherichia coli 3aGracilariopsis lemaneiformis 3aactive sites 3aapoproteins 3abinding sites 3acatalytic activity 3afluorescence 3agenes 3amolecular cloning 3aoptical properties 3aphycobilin 3aphycocyanin 3aphycoerythrin 3aplasmids1 aZang, Xiaonan1 aLiu, Zhu1 aJin, Yuming1 aSun, Deguang1 aGuo, Yalin1 aWang, Zhendong1 aZhang, Feng1 aLin, Jiaojiao0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2019 Oct., v. 31, no. 5 p.3331-3340dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-019-01778-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01907naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245007900209520066600288592002800954650001500982650000900997650002301006650002201029650001101051650001101062650001601073653000801089653000801097653000801105653003101113653001001144653001501154653002001169700006301189700006301252773009901315856008601414852000901500655001201509IND60743711720221118224025.0210820e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074371172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2021.1099772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassan, Kabir,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6274-354510aUsing precious metals to hedge cryptocurrency policy and price uncertainty  aThis study discovers a new dimension by analyzing the time-varying correlations between the top four precious metals and cryptocurrency uncertainty indices (UCRY Policy and Price).

The adsorption capacity of [Zn-Al]-LDH was significantly better than that of [Mg-Al]-LDH. The pollutants removal performance and behavior of microorganisms in LDH-SBBRs were also investigated. LDH-SBBRs showed improved removal efficiencies of COD, phosphate and TP with a low C/N ratio. Microscopic images show that biofilm formed rapidly in LDH-SBBRs. SEM-EDS detected abundant carbon and phosphorus, implying that biomass and phosphorus accumulate on LDH carriers. The microbial compositions of the three SBBRs indicate that the LDHs carriers improved the biodiversity of biofilm in the bioreactors. Synergistic effects of adsorption and biodegradation between well-structured LDHs and microorganisms led to an improved phosphate removal performance of LDH-SBBR. The results also demonstrate that [Zn-Al]-LDH carrier is the best for improving SBBR phosphate removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abatch systems 3abiodegradation 3abiodiversity 3abiofilm 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3acarbon 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 0aLDHs 0aBacteria 0aCarriers 0aPhosphate removal 0aSBBR 0aLDHs 0aSBBR 0aPAOs1 aXie, Xin1 aXu, Huanle1 aLiu, Jingxuan1 aLi, Bolin1 aZhang, Qiwu0 tBioresource technology.g2022 Apr., v. 349 p.126879-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1268793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245012800163300002000291520154400311592002801855650002501883650001501908650002001923650002901943650001701972650003301989650002102022650001402043650001002057650001102067700001702078700005802095700005702153700006802210700005702278773013102335856008502466852000902551655001202560IND60754850920221121151156.0211026e20211014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075485092DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c036002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Bin10aVersatile Integration of Liquid-Phase Microextraction and Fluorescent Aptamer Beacons: A Synergistic Effect for Bioanalysis  ap. 14323-14333.  aFluorescent aptamer beacons (FABs) are a major category of biosensors widely used in environmental analysis. However, due to their low compatibility, it is difficult to use the common FABs for biological samples. To overcome this challenge, construction of FABs with complex structures to adapt the nature of biological samples is currently in progress in this field. Unlike previous works, we moved our range of vision from the FAB itself to the biological sample. Inspired by this idea, in this work, flat membrane-based liquid-phase microextraction (FM-LPME) with sufficient sample cleanup and preconcentration capacities was integrated with FABs. With the merits of both FM-LPME and FABs, the integrated LPME-FAB system displayed a clear synergistic enhancement for target analysis. Specifically, LPME in the LPME-FAB system provided purified and enriched Hg²⁺ for the FAB recognition, while the FAB recognition event promoted the extraction efficiency of LPME. Due to superior performances, the LPME-FAB system achieved highly sensitive analysis of Hg²⁺ in urine samples with a detection limit of 27 nM and accuracies in the range of 98–113%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that an integrated LPME-FAB system was constructed for target analysis in biological samples. We believe that this study will provide a new insight into the next generation of biosensors, where the integration of sample preparation with detection probes is as important as the design of complex probes in the field of bioanalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3aenvironmental assessment 3afluorescence 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3aoligonucleotides 3asynergism 3aurine 3avision1 aLiu, Huajing1 aHuang, Chuixiu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4869-40591 aXiao, Xianjin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0455-10801 aPedersen-Bjergaard, Stig1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1666-80431 aShen, Xiantao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2118-74200 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Oct. 14, v. 93, no. 42 p.14323-14333dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c036003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02305naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006100146245009200207300002000299520129900319592002801618650003001646650002801676650001401704650002301718700002201741700002501763773013801788856008001926852000902006655001202015IND60746137120221120132454.0210729e20210716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074613712DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c026532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEgorov, Sergei A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0600-246710aAntiferromagnetism-Induced Spin Splitting in Systems Described by Magnetic Layer Groups  ap. 16147-16154.  aIn this paper, we report the classification of all the 528 magnetic layer groups into seven spin splitting prototypes, in analogy to the similar classification previously reported for the 1651 magnetic space groups [Yuan et al., Phys. Rev. Mat. 2021, 5, 014409]. According to this classification, induced (Pekar–Rashba) spin splitting is possible in the antiferromagnetic monolayers described by magnetic layer groups of type I (no anti-unitary operations) and III, both in the presence and in the absence of the space inversion operation. As one specific application, we have studied theoretically the (110) monolayer of antiferromagnetic (AFM) MnO₂. Our density functional theory calculations for this structure predicted colossal (on the order of 1 eV) spin splitting in the entire Brillouin zone, similar to the case of the (110) monolayer of AFM MnF₂ which was studied by us earlier. This splitting is much larger compared to the corresponding values for the bulk AFM1 structure of β-MnO₂, which was rationalized by noting that the (110) monolayer is described by the type I magnetic layer group that does not contain anti-unitary symmetry operations, and therefore, spin splitting is not suppressed anywhere in the entire Brillouin zone, including high-symmetry points and lines.  aPublisher supplied data 3adensity functional theory 3aferrimagnetic materials 3amagnetism 3aphysical chemistry1 aLitvin, Daniel B.1 aEvarestov, Robert A.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 July 16, v. 125, no. 29 p.16147-16154dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c026533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012400171300001600295520117000311592002801481650002101509650001301530650001701543650002601560650001501586650001901601650002201620650001301642650001701655650001801672650001401690650001501704650001301719650002701732650001601759650002201775650001901797653001301816653002001829653002001849653002201869653001401891653002701905700002901932700002101961700001701982700002201999700002002021773010902041856008602150852000902236655001202245IND60568568220221120151155.0190318e20170915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056856822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFathi, Marziyeh10aFolate-conjugated thermosensitive O-maleoyl modified chitosan micellar nanoparticles for targeted delivery of erlotinib  ap. 130-141.  aIn the present work, new self-assembled nanoparticles (NPs) were engineered using biocompatible and biodegradable natural polymer, chitosan (CS). The complexation of CS with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) facilitated the regioselective chemical modification of CS hydroxyl groups with maleic anhydride, and produced polymerizable precursor of CS that was further grafted with N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) as temperature-sensitive moiety and oleic acid (OA) as hydrophobic monomer. After removal of SDS complex, the free amino groups were functionalized with folic acid (FA) to form folate-(PNIPAAm-co-OA)-g-CS micellar NPs. The NPs were loaded with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib (ETB), which was carried out above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of micelles solution. The structure, size distribution, zeta potential, thermal stability, elemental composition, morphology and LCST of the synthesized micelles were characterized. The cellular uptake and cell cytotoxicity analyses revealed that the developed smart folate-(PNIPAAm-co-OA)-g-CS micellar NPs could be used for effective cancer therapy as an injectable tumor targeting nanocarrier.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3achitosan 3acytotoxicity 3aelemental composition 3afolic acid 3ahydrophobicity 3amaleic anhydrides 3amicelles 3ananocarriers 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3aoleic acid 3apolymers 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3azeta potential 0aChitosan 0aThermosensitive 0aFolate-targeted 0aHemocompatibility 0aErlotinib 0aTargeted drug delivery1 aZangabad, Parham Sahandi1 aAghanejad, Ayuob1 aBarar, Jaleh1 aErfan-Niya, Hamid1 aOmidi, Yadollah0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2017 Sept. 15, v. 172 p.130-141dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03684naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007000140245018100210300001800391500002000409520193700429592002802366650001702394650002402411650001302435650001202448650002102460650001702481650001902498650001902517650002902536650001802565650002402583650002202607650001802629650002202647650000902669650001702678650002802695700005902723700006602782700005802848700005902906700002202965773011902987856007503106852000903181655001203190IND60790617320221119182826.0220826e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079061732DNAL7 a10.1002/agj2.211642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPopescu, Gheorghe Cristian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5432-460710aAgricultural sciences and the environment: Reviewing recent technologies and innovations to combat the challenges of climate change, environmental protection, and food security  ap. 1895-1901.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAgricultural production systems currently face multiple challenges: Climate change, natural resource depletion, and supply chain disruption, together with global population growth. As sustainable agriculture must simultaneously deliver myriad services (e.g. provide food security, maintain natural resources, retain and improve framers’ profitability, and sustain biodiversity), a systemic and multidisciplinary approach is thus needed. In this context, new technologies based on sensors, automatic machines, robots, and digital applications show much potential. The special section of the Agronomy Journal, entitled, “Agricultural and Biological Sciences: Plant, Soil, Animal and Environment Nutrient Management,” brings together a coherent set of research studies. All papers published in this special section address current, relevant topics for agriculture, biology and environmental sciences with a multidisciplinary approach aimed at generating new scientific information on digital technologies, bioinformatics, plant science, soil resources, agricultural waste, and environmentally conscious approaches. A total of 58 papers were submitted, each of which was evaluated by expert reviewers using a double‐blind reviewing process and 25 full text papers were accepted for publication in the special section. The present paper highlights the findings of the published papers, with the aim of bringing cutting‐edge innovation to applied research in agriculture and biology. The published papers here provide new knowledge and viable solutions for better performance in agricultural and biological sciences. New technologies will change the concept of farming and agribusiness making it more profitable, efficient, safer, attractive, simple, smart, and finally sustainable. Rural development and food security policies must support and finance the easiest possible access to new technologies for agricultural producers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagribusiness 3aagricultural wastes 3aagronomy 3aanimals 3aapplied research 3abiodiversity 3abioinformatics 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental protection 3afood security 3anutrient management 3apopulation growth 3aprofitability 3arural development 3asoil 3asupply chain 3asustainable agriculture1 aPopescu, Monica1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0757-28671 aKhondker, Moniruzzaman1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5608-16371 aClay, David E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5031-97441 aPampana, Silvia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4194-31201 aUmehara, Mikihisa0 tAgronomy journal.g2022 July, v. 114, no. 4 p.1895-1901dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.211643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245011200161300001800273520137800291592002801669650002801697650002901725650001701754650001801771650002001789650001901809650001801828650001201846650004301858650005201901650001501953650002601968700001501994700001602009700001902025773010702044856007802151852000902229655001202238IND60408512420221119084550.0150905e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040851242DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2014009382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGe, Jingping10aEffect of small interfering RNA against Paracin 1.7 bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus paracasei HD1‐7  ap. 1075-1081.  aLactobacillus paracasei HD1‐7 (CCTCCM 205015), isolated from Chinese sauerkraut fermentation broth, contains the bacteriocin Paracin 1.7 which possesses broad‐spectrum antibacterial activity. The gene‐silencing effect of small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a potential strategy for further understanding the mechanism of production of Paracin 1.7 by L. paracasei HD1‐7. In this study, the effect of siRNA on the expression of the most important proteins in the production of Paracin 1.7, sensor kinase (prcK) and response regulator (prcR), was investigated. SiRNA were designed against prcK and prcR, and qRT‐PCR was performed to examine the expression of prcK and prcR mRNA. The efficacy of siRNA was determined by comparing the level of antimicrobial activity of the strains. qRT‐PCR showed that siRNA‐K4 and siRNA‐K5 significantly inhibited the expression of prcK mRNA, and siRNA‐R4 and siRNA‐R6 significantly inhibited the expression of prcR mRNA. The proteins levels and antibacterial activities of mutant strains were lower than the original and control groups, respectively. The results demonstrate that siRNA inhibited both mRNA expression and the production of Paracin 1.7 in L. paracasei HD1‐7. Targeting of prcK and prcR with siRNA appears to be a novel strategy for researching the mechanism of Paracin 1.7 production by L. paracasei HD1‐7.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus paracasei 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteriocins 3aculture media 3agene expression 3agene silencing 3amessenger RNA 3amutants 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asauerkraut 3asmall interfering RNA1 aWang, Yang1 aGao, Dongni1 aPing, Wenxiang0 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2015 Sept., v. 55, no. 9 p.1075-1081dAkademie-Verlagx0233-111X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2014009383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245011400173520185500287592002802142650001902170650002002189650001202209650001502221650001102236650001502247650002202262650001402284650001002298650002202308651001002330651000902340651001002349651001302359653002702372653001102399653001102410653001502421653001502436653001902451700002302470773014802493856008502641852000902726655001202735IND60688974420221121014425.0200607e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068897442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.1097432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArefifard, Sakineh10aEnd-Guadalupian extinction of larger fusulinids in central Iran and implications for the global biotic crisis  aThe end-Guadalupian (Capitanian) biotic crisis was less intense than its end-Permian counterpart but highly selective against certain groups of tropical organisms, such as rugose corals and keriothecal-walled fusulinid foraminifera. The causes of this event remain debated, in part due to apparent disagreement among stratigraphic sections in the timing of taxonomic losses. In order to further constrain the timing of extinction and assess the broader pattern of change in benthic marine ecosystems across the Guadalupian/Lopingian boundary (GLB), here we report the stratigraphic occurrence patterns of the large, keriothecal-walled fusulinid foraminifera as well as associated skeletal grains in the Abadeh section, central Iran, which contains a relatively complete record through the GLB interval. The last keriothecal-walled fusulinid occurs within the upper Wordian at Abadeh whereas smaller fusulinids continue to occur below and above the Guadalupian/Lopingian boundary (GLB). A lithologic change from carbonates toward chert and shale within the section suggests that the local disappearance of the keriothecal fusulinids prior to the GLB reflects a facies control rather than global extinction long prior to the GLB. Re-examination of the last occurrences of keriothecal-walled fusulinids in well-studied sections of South China, Japan, NE Thailand, and Transcaucasia reveals that facies change to organic-rich sediments can explain the local disappearance of these species prior to the GLB in both Japan and NE Thailand. Apparent diachroneity of extinction in this group appears best interpreted to reflect local facies effects rather than a protracted extinction event. Global, warming-induced failure of associations between fusulinids and photosymbionts following Emeishan volcanism is the scenario most consistent with available data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapitanian age 3aLopingian epoch 3aRetaria 3acarbonates 3acorals 3aextinction 3amarine ecosystems 3asediments 3ashale 3avolcanic activity 3aChina 3aIran 3aJapan 3aThailand 0aKeriothecal fusulinids 0aFacies 0aTethys 0aCapitanian 0aExtinction 0aGlobal warming1 aPayne, Jonathan L.0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2020 July 15, v. 550 p.109743-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.1097433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01912naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245013700167300001800304520068700322592002801009650000901037650001601046650001701062650001501079650000801094650002201102650000901124650001001133650002401143650001601167650000901183650001601192650002501208650000901233700002601242700002301268773012801291856007401419852000901493655001201502IND60656703620221122222511.0190814e20131024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065670362DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ay41343h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouza, Silvéria N.

The introduction of an optical signal could not only improve the selectivity of the detection systems, but also make it possible to observe the reduction of the ionic current that originated from stimulus-triggered nanochannel changes. However, the resolution of an optical signal can only verify issues of the presence or absence and cannot precisely analyze the detailed chemical structural changes within nanochannels. Here, we employed a biocompatible condensation reaction between 2-cyanobenzothiazole (CBT) and d-cysteine, and synthesized molecules PCTC that can be polymerized by cutting off short peptide sequences in the presence of furin to realize the detection of furin with multiple signal outputs. Through the introduction of a UV light-sensitive DNA sequence to the capture probes (CPs) inside the nanochannels, the blocking of the nanochannels can be confirmed to the formed oligomers by mass spectrometry analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3acondensation reactions 3afluorescence 3amass spectrometry 3anucleotide sequences 3apeptides1 aJiang, Wenlian1 aChen, Qing1 aLiu, Rui1 aLou, Xiaoding1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6556-20341 aXia, Fan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7705-46380 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Oct. 11, v. 93, no. 42 p.14036-14041dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c037273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245012100160300001400281500001400295520107600309592002801385650001401413650002001427650002601447650001701473650001601490650003101506650000901537650002601546650001201572650001501584650001401599650001101613653001501624653001401639653002301653700001701676700001701693700001701710700001601727773007801743856008201821852000901903655001201912IND60704966920221119060326.0200728s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070496692DNAL7 a10.1163/1568541087833601042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Li10aNutrient potential of various Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus bacteria for a free-living nematode Panagrellus redivivus  ap. 79-85.  aNAL-light  aXenorhabdus and Photorhabdus bacteria are symbionts of entomopathogenic nematodes of the genera Steinernema and Heterorhabditis, respectively. To determine the nutrient potential of these bacteria for a free-living nematode, Panagrellus redivivus, a promising food source for first-feeding fish and crustacean, sterile first-stage juveniles (J1) of P. redivivus were fed on various isolates of Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus bacteria in liquid cultures. Most of the tested bacterial isolates did not support the growth of P. redivivus. However, four of the Xenorhabdus isolates (X. nematophila All, X. bovienii T319, X. beddingii X-7 and X. poinarii KG) provided nutrients for the production of these nematodes in a liquid medium. Two Xenorhabdus isolates (X. beddingii X-7 and X. poinarii KG) even supported mass production of the nematode in a sponge medium, with yields comparable to those with yeast strains. This is the first report that Xenorhabdus bacteria can function as a nutrient source for mass production of nematodes other than their usual symbiotic partners.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrustacea 3aHeterorhabditis 3aPanagrellus redivivus 3aPhotorhabdus 3aSteinernema 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3afish 3afree-living nematodes 3aliquids 3anematology 3asymbionts 3ayeasts 0aPRODUCTION 0aFISH FOOD 0aSYMBIOTIC BACTERIA1 aQiu, Xuehong1 aLiu, Xiaofen1 aLiu, Xiuling1 aHan, Richou0 tNematology.g, v. 10, no. 1 p.79-85dBrillwJournal:2154x1388-55457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568541087833601043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02678naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245012200170300001600292520114000308592002801448650002101476650002401497650002701521650001601548650002601564650002901590650003601619650001401655650001801669650002401687650002601711650001101737650003301748650001001781653001801791653002201809653002701831653001401858700002201872700002501894700002101919700001901940773014601959856008202105852000902187655001202196IND60628038320221116195400.0190129e20180415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062803832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.03.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantana, Paula A.10aAlpha-helical domain from IL-8 of salmonids: Mechanism of action and identification of a novel antimicrobial function  ap. 803-809.  aIn this work, the potential antimicrobial role and mechanism of action of α-helix domain of trout and salmon IL-8 against Eschericia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus was investigated. By an in silico analysis of the primary structure of IL-8 from Oncorhynchus mykiss and salmo salar, it was evidenced that γ-core motif was present, as in the vast majority of kinocidins. The α-helix domain of IL-8 (αIL-8) was synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis and showed a tendency to form an α-helix conformation, as revealed by circular dichroism. Additionally, it was demonstrated that αIL-8 from both species showed antimicrobial activity against E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Membrane permeabilization and co-localization assay, as well as scanning electron microscopy, showed that these peptides were accumulated on the cell surface and in the cytoplasm, suggesting that they were capable of permeabilizing and disrupt the bacterial membranes and interact with cytoplasmic components. Our results represent the first analysis on the antimicrobial function of IL-8-derived peptide from salmonids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aSalmo salar 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantimicrobial properties 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acytoplasm 3ainterleukin-8 3amechanism of action 3amembrane permeability 3asalmon 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atrout 0aInterleukin-8 0aSynthetic peptide 0aAntimicrobial activity 0aSalmonids1 aSalinas, Nicolás1 aÁlvarez, Claudio A.1 aMercado, Luis A.1 aGuzmán, Fanny0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Apr. 15, v. 498, no. 4 p.803-809dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.03.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01383naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009800159300001800257520020400275592002800479650001500507650002300522650001100545650002500556650001300581650002900594650001300623650001100636700001700647700001900664700001700683700001500700700002000715700001600735700001800751773013300769856007400902852000900976655001200985IND60696738320221123031341.0200529e20200528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069673832DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc01573c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhuang, Xuming10aSynthesis of europium(iii)-doped copper nanoclusters for electrochemiluminescence bioanalysis  ap. 5755-5758.  aAn electrochemiluminescence biosensor based on europium(iii)-doped copper nanoclusters was proposed for the first time to achieve rapid and sensitive bioanalysis, using dopamine detection as a model.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3achemical reactions 3acopper 3acopper nanoparticles 3adopamine 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aeuropium 3amodels1 aGao, Xueqing1 aTian, Chunyuan1 aCui, Deliang1 aLuan, Feng1 aWang, Zhenguang1 aXiong, Yuan1 aChen, Lingxin0 tChemical communications.g2020 May 28, v. 56, no. 43 p.5755-5758dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0cc01573c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01419naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010100167300001400268520031900282592002800601650002300629650002500652650001300677653002700690653002900717653002200746653001700768653001200785700002300797700001600820700001900836700001600855773009200871856008500963852000901048655001201057IND60552115420221116172937.0161020e20150420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055211542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.02.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuepper, J.10aComplete genome sequence of solvent-tolerant Pseudomonas putida S12 including megaplasmid pTTS12  ap. 17-18.  aPseudomonas putida S12 is a solvent-tolerant gamma-proteobacterium with an extensive track record for production of industrially relevant chemicals.

This review is a literature overview on these diseases in humans, non-human primates, dogs, cats, rabbits, equids and ruminants with a focus on pathological and microbiological features aimed identifying common characteristics that could lead to a unified pathological classification for a better understanding of their mechanisms and causes. The result is a framework of inflammatory forms throughout the different species indicative of common mechanisms of the slow infection type characterized by a time course varying from weeks to months or even years, and where the inflammatory component would be more prominent in the intestinal interphase between host and environment and be morphologically characterized by an infiltrate ranging from lymphoplasmacytic to histiocytic. This should provide new insights for causation demonstration and therapeutic approaches in human IBD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrohn disease 3aPrimates 3acats 3acolitis 3adogs 3ahumans 3aintestines 3aparatuberculosis 3arabbits 3aruminants 3atherapeutics 0aChronic regional inflammatory intestinal disease 0aInflammatory bowel disease 0aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 0aHistopathological pattern 0aMammal enteritis1 aPérez, Valentín,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0075-15871 aJuste, Ramon A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6037-58730 tComparative immunology, microbiology, and infectious diseases.g2019 Feb., v. 62 p.88-100dElsevier LtdwJournal:12359x0147-95717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2018.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245016500161300001400326520165800340592002801998596005902026596009502085650001202180650002202192650001102214650002302225650002002248651001002268700001902278700001902297700001502316700001902331773014202350856008202492852000902574655001202583IND60627240320221122162115.0210217e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062724032DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-018-2503-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Xue14aThe Application of Expectation and Standard Deviation Calculations in the Evaluation of Dissolved Arsenic in the Pu River, Liaoning Province, Northeastern China  ap. 84-91.  aWater samples were collected from the Pu River in 2017 to research the distribution and accumulation characteristics of dissolved arsenic. We mainly built three types of expectation and standard deviation calculations corresponding to discrete, weighted and continuous random variables. The continuous expectation and standard deviation calculations are defined based on the concentration function and average formula, and the weighted expectation and standard deviation calculations are defined based on the relationship between the concentration and distance. The results indicate that the discrete expectation (1.8351 [Formula: see text]/L) and standard deviation (0.6410 [Formula: see text]/L) describe the average level and the deviation degree, respectively, of dissolved arsenic, and the continuous expectation (1.8684 [Formula: see text]/L) and standard deviation (0.5375 [Formula: see text]/L) mainly describe the average level and the dispersion degree, respectively, of dissolved arsenic after its accumulation. The weighted expectation (1.2997 [Formula: see text]/L) and standard deviation (0.2816 [Formula: see text]/L) reflect the average level and the dispersion degree, respectively, of dissolved arsenic and reveal the quantitative relationship between the concentration of dissolved arsenic and distance. The combination of the three types of expectation and standard deviation calculations and the concentration function may comprehensively describe the distribution and accumulation characteristics of dissolved arsenic, which can provide a theoretical foundation for guiding the reduction of arsenic pollution in the Pu River.  aPublisher supplied data  a31570706cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aLSNYB201609cScience and Technology Project of Liaoning Provincial Department of Education 3aarsenic 3apollution control 3arivers 3astandard deviation 3awater pollution 3aChina1 aZhang, Haozhen1 aLi, Liangliang1 aZhang, Kan1 aWang, Tieliang0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2019 Jan., v. 102, no. 1 p.84-91dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46145x0007-48617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-018-2503-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005300142245007400195300002000269520155600289592002801845650001301873650001201886650001101898650002201909650000901931650001701940650001301957700001501970700005801985700002602043700002202069700001702091700002502108700005202133700001602185700005602201700005302257700005202310700001602362700005202378773014902430856007602579852000902655655001202664IND60701227220221117011223.0200708e20200608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070122722DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c049192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Tong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4468-676710aLead-Free Cs₄CuSb₂Cl₁₂ Layered Double Perovskite Nanocrystals  ap. 11927-11936.  aConcerns about the toxicity of lead-based perovskites have aroused great interest for the development of alternative lead-free perovskite-type materials. Recently, theoretical calculations predict that Pb²⁺ cations can be substituted by a combination of Cu²⁺ and Sb³⁺ cations to form a vacancy-ordered layered double perovskite structure with superior optoelectronic properties. However, accessibilities to this class of perovskite-type materials remain inadequate, hindering their practical implementations in various applications. Here, we report the first colloidal synthesis of Cs₄CuSb₂Cl₁₂ perovskite-type nanocrystals (NCs). The resulting NCs exhibit a layered double perovskite structure with ordered vacancies and a direct band gap of 1.79 eV. A composition–structure–property relationship has been established by investigating a series of Cs₄CuₓAg₂–₂ₓSb₂Cl₁₂ perovskite-type NCs (0 ≤ x ≤ 1). The composition induced crystal structure transformation, and thus, the electronic band gap evolution has been explored by experimental observations and further confirmed by theoretical calculations. Taking advantage of both the unique electronic structure and solution processability, we demonstrate that the Cs₄CuSb₂Cl₁₂ NCs can be solution-processed as high-speed photodetectors with ultrafast photoresponse and narrow bandwidth. We anticipate that our study will prompt future research to design and fabricate novel and high-performance lead-free perovskite-type NCs for a range of applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimony 3acations 3acopper 3acrystal structure 3alead 3ananocrystals 3atoxicity1 aShi, Wenwu1 aHwang, Sooyeon1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5606-67281 aKobbekaduwa, Kanishka1 aNagaoka, Yasutaka1 aYang, Hanjun1 aHills-Kimball, Katie1 aZhu, Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2733-78371 aWang, Junyu1 aWang, Zhiguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5652-53621 aLiu, Yuzi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8733-16831 aSu, Dong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1921-66831 aGao, Jianbo1 aChen, Ou1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0551-090X0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 June 08, v. 142, no. 27 p.11927-11936dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c049193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245008500163300001800248500001900266520097700285592002801262650002501290650002101315650001801336650001201354650001301366650002001379650000901399650001201408650001501420650001301435653001901448653002301467653002601490653002101516653002701537700002201564700002201586773018401608856007501792852000901867655001201876IND60691893120221123025341.0200502e20010101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069189312DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.65.15492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, Hideyuki,10aPurification and Characterization of Aminopeptidase B from Escherichia coli K-12  ap. 1549-1558.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAminopeptidase B, which is one of the four cysteinyl-glycinases of Escherichia coli K-12, was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity and its enzymatic characteristics were observed. Aminopeptidase B was activated by various divalent cations such as Ni²⁺, Mn²⁺, Co²⁺, and Cd²⁺, and lost its activity completely on dialysis against EDTA. This indicates that aminopeptidase B is a metallopeptidase. It was stabilized against heat in the presence of Mn²⁺ or Co²⁺. The activity of aminopeptidase B, which was saturated with one of above divalent cations, was enhanced on the addition of a very small amount of a second divalent cation. α-Glutamyl p-nitroanilide, leucine p-nitroanilide, and methionine p-nitroanilide were good substrates for aminopeptidase B, while native peptides, cysteinylglycine and leucylglycine, were far better substrates. The kcₐₜ/Kₘ for cysteinylglycine was much bigger than those for leucylglycine or leucine p-nitroanilide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli K12 3aaminopeptidase B 3abiotechnology 3acations 3adialysis 3aelectrophoresis 3aheat 3aleucine 3amethionine 3apeptides 0aaminopeptidase 0acysteinylglycinase 0aEscherichia coli K-12 0ametallopeptidase 0aglutathione metabolism1 aKAMATANI, Sachiko1 aKUMAGAI, Hidehiko0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2001 Jan. 1, v. 65, no. 7 p.1549-1558dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.65.15493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01257naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013000168300001100298500002200309520013600331592002800467650001300495650001000508650000900518650002400527700001500551700001800566700001600584700002100600700003800621700001700659700002100676773010700697856008200804852000900886655001200895IND60631663720221119055505.0190404e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063166372DNAL7 a10.1007/s00335-018-9789-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShorter, John R.10aCorrection to: Quantitative trait mapping in Diversity Outbred mice identifies two genomic regions associated with heart size  ap. 42.  aPublished Erratum  aThe original article has been published with an incorrect text in Materials and Methods section.

Nevertheless, MIBs exhibit a very limited performance because of sluggish solid-state Mg²⁺ ion diffusion and high polarizability, which hinder their progress toward commercialization. Herein, we report a Mg²⁺/Li⁺ hybrid-ion battery (MLIB) with NaV₃O₈·1.69H₂O (NVO) nanobelts synthesized at room temperature working as the positive electrode. In the hybrid-ion system, Li⁺ intercalates/deintercalates along with a small amount of Mg²⁺ adsorption at the NVO cathode, whereas the anode side of the cell is dominated by Mg²⁺ deposition/dissolution. As a result, the MLIB exhibits a much higher rate capability (i.e., 446 mA h g–¹ at 20 mA g–¹) than the previously reported MLIBs. MLIB maintains a high specific capacity of 200 mA h g–¹ at 80 mA g–¹ for 150 cycles, showing excellent stability. Moreover, the effect of different Li-ion concentrations (i.e., 0.5–2.0 M) in the electrolyte and cutoff voltage (ranging from 2 to 2.6 V) on the specific capacities are investigated. The current study highlights a strategy to exploit the Mg²⁺/Li⁺ hybrid electrolyte system with various electrode materials for high-performance MIBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3aanodes 3abatteries 3acathodes 3aelectric power 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy density 3alithium 3amagnesium 0aNaV3O8·1.69H2O nanobelts 0amicrostructural characterization 0amagnesium−lithium hybrid-ion battery 0aelectrochemical properties 0aenergy storage1 aLi, Xianfeng1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8541-57791 aZhang, Huamin0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 June 04, v. 10, no. 25 p.21313-21320dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b041393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03690naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245010700208300001400315506007600329520166800405592002802073596005202101596005202153596005002205506003702255650001802292650002302310650001102333650001302344650001502357650001202372650001402384650001202398650001602410650001002426650002302436650001202459650001102471650001202482650000902494650003002503650001402533650001002547650004302557650001702600650002002617650001402637650001202651650000902663650002202672650001702694700002802711700001802739700001802757700002202775700002102797773010702818856008202925852000903007655001203016IND60631663820221207051047.0190404e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063166382DNAL7 a10.1007/s00335-018-9790-32doi7 aPMC63977142pmcid7 a305919712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimizu, Yukiko12aA deletion in the Ctns gene causes renal tubular dysfunction and cystine accumulation in LEA/Tohm rats  ap. 23-33.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Long-Evans Agouti (LEA/Tohm) rat has recently been established as a new rat model of type 2 diabetes. The onset of diabetes mellitus was observed only in male LEA/Tohm rats; however, urinary glucose appeared before the onset of diabetes. To clarify the genetic basis of urinary glucose, we performed genetic linkage analysis using (BN × LEA) F₂ intercross progeny. A recessively acting locus responsible for urinary glucose excretion (ugl) was mapped to a 7.9 Mb region of chromosome 10, which contains the cystinosin (Ctns) gene. The Ctns gene encodes the cystine transporter, which transports cystine out of the lysosome and is responsible for nephropathic cystinosis in humans. Sequence analysis identified a 13-bp deletion in the Ctns gene, leading to a truncated and loss-of-function protein, which cause cystine accumulation in various tissues. We also developed a novel congenic rat strain harboring the Ctnsᵘᵍˡ mutation on the F344 genetic background. Phenotypic analysis of F344-Ctnsᵘᵍˡ rats indicated that the incidence of urinary glucose was 100% in both males and females at around 40 weeks of age, and marked cystine accumulation was observed in the tissues, as well as remarkable renal lesions and cystine crystals in the lysosomes of the renal cortex. Furthermore, treatment with cysteamine depleted the cystine contents in F344-Ctnsᵘᵍˡ rat embryonic fibroblasts. These results indicated that the F344-Ctnsᵘᵍˡ rat provides a novel rat model of cystinosis, which allows not only a better understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of cystinosis but will also contribute to the development of new therapies.  aPublisher supplied data  a27-6001cMinistry of Health, Labour and Welfare  a29-2004cMinistry of Health, Labour and Welfare  a17K07149cJapan Science and Technology Agency0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3achromosome mapping 3acortex 3acrystals 3acysteamine 3acystine 3aexcretion 3afemales 3afibroblasts 3agenes 3agenetic background 3aglucose 3ahumans 3akidneys 3aloci 3aloss-of-function mutation 3alysosomes 3amales 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apathogenesis 3apathophysiology 3aphenotype 3aprogeny 3arats 3asequence analysis 3atransporters1 aYanobu-Takanashi, Rieko1 aNakano, Kenta1 aHamase, Kenji1 aShimizu, Toshiaki1 aOkamura, Tadashi0 tMammalian genome.g2019 Feb., v. 30, no. 1-2 p.23-33dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870068x0938-89907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00335-018-9790-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245006100177300001400238520144600252592002801698650001401726650002501740650001001765650001601775650001101791650002701802650001901829650001501848650001401863650001801877653000701895653000701902653001201909653000901921653000901930653001401939653000801953653001901961653001901980653002101999653002302020700002502043700002202068700001802090700002302108700001902131773009202150856008502242852000902327655001202336IND60552115620221122201053.0161020e20150710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055211562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.02.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoffmann, Oliver Ingo10aImpact of the spheroid model complexity on drug response  ap. 14-23.  aPharmaceutical investigators are searching for preclinical models closely resembling the original cancer and predicting clinical outcome. This study compares drug response of three in vitro 3D-drug screening models with different complexity.Tumor cell line spheroids were generated from the cell lines Caco-2, DLD-1, COLO 205, HT-29 and HCT-116, and treated with clinically relevant combination therapies, namely 5-FU/oxaliplatin (FO), 5-FU/irinotecan (FI) and the molecular drugs Cetuximab, Trastuzumab, Vorinostat and Everolimus. Treatment results were compared with spheroids originated from tumor cell lines (Caco-2, DLD-1) co-cultured with stromal cells (PBMCs, cancer-associated fibroblasts of colorectal origin) and spheroids directly prepared from colon cancer tissues.Different microenvironment compositions altered the tumor cell line spheroid response patterns. Adding PBMCs increased resistance to FO treatment by 10–15% in Caco-2 and DLD-1 spheroids but decreased resistance to FI by 16% in DLD-1 spheroids. Fibroblast co-cultures decreased resistance to FI in Caco-2 spheroids by 38% but had no impact on FO. Treatment of colon cancer tissue spheroids revealed three distinct response pattern subgroups not detectable in 3D cell lines models.The cancer tissue spheroid model mimics both tumor characteristics and the stromal microenvironment and therefore is an invaluable screening model for pharmaceutical drug development.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoculture 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adrugs 3afibroblasts 3amodels 3amononuclear leukocytes 3aneoplasm cells 3aprediction 3ascreening 3astromal cells 0aFO 0aFI 0aFOC/FIC 0aTILs 0aTAMs 0aTAFs/CAFs 0aCRC 0aSpheroid model 0aDrug screening 0aCancer cell line 0aHuman tumor tissue1 aIlmberger, Christian1 aMagosch, Stefanie1 aJoka, Mareile1 aJauch, Karl-Walter1 aMayer, Barbara0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2015 July 10, v. 205 p.14-23dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.02.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03829naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245010200165300002000267520228900287592002802576650002502604650003002629650001602659650002802675650001802703650001202721650001502733650001202748650001302760650003202773650003302805650001102838650001302849650001602862653002002878653002502898653001702923653002402940653002702964700001902991700001803010700001903028700005903047773014203106856007803248852000903326655001203335IND60598284920221116170717.0180629e20180604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059828492DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b041572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCronin, Harry M.10aPhotonic Curing of Low-Cost Aqueous Silver Flake Inks for Printed Conductors with Increased Yield  ap. 21398-21410.  aPrinting of highly conductive tracks at low cost is of primary importance for the emerging field of flexible, plastic, and large-area electronics. Commonly, this is achieved by printing of metallic conductive inks, often based on Ag or Cu nanoparticles dispersed in organic solvents. The solvents, which must be safely removed, have particular storage and handling requirements, thus increasing the process costs. By using water-based inks containing micron-sized silver flakes, both material and process costs can be reduced, making these inks attractive for industrial applications. However, the sintering of flake inks requires higher temperatures than nano-sized inks owing to the particles’ smaller surface area-to-volume ratio, meaning that when cured thermally the conductivity of many flake inks is lower than nanoparticle alternatives. This problem can be addressed by the application of visible light photonic curing; however, the substrate must be protected and so process parameters must be defined for each material/substrate combination. Here, we report results of a large-scale trial of photonic curing of aqueous flake silver inks on poly(ethylene terephthalate) substrates in an industrial setting. The resistivity of printed patterns after an optimized photocuring regime matched those reported for typical nanoparticle inks; on the order of 100 μΩ cm depending on substrate and geometry. Scanning electron microscopy revealed evidence for structural changes within the printed films consistent with localized melting and necking between adjacent particles, leading to an improved percolation network. Furthermore, in the large-scale industrial trial employing screen-printed silver lines, the manufacturing yield of conductive lines was increased from 44% untreated to 80% after photocuring and reached 100% when photocuring was combined with thermal curing. We believe this to be the first reported observation of an increase in the yield of printed electronic structures following photocuring. We propose a crack-healing mechanism to explain these increases in yield and conductivity. We further report on the effects of the photonic curing on the mechanical bending stability of the printed conductors and discuss their suitability for wearable applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper nanoparticles 3acuring (nonfood products) 3aelectronics 3aindustrial applications 3amanufacturing 3amelting 3ananosilver 3aphotons 3aplastics 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilver 3asolvents 3atemperature 0aphotonic curing 0aintense pulsed light 0aaqueous inks 0aprinted electronics 0asilver conductive inks1 aStoeva, Zlatka1 aBrown, Martin1 aShkunov, Maxim1 aSilva, S.

Nevertheless, it has also been identified as a component of scar-forming stromal cells after spinal cord injury (SCI). In process of enlargement of spinal cavity after SCI, the number of pericytes increased and outnumbered astrocytes. However, the mechanism of proliferation of pericytes remains unclear. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) has been reported to play important roles in the formation of glia scar, but previous studies had paid more attention to the astrocytes. The present study aimed to observe the effects of S1P and S1P receptors (S1PRs) on proliferation of pericytes and investigate the underlying mechanism. By double immunostaining, we found that the number of PDGFRβ-positive pericytes was gradually increased and sealed the cavity, which surrounded by reactive astrocytes. Moreover, the subtype of S1PR3 was found to be induced by SCI and mainly expressed on pericytes. Further, by use of CAY10444, an inhibitor of S1PR3, we showed that S1P/S1PR3 mediated the proliferation of pericytes through Ras/pERK pathway. Moreover, CAY10444 was found to have the effects of enhancing neuronal survival, alleviating glial scar formation, and improving locomotion recovery after SCI. The results suggested that S1P/S1PR3 might be a promising target for clinical therapy for SCI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal injuries 3aastrocytes 3ablood-brain barrier 3alocomotion 3aneurons 3areceptors 3aspinal cord 3astromal cells 3atherapeutics 0aSpinal cord injury 0aS1P 0aS1PR3 0aProliferation 0aPericytes1 aJiang, Xiao-Jian1 aWang, Chen1 aLiu, Shi-Chang0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Apr. 15, v. 498, no. 4 p.830-836dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.03.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003100152245011800183300001600301520133200317592002801649650002301677650002501700650000801725650001801733650002601751650002001777650001201797650002901809650001401838650001701852650002101869650000901890650001201899650000901911650001301920650001301933650001201946650001601958651001301974653002001987653001502007653001602022653001802038653001302056773010402069856008702173852000902260655001202269IND60608114120221120210820.0180904e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060811412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez-Chardi, Alejandro10aBiomonitoring potential of five sympatric Tillandsia species for evaluating urban metal pollution (Cd, Hg and Pb)  ap. 352-359.  aThe present study quantifies non essential heavy metals highly toxic for biological systems (Pb, Hg and Cd) in five autochthonous epiphytic plants from Tillandsia genus (T. recurvata, T. meridionalis, T. duratii, T. tricholepis, T. loliacea) according to different traffic levels (reference, low, medium and high polluted sites) in Asunción (Paraguay). The three metals increased in polluted sites following Pb (till 62.99 ppm in T. tricholepis) > Cd (till 1.35 ppm in T. recurvata) > Hg (till 0.36 ppm in T. recurvata) and Pb and Cd levels were directly related to traffic flow. Although the species showed similar bioaccumulation pattern (namely, higher levels of metals in polluted sites), enrichment factors (maximum EF values 37.00, 18.16, and 11.90 for Pb, Hg, and Cd, respectively) reported T. tricholepis as the most relevant bioindicator due to its wide distribution and abundance in study sites, low metal content in control site and high metal contents in polluted sites, and significant correlations with traffic density of Pb and Cd. This study emphasizes the necessity of biomonitoring air pollution in areas out of air monitoring control such as Asunción, where the high levels of metal pollution especially Pb, may represent an increment of risk for the human population inhabiting this urban area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTillandsia duratii 3aTillandsia recurvata 3aair 3aair pollution 3aatmospheric chemistry 3abioaccumulation 3acadmium 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aepiphytes 3aheavy metals 3ahuman population 3alead 3amercury 3arisk 3asympatry 3atoxicity 3atraffic 3aurban areas 3aParaguay 0aUrban pollution 0aTillandsia 0aHeavy metal 0aBiomonitoring 0aParaguay0 tAtmospheric environment.g2016 Apr., v. 131 p.352-359dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02564naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245012500162300001800287500001900305520111000324592002801434650002601462650002301488650001301511650001401524650001801538650001801556650001501574650001101589650001001600650001301610650001101623650001201634650001701646650001201663650001301675653001401688653002001702653002401722653002001746653002401766700002401790773018401814856007501998852000902073655001202082IND60691893520221123025414.0200502e20010101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069189352DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.65.15752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSUGIMOTO, Manabu10aMolecular Cloning, Sequencing, and Expression of cDNA Encoding Serine Protease with Fibrinolytic Activity from Earthworm  ap. 1575-1580.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAn earthworm, Lumbricus rubellus, produces alkaline trypsin-like proteases that are greater than trypsins in their stability and strong tolerance to organic solvents. cDNAs encoding strong fibrinolytic proteases (F-III-2 and F-III-1) in the six isozymes were cloned and sequenced to study their stability-structure relationship.

The deduced amino acid sequences of F-III-2 and F-III-1 have 7 and 8 activation peptides in the N-termini respectively, indicating that they are translated as proenzymes and modified to active forms by post-translational processing. They showed similarity to mammalian serine proteases and conserved the catalytic amino acid residues, however, neither arginine nor lysine residues were present in the autolysis region. The gene encoding the native form of F-III-2 was expressed in Pichia pastoris to produce and secrete the earthworm protease in the culture medium, which dissolves an artificial fibrin plate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKomagataella pastoris 3aLumbricus rubellus 3aarginine 3aautolysis 3abiotechnology 3aculture media 3aearthworms 3afibrin 3agenes 3aisozymes 3alysine 3amammals 3apolypeptides 3atrypsin 3azymogens 0aearthworm 0aserine protease 0afibrinolytic enzyme 0agene expression 0anucleotide sequence1 aNAKAJIMA, Nobuyoshi0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2001 Jan. 1, v. 65, no. 7 p.1575-1580dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.65.15753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04447naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010100166300001500267520255800282592002802840650001402868650001302882650000902895650001502904650002002919650001402939650002102953650001002974650002102984650001503005650001503020650001603035650001303051650001803064650001303082650001803095650001303113650002103126650001103147650001103158650001203169650001803181650001403199650001003213650001103223651001103234653001303245653001603258653002003274653001203294653001103306653001703317700002203334700002003356700003303376700002503409700003003434700002003464700002703484700002203511773012403533856008303657852000903740655001203749IND60532391420221120051837.0190318e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053239142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2013.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSordi, André10aNitrous oxide emission factors for urine and dung patches in a subtropical Brazilian pastureland  ap. 94-103.  aCattle urine and dung (faeces) patches are nitrous oxide (N2O) sources in pasturelands with impacts in the global N2O budget, but specific information about those emissions are still missing for Brazilian subtropical and tropical regions. We conducted a sequence of 3 field-trials (summer, winter and spring, 90 days each) to evaluate the N2O emission and emission factor (EF) after the deposition of 3 volumes of cattle urine or 3 weights of dung (½, 1 and 1½ time the mean urination volume or defecation weight of Friesian cows) on a free-drained Cambisol of a subtropical pastureland of Brazil. The N2O emission peaks (3198μgN2O-Nm−2h−1 after urine in summer was the highest) occurred on average 17±9 days after application (DAA), both for urine and dung, and dropped to the background levels 41±10 DAA of urine and 49±10 DAA of dung. The highest contents of NH4+-N in soil (200–250mgNkg−1) occurred one day after urine application and 10–14 days later for dung (100–200mgNkg−1). Nitrate peaks occurred from 23 to 26 DAA in urine patches (∼40–50mgNkg−1) and 19–50 DAA in dung patches (∼40–50mgNkg−1). The N2O emission peaks for urine coincided with soil NH4+-N peak in winter but with soil NO3−-N peak in spring. For dung, the emission peak seemed to be more associated with soil NO3−-N than to NH4+-N, either in winter or spring (inorganic-N was not assessed in summer). It was not possible to conclude whether nitrification or denitrification was the dominant process in N2O production, but it seemed that both played relevant roles. The EF for urine, averaged across the seasons, diminished with increments in urine volume, from 0.33% in ½ volume to 0.19% in 1½ volume, possibly because urine percolated deeper into the soil and proportionally less N remained available for N2O production in the top layer. The EF for dung was 0.19%, 0.12% and 0.14% for ½, 1 and 1½ weight, respectively, showing no clear trend with increment in dung weight. The lowest EFs for urine and dung occurred in winter, possibly because of lowest temperatures and soil water-filled pore space. The average EF for dung (0.15%) was lower than that of urine (0.26%), because urea-N of urine is more readily available for the hydrolysis than organic N forms of dung. This result suggests that these two excreta should be addressed separately in national greenhouse gases inventories or communications. Our results suggest that the default 2% EF proposed in IPCC Guidelines for cattle excreta are overestimated for subtropical Brazil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCambisols 3aHolstein 3acows 3adefecation 3adenitrification 3aemissions 3aemissions factor 3afeces 3agreenhouse gases 3aguidelines 3ahydrolysis 3ainventories 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3apastures 3asoil temperature 3aspring 3asummer 3atropics 3aurea nitrogen 3aurination 3aurine 3awinter 3aBrazil 0aAmmonium 0aDung weight 0aEmission factor 0aNitrate 0aSeason 0aUrine volume1 aDieckow, Jeferson1 aBayer, Cimélio1 aAlburquerque, Márcio Amaral1 aPiva, Jonatas Thiago1 aZanatta, Josiléia Acordi1 aTomazi, Michely1 ada Rosa, Carla Machado1 ade Moraes, Anibal0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2014 June 01, v. 190 p.94-103dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2013.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245014900160300002000309520148400329592002801813650002301841650001901864650002101883650001501904650001701919650000901936650001301945700001901958700002001977700002501997700006002022700005902082700005702141773014902198856007602347852000902423655001202432IND60701227620221117010701.0200708e20200617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070122762DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c051622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Bao-Ying10aProbing Electric Field Distributions in the Double Layer of a Single-Crystal Electrode with Angstrom Spatial Resolution using Raman Spectroscopy  ap. 11698-11702.  aThe electrical double layer (EDL) is the extremely important interfacial region involved in many electrochemical reactions, and it is the subject of significant study in electrochemistry and surface science. However, the direct measurement of interfacial electric fields in the EDL is challenging. In this work, both electrochemical resonant Raman spectroscopy and theoretical calculations were used to study electric field distributions in the EDL of an atomically flat single-crystal Au(111) electrode with self-assembled monolayer molecular films. This was achieved using a series of redox-active molecules containing the 4,4′-bipyridinium moiety as a Raman marker that were located at different precisely controlled distances away from the electrode surface. It was found that the electric field and the dipole moment of the probe molecule both directly affected its Raman signal intensity, which in turn could be used to map the electric field distribution at the interface. Also, by variation of the electrolyte anion concentration, the Raman intensity was found to decrease when the electric field strength increased. Moreover, the distance between adjacent Raman markers was ∼2.1 Å. Thus, angstrom-level spatial resolution in the mapping of electric field distributions at the electrode–electrolyte interface was realized. These results directly evidence the EDL structure, bridging the gap between the theoretical and experimental understandings of the interface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aelectric field 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3agold 3amoieties1 aLin, Jia-Sheng1 aZhang, Yue-Jiao1 aRadjenovic, Petar M.1 aZhang, Xia-Guang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9223-08521 aTian, Zhong-Qun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9775-81891 aLi, Jian-Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1598-68560 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 June 17, v. 142, no. 27 p.11698-11702dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c051623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03137naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245012400166300001600290520133000306592002801636650001501664650001801679650002101697650002301718650003601741650001301777650001701790650001501807650002401822650002301846653000801869653000701877653000801884653000801892653000801900653000701908653000801915653001001923653000801933653000901941653001101950653000901961653001301970653001001983653000801993653000802001653002002009653001902029653002202048653002602070653002302096700001702119700001802136700001702154700001302171700001302184700001802197700001802215700001502233773010802248856008602356852000902442655001202451IND60553015320221119143221.0170607e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055301532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.01.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Hao10aCatalytic performance and molecular dynamic simulation of immobilized CC bond hydrolase based on carbon nanotube matrix  ap. 365-371.  aCarbon nanotube (CNT) has been proved to be a kind of novel support for enzyme immobilization. In this study, we tried to find the relationship between conformation and catalytic performance of immobilized enzyme. Two CC bond hydrolases BphD and MfphA were immobilized on CNTs (SWCNT and MWCNT) via physical adsorption and covalent attachment. Among the conjugates, the immobilized BphD on chemically functionalized SWCNT (BphD-CSWCNT) retained the highest catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km value) compared to free BphD (92.9%). On the other hand, when MfphA bound to pristine SWCNT (MfphA-SWCNT), it was completely inactive. Time-resolved fluorescence spectrum indicated the formation of static ground complexes during the immobilization processes. Circular dichroism (CD) showed that the secondary structures of immobilized enzymes changed in varying degrees. In order to investigate the inhibition mechanism of MfphA by SWCNT, molecular dynamics simulation was employed to analyze the adsorption process, binding sites and time evolution of substrate tunnels. The results showed that the preferred binding sites (Trp201 and Met81) of MfphA for SWCNT blocked the main substrate access tunnel, thus making the enzyme inactive.

Merr.], especially in western USA growing areas that are newly infested. The objective of this study was to find cultural practices that reduce cyst nematode effect on soybean in this region. Four management systems, one having continuous susceptible soybean, a second consisting of a 3-yr rotation with 2 yr of a nonhost crop followed by susceptible soybean, and two 4-yr rotations alternating a susceptible and resistant cultivar with non-host crops, were investigated at nematode-infested and noninfested locations. One 4-yr rotation had full-season soybean while the other had double-crop soybean. Data included soybean seed yield, yield components, and cyst nematode egg density. Grain yields of full-season, SCN-susceptible ‘Stafford’ were similar in all rotations at each location. Nonhost crops reduced nematode densities from 4000 eggs 100 cm⁻³ in continuously cropped SCN-susceptible plots to 1000 and 500 eggs 100 cm⁻³ in 3- and 4-yr rotations, respectively. However, nematode numbers rapidly increased to more than 5000 eggs 100 cm⁻³ by seasons end when susceptible soybean was grown. The SCN-susceptible cultivar produced 33% less grain and pods than did the SCN-resistant cultivar, Manokin, at the infested location while the cultivars yielded similarly at the noninfested site. Full-season and double-cropped soybean reacted similarly to SCN. Crop rotation reduced cyst nematode numbers, but this benefit did not reduce yield losses on subsequent SCN-susceptible soybean as numbers rapidly climbed to damaging levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aHeterodera glycines 3acontinuous cropping 3acrop rotation 3acrops 3acultivars 3acyst nematodes 3adouble cropping 3aeggs 3agrain yield 3amanagement systems 3apods 3aseed yield 3asoybeans 3ayield components 3aWestern United States1 aTodd, T.

We measured net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and its major components, gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco) using an eddy covariance flux technique in a natural coastal wetland (reed) and an adjacent, newly reclaimed farmland (cotton) in the Yellow River Delta, China. The results showed that agricultural reclamation changed the ecosystem CO2 exchange of the coastal wetland at three distinct levels. Initially, the conversion from the wetland to farmland changed the light response parameters (α, Amax, and Reco, day) of NEE and temperature sensitivity (Q10) of Reco mainly by changing the dominant vegetation type. Over the growing season, NEE, Reco and GPP were significantly correlated with LAI at both sites and aboveground biomass at the farmland site. Next, the reclamation of wetland modified the diurnal and seasonal dynamics of ecosystem CO2 exchange. Significant differences in diurnal variations of NEE between the wetland and farmland sites were found during the growing season (with the exception of June and July). Seasonal means of daily GPP and Reco values at the wetland site were higher than those at the farmland. Ultimately, the agricultural reclamation altered the CO2 sequestration capacity of the coastal wetland. The cumulative NEE in the wetland (−237.4gCm−2) was higher than that in the farmland (−202.0gCm−2). When biomass removal was taken into account, the farmland was a strong source for CO2 of around 131.9gCm−2 during the growing season. Overall, land use changes by reclamation altered ecosystem CO2 exchange at several ecological scales by changing the dominant vegetation type and altering the ecosystem's natural development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3aagricultural land 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3acotton 3adiurnal variation 3aecosystem respiration 3aecosystems 3aeddy covariance 3agrowing season 3aland use change 3aleaf area index 3anet ecosystem exchange 3aprimary productivity 3ariver deltas 3atemperature 3avegetation types 3awetlands 3aChina 3aYellow River 0aEddy covariance 0aEcosystem CO2 exchange 0aCoastal wetlands 0aAgricultural reclamation 0aYellow River Delta1 aXing, Qinghui1 aYu, Junbao1 aLuo, Yiqi1 aLi, Dejun1 aYang, Liqiong1 aWang, Guangmei1 aMao, Peili1 aXie, Baohua1 aMikle, Nate0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2014 Oct. 15, v. 196 p.187-198dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2013.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03392naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006100142245013400203300002000337520147900357592002801836650001501864650003401879650001501913650001701928650000901945650002701954650001501981650002101996650003002017650002302047650001602070700005802086700006402144700005902208700006302267700005902330700005802389700005902447700006102506700005902567700006302626773014802689856007602837852000902913655001202922IND60701227820200904000000.0200708e20200514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070122782DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b118352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAspermair, Patrik1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1671-132810aDual Monitoring of Surface Reactions in Real Time by Combined Surface-Plasmon Resonance and Field-Effect Transistor Interrogation  ap. 11709-11716.  aBy combining surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and electrolyte gated field-effect transistor (EG-FET) methods in a single analytical device we introduce a novel tool for surface investigations, enabling simultaneous measurements of the surface mass and charge density changes in real time. This is realized using a gold sensor surface that simultaneously serves as a gate electrode of the EG-FET and as the SPR active interface. This novel platform has the potential to provide new insights into (bio)adsorption processes on planar solid surfaces by directly relating complementary measurement principles based on (i) detuning of SPR as a result of the modification of the interfacial refractive index profile by surface adsorption processes and (ii) change of output current as a result of the emanating effective gate voltage modulations. Furthermore, combination of the two complementary sensing concepts allows for the comparison and respective validation of both analytical techniques. A theoretical model is derived describing the mass uptake and evolution of surface charge density during polyelectrolyte multilayer formation. We demonstrate the potential of this combined platform through the observation of layer-by-layer assembly of PDADMAC and PSS. These simultaneous label-free and real-time measurements allow new insights into complex processes at the solid–liquid interface (like non-Fickian ion diffusion), which are beyond the scope of each individual tool.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3agold 3aliquid-solid interface 3amonitoring 3arefractive index 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atheoretical models 3atransistors1 aRamach, Ulrich1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1111-29941 aReiner-Rozman, Ciril1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6476-24131 aFossati, Stefan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1109-00351 aLechner, Bernadette1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4949-51181 aMoya, Sergio E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7174-19601 aAzzaroni, Omar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5098-06121 aDostalek, Jakub1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0431-21701 aSzunerits, Sabine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1567-49431 aKnoll, Wolfgang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1543-40901 aBintinger, Johannes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6397-42540 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 May 14, v. 142, no. 27 p.11709-11716dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b118353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006400152245007700216300001600293520096600309592002801275650001301303650001301316650002601329650000901355650001701364650001301381650001001394650001001404650002001414650001301434650001201447651002501459653000901484653001401493653000901507653001201516653001201528653000801540700002001548700002201568700001901590700002001609700002001629700002601649773010401675856008701779852000901866655001201875IND60608114620221120210935.0180904e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060811462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.02.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmato, F.q(Fulvio),1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1546-915410aEffects of water and CMA in mitigating industrial road dust resuspension  ap. 334-340.  aWater spraying and/or chemical suppressants such as salts and polymers have been suggested to reduce road dust resuspension due to their capability to increase adhesion, and therefore the effective size and weight of particles, but contrasting results have been obtained so further testing are needed.

Long-term warming is observed in Canada’s annual, winter and summer mean temperatures, and in the annual coldest and hottest daytime and nighttime temperatures. The causes of these changes are assessed by comparing observed changes with climate model simulated responses to anthropogenic and natural (solar and volcanic) external forcings. Most of the observed warming of 1.7 °C increase in annual mean temperature during 1948–2012 [90% confidence interval (1.1°, 2.2 °C)] can only be explained by external forcing on the climate system, with anthropogenic influence being the dominant factor. It is estimated that anthropogenic forcing has contributed 1.0 °C (0.6°, 1.5 °C) and natural external forcing has contributed 0.2 °C (0.1°, 0.3 °C) to the observed warming. Up to 0.5 °C of the observed warming trend may be associated with low frequency variability of the climate such as that represented by the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and North Atlantic oscillation (NAO). Overall, the influence of both anthropogenic and natural external forcing is clearly evident in Canada-wide mean and extreme temperatures, and can also be detected regionally over much of the country.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNorth Atlantic Oscillation 3aair temperature 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3aconfidence interval 3ahumans 3anight temperature 3asummer 3awinter 3aCanada1 aZhang, Xuebin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6551-62491 aZwiers, Francis0 tClimate dynamics.g2019 Jan., v. 52, no. 1-2 p.479-494dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4145-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002800141245014000169300001400309500002000323520166100343592002802004596004802032650001602080650001402096650001602110650001402126650002202140650001602162650002302178650001002201650002502211651001102236700004102247700003602288700003502324773013102359856007602490852000902566655001202575IND60786385020221118204859.0220803e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078638502DNAL7 a10.3732/ajb.16003052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCortés‐Flores, Jorge10aFlowering phenology, growth forms, and pollination syndromes in tropical dry forest species: Influence of phylogeny and abiotic factors  ap. 39-49.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPREMISE OF THE STUDY: Analyses of the influence of temporal variation in abiotic factors on flowering phenology of tropical dry forest species have not considered the possible response of species with different growth forms and pollination syndromes, while controlling for phylogenetic relationships among species. Here, we investigated the relationship between flowering phenology, abiotic factors, and plant functional attributes, while controlling for phylogenetic relationship among species, in a dry forest community in Mexico. METHODS: We characterized flowering phenology (time and duration) and pollination syndromes of 55 tree species, 49 herbs, 24 shrubs, 15 lianas, and 11 vines. We tested the influence of pollination syndrome, growth form, and abiotic factors on flowering phenology using phylogenetic generalized least squares. KEY RESULTS: We found a relationship between flowering duration and time. Growth form was related to flowering time, and the pollination syndrome had a more significant relationship with flowering duration. Flowering time variation in the community was explained mainly by abiotic variables, without an important phylogenetic effect. Flowering time in lianas and trees was negatively and positively correlated with daylength, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Functional attributes, environmental cues, and phylogeny interact with each other to shape the diversity of flowering patterns. Phenological differentiation among species groups revealed multiples strategies associated with growth form and pollination syndromes that can be important for understanding species coexistence in this highly diverse plant community.  aPublisher supplied data  aIN207512cInnovación Tecnológica (PAPIIT) 3adry forests 3aphenology 3aphotoperiod 3aphylogeny 3aplant communities 3apollination 3atemporal variation 3atrees 3atropical dry forests 3aMexico1 aHernández‐Esquivel, Karen Beatriz1 aGonzález‐Rodríguez, Antonio1 aIbarra‐Manríquez, Guillermo0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2017 Jan., v. 104, no. 1 p.39-49dBotanical Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44651x0002-91227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.16003053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01584naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245010400164300001400268520033400282592002800616650002400644650002600668650001300694650001900707650001100726650002100737650002100758650001100779650002500790650001700815653002000832653001300852653001900865653001700884700001800901700001600919700001500935700001400950773009200964856008501056852000901141655001201150IND60552116320221116173431.0161020e20150420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055211632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.02.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yu10aComplete genome sequence of Bacillus sp.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the variables involved in this process to achieve higher quality. Within the rotifer culture, the following evaluations were carried out nine times (0, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168 hr); with two types of food TRA = 0 (Nannochloropsis oceanica) and TRA = 1 (N. oceanica + Isochrysis galbana); assessing three types of fatty acids (μg/g) eicosapentaenoic (EPA; 20:5n−3), docosahexaenoic (DHA; 22:6n−3), and arachidonic (ARA; 20:4ω−6); and biomass weight in grams from 7,000 individuals per sample. The results showed that the maximum biomass weight was 77.5 g at 96 hr with the mixed treatment. In both treatments, the EPA and DHA fatty acid content exhibited the exact same temporal pattern, while ARA fatty acid was recorded during the entirety of the mixed treatment. The relationship of biomass weight over time versus the fatty acids exhibited significant differences in the mixed treatment, where an increasing trend over time is observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIsochrysis galbana 3aNannochloropsis 3aRotifera 3aaquaculture 3abiomass 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3afatty acid composition1 aGaspar, Wilmer1 aInga, Gheraldine1 aFlores, Lennin1 aSanchez, Pedro1 aHernandez Acevedo, Hanna1 aBorda Soares, Roberta1 aOlivera Galvez, Alfredo0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2022 June, v. 53, no. 3 p.741-753dWiley Subscription Services, Inc.wJournal:jnl42330x0893-88497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jwas.128483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002400141245014400165300001800309500001900327520118600346592002801532650000801560650002201568650002101590650002701611650002601638650001801664650001501682650004001697650003301737650003901770650001501809650002101824653002301845653001701868653001701885653001401902653001601916700001701932700002301949700002201972700002101994700002302015700001702038700001602055773018402071856007502255852000902330655001202339IND60691894320221120024549.0200502e20010101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069189432DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.65.16272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamano, Yoshimitsu,10aCloning of a Gene Cluster Encoding Enzymes Responsible for the Mevalonate Pathway from a Terpenoid-antibiotic-producing Streptomyces Strain  ap. 1627-1635.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA gene cluster encoding enzymes responsible for the mevalonate pathway was isolated from Streptomyces griseolosporeus strain MF730-N6, a terpenoid-antibiotic terpentecin producer, by searching a flanking region of th 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase gene, which had been previously isolated by complementation. By DNA sequencing of an 8.9-kb BamHI fragment, 7 genes encoding geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGDPS), mevalonate kinase (MK), mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (MDPD), phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK), isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) isomerase, HMG-CoA reductase, and HMG-CoA synthase were suggested to exist in that order. Heterologous expression of these genes in E. coli and Streptomyces lividans, both of which have only the nonmevalonate pathways, suggested that the genes for the mevalonate pathway were included in the cloned DNA fragment. The GGDPS, MK, MDPD, PMK, IPP isomerase, and HMG-CoA synthase were expressed in E. coli. Among them, the recombinant GGDPS, MK, and IPP isomerase were confirmed to have the expected activities. This is the first report, to the best of our knowledge, about eubacterial MK with direct evidence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA fragmentation 3aEscherichia coli 3aKitasatospora griseola 3aStreptomyces lividans 3abiotechnology 3acoenzyme A 3ageranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase 3aheterologous gene expression 3ahydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase 3aisomerases 3amultigene family 0amevalonate pathway 0agene cloning 0aStreptomyces 0aterpenoid 0aterpentecin1 aDAIRI, Tohru1 aYAMAMOTO, Masahiro1 aKAWASAKI, Takashi1 aKANEDA, Kazuhide1 aKUZUYAMA, Tomohisa1 aITOH, Nobuya1 aSETO, Haruo0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2001 Jan. 1, v. 65, no. 7 p.1627-1635dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.65.16273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03308naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100001800193245012000211300001600331506007600347520138600423592002801809506003701837650001501874650001901889650001301908650001701921650001601938650002601954650001701980650002601997650001002023650000902033650001302042650001902055650002102074650001602095650002102111650001902132650001802151650001902169650001702188650003702205653002002242653002202262653002902284653001802313653002602331653002302357700001502380700001302395700001702408700001802425700002402443773010802467856008602575852000902661655001202670IND60553015720221207105913.0170607e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055301572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.01.0222doi7 aPMC39958712pmcid7 a245490472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yanjing10aLow-dose chemotherapy of hepatocellular carcinoma through triggered-release from bilayer-decorated magnetoliposomes  ap. 452-458.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLow-dose (LD) chemotherapy is a promising treatment strategy that may be improved by controlled delivery. Polyethylene glycol-stabilized bilayer-decorated magnetoliposomes (dMLs) have been designed as a stimuli-responsive LD chemotherapy drug delivery system and tested in vitro using Huh-7 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. The dMLs contained hydrophobic superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles within the lipid bilayer and doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX, 2μM) within the aqueous core. Structural analysis by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering showed that the assemblies were approximately 120nm in diameter. Furthermore, the samples consisted of a mixture of dMLs and bare liposomes (no nanoparticles), which provided dual burst and spontaneous DOX release profiles, respectively. Cell viability results show that the cytotoxicity of DOX-loaded dMLs was similar to that of bare dMLs (∼10%), which indicates that spontaneous DOX leakage had little cytotoxic effect. However, when subjected to a physiologically acceptable radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic field, cell viability was reduced up to 40% after 8h and significant cell death (>90%) was observed after 24h. The therapeutic mechanism was intracellular RF-triggered DOX release from the dMLs and not intracellular hyperthermia due to nanoparticle heating via magnetic losses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell death 3acell viability 3acolloids 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3adrug delivery systems 3adrug therapy 3aelectromagnetic field 3afever 3aheat 3ahepatoma 3ahydrophobicity 3ain vitro studies 3airon oxides 3alight scattering 3alipid bilayers 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3apolyethylene 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aMagnetoliposome 0aSPIO nanoparticle 0aHepatocellular carcinoma 0aDrug delivery 0aMagnetic nanoparticle 0aStimuli responsive1 aChen, Yuan1 aXiao, Da1 aBose, Arijit1 aDeng, Ruitang1 aBothun, Geoffrey D.0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2014 Apr. 01, v. 116 p.452-458dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.01.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
