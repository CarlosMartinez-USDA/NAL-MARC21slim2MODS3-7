However, little is known about the predictors of death in drug-resistant TB in Malaysia. This study aimed to determine the predictors of death in drug-resistant TB patients, including multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. This study adopted a retrospective cohort study design and involved laboratory-confirmed drug-resistant TB patients (n=426) from January 2009 to June 2013. A Cox regression model and Kaplan–Meier curves were used to model the outcome measure. Data were analysed by using SPSS v.20.0 for Windows. In this study, 15.3% (n=65) of the patients died. Among the study patients, 70.9% were monoresistant TB cases, 9.4% were poly-resistant TB and 19.7% were MDR-TB. MDR-TB [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR)=2.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26–3.95], ethnicity [Malay (aHR=5.95, 95% CI 2.30–15.41), Chinese (aHR=4.01, 95% CI 1.38–11.66) and Indian (aHR=3.76, 95% CI 1.19–11.85)], coronary heart disease (aHR=6.82, 95% CI 2.16–21.50), drug abuse (aHR=3.79, 95% CI 2.07–6.93) and treatment non-compliance (aHR=1.81, 95% CI 1.01–3.27) were independent predictors of poorer survival in the multivariate Cox regression analysis. This study suggests that MDR-TB, local ethnicity, coronary heart disease, history of drug abuse and treatment non-compliance are factors predicting poor survival in drug-resistant TB patients. More emphasis should be given to the management of drug-resistant TB patients with these characteristics to achieve better treatment outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSurvival 0aPredictors of death 0aDrug-resistant tuberculosis 0aMultidrug-resistant 0aMalaysia1 aShah, Shamsul Azhar1 aKamaludin, Fadzilah0 tJournal of Global Antimicrobial Resistance.g2016 Sept., v. 6 p.102-107dElsevier LtdaInternational Society for Chemotherapy of Infection and Cancerx2213-71657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgar.2016.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245014500175500001900320520129900339592002801638650002501666650001901691650002301710650001701733650001601750650002101766650001901787653000901806653002201815653003701837653002701874653002401901653003201925700002201957700001801979700002301997700001802020700002102038773012802059856008402187852000902271655001202280IND60714125820221120160205.0201104e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071412582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2020.1051032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPidlisnyuk, Valentina10aPotential role of plant growth-promoting bacteria in Miscanthus x giganteus phytotechnology applied to the trace elements contaminated soils  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe second-generation energy crop Miscanthus x giganteus (M. xgiganteus) is a perspective plant for phytoremediation of contaminated lands and the production of biomass. The excellent quality biomass can be ensured by adding soil amendments or inoculation of the plant by plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB). The main goal of the current study was to research the influence of PGPB Bacillus altitudinis strain KP-14 isolated from the post-mining aged contaminated soil in Všebořice dump, Ústí nad Labem to the phytoremediation parameters and biomass production of M. xgiganteus. The experiment was done in the greenhouse conditions using the initial aged soil contaminated by the following trace elements (TEs): V, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Pb and the same aged soil, additionally artificially contaminated by Pb. The results showed that PGPB treatment increased the growth process and leaves, stems, and roots biomass at harvest by 49%, 86%, and 76%, respectively. In the presence of B. altitudinis strain KP-14, the translocation factor decreased, the uptake index of TEs remained low and the process can be classified as phytostabilization. The finding showed that the application of PGPB strain could be used in the sustainable production of M. xgiganteus at the TEs contaminated soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus altitudinis 3abiodegradation 3abiomass production 3aenergy crops 3agreenhouses 3aphytoremediation 3apolluted soils 0aPGPB 0aTolerance profile 0aTrace elements contaminated soil 0aMiscanthus x giganteus 0aBiomass enhancement 0aPhytoremediation parameters1 aMamirova, Aigerim1 aPranaw, Kumar1 aShapoval, Pavlo Y.1 aTrögl, Josef1 aNurzhanova, Asil0 tInternational biodeterioration & biodegradation.g2020 Nov., v. 155 p.105103-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12418x0964-83057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2020.1051033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03074naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245016200170300001600332520191800348592002802266653002102294653000902315653001002324653001102334653001302345653001202358700002002370700002502390700002202415700002202437773018602459856008202645852000902727655001202736IND60566833720221119175742.0170412e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056683372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jgar.2016.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelmahdi, Mohamed10aMolecular characterisation of extended-spectrum β-lactamase- and plasmid AmpC-producing Escherichia coli strains isolated from broilers in Béjaïa, Algeria  ap. 108-112.  aThis study aimed to characterise the molecular support of antibiotic resistance in expanded-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC)-resistant Escherichia coli isolates recovered from healthy broilers in Béjaïa, northeast Algeria. A total of 61 intestinal swabs from slaughtered broilers from four regions in Béjaïa locality, Algeria, were collected between February and April 2014, from which 20 ESC-resistant E. coli strains were isolated. Escherichia coli isolates were identified by classical biochemical and MALDI-TOF methods. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using disk diffusion and Etest methods. Screening for β-lactamases, aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme (AME)-encoding genes and qnr determinants was performed by PCR and sequencing. Clonal relatedness was determined using molecular typing by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed that the isolates showed high rates of resistance (>90%) to amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam, aztreonam, ceftazidime, streptomycin, tobramycin, nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. Low rates of resistance were observed for kanamycin (35%), amikacin (30%), cefoxitin (20%) and cefotaxime (15%). Molecular characterisation revealed that all of the isolates expressed the blaTEM-1 gene. Fourteen of them harboured the blaSHV-12 gene, two harboured the blaCTX-M-1 gene and four isolates harboured blaCMY-2. Screening for AME-encoding genes demonstrated that all isolates contained the aadA gene. In addition, qnrA was detected as the quinolone resistance determinant in 13 isolates. MLST revealed four known sequence types (STs), including ST744, ST38, ST1011 and ST2179, as well as one new sequence type (ST5086). Here we report the first study describing the clonal diversity of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)- and plasmid AmpC-producing E. coli isolated from healthy broilers in Algeria.  aPublisher supplied data 0aEscherichia coli 0aESBL 0apAmpC 0aST5086 0aBroilers 0aAlgeria1 aBakour, Sofiane1 aAl Bayssari, Charbel1 aTouati, Abdelaziz1 aRolain, Jean-Marc0 tJournal of global antimicrobial resistance.g2016 Sept., v. 6 p.108-112dElsevier LtdaInternational Society for Chemotherapy of Infection and CancerwJournal:23469x2213-71657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgar.2016.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01273naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014200156300002000298520034300318592002800661650001800689650002200707650001500729650001500744700001800759773013500777856007400912852000900986655001200995IND60659109620221122035343.0190819e20111108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065910962DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc14982b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSekiya, Ryo10aPd²⁺⋯O₃SR⁻ interaction encourages anion encapsulation of a quadruply-stranded Pd complex to achieve chirality or high solubility  ap. 12346-12348.  aPd²⁺⋯O₃SR⁻ and CH⋯O₃SR⁻ interactions were found to play a crucial role in the encapsulation of organic sulfonates in a quadruply-stranded complex of Pd₂L₄-type.

Similar to wheat, maize and other agriculturally important crops, seed yield is highly dependent on a number of interacting seed yield components. This research was performed to apply and describe path analysis of perennial ryegrass seed yield components in relation to harvested seed yields. Utilising extensive yield components which included subdividing reproductive inflorescences into five size categories, path analysis was undertaken assuming a unidirectional causal‐admissible relationship between seed yield components and harvested seed yield in six commercial seed production fields. Both spikelets per inflorescence and florets per spikelet had a significant (p < .05) direct effect on the overall seed yield; however, total path correlation coefficients showed that inflorescence size had the largest positive influence on seed yield via its indirect effects on other seed yield components. Our results will allow seed producers, seed production researchers and plant breeders alike to more efficiently increase harvested seed yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium perenne 3acorn 3acorrelation 3acrops 3aflorets 3apath analysis 3aplant breeders 3aresearchers 3aseed crop production 3aseed yield 3awheat 3ayield components1 aGislum, R.1 aBoelt, B.0 tJournal of agronomy and crop science.g2017 Aug., v. 203, no. 4 p.338-344dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57791x0931-22507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jac.122023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245008300177500001900260520134400279592002801623650001901651650001501670650001601685650002501701650001301726650001901739650001401758650001601772650001701788650001201805650001301817650001201830650002101842651001001863653002601873653003101899653001101930653002201941653002301963700002001986700002202006700002402028700002502052700002002077700002102097700001802118700002202136700005502158700005702213700001802270700005702288700001902345773012802364856008402492852000902576655001202585IND60714126020221120174913.0201104e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071412602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2020.1051052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFavero-Longo, Sergio E.14aThe application protocol impacts the effectiveness of biocides against lichens  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis work analyzed the influence of different application protocols on the efficacy of two biocides against the foliose lichen Xanthoparmelia tinctina on the sandstones of the Roman Archaeological site of Luni (Italy). The hypotheses that (a) biocide application tools (brush vs. poultice), (b) pre-treatment hydration, and (c) post-treatment washing may affect devitalization success were verified by monitoring chlorophyll a fluorescence of thalli, both in situ and in laboratory conditions. The hypothesis that (d) stone substrate may act as reservoir for later biocide release under repeated cycles of wetting and drying was also assayed. Analyses confirmed the importance of the application tool, with cellulose poultice being more effective than brush. Hydration influenced the biocide absorption by thalli. Moreover it modulated the metabolic activity and susceptibility to the available toxic compound, hindering lichens from entering a dormant state to tolerate stress. Depending on the preparation solvent (water vs. white spirit), the biocide application benefited from pre-treatment hydration and/or a post-treatment washing. Lastly, we showed that different sandstones variously adsorb the biocides and potentially contribute as a reservoir for their long-term release at low concentrations during successive hydration events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXanthoparmelia 3aabsorption 3aarchaeology 3abiochemical pathways 3abiocides 3abiodegradation 3acellulose 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3alichens 3asolvents 3athallus 3atoxic substances 3aItaly 0aBenzalkonium chloride 0aChlorophyll a fluorescence 0aLichen 0aThallus hydration 0aStone conservation1 aVannini, Andrea1 aBenesperi, Renato1 aBianchi, Elisabetta1 aFačkovcová, Zuzana1 aGiordani, Paolo1 aMalaspina, Paola1 aMartire, Luca1 aMatteucci, Enrica1 aPaoli, Luca1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5479-64281 aRavera, Sonia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5223-79641 aRoccardi, Ada1 aTonon, Chiara1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1500-47361 aLoppi, Stefano0 tInternational biodeterioration & biodegradation.g2020 Nov., v. 155 p.105105-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12418x0964-83057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2020.1051053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100006900188245011600257300001800373506007600391520114300467592002801610506003701638650002201675650001201697650001201709650001101721650001101732650001001743650001101753650001301764650001501777650002101792650001201813650001501825650001001840700001901850700001901869700002101888700002001909700002601929773016601955856008202121852000902203655001202212IND60588956720221207130549.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058895672DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-0528-72doi7 aPMC57667072pmcid7 a290810442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarney Almroth, BethanieM.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5037-461210aQuantifying shedding of synthetic fibers from textiles; a source of microplastics released into the environment  ap. 1191-1199.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMicroplastics in the environment are a subject of intense research as they pose a potential threat to marine organisms. Plastic fibers from textiles have been indicated as a major source of this type of contaminant, entering the oceans via wastewater and diverse non-point sources. Their presence is also documented in terrestrial samples. In this study, the amount of microfibers shedding from synthetic textiles was measured for three materials (acrylic, nylon, polyester), knit using different gauges and techniques. All textiles were found to shed, but polyester fleece fabrics shed the greatest amounts, averaging 7360 fibers/m⁻²/L⁻¹ in one wash, compared with polyester fabrics which shed 87 fibers/m⁻²/L⁻¹. We found that loose textile constructions shed more, as did worn fabrics, and high twist yarns are to be preferred for shed reduction. Since fiber from clothing is a potentially important source of microplastics, we suggest that smarter textile construction, prewashing and vacuum exhaustion at production sites, and use of more efficient filters in household washing machines could help mitigate this problem.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaquatic organisms 3afabrics 3afilters 3afleece 3agauges 3anylon 3aoceans 3aplastics 3apolyesters 3asynthetic fibers 3awashing 3awastewater 3ayarns1 aÅström, Linn1 aRoslund, Sofia1 aPetersson, Hanna1 aJohansson, Mats1 aPersson, Nils-Krister0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 Jan., v. 25, no. 2 p.1191-1199dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-0528-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003000149245014900179300001400328520142700342592002801769650002401797650001201821650001601833650001101849650002501860650001201885650001101897650001601908650001501924650001301939650002501952653002801977653002502005653002802030653002402058653002302082653003002105700002802135700002902163700006102192773009202253856008402345852000902429655001202438IND60535507620221116170307.0190416e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053550762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2014.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorales-Sánchez, Daniela10aCulturing Neochloris oleoabundans microalga in a nitrogen-limited, heterotrophic fed-batch system to enhance lipid and carbohydrate accumulation  ap. 61-69.  aThe effects of nitrogen limitation on the specific growth rate (μ) and the accumulation of reserve metabolites in Neochloris oleoabundans during heterotrophic fed-batch cultivation were studied in a system consisting of three stages with an excess of glucose in a 40-L bioreactor. During the first stage, which was a batch cultivation with no carbon or nitrogen limitation, the cells grew at a μ of 0.045h−1, and the major cellular component was protein (44%, w/w) on a dry cell weight (DCW) basis. In the second, which was a fed-batch stage, two different exponential nitrate-feeding profiles were employed at μ values of 0.042 and 0.035h−1. The results show that a nitrogen limitation that causes a small reduction in the μ (only 20%) has a marked effect on the biochemical composition of the microalgal cells, promoting greater accumulation of lipids and carbohydrates. During the third stage, which was a post fed-batch stage, the cells were maintained under nitrogen-starvation and excess glucose conditions. When the glucose was depleted, the cells from the fed-batch culture at 0.042h−1 contained 53.8% lipids, reaching a cell mass of 20.9gDCW L−1, and the biomass, lipid and carbohydrate productivities were 1900, 1020 and 500mgL−1day−1, respectively. Thus far, these are the highest productivity values reported for N. oleoabundans cultures under phototrophic, mixotrophic or heterotrophic growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEttlia oleoabundans 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3acarbon 3achemical composition 3aglucose 3alipids 3ametabolites 3amicroalgae 3anitrogen 3aspecific growth rate 0aNeochloris oleoabundans 0aHeterotrophic growth 0aExponentially fed-batch 0aNitrogen limitation 0aLipid accumulation 0aCarbohydrate accumulation1 aTinoco-Valencia, Raunel1 aCaro-Bermúdez, Mario A.1 aMartinez, Alfredo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4804-66870 tAlgal research.g2014 July, v. 5 p.61-69dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2014.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008200168300001600250520132200266592002801588650001901616650002201635650002501657650001101682650001001693650002101703650002301724650001101747650002101758650001901779653003901798653003201837653002801869653002601897653003201923653002801955700002001983700001602003773009102019856008502110852000902195655001202204IND60571028820221119051053.0180912e20170901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057102882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2017.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajidi, Majid12aA cost-emission framework for hub energy system under demand response program  ap. 157-166.  aBased on the kind of fuel consumed by generation unit, each generation system has different generation costs and emits various types of greenhouse gases like CO2, SO2 and NO2 to the atmosphere. So, nowadays in the power system scheduling, emission issue has been turned to be an important factor. In this paper, in addition to economic performance, emission problem of energy hub system has been also investigated. Therefore, a multi-objective optimization model has been proposed for cost-environmental operation of energy hub system in the presence of demand response program (DRP). Weighted sum approach has been employed to solve the proposed multi-objective model and fuzzy satisfying technique has been implemented to select the best compromise solution. Implementation of load management programs presented by DRP shifts some percentage of load from peak periods to off-peak periods to flatten load curve which leads to reduction of total cost and emission of energy hub system. A mixed-integer linear programming has been used to model the cost-environmental performance problem of energy hub system and then, GAMS optimization software has been utilized to solve it. A sample energy hub system has been studied and the obtained results have been compared to validate the effectiveness of proposed techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acomputer software 3aeconomic performance 3aenergy 3afuels 3agreenhouse gases 3alinear programming 3amodels 3anitrogen dioxide 3asulfur dioxide 0aMulti-objective optimization model 0aMulti-carrier energy system 0aCombined heat and power 0aWeighted sum approach 0aFuzzy satisfying techniques 0aDemand response program1 aNojavan, Sayyad1 aZare, Kazem0 tEnergy.g2017 Sept. 01, v. 134 p.157-166dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03810naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003600147245013500183300001800318520168100336592002802017650001302045650001302058650002902071650001202100650003502112650001102147650002002158650001302178650001202191650001302203650001202216650001102228650000902239650001002248650002902258650002902287650001702316650002202333650000902355650001202364650001002376650001402386650001502400650001102415650001602426650001302442650000902455650001902464650001202483650001402495650001202509650001302521650001702534650001302551650001502564650000902579651001102588700001802599700003502617700002902652700003202681700003302713700003102746700003002777773016602807856008202973852000903055655001203064IND60588956920221117235735.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058895692DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-0427-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalvador, RaizaMenezes Venturim10aTropidurus torquatus (Squamata: Tropiduridae) as a bioindicator of heavy metal (aluminum and zinc) pollution in Vila Velha, Brazil  ap. 1210-1219.  aUrbanization is responsible for numerous environmental changes including pollution. Information on the susceptibility of reptiles to environmental contaminants is relatively scarce. Tropidurus torquatus represents a potential bioindicator of heavy metal pollution. Levels of heavy metals in tissues from T. torquatus depend on bioavailability and vary among different populations. The aim of this study was to determine the heavy metal concentration in liver and fat tissue of T. torquatus from three distinct populations in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil. The study areas included coastal rocky outcrops, dunes, and mountain rocky outcrops; each area had a different climate, vegetation, and level of anthropogenic influence. Fifty-one individuals were captured. Biometrics and sexes were determined, and stomach contents were identified. The tissue samples were digested with nitric acid and analyzed via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) for aluminum (Al), arsenic (As), barium (Ba), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), lithium (Li), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), strontium (Sr), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), and zinc (Zn) contents. The concentration of zinc in Tropidurus torquatus was higher in liver than in fat tissue (432 ± 1380 mg kg⁻¹), and that of aluminum was higher in fat tissue (765 ± 1455 mg.kg⁻¹). The animals’ diet may be related to heavy metal contamination. The study suggests that T. torquatus could be used for soil biomonitoring with liver as a bioindicator for aluminum contamination and fat tissue as a bioindicator for zinc contamination.

However, less attention has been brought to the question of the source inference of ignitable liquids. Infer the identity of source of ignitable liquids recovered from arson sites is still a challenging and ongoing research area. In this study, the objective is to link neat gasoline samples sharing a common source through the use of an untargeted chemometric approach applied to data acquired by automated thermodesorption (ATD)-GC–MS following passive headspace extraction onto Tenax TA tubes. To that end, 190 unique gasoline samples from 19 gas stations collected over a year were used. A general and automated chemometric methodology for data treatment involving the following main steps is proposed: feature detection, normalization by exhaustive calculation of ratios between areas of pairs of features and selection of most discriminant ratios. The ratio selection procedure used here is based on the calculation of similarity measurements between pairs of samples sharing a common source or not. The algorithm maximizes the separation of the distributions of similarity measurements for related and unrelated samples by selecting a subset of ratios maximizing the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve. The approach presented here was successfully applied to neat gasoline samples in order to assess if two gasoline samples share a common source or not.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aautomation 3achemometrics 3adata collection 3aforensic sciences 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agasoline 3aheadspace analysis 0aFire debris analysis 0aIgnitable liquids 0aGasoline 0aSource inference 0aChemometrics1 aCordella, Christophe B.Y.1 aJouan-Rimbaud Bouveresse, Delphine1 aArcher, Xavier1 aBégué, Jean-Marc1 aRutledge, D.

Multicomponent reactions are especially attractive in organic chemistry as they allow the synthesis of large libraries of diversely functionalized products in a short time when run in a combinatorial fashion. Herein, we report a novel, regioselective, iridium-catalyzed multicomponent synthesis of pyrimidines from amidines and up to three (different) alcohols. This reaction proceeds via a sequence of condensation and dehydrogenation steps which give rise to selective C–C and C–N bond formations. While the condensation steps deoxygenate the alcohol components, the dehydrogenations lead to aromatization. Two equiv of hydrogen and water are liberated in the course of the reactions. PN₅P–Ir–pincer complexes, recently developed in our laboratory, catalyze this sustainable multicomponent process most efficiently. A total of 38 different pyrimidines were synthesized in isolated yields of up to 93%. Strong points of the new protocol are its regioselectivity and thus the immediate access to pyrimidines that are highly and unsymmetrically decorated with alkyl or aryl substituents. The combination of this novel protocol with established methods for converting alcohols to nitriles now allows to selectively assemble pyrimidines from four alcohol building blocks and 2 equiv of ammonia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aamidines 3aammonia 3abiomass 3achemical bonding 3adehydrogenation 3ahydrogen 3alignocellulose 3anitriles 3apyrimidines 3astandard operating procedures1 aAment, Kevin1 aKempe, Rhett0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Oct. 14, v. 137, no. 40 p.12804-12807dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b095103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245007400163300001600237500002000253520146500273592002801738650001301766650001801779650001701797650001301814650000901827650001601836650001201852650002701864650001801891650001201909650001401921650001901935650001901954650001901973650001901992650002202011650001902033650001702052700001402069700001402083700002302097773013702120856007302257852000902330655001202339IND60587439220221122010556.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058743922DNAL7 a10.1111/jac.122012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFleta‐Soriano, E.10aMelatonin may exert a protective role against drought stress in maize  ap. 286-294.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMelatonin (N‐acetyl‐5methoxytryptamine) is an amphiphilic low‐molecular‐weight compound found in evolutionary distant living organisms, from bacteria to mammals. It can be synthesized by plants and acts as a potent antioxidant and/or a regulator of plant growth and development. Here, we investigated the role of melatonin in plant response to drought stress and recovery in maize (Zea mays L.) plants, with an emphasis on its possible photoprotective and antioxidant role and/or signalling function in relation to the stress‐related phytohormones, abscisic acid, salicylic acid and jasmonic acid. Results show a positive correlation between endogenous contents of melatonin and photoprotection, as indicated by the maximum efficiency of photosystem II photochemistry (Fᵥ/Fₘ ratio), which was confirmed further by exogenous application of melatonin during recovery from drought stress. Melatonin applications during drought recovery improved the Fᵥ/Fₘ ratio in maize plants exposed to a subsequent drought stress. Furthermore, endogenous contents of melatonin positively correlated with those of stress‐related phytohormones, particularly with those of salicylic acid, although exogenous application of melatonin did not alter the contents of these defence compounds. It is concluded that melatonin can exert a defensive role in maize plants exposed to drought stress, particularly improving the efficiency of photosystem II photochemistry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aabscisic acid 3aantioxidants 3abacteria 3acorn 3acorrelation 3adrought 3agrowth and development 3ajasmonic acid 3amammals 3amelatonin 3aphotochemistry 3aphotostability 3aphotosystem II 3aplant response 3aprotective effect 3asalicylic acid 3awater stress1 aDíaz, L.1 aBonet, E.1 aMunné‐Bosch, S.0 tJournal of agronomy and crop science.g2017 Aug., v. 203, no. 4 p.286-294dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57791x0931-22507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jac.122013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012900174300001800303520091900321536027001240592002801510596010201538596008501640596008501725650001801810650001101828650001401839650001301853650002501866653003201891653001401923653002301937700001601960773011401976856008602090852000902176655001202185IND60758693520221118065343.0211202e20211110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075869352DNAL7 a10.1080/03066150.2021.19644752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrügl, Elisabeth,10aProductive farmers and vulnerable food securers: contradictions of gender expertise in international food security discourse  ap. 1439-1458.  aWith gender equality becoming a key feature of the global food security agenda, international organizations have produced a rich body of knowledge on gender. This paper argues that such gender expertise generates political effects through identity constructions, problem definitions and rationalities. We critically analyse 59 documents relating to gender and food security in the South written in international organizations between 2000 and 2018. Our analysis reveals two gendered constructions articulated in these documents – the productive female farmer and the caring woman food securer. We demonstrate that problem definitions, solutions, and rationalities associated with these identity constructions are contradictory. Their juxtaposition reveals that gender expertise in international food security discourse is not only governed by neoliberal orthodoxy but also surfaces ambivalences and alternatives.  aResearch leading to this publication has been supported by a grant from the Swiss Programme for Research on Global Issues for Development, co-funded by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation and the Swiss National Science Foundation [grant number 400540].  aPublisher supplied data  cSwiss Programme for Research on Global Issues for Developmentdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100010767  cSwiss Agency for Development and Cooperationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009131  a400540cSwiss National Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001711 3afood security 3agender 3apeasantry 3apolitics 3awomen in agriculture 0ainternational organizations 0aexpertise 0adiscourse analysis1 aJoshi, Saba0 tJournal of peasant studies.g2021 Nov. 10, v. 48, no. 7 p.1439-1458dRoutledgewJournal:2021x1743-93617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2021.19644753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02227naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002500155245008000180300001400260520101500274592002801289650001901317650002401336650002401360650001601384650001001400650001901410650002101429653002101450653002901471653003501500653002901535700001901564700001801583700002101601700002001622773008901642856008901731852000901820655001201829IND60605094120221121100750.0180720e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060509412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2015.05.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmeida, Renato S.M.10aTensile and creep performance of a novel mullite fiber at high temperatures  ap. 37-43.  aThe novel fiber CeraFib75 with a composition near to pure mullite was analyzed with respect to its potential for high-temperature applications. This mullite fiber free of glass phase was aimed to overcome the strength of commercial oxide fibers at high-temperatures. Tensile tests at room and high temperatures ranging from 900 to 1400°C and creep tests were performed. Nextel™720, another crystalline mullite-alumina fiber, was tested as a reference. Microstructure and crystal phase analysis of the new fiber revealed mullite grains with traces of γ- and α-alumina in-between; it contains occasionally defects causing a reduced strength at room-temperature. Remarkably, at temperatures beyond 1200°C, CeraFib75 presented a higher tensile strength than Nextel™720. During tensile tests at 1400°C, an extended region of inelastic deformation was observed for CeraFib fibers only, which was related to a grain boundary sliding mechanism. Creep rates were of the same order of magnitude for both fibers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3aambient temperature 3acomposite materials 3adeformation 3aglass 3amicrostructure 3atensile strength 0aA.

The National Solid Waste Policy (2010) enforces the implementation of reverse logistics systems under the shared responsibility of consumers, companies and governments. The objective of this paper is to assess sustainability and prioritise system alternatives for potential implementation in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro. Sustainability criteria and decision alternatives were defined by elicitation of stakeholders. The adopted multicriteria approach combines Life Cycle Assessment with qualitative evaluations by a small sample of regional experts with knowledge of the problem. The recommended system consists of a hybrid WEEE collection scheme with delivery points at shops, metro stations and neighbourhood centres; a pre-treatment phase with the involvement of private companies, cooperatives and social enterprises; and full recycling of all components in the country.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooperatives 3aelectronic wastes 3aexperts 3aissues and policy 3alandfills 3alife cycle assessment 3amanagement systems 3aprioritization 3aprivate enterprises 3arecycling 3astakeholders 3aBrazil 0aWaste electric and electronic equipment 0aReverse logistics 0aMulticriteria decision analysis 0aComposition of probabilistic preferences 0aLife cycle assessment 0aSustainability assessment1 aClímaco, João C.

A.10aSynthesis, Characterization, and Nitrogenase-Relevant Reactions of an Iron Sulfide Complex with a Bridging Hydride  ap. 13220-13223.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe FeMoco of nitrogenase is an iron–sulfur cluster with exceptional bond-reducing abilities. ENDOR studies have suggested that E₄, the state that binds and reduces N₂, contains bridging hydrides as part of the active-site iron-sulfide cluster. However, there are no examples of any isolable iron-sulfide cluster with a hydride, which would test the feasibility of such a species. Here, we describe a diiron sulfide hydride complex that is prepared using a mild method involving C–S cleavage of added thiolate. Its reactions with nitrogenase substrates show that the hydride can act as a base or nucleophile and that reduction can cause the iron atoms to bind N₂. These results add experimental support to hydride-based pathways for nitrogenase.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactive sites 3ahydrides 3airon 3anitrogen 3anitrogenase 3asulfides1 aDugan, Thomas R.1 aMenges, Fabian S.1 aMercado, Brandon Q.1 aBrennessel, William W.1 aBill, Eckhard1 aJohnson, Mark A.1 aHolland, Patrick L.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Oct. 21, v. 137, no. 41 p.13220-13223dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b068413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03610naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245019000165500001900355520196200374592002802336650002402364650001402388650001302402650000902415650003102424650001302455650002402468650001702492650001202509650001302521650001102534650002202545650001402567650001002581650001302591653001102604653003002615653002402645653002602669700001302695700002002708700001802728700001802746700002502764700001702789700005702806773012502863856008302988852000903071655001203080IND60714126720221121091127.0201202e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071412672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2020.1034752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qiang10aIdentification and profiling of Bactrocera dorsalis microRNAs and their potential roles in regulating the developmental transitions of egg hatching, molting, pupation and adult eclosion  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs (18–25 nt) that are involved in many physiological processes including development, cancer, immunity, apoptosis and host-microbe interactions through post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. In this study, we measured the profile of small RNAs over the developmental transitions of the oriental fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis from egg hatching, molting, and pupation to adult eclosion. We identified 250 miRNAs, including 83 known and 167 novel miRNAs, and 47 isomiRNAs. In addition, we identified the miRNAs differentially expressed over the developmental transitions. Interestingly, the miR-309 cluster, the miR-2 cluster/family and the let-7 cluster were among these differentially expressed miRNAs, suggesting a role in the regulation of egg hatching, molting and pupation/adult eclosion, respectively. Moreover, a detailed analysis of the temporal expression patterns of 14 highly expressed miRNAs in the pupal stage revealed three types of expression profiles. Furthermore, injection of a miR-100 mimic in the 3rd instar larvae resulted in a significant decrease in pupation and adult eclosion rates, whereas injection of a miR-317 antagomir resulted in a significant decrease in the pupation rate and a decrease in the pupation time, indicating that miR-100 and miR-317 are involved in the process of pupation. Finally, injection of a miR-100/miR-285 mimic or antagomir in pupae resulted in a significant decrease in the eclosion rate and a significant increase in the prevalence of a partial eclosion phenotype, implying the involvement of miR-100 and miR-285 in the process of adult eclosion. This study identified critical miRNAs involved in the transitions of this important holometabolic model and pest insect B. dorsalis from egg hatching to adult eclosion, thus providing a useful resource for exploring the regulatory role of miRNAs during insect post-embryonic development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBactrocera dorsalis 3aapoptosis 3aeclosion 3aeggs 3agene expression regulation 3aimmunity 3ainsect biochemistry 3ainsect pests 3ainstars 3amicroRNA 3amodels 3amolecular biology 3aphenotype 3apupae 3apupation 0amiRNAs 0aDevelopmental transitions 0aTemporal expression 0aSmall RNAs sequencing1 aDou, Wei1 aSong, Zhong-Hao1 aJin, Tong-Jun1 aYuan, Guo-Rui1 aDe Schutter, Kristof1 aSmagghe, Guy1 aWang, Jin-Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8777-52680 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2020 Dec., v. 127 p.103475-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48131x0965-17487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2020.1034753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03024naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245013800167300001600305520148500321592002801806650002301834650001901857650001301876650001201889650001601901650001201917650002401929650002001953650001301973650001301986650001101999650001102010650001502021650002102036650001602057653001102073653001002084653002802094653004402122653001802166653002002184700002002204700001902224700001802243700002602261700002002287773009402307856008402401852000902485655001202494IND60535508220221116170139.0190416e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053550822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2014.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraya, Blanca10aEvaluation of the simultaneous production of lutein and lipids using a vertical alveolar panel bioreactor for three Chlorella species  ap. 218-222.  aThe concept of a biorefinery improves the economic efficiency of a biofuel production process from microalgae by recovering high value added compounds. Lutein is a carotenoid currently extracted from petals of Tagetes erecta with an established market in poultry and in human nutritional supplements. For the very first time, an extended study on the lipid and lutein production over three Chlorella species as well as cell disruption methods was performed. Chlorella vulgaris, Chlorella zofingiensis and Chlorella protothecoides were grown in an indoor vertical alveolar panel photobioreactor with continuous illumination, and two cell disruption methods were assessed at a laboratory scale: glass bead vortexing and ball mill grinding. For C. vulgaris, C. zofingiensis and C. protothecoides the intracellular lutein content was measured as: 3.86, 4.38 and 3.59mgg−1 respectively. Lipid contents vary slightly among microalgae with a value close to 9% w/w. Biomass and lutein productivities were found to be higher for C. vulgaris (0.131gL−1d−1, 0.51mgL−1d−1) and for C. zofingiensis (0.122gL−1d−1, 0.53mgL−1d−1) compared to C. protothecoides (0.103gL−1d−1, 0.37mgL−1d−1).C. vulgaris 1803 and C. zofingiensis B 32 were found to be promising organisms for simultaneous production of lutein and lipids. Although all the microalgae under study belong to the same genus, a species-specific response was observed for each of the cell grinding methods tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aTagetes erecta 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3acorolla 3adietary supplements 3afuel production 3agrinding 3alighting 3alipids 3alutein 3amicroalgae 3aphotobioreactors 3avalue added 0aLutein 0aLipid 0aPhotoautotrophic growth 0aVertical alveolar panel photobioreactor 0aChlorella sp. 0aCell disruption1 aGouveia, Luisa,1 aNobre, Beatriz1 aReis, Alberto1 aChamy, R.q(Rolando),1 aPoirrier, Paola0 tAlgal research.g2014 Oct., v. 6 p.218-222dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2014.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245014600168300001400314520088000328592002801208650002401236650001301260650000901273650002501282650002601307650001401333650002001347650002001367650001601387650002501403653001401428653004001442653002601482653002901508700001601537700001601553700001301569700001701582700001501599700001301614700002401627700001501651773008901666856008901755852000901844655001201853IND60605094520221121070237.0180720e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060509452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2015.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Wen10aEnhanced thermal conductivity and retained electrical insulation for polyimide composites with SiC nanowires grown on graphene hybrid fillers  ap. 73-81.  aPolyimide (PI) composites containing one-dimensional SiC nanowires grown on two-dimensional graphene sheets (1D–2D SiCNWs-GSs) hybrid fillers were successfully prepared. The PI/SiCNWs-GSs composites synchronously exhibited high thermal conductivity and retained electrical insulation. Moreover, the heat conducting properties of PI/SiCNWs-GSs films present well reproducibility within the temperature range from 25 to 175°C. The maximum value of thermal conductivity of PI composite is 0.577W/mK with 7wt% fillers loading, increased by 138% in comparison with that of the neat PI. The 1D SiC nanowires grown on the GSs surface prevent the GSs contacting with each other in the PI matrix to retain electrical insulation of PI composites. In addition, the storage modulus and Young’s modulus of PI composites are remarkably improved in comparison with that of the neat PI.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite materials 3agraphene 3aheat 3ainsulating materials 3amodulus of elasticity 3ananowires 3asilicon carbide 3astorage modulus 3atemperature 3athermal conductivity 0aA.

Yet, there has been limited investigation in cats, and the impact of comorbidities such as feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection has not been reported. Oral and conjunctival swabs were collected from cats with FIV infection and FIV-uninfected controls, and subjected to 16S rRNA gene (V4) PCR and next generation sequencing. 9,249 OTUs were identified from conjunctival swabs, yet the most common 20 (0.22%) OTUs accounted for 76% of sequences. The two most abundant OTUs both belonged to Staphylococcus, and accounted for 37% of sequences. Cats with FIV infection had significantly lower relative abundances of Verrucomicrobia, Fibrobacteres, Spirochaetes, Bacteroidetes and Tenericutes, and a higher relative abundance of Deinococcus-Thermus. There were significant differences in both community membership (P = 0.006) and community structure (P = 0.02) between FIV-infected and FIV-uninfected cats. FIV-infected cats had significantly higher relative abundances of Fusobacteria and Actinobacteria in the oral cavity, and significantly higher relative abundances of several bacterial classes including Fusobacteria (0.022 vs 0.007, P = 0.006), Actinobacteria (0.017 vs 0.003, P = 0.003), Sphingobacteria (0.00015 vs 0.00003, P = 0.0013) and Flavobacteria (0.0073 vs 0.0034, P = 0.030). The feline conjunctival and oral microbiotas are complex polymicrobial communities but dominated by a limited number of genera. There is an apparent impact of FIV infection on various components of the microbiota, and assessment of the clinical relevance of these alterations in required.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFusobacteria 3aStaphylococcus 3acommunity structure 3aribosomal RNA 3acats 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aFlavobacteria 3amouth 3acomorbidity 3apathogens 3agenes 3aSphingobacteriia 3aActinobacteria 3aVerrucomicrobium 3aFeline immunodeficiency virus 3aSpirochaetales 0aSphingobacteria1 aNichols, Jamieson1 aJalali, Mohammad1 aLitster, Annette0 tVeterinary research.g2015 Dec., v. 46, no. 1 p.21-21dBioMed Centralx1297-97167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13567-014-0140-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03876naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001700189245014200206300001600348506007600364520208700440592002802527506003702555650000802592650002002600650001202620650001202632650002102644650001002665650001802675650001602693650001302709650001802722650001802740650001602758650001302774650001002787650001602797650000902813650001702822650001202839650003502851650002002886650001202906700001902918700001602937700002502953700002302978700001603001700001803017700002003035773012803055856008203183852000903265655001203274IND60089558020221207113034.0141102e20120413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008955802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.03.0352doi7 aPMC33277672pmcid7 a224458942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xiaoju10aGlucocorticoid-induced loss of DNA methylation in non-neuronal cells and potential involvement of DNMT1 in epigenetic regulation of Fkbp5  ap. 570-575.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGlucocorticoids may play a significant role in the etiology of neuropsychiatric illnesses. Abnormalities in plasma cortisol levels, glucocorticoid sensitivity, and HPA-axis function often accompany clinical symptoms of stress-related illnesses such as PTSD and depression. Of particular interest are genetic association studies that link single nucleotide polymorphisms of HPA-axis genes with illnesses only in the context of an early-life trauma exposure such as child abuse. These studies suggest that dysregulation of HPA-axis function can have lasting repercussions in shaping mood and anxiety, long after termination of the traumatic experience. As persistent glucocorticoid-induced loss of DNA methylation in FK506 binding protein 5 (Fkbp5) was previously observed in the hippocampus and blood and in the neuronal cell line HT-22, we asked whether these epigenetic alterations occur in non-neuronal, HPA-axis relevant cells. We used the pituitary adenoma cell line AtT-20 to demonstrate that the intronic enhancer region of Fkbp5 undergoes loss of DNA methylation in response to dexamethasone treatment in a dose-dependent manner. We also focused on the mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus to test whether these changes would be enriched in a region implicated in the HPA-axis stress response, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. We observed an increase in enrichment of DNA methylation loss in the dentate gyrus, as compared to whole hippocampal tissues that were similarly treated with glucocorticoids. We then asked whether DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1), a methyltransferase enzyme involved in maintaining DNA methylation following cell division, is involved in the observed epigenetic alterations. We found a dose-dependent decrease of Dnmt1 expression in the AtT-20 cells following dexamethasone treatment, and a similar decrease in corticosterone-treated mouse hippocampus. Taken together, we provide evidence that these glucocorticoid-induced epigenetic alterations have a broader validity in non-neuronal cells and that they may involve the DNA methylation machinery.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aadenoma 3aanxiety 3abinding proteins 3ablood 3acell division 3achild abuse 3acortisol 3adexamethasone 3adose response 3aepigenetics 3aetiology 3agenes 3ahippocampus 3amice 3aneurogenesis 3aneurons 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3astress response 3atissues1 aEwald, Erin R.1 aHuo, Yuqing1 aTamashiro, Kellie L.1 aSalvatori, Roberto1 aSawa, Akira1 aWand, Gary S.1 aLee, Richard S.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Apr. 13, v. 420, no. 3 p.570-575dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.03.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03260naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003300188245009800221300001100319506007600330520162400406592002802030506003702058650002302095650002502118650002002143650003102163650003202194650001602226650001302242650001902255650001702274650001402291650001502305650001002320650001902330650001202349700002102361700001802382700001802400700001702418700001702435700002002452700002302472700002102495700002102516773009102537856008102628852000902709655001202718IND60121504820221207120911.0161029e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012150482DNAL7 a10.1186/s13567-014-0141-42doi7 aPMC43461062pmcid7 a258795892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNúñez-Hernández, Fernando10aIdentification of microRNAs in PCV2 subclinically infected pigs by high throughput sequencing  ap. 18.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPorcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the essential etiological infectious agent of PCV2-systemic disease and has been associated with other swine diseases, all of them collectively known as porcine circovirus diseases. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a new class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. miRNAs play an increasing role in many biological processes. The study of miRNA-mediated host-pathogen interactions has emerged in the last decade due to the important role that miRNAs play in antiviral defense. The objective of this study was to identify the miRNA expression pattern in PCV2 subclinically infected and non-infected pigs. For this purpose an experimental PCV2 infection was carried out and small-RNA libraries were constructed from tonsil and mediastinal lymph node (MLN) of infected and non-infected pigs. High throughput sequencing determined differences in miRNA expression in MLN between infected and non-infected while, in tonsil, a very conserved pattern was observed. In MLN, miRNA 126-3p, miRNA 126-5p, let-7d-3p, mir-129a and mir-let-7b-3p were up-regulated whereas mir-193a-5p, mir-574-5p and mir-34a down-regulated. Prediction of functional analysis showed that these miRNAs can be involved in pathways related to immune system and in processes related to the pathogenesis of PCV2, although functional assays are needed to support these predictions. This is the first study on miRNA gene expression in pigs infected with PCV2 using a high throughput sequencing approach in which several host miRNAs were differentially expressed in response to PCV2 infection.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPorcine circovirus 3aPorcine circovirus-2 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3alymph nodes 3amicroRNA 3anon-coding RNA 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3aprediction 3aswine 3aswine diseases 3atonsils1 aPérez, Lester J1 aMuñoz, Marta1 aVera, Gonzalo1 aTomás, Anna1 aEgea, Raquel1 aCórdoba, Sarai1 aSegalés, Joaquim,1 aSánchez, Armand1 aNúñez, José I0 tVeterinary research.g2015 Dec., v. 46, no. 1 p.18-18dBioMed Centralx1297-97167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13567-014-0141-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245010700162300001600269500002000285520112600305592002801431596001801459596005801477650002701535650002001562650002201582650000901604650001801613650002301631650002001654651001001674651001601684700001401700700001801714700002301732773014301755856007501898852000901973655001201982IND60773354120221120123545.0220413e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077335412DNAL7 a10.1111/ajae.122542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCobourn, Kelly M.14aThe effect of prior appropriation water rights on land‐allocation decisions in irrigated agriculture  ap. 947-975.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe doctrine of prior appropriation, which administers water rights based on seniority, may introduce heterogeneity in the risk of a water shortage among otherwise similar agricultural irrigators. We develop a theoretical model that describes how farmers with differing seniority in water rights adjust land‐allocation decisions in response to an anticipated change in water deliveries. Using a fine‐scale dataset of spatially referenced surface water rights for Idaho's Eastern Snake River Plain, we find evidence that irrigators with differing water rights make systematically different land‐allocation decisions, and that farmers with the most junior (least secure) water rights are most responsive to an expected water shortage. These irrigators adapt to anticipated dry conditions by increasing land fallowed and planting a less profitable, drought‐resilient mix of crops. Relatively dry growing season conditions exacerbate the potential for prior appropriation to introduce inefficiencies by driving a divergence in resource‐use decisions between otherwise similar irrigators with differing water rights.  aPublisher supplied data  cVirginia Tech  cInstitute for Critical Technology and Applied Science 3aagricultural economics 3adata collection 3airrigated farming 3arisk 3asurface water 3atheoretical models 3awater shortages 3aIdaho 3aSnake River1 aJi, Xinde1 aMooney, Siân1 aCrescenti, Neil F.0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g2022 May, v. 104, no. 3 p.947-975dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajae.122543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02316naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011900172300001300291520113800304592002801442650001301470650001501483650001201498650001401510650001701524650001201541650001201553650001501565650001501580653001801595653001801613653002201631653002501653653002101678700002001699773010401719856008601823852000901909655001201918IND60597147920221122050559.0190613e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059714792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.12.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosenbaum, Stacy10aWith a little help from her friends (and family) part I: the ecology and evolution of non-maternal care in mammals  ap. 1-11.  aIn the class Mammalia, most young are cared for exclusively by their mothers. In species where mothers receive help, however, non-maternal caregivers may play a crucial role in development and life history trajectories. In turn, recipients of such care may have important impacts on caregivers of all types. In Part I of this overview, we briefly review the evolutionary barriers to widespread non-maternal care in mammals, and explain why the exceptions are of particular theoretical importance. We also summarize the current understanding of the selective forces leading to non-maternal care, and the taxa and types of caretakers amongst which it occurs. Finally, we argue for a fresh look at the categorization schemes that have traditionally been used to separate various types of mammalian non-maternal caregivers. This two-part introduction is aimed at scientists from multiple disciplines who study diverse organismal systems. It draws from the social and biological sciences literatures to provide an overview of this special issue of Physiology and Behavior's suite of methodological offerings and theoretical underpinnings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMammalia 3acaregivers 3aecology 3aevolution 3alife history 3amammals 3amothers 3aphysiology 3ascientists 0aAlloparenting 0aPaternal care 0aAllomaternal care 0aCooperative breeding 0aBi-parental care1 aGettler, Lee T.0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 193 p.1-11dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.12.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245010400172300001600276520145000292592002801742650001401770650001501784650001901799650001101818650001501829650003301844650001301877653002001890653002301910653002201933653003301955653001401988653001802002700002302020700002202043700006002065700006402125773009402189856008402283852000902367655001202376IND60535508420221116170247.0190416e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053550842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2014.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYap, Benjamin H.J.12aA mechanistic study of algal cell disruption and its effect on lipid recovery by solvent extraction  ap. 112-120.  aThe effect of cell rupture on subsequent lipid recovery by solvent extraction was assessed by performing extractions on Chlorella sp. suspensions that were ruptured to varying extents by high pressure homogenization. Descriptions of lipid recovery mechanisms were supported by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the damaged cells, with the extent of cell rupture quantified by cell counting. Lipid recovery by monophasic solvent extraction was found to be a two-stage process. Intracellular lipids from ruptured cells were immediately recovered. Lipids from unruptured cells were recovered very slowly over hours, which can be best explained by diffusion across the cell wall, driven by a concentration gradient formed upon permeation of solvents into the cells. Biphasic solvent extraction required complete rupture of the cells to enable the necessary physical contact between the immiscible solvent and the lipids. Lipid recovery from ruptured cells was 100-fold higher than that from unruptured cells, owing to the impermeability of the cell walls to the immiscible solvent. Biphasic solvent extraction selectively recovered non-polar triacylglycerides, while monophasic solvent extraction recovered all lipid types. This study demonstrates and explains the need for complete cell rupture in the recovery of intracellular lipids from microalgae using solvents, and provides the first clear description of the underlying mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella 3acell walls 3ahomogenization 3alipids 3amicroalgae 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 0aCell disruption 0aSolvent extraction 0aMicroalgal lipids 0aHigh pressure homogenization 0aBiodiesel 0aChlorella sp.1 aCrawford, Simon A.1 aDumsday, Geoff J.1 aScales, Peter J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8033-36861 aMartin, Gregory J.O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7099-79130 tAlgal research.g2014 July, v. 5 p.112-120dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2014.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245010000208300001100308506007600319520132600395592002801721506003701749650002301786650002501809650001801834650001501852650002701867650001901894650002101913650001401934650001401948650001201962650001901974650002101993650003202014650001602046650001302062650001202075700002402087700001902111700002002130700001902150700002202169700002502191700002002216700002302236773009102259856008102350852000902431655001202440IND60121504920221207133246.0161029e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012150492DNAL7 a10.1186/s13567-015-0157-42doi7 aPMC43481022pmcid7 a258888992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoinig, Hanna C10aPCV2 vaccination induces IFN-γ/TNF-α co-producing T cells with a potential role in protection  ap. 20.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPorcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is one of the economically most important pathogens for swine production worldwide. Vaccination is a powerful tool to control porcine circovirus diseases (PCVD). However, it is not fully understood how PCV2 vaccination interacts with the porcine immune system. Especially knowledge on the cellular immune response against PCV2 is sparse. In this study we analysed antigen-specific T cell responses against PCV2 in a controlled vaccination and infection experiment. We focused on the ability of CD4⁺ T cells to produce cytokines using multicolour flow cytometry (FCM). Vaccination with a PCV2 subunit vaccine (Ingelvac CircoFLEX®) induced PCV2-specific antibodies only in five out of 12 animals. Conversely, vaccine-antigen specific CD4⁺ T cells which simultaneously produced IFN-γ and TNF-α and had a phenotype of central and effector memory T cells were detected in all vaccinated piglets. After challenge, seroconversion occurred earlier in vaccinated and infected pigs compared to the non-vaccinated, infected group. Vaccinated pigs were fully protected against viremia after subsequent challenge. Therefore, our data suggests that the induction of IFN-γ/TNF-α co-producing T cells by PCV2 vaccination may serve as a potential correlate of protection for this type of vaccine.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPorcine circovirus 3aPorcine circovirus-2 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantibodies 3acell-mediated immunity 3aflow cytometry 3ainterferon-gamma 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3apiglets 3aseroconversion 3aswine production 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aviremia1 aTalker, Stephanie C1 aStadler, Maria1 aLadinig, Andrea1 aGraage, Robert1 aRitzmann, Mathias1 aHennig-Pauka, Isabel1 aGerner, Wilhelm1 aSaalmüller, Armin0 tVeterinary research.g2015 Dec., v. 46, no. 1 p.20-20dBioMed Centralx1297-97167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13567-015-0157-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245004400175300001600219520128100235592002801516650001101544650001601555650001101571650003101582650001201613650002901625650000901654650001101663650001601674650001901690653002901709653001101738653001501749653002101764653001301785653002601798700006001824773009101884856008501975852000902060655001202069IND60571029520221119051134.0180912e20170901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057102952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2017.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJensen, Ida Græsted14aThe impact of CO2-costs on biogas usage  ap. 289-300.  aThe Danish government has set a target of being fossil fuel independent by 2050 implying that a high degree of inflexible renewable energy will be included in the energy system; biogas can add flexibility and potentially has a negative CO2-emission. In this paper, we investigate the socio-economic system costs of reaching a Danish biogas target of 3.8 PJ in the energy system, and how CO2-costs affect the system costs and biogas usage.We perform our analysis using the energy systems model, Balmorel, and expand the model with a common target for raw biogas and upgraded biogas (biomethane). Raw biogas can be used directly in heat and power production, while biomethane has the same properties as natural gas. Balmorel is altered such that natural gas and biomethane can be used in the same technologies.Several CO2-cost estimates are investigated; hereunder a high estimate for the expected CO2-externality costs. We find that system costs increase with CO2-costs in most cases, while the biogas target becomes socio-economically cheaper. In the case of a very high CO2-cost, system costs decrease and biomethane becomes the primary fuel. Furthermore, biomethane functions as regulating power and the Danish fuel consumption increases due to a higher electricity export.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogas 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3aexports 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat 3amodels 3anatural gas 3asocioeconomics 0aEnergy systems modelling 0aBiogas 0aBiomethane 0aRenewable energy 0aBalmorel 0aCO2-externality costs1 aSkovsgaard, Lise1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8562-01260 tEnergy.g2017 Sept. 01, v. 134 p.289-300dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03705naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245010700174300001800281520183900299592002802138650002302166650001702189650002502206650002202231650001902253650001602272650001702288650001702305650002202322650000902344650001402353650001802367650001402385650001402399650001902413650001502432650003302447650003802480650001002518650001402528650001902542650001102561650000902572650001802581650002102599650001102620650001302631650000902644651001002653700002302663700002702686700002402713700002802737700002002765700002502785773016602810856008202976852000903058655001203067IND60588957920221117235823.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058895792DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-0505-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez-Orenes, Antonio10aDifferent mechanisms of the metalliferous Zygophyllum fabago shoots and roots to cope with Pb toxicity  ap. 1319-1330.  aLead (Pb) remains classified as a priority pollutant. Zygophyllum fabago is considered an early colonizer of heavy metal-polluted soils under semiarid conditions, but physiological mechanisms underlying this colonizing capacity remain unclear. In order to characterize Z. fabago plants’ performance on Pb-contaminated soils, we evaluated how Pb influenced root and shoot growth, carbon metabolism, and oxidative status. For that, 30-day-old seedlings from one population colonizing a mine tailing (“Mercader”) at Murcia (southeast Spain) were exposed to 500-μM Pb(NO₃)₂ for 1 week. Results showed that this high dose of Pb induced no plant mortality nor senescence, though promoting plant nanism. Besides the efficiency of roots to accumulate Pb, shoots also demonstrate a high efficiency to translocate and accumulate this metal. Pb exposure decreased Zn uptake to the aerial part and reduced net photosynthetic rate (A), RuBisCO activity, chlorophyll, and soluble sugar contents in shoots. Moreover, in shoots, Pb exposure increased the levels of O₂⁻ and decreased antioxidant capacity, culminating with a loss of cell membrane integrity (electrolyte leakage) and increased protein oxidation. Compared to controls, exposed roots had less Mn and Zn levels, and despite the rise in H₂O₂ levels, they were able to modulate non-protein thiols presenting a robust defense capacity. This capacity may support the roots’ ability to maintain cell membrane integrity (electrolyte leakage) with regard to control. Principal component analysis (PCA) contributed to elucidate how this species adjusts physiological mechanisms to cope with Pb toxicity, showing that roots and shoots evolved different antioxidant defenses, which demonstrates the importance of organ specificity in the response of Z. fabago to heavy metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZygophyllum fabago 3aaerial parts 3aantioxidant activity 3acarbon metabolism 3acell membranes 3achlorophyll 3aelectrolytes 3aheavy metals 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alead 3amanganese 3amine tailings 3amortality 3aoxidation 3aphotosynthesis 3apollutants 3aprincipal component analysis 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aroots 3aseedlings 3asemiarid zones 3ashoots 3asoil 3asugar content 3asuperoxide anion 3athiols 3atoxicity 3azinc 3aSpain1 aDias, MariaCeleste1 aFerrer, MaríaÁngeles1 aCalderón, Antonio,1 aMoutinho-Pereira, José1 aCorreia, Carlos1 aSantos, Conceição,0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 Jan., v. 25, no. 2 p.1319-1330dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-0505-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03825naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245012500204300001400329520224700343592002802590650002502618650001502643650002302658650002502681650002202706650002402728650002902752650001202781650001102793650002202804650001002826650001002836650001202846650001102858650001102869650002402880650001402904650001002918650001402928650001002942651001002952653000902962653001902971653001002990653001203000653001003012700001803022700001403040700001803054773009303072856008503165852000903250655001203259IND60557307220221119004235.0180831e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055730722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2016.02.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jinhui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9730-074110aMeasuring treatment costs of typical waste electrical and electronic equipment: A pre-research for Chinese policy making  ap. 36-45.  aWaste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) volume is increasing, worldwide. In 2011, the Chinese government issued new regulations on WEEE recycling and disposal, establishing a WEEE treatment subsidy funded by a levy on producers of electrical and electronic equipment. In order to evaluate WEEE recycling treatment costs and revenue possibilities under the new regulations, and to propose suggestions for cost-effective WEEE management, a comprehensive revenue-expenditure model (REM), were established for this study, including 7 types of costs, 4 types of fees, and one type of revenue. Since TV sets dominated the volume of WEEE treated from 2013 to 2014, with a contribution rate of 87.3%, TV sets were taken as a representative case. Results showed that the treatment cost varied from 46.4RMB/unit to 82.5RMB/unit, with a treatment quantity of 130,000 units to 1,200,000 units per year in China. Collection cost accounted for the largest portion (about 70.0%), while taxes and fees (about 11.0 %) and labor cost (about 7.0 %) contributed less. The average costs for disposal, sales, and taxes had no influence on treatment quantity (TQ). TQ might have an adverse effect on average labor and management costs; while average collection and purchase fees, and financing costs, would vary with purchase price, and the average sales fees and taxes would vary with the sales of dismantled materials and other recycled products. Recycling enterprises could reduce their costs by setting up online and offline collection platforms, cooperating with individual collectors, creating door-to-door collection channels, improving production efficiency and reducing administrative expenditures. The government could provide economic incentives—such as subsidies, low-cost loans, tax cuts and credits—and could also raise public awareness of waste management and environmental protection, in order to capture some of the WEEE currently discarded into the general waste stream. Foreign companies with advanced WEEE utilization technology could invest or participate in this area, producing profits for themselves while helping to develop and implement environmentally friendly and energy-saving technologies applicable to the Chinese market.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acollectors 3acost effectiveness 3aelectronic equipment 3aelectronic wastes 3aenergy conservation 3aenvironmental protection 3afunding 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3alabor 3aloans 3amarkets 3amodels 3aprices 3aprofits and margins 3arecycling 3asales 3asubsidies 3ataxes 3aChina 0aWEEE 0aTreatment cost 0aModel 0aTV sets 0aChina1 aDong, Qingyin1 aLiu, Lili1 aSong, Qingbin0 tWaste management.g2016 Nov., v. 57 p.36-45dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2016.02.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04089naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245016800184300001400352500001500366520236600381592002802747650001002775650001502785650001602800650002802816650001402844650001502858650001102873650001502884650001502899650002802914650002602942650001702968650002502985650001203010653001803022653002403040700003603064700003703100700002403137700002403161700002903185700002403214700003003238700002603268700003203294700002903326773009803355856008503453852000903538655001203547IND60080885420221120153215.0140812e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008088542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2013.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopes, Welber Daniel Zanetti10aEffects of macrocyclic lactones on the reproductive parameters of engorged Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus females detached from experimentally infested cattle  ap. 72-78.  a2019-12-06  aThe present study therefore assessed the deleterious effects of MLs (ivermectin, abamectin, doramectin and moxidectin) on the reproductive parameters of engorged Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus females that naturally detached from experimentally infested cattle in two experiments. The following reproductive parameters of engorged female ticks were analyzed: female weight, egg mass weight, percentage of hatchability, percentage of reduction in oviposition, percentage of reduction in hatchability, reproductive efficiency and percent control/efficacy of formulations with respect to reproductive parameters. In the experiment I, statistical analysis of the data grouped into 5-days intervals revealed that pour-on application of abamectin (500mcg/kg) had significantly (p⩽0.05) reduced engorged female weight, egg mass weight and percent hatchability on days 6–15, 6–20 and 11–20 post-treatment (p. t.) compared to the respective data for detached and pre-selected engorged females in the control group. The abamectin, demonstrated 33.41% of reduction in oviposition, 6.77% in hatchability and abamectin efficacy was of 13.99%. In the experiment II, statistically significant reductions (p⩾0.05) were observed in animals treated subcutaneous with ivermectin (630mcg/kg), doramectin (700mcg/kg) and moxidectin (1000mcg/kg) relative to the control for days 6–40, 6–48 and 6–40 p. t., respectively. Ivermectin reduced hatchability only on days 16–20 p. t., whereas doramectin significantly reduced (p⩽0.05) hatchability on days 6–10 and 16–35 p. t. For moxidectin, deleterious effects on hatchability were observed on days 16–35 p. t. The percent reductions in oviposition of engorged female ticks were 46.31%, 62.17% and 61.02% with ivermectin, doramectin and moxidectin treatments, respectively. The percent efficacy of the formulations on the reproductive parameters of engorged female ticks was 21.22% for ivermectin, 36.03% for doramectin and 35.45% for moxidectin. Among the MLs assessed, doramectin and moxidectin had the highest acaricidal efficacies and the most deleterious effects on the reproductive parameters of engorged R. (B.) microplus females. However, future studies will be necessary to assess the extent to which these effects, along with acaricidal activity, can be used to control the ectoparasite in cattle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aticks 3aivermectin 3aoviposition 3aRhipicephalus microplus 3aabamectin 3adoramectin 3acattle 3amoxidectin 3aegg weight 3areproductive efficiency 3aacaricidal properties 3aparasitology 3astatistical analysis 3afemales 0aRhipicephalus 0aBoophilus microplus1 aTeixeira, Weslen Fabricio Pires1 ade Matos, Lucas Vinicius Shigaki1 aFelippelli, Gustavo1 aCruz, Breno Cayeiro1 aMaciel, Willian Giquelin1 aBuzzulini, Carolina1 aFávero, Flávia Carolina1 aSoares, Vando Edésio1 aOliveira, Gilson Pereira de1 aCosta, Alvimar José da,0 tExperimental parasitology.g2013 Sept., v. 135, no. 1 p.72-78dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2013.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013600168300001800304520126400322592002801586650000801614650001301622650002201635650001101657650001501668650002601683650001101709650001901720650001501739700001801754773008701772856008601859852000901945655001201954IND60084846620221120211142.0141101e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008484662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.10.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRezk, Kamal10aGeometry development of the internal duct system of a heat pump tumble dryer based on fluid mechanic parameters from a CFD software  ap. 1596-1605.  aOne aspect of reducing the energy consumption of a household tumble dryer is to reduce the pressure drop of the circulating air in the internal duct system. It is, however, costly and time consuming to design several prototypes for airflow measurements. In this paper, several fluid mechanic parameters in a partial model of the internal duct system of a tumble dryer have been studied in the CFD software Comsol MultiPhysics. The purpose was to establish a numerically based design process, where the design is conducted based on visual analysis of air velocity and vorticity, and two design criteria. The geometry design was conducted by a CAD-engineer, which was the counterpart of this project. In order to enable a successful design process, it was essential to establish a strong relation between fluid parameters and design criteria in order to share knowledge effectively with the CAD-engineer. Two geometry modifications, based on a standard model, were conducted on the duct. Based on the design criteria, the pressure drop and the non-uniformity coefficient of the outlet airflow, the second modification (Modification 2) represents an improvement as the pressure drop is reduced by 23% and the uniformity at the outflow section is increased by 3%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair flow 3acomputer software 3aenergy 3aheat pumps 3ahousehold consumption 3amodels 3aprocess design 3aprototypes1 aForsberg, Jan0 tApplied energy.g2011 May, v. 88, no. 5 p.1596-1605dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.10.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03786naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003200148245014300180300001800323520178500341592002802126596007302154596007302227596007302300596007302373596007302446596007302519650002802592650002602620650001902646650001202665650002002677650001002697650002602707650001402733650001302747650001402760650001702774650003002791650003702821651001102858700003102869700003202900700002702932700003102959700003402990700002803024773011203052856008303164852000903247655001203256IND60708599020221122060024.0201120e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070859902DNAL7 a10.1007/s00284-020-02060-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Freitas, Stella Buchhorn10aMolecular Characterization of Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Associated with Nosocomial Infection in the Pelotas, RS, Brazil  ap. 2724-2734.  aAcinetobacter calcoaceticus–Acinetobacter baumannii complex (ACB) comprises some opportunistic pathogens associated with infectious outbreaks in hospital settings. A. baumannii is the most relevant species owing to its capacity to develop resistance to the different classes of antimicrobials. The aim of this study was to identify the species, establish the genetic patterns, resistance and biofilm profiles in ACB isolates associated with nosocomial infection in a hospital of Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Twenty-two clinical isolates were characterized at the species level through multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the gyrB and blaOXA₅₁₋ₗᵢₖₑ genes, and the genetic relationship was determined through pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Their antibiotic resistance profiles and carbapenemases synthesis were evaluated following CLSI guidelines. PCR was carried out to evaluate the presence of carbapenemases genes and the isolates were classified for their biofilm-forming ability. All isolates obtained in the study were identified as A. baumannii and 72.7% of the isolates were classified as strong biofilm formers. In the class carbapenems, 95.4% and 77.3% of the isolates were resistant to meropenem and imipenem, respectively. The blaVIM gene was identified in 90.9% of isolates and carbapenemases synthesis were confirmed in 95.4% of the isolates. Fourteen genetic patterns were confirmed through PFGE analyses. The isolates collected within a time gap of 2 years demonstrated a genetic relationship, and the same clone was identified in different departments in the hospital. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of identification and characterization of A. baumannii nosocomial isolates in Pelotas, RS, Brazil.  aPublisher supplied data  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a001cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a001cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aAcinetobacter baumannii 3aantibiotic resistance 3abeta-lactamase 3abiofilm 3across infection 3agenes 3agenetic relationships 3ahospitals 3aimipenem 3ameropenem 3amicrobiology 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3aBrazil1 aAmaral, Suélen Cavalheiro1 aFerreira, Marcos Roberto A.1 aRoloff, Bárbara Couto1 aMoreira, Clóvis, Jr.cJr.1 aConceição, Fabricio Rochedo1 aHartwig, Daiane Drawanz0 tCurrent microbiology.g2020 Oct., v. 77, no. 10 p.2724-2734dSpringer USwJournal:jnl10978x0343-86517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-020-02060-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245012400180300001400304500001500318520098500333592002801318650001401346650001701360650002801377650001501405650001201420650002601432650005201458650002001510650001001530650001601540650001701556650001701573650002601590650002801616653001301644700002501657700003001682700003001712700003401742700002201776700002501798773009801823856008501921852000902006655001202015IND60080885520221120142820.0140812e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008088552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2013.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez-Higuera, Aarón10aIdentification of calcium-transporting ATPases of Entamoeba histolytica and cellular localization of the putative SERCA  ap. 79-86.  a2019-12-06  aCalcium has an important role on signaling of different cellular processes in the protozoa parasite Entamoeba histolytica, including development and pathogenesis. However, the systems that control calcium responses in this parasite are incompletely understood. Calcium-ATPases (Ca²⁺-ATPases) are proteins that play an important role in calcium homeostasis by catalyzing the active efflux of this ion from cytoplasm and are essential to the correct functioning of the cell machinery. Here, we reported the identification of five E. histolytica genes encoding putative Ca²⁺-ATPases, three related to PMCA, and two related to organellar ATPases. RT-PCR assays showed that all those genes are expressed in trophozoites and specific antibodies against the SERCA-like member located this protein in a continuous cytoplasmic network, supporting the hypothesis that it corresponds to the Ca²⁺-ATPase responsible to sequester calcium in the endoplasmic reticulum of this parasite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aparasites 3atrophozoites 3aCa2-transporting ATPase 3aantibodies 3acalcium 3aEntamoeba histolytica 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3aparasitology 3apathogenesis 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 0aproteins1 aSalas-Casas, Andrés1 aCalixto-Gálvez, Mercedes1 aChávez-Munguía, Bibiana1 aPérez-Ishiwara, D.

The studied compounds were 1,2-, 1,3-, 1,4-, 2,3-, 1,8-, 2,6- and 2,7-dicyanonaphthalene. For most of the isomers, the one-electron reduction to the anion radical occurred as a simple, reversible reduction without complications from coupled chemical reactions. However, for 1,3-, 2,3- and 2,7-dicyanonaphthalene, the reduction was affected by a reversible dimerization of the anion radicals. Dimerization equilibrium constants were determined at various temperatures. DFT calculations of the anion radicals of all 10 isomers provided spin densities at ring carbons 1–8. The highest spin density for carbons 1–8 not bearing a cyano group was largest for the three isomers with detectable dimerization. Not only do these calculations suggest the site of dimerization, it was found that the free energy change for dimerization varies in an approximately linear fashion with spin density.  aPublisher supplied data 3adimerization 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3afree radicals 3aisomers 3atemperature1 aEvans, Dennis H.0 tJournal of electroanalytical chemistry.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 660, no. 1 p.91-96dElsevier B.V.x1572-66577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2011.06.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03415naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245013700172520195400309592002802263650001702291650002302308650001302331650001902344650002202363650001102385650001502396650002002411650002102431650001302452653003202465653004502497653004202542653003702584653002802621700002102649700005702670700001602727700002002743700001602763773009102779856009002870852000902960655001202969IND60759551520221120200239.0220606e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075955152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1331902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ze-Jun10aNew methods of top-to-down mixture toxicity prediction: A case study of eliminating of the effects of cosolvent from binary mixtures  aAt present, the toxicity prediction of mixtures mainly focuses on the concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) based on individual toxicants to predict the toxicity of multicomponent mixtures. This process of predicting the toxicity of multicomponent mixtures based on single substances or low component mixtures is called down-to-top method in this study. However, due to the particularity of some toxicants, we have to use the top-to-down idea to obtain or eliminate the toxicity of some components from mixtures. For example, the toxicity of toxicants is obtained from the toxicity of a mixture with, especially toxic, cosolvent added. In the study, two top-to-down methods, the inverse CA (ICA) and inverse IA (IIA) models, were proposed to eliminate the effects of a certain component from multicomponent mixtures. Furthermore, taking the eight binary mixtures consisting of different shapes of cosolvents (isopropyl alcohol (IPA) having hormesis and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) and toxicants (two ionic liquids and two pesticides) as an example, combined with the interaction evaluated by CA and IA model, the influence of different shapes of components on top-to-down toxicity prediction was explored. The results showed that cosolvent IPA having hormesis may cause unpredictable effects, even at low concentrations, and should be used with caution. For DMSO, most of the toxicant's toxicity obtained by ICA and IIA models were almost in accordance with those observed experimentally, which showed that ICA and IIA could effectively eliminate the effects of cosolvent, even if toxic cosolvent, from the mixture. Ultimately, a frame of cosolvent use and toxicity correction for the hydrophobic toxicant were suggested based on the top-to-down toxicity prediction method. The proposed methods improve the existing framework of mixture toxicity prediction and provide a new idea for mixture toxicity evaluation and risk assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3ahormesis 3ahydrophobicity 3aisopropyl alcohol 3amodels 3aprediction 3arisk assessment 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 0aVibrio qinghaiensis sp.-Q67 0aDirect equipartition ray design (EquRay) 0aGlobal concentration additivity (GCA) 0aGlobal response additivity (GRA) 0aLuminescence inhibition1 aZheng, Qiao-Feng1 aLiu, Shu-Shen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2160-97501 aHuang, Peng1 aDing, Ting-Ting1 aXu, Ya-Qian0 tChemosphere.g2022 Feb., v. 289 p.133190-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1331903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03517naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011900171300001400290520205400304592002802358650002902386650000902415650001502424650001302439650001502452650001902467650002002486650001802506650002102524650002102545650001802566650001502584650000902599650001102608650001402619650001702633650001602650650001602666650001302682700002302695700001802718700001702736700001702753700001902770700001802789773009802807856008502905852000902990655001202999IND60080885620221120153246.0140812e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008088562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2013.05.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorris, C. Paul10aVaccination with intestinal tract antigens does not induce protective immunity in a permissive model of filariasis  ap. 87-95.  aAntigens obtained from the intestinal tract of filarial nematodes have been proposed as potential safe and effective vaccine candidates. Because they may be ‘hidden’ from the immune response during natural infection, yet accessible by antibodies induced by vaccination, intestinal antigens may have a low potential for eliciting allergic responses when vaccinating previously infected individuals. Despite prior promising data, vaccination with intestinal antigens has yet to be tested in a permissive model of filariasis. In this study we investigated the efficacy of vaccination with filarial intestinal antigens in the permissive Litomosoides sigmodontis BALB/c model of filariasis, and we evaluated the extent to which these antigens are recognized by the immune system during and after infection. Infected BALB/c mice developed lower IgG antibody responses to soluble intestinal antigens (GutAg) than to soluble antigens of whole worms (LsAg). Similarly, GutAg induced less proliferation and less production of IL-4 and IFNγ from splenocytes of infected mice than LsAg. In contrast to these differences, active infection resulted in equivalent levels of circulating GutAg-specific IgE and LsAg-specific IgE levels. Consistent with this, basophil activation, as assessed by flow cytometric staining of intracellular basophil IL-4 expression, was equivalent in response to GutAg and LsAg. Vaccination with GutAg adsorbed to CpG/alum induced GutAg specific IgG1 and IgG2A production, with GutAg specific IgG titers greater than 5-fold higher than those measured in previously infected animals. Despite this response to GutAg vaccination, vaccinated mice harbored similar parasite burdens 8weeks post infection when compared to non-vaccinated controls. These studies demonstrate that soluble antigens obtained from the intestinal tracts of L. sigmodontis have some qualities of ‘hidden’ antigens, but they still sensitize mice to allergic reactions and fail to protect against future infection when given as a vaccine adsorbed to alum/CPG.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitomosoides sigmodontis 3aalum 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3afilariasis 3aflow cytometry 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3aimmunoglobulin E 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainterleukin-4 3aintestines 3amice 3amodels 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3asplenocytes 3avaccination 3avaccines1 aTorrero, Marina N.1 aLarson, David1 aEvans, Holly1 aShi, Yinghui1 aCox, Rachel T.1 aMitre, Edward0 tExperimental parasitology.g2013 Sept., v. 135, no. 1 p.87-95dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2013.05.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245011300164300001800277520145400295592002801749650002301777650001101800650001901811650001501830650002201845650001601867650001201883650001501895650001701910650001501927651001201942651001201954651001301966651001801979651001301997651001402010651001902024651001102043651001702054700002402071700002002095700002002115700002002135700002302155700002102178700002402199700002002223700002102243773012402264856007502388852000902463655001202472IND60536273320221117223136.0160806e20150303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053627332DNAL7 a10.1021/es505389y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHopkins, Kristina G.10aAssessment of Regional Variation in Streamflow Responses to Urbanization and the Persistence of Physiography  ap. 2724-2732.  aAquatic ecosystems are sensitive to the modification of hydrologic regimes, experiencing declines in stream health as the streamflow regime is altered during urbanization. This study uses streamflow records to quantify the type and magnitude of hydrologic changes across urbanization gradients in nine U.S. cities (Atlanta, GA, Baltimore, MD, Boston, MA, Detroit, MI, Raleigh, NC, St. Paul, MN, Pittsburgh, PA, Phoenix, AZ, and Portland, OR) in two physiographic settings. Results indicate similar development trajectories among urbanization gradients, but heterogeneity in the type and magnitude of hydrologic responses to this apparently uniform urban pattern. Similar urban patterns did not confer similar hydrologic function. Study watersheds in landscapes with level slopes and high soil permeability had less frequent high-flow events, longer high-flow durations, lower flashiness response, and lower flow maxima compared to similarly developed watersheds in landscape with steep slopes and low soil permeability. Our results suggest that physical characteristics associated with level topography and high water-storage capacity buffer the severity of hydrologic changes associated with urbanization. Urbanization overlain upon a diverse set of physical templates creates multiple pathways toward hydrologic impairment; therefore, we caution against the use of the urban homogenization framework in examining geophysically dominated processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic ecosystems 3acities 3ahomogenization 3alandscapes 3asoil permeability 3astream flow 3astreams 3atopography 3aurbanization 3awatersheds 3aArizona 3aGeorgia 3aMaryland 3aMassachusetts 3aMichigan 3aMinnesota 3aNorth Carolina 3aOregon 3aPennsylvania1 aMorse, Nathaniel B.1 aBain, Daniel J.1 aBettez, Neil D.1 aGrimm, Nancy B.1 aMorse, Jennifer L.1 aPalta, Monica M.1 aShuster, William D.1 aBratt, Anika R.1 aSuchy, Amanda K.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 Mar. 03, v. 49, no. 5 p.2724-2732dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes505389y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100001800188245007000206300001100276500001100287506007600298520089200374592002801266506003701294650001501331650001101346650001301357650002301370650001801393650001801411650001201429650002401441650001801465650001101483650001501494650002001509650001501529650000901544650001101553651001301564700001801577700002301595700002101618773010601639856008201745852000901827655001201836IND60575028020221207091328.0220831e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057502802DNAL7 aPMC54293072pmcid7 a285004012pmid7 a10.1007/s13205-017-0645-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaqib, Shaima10aSources of β-galactosidase and its applications in food industry  ap. 79.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe enzyme β-galactosidases have been isolated from various sources such as bacteria, fungi, yeast, vegetables, and recombinant sources. This enzyme holds importance due to its wide applications in food industries to manufacture lactose-hydrolyzed products for lactose-intolerant people and the formation of glycosylated products. Absorption of undigested lactose in small intestine requires the activity of this enzyme; hence, the deficiency of this enzyme leads to lactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance affects around 70% of world’s adult population, while the prevalence rate of lactose intolerance is 60% in Pakistan. β-Galactosidases are not only used to manufacture lactose-free products but also employed to treat whey, and used in prebiotics. This review focuses on various sources of β-galactosidase and highlights the importance of β-galactosidases in food industries.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3aadults 3abacteria 3abeta-galactosidase 3afood industry 3aglycosylation 3alactose 3alactose intolerance 3amanufacturing 3apeople 3aprebiotics 3asmall intestine 3avegetables 3awhey 3ayeasts 3aPakistan1 aAkram, Attiya1 aHalim, Sobia Ahsan1 aTassaduq, Raazia0 t3 Biotech.g2017 May, v. 7, no. 1 p.79-79dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-017-0645-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245014500167300001600312520085900328592002801187650002301215650005201238650001601290650001601306650002901322653002901351653001601380653001101396653002301407653002601430700001801456700002101474700002401495700002001519700002001539700002001559700002301579700002301602700002301625773012501648856008301773852000901856655001201865IND60741659320221122033525.0210904e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074165932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.06.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorrea, Yubexi10aSARS-CoV-2 spike protein removes lipids from model membranes and interferes with the capacity of high density lipoprotein to exchange lipids  ap. 732-739.  aCholesterol has been shown to affect the extent of coronavirus binding and fusion to cellular membranes. The severity of Covid-19 infection is also known to be correlated with lipid disorders. Furthermore, the levels of both serum cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) decrease with Covid-19 severity, with normal levels resuming once the infection has passed. Here we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein interferes with the function of lipoproteins, and that this is dependent on cholesterol. In particular, the ability of HDL to exchange lipids from model cellular membranes is altered when co-incubated with the spike protein. Additionally, the S protein removes lipids and cholesterol from model membranes. We propose that the S protein affects HDL function by removing lipids from it and remodelling its composition/structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3ahigh density lipoprotein 0aSARS-CoV-2 spike protein 0aCholesterol 0aLipids 0aNeutron reflection 0aInfrared spectroscopy1 aWaldie, Sarah1 aThépaut, Michel1 aMicciulla, Samantha1 aMoulin, Martine1 aFieschi, Franck1 aPichler, Harald1 aTrevor Forsyth, V.1 aHaertlein, Michael1 aCárdenas, Marité0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 602 p.732-739dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.06.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01190naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245012700161300002000288520021700308592002800525650001200553650002300565650002300588650002400611650002200635700002400657773013600681856007400817852000900891655001200900IND60661063220221123032538.0190827e20150825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066106322DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc05432j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagamoto, Midori10aStereoselective hydroacylation of bicyclic alkenes with 2-hydroxybenzaldehydes catalyzed by hydroxoiridium/diene complexes  ap. 13791-13794.  aA hydroxoiridium complex coordinated with 1,5-cyclooctadiene efficiently catalyzed the hydroacylation of bicyclic alkenes with 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde and its derivatives in high yields with high stereoselectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkenes 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3ahydroxybenzaldehyde 3astereoselectivity1 aNishimura, Takahiro0 tChemical communications.g2015 Aug. 25, v. 51, no. 72 p.13791-13794dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5cc05432j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03304naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001700158245011500175300001600290520201200306592002802318650001502346650001602361650001802377650001402395650001202409650002002421650001002441653002802451653002802479653000802507653002602515653003102541700001502572700002202587700001902609700002002628700002402648773010802672856009302780852000902873655001202882IND50068435320221118151639.0190318e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006843532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2013.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGharibi, Sh.10aEffect of phosphodiesterase type 3 inhibitor on nuclear maturation and in vitro development of ovine oocytes  ap. 302-312.  aThe present study aims to investigate if prematuration culture (PMC) of ovine oocytes in the presence of a phosphodiesterase type 3 (PDE3) inhibitor cilostamide can improve the shortcomings of conventional in vitro maturation (IVM) system. Therefore, a two-step culture system consisting of 22 hours culture in the presence of 1, 10, and 20 μM cilostamide (PMC medium), followed by 22 hours culture in maturation medium, was designed. The effect of cilostamide on gap junction communications and nuclear status was studied. The variables assessed were chromosome organization, spindle pattern, polar body extrusion, and embryonic development. According to the results, inhibition of PDE3 could not permanently block nuclear maturation in ovine oocytes but it delayed the process of nuclear maturation. Elevation of intra-oocyte cAMP concentration could inhibit cumulus cells expansion and maintain gap junction communications between oocyte and cumulus cells. Deletion of cilostamide and refreshing maturation medium after 22 hours culture revealed that cumulus cells were completely expanded. The inhibitory effect induced by 1 μM cilostamide was reversible, and it increased the number of mature oocytes with aligned chromosomes and normal spindle. However, the inhibitory effects of 10 and 20 μM cilostamide was not fully reversible and was associated with deleterious effects on chromosome organization and spindle pattern. Investigation of embryonic development via parthenogenetic activation and in vitro fertilization revealed that the blastocyst rate of oocytes that were prematured with 1 μM cilostamide was not significantly different from oocytes that underwent conventional IVM but it was significantly reduced in oocytes that were prematured with 10 and 20 μM cilostamide. Our results provide the evidence that reduced cAMP via PDE3 is not the only mechanism that controls the progress of nuclear maturation in sheep oocytes, and that alternative or additional mechanisms may also exist.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablastocyst 3achromosomes 3aembryogenesis 3aextrusion 3aoocytes 3aparthenogenesis 3asheep 0aTwo-step culture system 0aConventional IVM system 0aPMC 0aEmbryonic development 0aGap junction communication1 aHajian, M.1 aOstadhosseini, S.1 aHosseini, S.M.1 aForouzanfar, M.1 aNasr-Esfahani, M.H.0 tTheriogenology.g2013 Sept. 01, v. 80, no. 4 p.302-312dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2013.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03229naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245021700168520149100385592002801876650000801904650001301912650001301925650002201938650001401960650002001974650001001994650002202004650001802026650000902044650002702053650001402080651002202094653002002116653001302136653002302149653001802172653003102190653003202221700002002253700001802273700001702291700001602308700001602324700002102340700002102361700002102382700002102403700001602424700001402440773011502454856008502569852000902654655001202663IND60734133720221117190208.0220606e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073413372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2021.1048592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraima, Kamil10aMolecular analysis of cryptosporidiosis cases in Western Australia in 2019 and 2020 supports the occurrence of two swimming pool associated outbreaks and reveals the emergence of a rare C. hominis IbA12G3 subtype  aCryptosporidium is an important protozoan parasite and due to its resistance to chlorine is a major cause of swimming pool-associated gastroenteritis outbreaks. The present study combined contact tracing and molecular techniques to analyse cryptosporidiosis cases and outbreaks in Western Australia in 2019 and 2020. In the 2019 outbreak, subtyping at the 60 kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene identified 89.0% (16/18) of samples were caused by the C. hominis IdA15G1 subtype. Amplicon next generation sequencing (NGS) at the gp60 locus identified five C. hominis IdA15G1 subtype samples that also had C. hominis IdA14 subtype DNA, while multi locus sequence typing (MLST) analysis on a subset (n = 14) of C. hominis samples identified three IdA15G1 samples with a 6 bp insertion at the end of the trinucleotide repeat region of the cp47 gene. In 2020, 88.0% (73/83) of samples typed were caused by the relatively rare C. hominis subtype IbA12G3. Four mixed infections were observed by NGS with three IdA15G1/ IdA14 mixtures and one C. parvum IIaA18G3R1 sample mixed with IIaA16G3R1. No genetic diversity using MLST was detected. Epidemiological and molecular data indicates that the outbreaks in 2019 and 2020 were each potentially from swimming pool point sources and a new C. hominis subtype IbA12G3 is emerging in Australia. The findings of the present study are important for understanding the introduction and transmission of rare Cryptosporidium subtypes to vulnerable populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aProtozoa 3achlorine 3acryptosporidiosis 3aevolution 3agastroenteritis 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3aglycoproteins 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparasites 3aWestern Australia 0aCryptosporidium 0aOutbreak 0aC. hominis IbA12G3 0aSwimming pool 0aNext-generation sequencing 0aMulti locus sequence typing1 aZahedi, Alireza1 aEgan, Siobhon1 aAusten, Jill1 aXiao, Lihua1 aFeng, Yaoyu1 aWitham, Benjamin1 aPingault, Nevada1 aPerera, Shalinie1 aOskam, Charlotte1 aReid, Simon1 aRyan, Una0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2021 Aug., v. 92 p.104859-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2021.1048593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245006800170300001600238520115400254592002801408650002601436650002801462650001501490650001301505650001501518650002201533650002501555650000901580650001801589650001001607650001801617650000901635650002501644650001701669650001401686650001401700650001501714650001301729650002901742650001601771650002401787650001301811700002101824700001601845700002201861700002801883700002001911700001901931700002501950773009901975856008502074852000902159655001202168IND60080886020221122000937.0140812e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008088602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2013.06.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarpio, Yamila10aAkirins in sea lice: First steps towards a deeper understanding  ap. 188-199.  aSea lice (Copepoda, Caligidae) are the most widely distributed marine pathogens in the salmon industry. Vaccination could be an environmentally friendly alternative for sea lice control; however, research on the development of such vaccines is still at an early stage of development. Recent results have suggested that subolesin/akirin/my32 are good candidate antigens for the control of arthropod infestations, including sea lice, but background knowledge about these genes in crustaceans is limited. Herein, we characterize the my32 gene/protein from two important sea lice species, Caligus rogercresseyi and Lepeophtheirus salmonis, based on cDNA sequence isolation, phylogenetic relationships, three dimensional structure prediction and expression analysis. The results show that these genes/proteins have the main characteristics of akirins from invertebrates. In addition, immunization with purified recombinant my32 from L. salmonis elicited a specific antibody response in mice and fish. These results provide an improvement to our current knowledge about my32 proteins and their potential use as vaccine candidates against sea lice in fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaligus rogercresseyi 3aLepeophtheirus salmonis 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3aarthropods 3acomplementary DNA 3adevelopmental stages 3afish 3afish industry 3agenes 3alouse control 3amice 3anucleotide sequences 3aparasitology 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3aprediction 3aproteins 3aresearch and development 3avaccination 3avaccine development 3avaccines1 aGarcía, Claudia1 aPons, Tirso1 aHaussmann, Denise1 aRodríguez-Ramos, Tania1 aBasabe, Liliana1 aAcosta, Jannel1 aEstrada, Mario Pablo0 tExperimental parasitology.g2013 Oct., v. 135, no. 2 p.188-199dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2013.06.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245014100177300001300318520097400331592002801305650002401333650001301357650001001370650002301380650001501403650001901418650002301437650001801460650001301478650002101491650002701512650001501539650001901554653002401573653003601597653002801633653002801661653003001689700002001719700002501739700002501764700001801789700001901807700002201826773009701848856008601945852000902031655001202040IND60656198220221118014717.0191017e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065619822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2019.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmid, Maximilian T.10aUtilization of desugarized sugar beet molasses for the production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) by halophilic Bacillus megaterium uyuni S29  ap. 9-15.  aDesugarized sugar beet molasses is a high-salinity side stream after fractionation of beet molasses by chromatography. It could be demonstrated that this by-product of the sugar industry is a suitable substrate for the production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) with the halophilic bacterium Bacillus megaterium uyuni S29.Cell dry mass concentrations of up to 16.7 g L−1 with a P(3HB) content of 0.6 g g−1 were achieved after only 24 h of batch cultivation. Utilization of a desugarized sugar beet molasses medium resulted in a two- to threefold increase in biomass production compared to a conventional mineral based medium. Depending on the extraction method, the molecular mass (Mn) of the P(3HB) varied between 119 kDa and 722 kDa.The high P(3HB) productivity of 0.42 g L−1 h−1 during batch experiments combined with desugarized sugar beet molasses as inexpensive substrate suggests a simple and robust process for cost effective P(3HB) production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus megaterium 3abacteria 3abeets 3abiomass production 3abyproducts 3achromatography 3acost effectiveness 3afractionation 3amolasses 3amolecular weight 3apoly-3-hydroxybutyrate 3asugar beet 3asugar industry 0aBacillus megaterium 0aDesugarized sugar beet molasses 0aPoly(3-hydroxybutyrate) 0aHalophilic fermentation 0aSugar industry by-product1 aSong, Hyunjeong1 aRaschbauer, Michaela1 aEmerstorfer, Florian1 aOmann, Markus1 aStelzer, Franz1 aNeureiter, Markus0 tProcess biochemistry.g2019 Nov., v. 86 p.9-15dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2019.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003500149245011500184520187400299592002802173650001102201650001702212650001302229650003302242650001502275650001402290650001302304650001902317650002302336650001502359651001102374653002002385653001402405653002502419653001402444700002702458700002602485700003702511700003402548773010802582856008402690852000902774655001202783IND60753107520221118042927.0220103e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075310752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsase.2021.1006462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Conceição de Sousa, Maria10aSpatio-temporal dynamics of land use changes of an intense anthropized basin in the Brazilian semi-arid region  aThe temporal dynamics of land use and land cover (LULC) changes affect natural resources and biodiversity on a local and global scale. The negative impacts of LULC changes can be enhanced in arid and semi-arid areas, where vegetations are more sensitive to changes due to limited water availability. The present study aimed to explore the detailed spatio-temporal LULC changes in the Jaguaribe River basin, Ceará state, Brazil. Specifically, we aimed to identify the dynamics of LULC changes from 1985 to 2018, including the main LULC conversations and the sub-basins that presented the most intense dynamics. For this, we used annual LULC maps generated by the national Mapbiomas project. The LULC conversions were determined through cross-tabulation analysis and pixel comparison analysis. Our results indicate that in the last three decades there was a significant conversion of the natural vegetation Caatinga (Arboreal and Herbaceous) to agricultural and livestock areas, showing that the anthropic activities are the main factors behind the historical landscape changes in the Jaguaribe River basin. The Middle Jaguaribe and the Lower Jaguaribe sub-basins were the most affected by LULC changes during the study period. While the LULC changes in Middle Jaguaribe sub-basin reveal that this area has been impacted by anthropic interference with similar areas of pasture and the caatinga class since 1985, the Lower Jaguaribe sub-basin was continuously impacted mainly by the expansion of the annual and perennial culture and reduction of natural vegetation areas. The Lower Jaguaribe sub-basin had a higher percentage of altered areas, LULC classes per pixel and LULC changes during the study period. The spatio-temporal analysis presented can orient planning actions to conserve natural resources and preserve the biodiversity in this semi-arid region of Brazil.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3abiodiversity 3acaatinga 3aland use and land cover maps 3alandscapes 3alivestock 3apastures 3asemiarid zones 3atemporal variation 3awatersheds 3aBrazil 0aJaguaribe river 0aMapBiomas 0aLand use transitions 0aSemi-arid1 aVeloso, Gustavo Vieira1 aGomes, Lucas Carvalho1 aFernandes-Filho, Elpidio Inácio1 aOliveira, Teógenes Senna de,0 tRemote sensing applications.g2021 Nov., v. 24 p.100646-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23329x2352-93857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2021.1006463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04054naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245010600210520225700316592002802573650003502601650001602636650001702652650001202669650001102681650002302692650001802715650001502733650001502748650001002763650002302773650000902796650001702805650001302822650001502835650001402850650001302864651001102877653001602888653001502904653003602919653001602955653002302971700002802994700002403022700002603046700006403072700003203136700006403168700006503232773010003297856008203397852000903479655001203488IND60734133920221117190214.0210708e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073413392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hal.2021.1020042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamos, Tanise Klein1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3232-658810aSaxitoxins from the freshwater cyanobacterium Raphidiopsis raciborskii can contaminate marine mussels  aRaphidiopsis raciborskii (formerly Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii) is a freshwater cyanobacterium potentially producing saxitoxins (STX) and cylindrospermopsin. Its ecophysiological versatility enables it to form blooms in the most diverse types of environments, from tropical to temperate, and from relatively pristine to polluted. In Peri Lake, located in the subtropical south of Brazil, growing populations of STX-producing R. raciborskii have been detected since 1994, posing risks to the use of its waters that supply a population of about 100,000 inhabitants. Despite the existence of a monitoring system for the presence and toxicity of cyanobacteria in Peri Lake water, no assessment has been made in the coastal region, downstream of outflowing lake water, thereby potentially making available a toxic biomass to natural and cultivated shellfish populations in the salt water ecosystem. To address this problem, the present study evaluated environmental variables and STX concentration by profiling the outflowing waters between Peri Lake and the adjacent coastal zone. Laboratory experiments were carried out with three strains of R. raciborskii in order to confirm the effect of salinity on STX production and verify if Perna Perna mussels fed with R. raciborskii cultures would absorb and accumulate STX. Results showed that environmental concentrations of STX reach high levels (up to 6.31 µg L⁻¹ STX eq.), especially in the warmer months, reaching the coastal zone. In laboratory tests, it was found that the strains tolerate salinities between 4 and 6 and that salinity influences the production of STX. In addition, mussels fed with R. raciborskii effectively absorb and accumulate STX, even in typically marine salinities (22 to 30), suggesting that R. raciborskii biomass remains available and toxic despite salinity shock. These results draw attention to the ecological and health risk associated with R. raciborskii blooms, both in the lake environment and in the adjacent marine environment, calling attention to the need to improve the monitoring and management systems for water and shellfish toxicity in the region of interest, as well as other places where toxic cyanobacteria of limnic origin can reach the coastal zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCylindrospermopsis raciborskii 3aPerna perna 3aRaphidiopsis 3abiomass 3acoasts 3acylindrospermopsin 3aecophysiology 3aecosystems 3afreshwater 3alakes 3amarine environment 3arisk 3asaline water 3asalinity 3asaxitoxins 3ashellfish 3atoxicity 3aBrazil 0aCyanotoxins 0aSaxitoxins 0aMonitoring harmful algal blooms 0aPerna perna 0aCylindrospermopsis1 aCosta, Luiza Dy Fonseca1 aYunes, João Sarkis1 aResgalla Jr., Charrid1 aBarufi, José Bonomi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5332-95531 aBastos, Eduardo de Oliveira1 aHorta, Paulo Antunes1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7699-75891 aRörig, Leonardo Rubi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2244-92230 tHarmful algae.g2021 Mar., v. 103 p.102004-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3946763x1568-98837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2021.1020043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245012100168300001400289520146600303592002801769650001501797650001901812650003801831650001501869650002101884650001101905650001901916650001101935650001901946650002501965650002501990700002102015700001902036700002002055700002302075700005902098773010602157856008102263852000902344655001202353IND60634527320221119110402.0190606e20190715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063452732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2019.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThege, Fredrik I.10aanti-EGFR capture mitigates EMT- and chemoresistance-associated heterogeneity in a resistance-profiling CTC platform  ap. 26-33.  aCapture and analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) holds promise for diagnosing and guiding treatment of pancreatic cancer. To accurately monitor disease progression, capture platforms must be robust to processes that increase the phenotypic heterogeneity of CTCs. Most CTC-analysis technologies rely on the recognition of epithelial-specific markers for capture and identification, in particular the epithelial cell-adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and cytokeratin. As the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the acquisition of chemoresistance are both associated with loss of epithelial markers and characteristics, the effect of these processes on the expression of commonly used CTC markers, specifically EpCAM, EGFR and cytokeratin, requires further exploration. To determine this effect, we developed an in vitro model of EMT and acquired gemcitabine resistance in human pancreatic cancer cell lines. Using this model, we show that EMT-induction and acquired chemoresistance decrease EpCAM expression and microfluidic anti-EpCAM capture performance. Furthermore, we find that EGFR capture is more robust to these processes. By measuring the expression of known mediators of chemoresistance in captured cells using automated imaging and image processing, we demonstrate the ability to resistance-profile cells on-chip. We expect that this approach will allow for the development of improved non-invasive biomarkers of pancreatic cancer progression.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3adisease course 3aepithelial cell adhesion molecule 3aepithelium 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3apancreatic neoplasms 3aphenotypic variation1 aGruber, Conor N.1 aCardle, Ian I.1 aCong, Sophie H.1 aLannin, Timothy B.1 aKirby, Brian J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7479-97380 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2019 July 15, v. 577 p.26-33dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2019.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02225naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245013500177300001600312520117600328592002801504650002301532650002101555650001501576650001701591650002201608700002201630700002601652773011501678856008601793990002301879852000901902655001201911IND60113185620221122215609.0141111e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011318562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jelechem.2011.06.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMažeikienė, Regina10aElectrocatalytic reduction of hydrogen peroxide at Prussian blue modified electrode: An in situ Raman spectroelectrochemical study  ap. 140-146.  aElectrodeposited layers of Prussian blue (PB) and electrocatalytic reduction of hydrogen peroxide at electrodes, modified with these layers have been studied with in situ Raman spectroelectrochemical technique. Characteristic Raman features have been observed and attributed to reversible electrochemical transition between the oxidized (PB) and reduced (Prussian white, PW) forms of the modifier. It has been shown that, during the cathodic reduction of hydrogen peroxide, PW layer turns partially into its oxidized form PB even at electrode potentials corresponding to the reduced form of a modifier. The ratio of PB/PW within the modifier layer has been shown to depend on peroxide concentration, indicating that electrocatalysis proceeds within the modifier layer rather than at an outer modifier/electrolyte interface. As opposite, electrooxidation of ascorbate does not affect in situ Raman spectra and thus proceeds most probably at an outer interface. The kinetics of PB decomposition during electrocatalytic reduction of hydrogen peroxide has been studied by in situ Raman spectroscopy, and the corresponding first-order reaction rate constant has been obtained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3ahydrogen peroxide1 aNiaura, Gediminas1 aMalinauskas, Albertas0 tJournal of electroanalytical chemistry.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 660, no. 1 p.140-146dElsevier B.V.x1572-66577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2011.06.0223Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02968naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245010200175300001800277520161700295592002801912596002401940596002001964596003201984650002702016650002702043650002402070650002302094650001402117650001502131650001202146650001502158700003202173700003002205700002802235700001702263700003202280700003002312773011202342856008302454852000902537655001202546IND60708599620221122060254.0201120e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070859962DNAL7 a10.1007/s00284-020-02076-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez-Ortiz, Ana C.10aProbiotic Bacterium and Microalga Interaction on Rearing Kumamoto Oyster Crassostrea sikamea Spat  ap. 2758-2765.  aThis study assessed in vitro interaction between Bacillus bacteria and microalgae and their posterior in vivo effect on rearing Kumamoto oyster Crassostrea sikamea. The probiotic strains Bacillus licheniformis (MAt32), B. subtilis (MAt43) and B. subtilis (GAtB1) were individually inoculated in triplicate into 250 mL flasks containing 1 × 10⁴ colony forming units (CFU) mL⁻¹ of bacteria and 4.5 × 10⁴ cell mL⁻¹ of microalgae (Isochrysis galbana or Chaetoceros calcitrans) to evaluate their growth during a 7-day culture. Single cultures of microalgae or bacilli served as control. Additionally, C. sikamea spat was treated for 28 days with four single/combined bacillus treatments in triplicate at a concentration of 1 × 10⁶ CFU mL⁻¹ as follows: (a) control, without treatments; (b) combination of two antibiotics (10 mg L⁻¹); (c) B. licheniformis; (d) B. subtilis; (e) B. subtilis subtilis and (f) mixed bacilli. The results showed a significantly (P < 0.05) increased growth of Bacillus strains co-cultured with microalgae, while the growth of I. galbana co-cultured with bacteria was not reduced significantly (P > 0.05) compared with the control group. C. sikamea spat treated with Bacillus showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher growth and survival than the control group. In this study, C. calcitrans microalgae were susceptible to the presence of probiotic bacteria. Nonetheless, this reduction in microalgal growth observed in vitro increased growth and survival of C. sikamea spat exposed to probiotic bacteria when compared to spat without probiotics.  aPublisher supplied data  a243532cSEP-CONACYT  a209357cCONACYT  a199788cPROINNOVA–CONACYT 3aBacillus licheniformis 3aChaetoceros calcitrans 3aCrassostrea sikamea 3aIsochrysis galbana 3acoculture 3amicroalgae 3aoysters 3aprobiotics1 aMazón-Suástegui, José M.1 adel C.

In this study, Ni-based catalysts were made by mechanically mixing NiO and char particles at various ratios. Catalytic performance of the Ni/char catalysts was studied and compared with performance of wood char and coal char without Ni for syngas cleanup in a laboratory-scale updraft biomass gasifier. Reforming parameters investigated were reaction temperature (650–850°C), NiO loading (5–20% of the weight of char support), and gas residence time (0.1–1.2s). The Ni/coalchar and Ni/woodchar catalysts removed more than 97% of tars in syngas at 800°C reforming temperature, 15% NiO loading, and 0.3s gas residence time. Analysis of syngas composition indicated that concentrations of H₂ and CO in syngas significantly. Furthermore, performance of the Ni/coalchar catalyst was continuously tested for 8h. There was slight deactivation of the catalyst in the early stage of tar/syngas reforming; however, the catalyst was able to stabilize soon after. It was concluded that chars especially coal char can be an effective and inexpensive support of NiO for biomass gasification tar removal and syngas conditioning.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acoal 3aequipment 3agasification 3ahydrogen 3amixing 3anickel 3apipes 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature 3awood1 aYuan, Wenqiao1 aJi, Wei0 tApplied energy.g2011 May, v. 88, no. 5 p.1656-1663dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.11.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02154naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245008300164300001600247520113300263592002801396653002801424653002101452653001501473653001001488653001301498653001801511700002401529700003701553700002201590773013101612856007601743852000901819655001201828IND60125204820221119120843.0151102e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012520482DNAL7 a10.1647/2010-001.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin-Jurado, Olga10aBispectral Index Reveals Death-feigning Behavior in a Red Kite (Milvus milvus)  ap. 132-135.  aRed kites (Milvus milvus) are birds of prey known to feign death in the presence of humans. An adult wild red kite was anesthetized with isoflurane for coelioscopy. During surgery, heart rate and respiratory rate ranged from 240 to 260 beats per minute and from 16 to 28 breaths rates per minute, respectively. Pupil and corneal reflexes remained present, and body temperature was maintained at 40.4°°C (104.7°°F). Suppression ratio was 0 during the anesthetic episode. The bispectral index was 44 immediately after intubation, ranged from 44 to 57 during maintenance of anesthesia, and was 59 at the moment of extubation. The index increased to 85 while the kite remained immobile, which was suggestive of feigning death in sternal recumbency. Once the bird was perched upright, it immediately kept the upright position, which confirmed the correspondence of the bispectral index value (85) with a fully conscious patient. Although behavioral or cardiorespiratory variables remained unchanged, the degree of hypnosis was indicated by the bispectral index, which anticipated a possible sudden awakening episode of this bird.  aPublisher supplied data 0adeath-feigning behavior 0abispectral index 0aisoflurane 0aavian 0ared kite 0aMilvus milvus1 aSimova-Curd, Stefka1 aBettschart-Wolfensberger, Regula1 aHatt, Jean-Michel0 tJournal of avian medicine and surgery.g2011 June, v. 25, no. 2 p.132-135dAssociation of Avian Veterinariansx1082-67427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1647%2F2010-001.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04248naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245014000206520239300346592002802739650002602767650003502793650001902828650002802847650001602875650001902891650001402910650001502924650001902939650001602958650001802974650002802992650001303020650001903033650001503052650002003067650001303087653001803100653001503118653003103133653002403164653002003188653001603208700001803224700001803242700003103260700006003291700001803351700002303369700002103392700006603413773010003479856008203579852000903661655001203670IND60734134120221117190141.0210708e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073413412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hal.2021.1020282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHouliez, Emilie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1670-677210aPhysiological changes induced by sodium chloride stress in Aphanizomenon gracile, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and Dolichospermum sp.  aDue to anthropogenic activities, associated with climate change, many freshwater ecosystems are expected to experience an increase in salinity. This phenomenon is predicted to favor the development and expansion of freshwater cyanobacteria towards brackish waters due to their transfer along the estuarine freshwater-marine continuum. Since freshwater cyanobacteria are known to produce toxins, this represents a serious threat for animal and human health. Saxitoxins (STXs) are classified among the most powerful cyanotoxins. It becomes thus critical to evaluate the capacity of cyanobacteria producing STXs to face variations in salinity and to better understand the physiological consequences of sodium chloride (NaCl) exposure, in particular on their toxicity. Laboratory experiments were conducted on three filamentous cyanobacteria species isolated from brackish (Dolichospermum sp.) and fresh waters (Aphanizomenon gracile and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii) to determine how salinity variations affect their growth, photosynthetic activity, pigment composition, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), synthesis of compatible solutes and STXs intracellular quotas. Salinity tolerance was found to be species-specific. Dolichospermum sp. was more resistant to salinity variations than A. gracile and C. raciborskii. NaCl variations reduced growth in all species. In A. gracile, carotenoids content was dose-dependently reduced by NaCl. By contrast, in C. raciborskii and Dolichospermum sp., variations in carotenoids content did not show obvious relationships with NaCl concentration. While in Dolichospermum sp. phycocyanin and phycoerythrin increased within the first 24 h exposure to NaCl, in both A. gracile and C. raciborskii, these pigments decreased proportionally to NaCl concentration. Low changes in salinity did not impact STXs production in A. gracile and C. raciborskii while higher increase in salinity could modify the toxin profile and content of C. raciborskii (intracellular STX decreased while dc-GTX2 increased). In estuaries, A. gracile and C. raciborskii would not be able to survive beyond the oligohaline area (i.e. salinity > 5). Conversely, in part due to its ability to accumulate compatible solutes, Dolichospermum sp. has the potential to face consequent salinity variations and to survive in the polyhaline area (at least up to salinity = 24).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphanizomenon gracile 3aCylindrospermopsis raciborskii 3aDolichospermum 3aanimal and human health 3acarotenoids 3aclimate change 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3aphotosynthesis 3aphycocyanin 3aphycoerythrin 3areactive oxygen species 3asalinity 3asalt tolerance 3asaxitoxins 3asodium chloride 3atoxicity 0aCyanobacteria 0aSaxitoxins 0aParalytic shellfish toxins 0aHarmful algal bloom 0aSodium chloride 0aCyanotoxins1 aBriand, Enora1 aMalo, Florent1 aRovillon, Georges-Augustin1 aHervé, Fabienne1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5485-76111 aRobert, Elise1 aMarchand, Laetitia1 aZykwinska, Agata1 aCaruana, Amandine M.N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4763-89950 tHarmful algae.g2021 Mar., v. 103 p.102028-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3946763x1568-98837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2021.1020283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02080naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008100165300001600246520088700262592002801149650003101177650001901208650002101227650002101248650002501269650001101294650002101305650001401326650001901340650001401359650001601373700002401389700001701413700001301430700001701443700002301460773009701483856008101580852000901661655001201670IND60438843820221116164801.0151024e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043884382DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-006-0294-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNisha, Mathew10aIn vitro screening of medicinal plant extracts for macrofilaricidal activity  ap. 575-579.  aMethanolic extracts of 20 medicinal plants were screened at 1–10 mg/ml for in vitro macrofilaricidal activity by worm motility assay against adult Setaria digitata, the cattle filarial worm.

However, the optimal timing of enteral tube placement and feeding commencement is unknown. This review aims to compare the outcomes for patients with HNC undergoing curative intent radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) receiving either prophylactic percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (pPEG) tube placement/feeding or reactive enteral nutrition (rEN). A literature search was conducted in March 2020 across PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients (≥18 years) with HNC who had received either pPEG or rEN were included. Outcomes examined were weight change, nutritional status, body mass index, treatment interruptions, quality of life (QoL), disease-free survival and overall survival. Study quality and certainty of evidence were assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-bias Tool for Randomized Trials Version 2 and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system, respectively. Five studies (three RCTs) (n = 298) were included and definitions of pPEG and rEN were heterogenous. pPEG was associated with a clinically important reduction in short-term critical weight loss (>10% weight loss), and significantly improved short-term QoL in patients with HNC. The timing of nutrition support commencement had no effect on all other outcomes. The overall certainty of evidence was ‘moderate’ for: nutritional status; treatment interruptions; short-term QoL; disease-free survival; and ‘low’ for all other outcomes. Patients with HNC undergoing RT or CRT receiving pPEG tube feeding/placement were less likely to experience short-term critical weight loss and have improved short-term QoL compared to rEN. Further well-designed RCTs with consistent definitions of tube feeding protocols and the use of validated tools to evaluate nutritional status, will assist to increase the certainty of evidence and confirm the beneficial effects observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3aclinical nutrition 3ahead and neck neoplasms 3anutritional status 3aquality of life 3aradiotherapy 3asystematic review 3atube feeding 3aweight loss 0aHead and neck cancer 0aProphylactic gastrostomy 0aNasogastric tube1 aYe, Xiaodan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6260-872X1 aVan Den Brande, Jonathan1 aWai Ray Mak, Tsz1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7951-33671 aBrown, Teresa1 aFindlay, Merran1 aBauer, Judy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3830-51470 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2021 Dec., v. 46 p.87-98dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.09.7243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03801naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245015000177300001600327520185600343592002802199650002402227650002502251650001402276650002202290650001502312650001502327650001302342650001502355650001002370650002102380650001502401650001902416650003002435650003002465650003502495650003402530650003702564650002002601650000902621650002202630650001802652650003102670650001602701651001102717653002302728653002802751653001102779653000902790653001202799653001402811700001902825700002002844700002002864700002102884700002102905700001902926700001902945773007702964856008903041852000903130655001203139IND60545405320221122032629.0170709e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054540532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.11.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeníšek, Martin10aDioxins and dioxin-like compounds in composts and digestates from European countries as determined by the in vitro bioassay and chemical analysis  ap. 168-175.  aAerobic composting and anaerobic digestion plays an important role in reduction of organic waste by transforming the waste into humus, which is an excellent soil conditioner. However, applications of chemical-contaminated composts on soils may have unwanted consequences such as accumulation of persistent compounds and their transfer into food chains. The present study investigated burden of composts and digestates collected in 16 European countries (88 samples) by the compounds causing dioxin-like effects as determined by use of an in vitro transactivation assay to quantify total concentrations of aryl hydrocarbon receptor-(AhR) mediated potency. Measured concentrations of 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibeno-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD) equivalents (TEQbio) were compared to concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and selected chlorinated compounds, including polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans (PCDD/Fs), co-planar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), indicator PCB congeners and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). Median concentrations of TEQbio (dioxin-like compounds) determined by the in vitro assay in crude extracts of various types of composts ranged from 0.05 to 1.2 with a maximum 8.22μg (TEQbio)kg−1 dry mass. Potencies were mostly associated with less persistent compounds such as PAHs because treatment with sulfuric acid removed bioactivity from most samples. The pan-European investigation of contamination by organic contaminants showed generally good quality of the composts, the majority of which were in compliance with conservative limits applied in some countries. Results demonstrate performance and added value of rapid, inexpensive, effect-based monitoring, and points out the need to derive corresponding effect-based trigger values for the risk assessment of complex contaminated matrices such as composts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abioactive properties 3abioassays 3achemical analysis 3acompliance 3acomposting 3acomposts 3afood chain 3ahumus 3ain vitro studies 3amonitoring 3aorganic wastes 3aorganochlorine pesticides 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3apolychlorinated dibenzofurans 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arisk assessment 3asoil 3asoil conditioners 3asulfuric acid 3atranscriptional activation 3avalue added 3aEurope 0aBiodetection tools 0aEffect-based monitoring 0aDioxin 0aPAHs 0aCompost 0aDigestate1 aKukučka, Petr1 aMariani, Giulio1 aSuurkuusk, Gert1 aGawlik, Bernd M.1 aLocoro, Giovanni1 aGiesy, John P.1 aBláha, Luděk0 tChemosphere.g2015 Mar., v. 122 p.168-175dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.11.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03640naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245017700165520188700342592002802229650001502257650001902272650001102291650001902302650002902321650001702350653001502367653001902382653003502401653001902436653004902455653000802504653000802512653000902520653000702529653000902536653000802545653000802553653000802561653000802569653000702577653000802584653000802592653000802600653000802608653000902616653001502625653000802640653000802648700001602656700001802672700002202690700005302712700005602765773011002821856008602931852000903017655001203026IND60734134320221123022521.0210527e20210530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073413432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1226962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemir, Z.10aQuantification of beta-lactam antibiotics cefuroxime and flucloxacillin in human synovial fluid, using ultra-performance convergence chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  aTotal hip- and knee arthroplasty generally result in successful outcomes. A small percentage of patients however suffer from periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) postoperatively, often with severe consequences. The standard treatment of chronic PJIs consists of a staged arthroplasty exchange during which antibiotic therapy plays a crucial role. For successful antibiotic treatment, adequate concentrations at the infection site are a prerequisite. Regarding the treatment of PJIs, knowledge is lacking with respect to the relationship between administered dosages and plasma- and infection site concentrations of the antibiotics. To gain insight into the antibiotic exposure at the infection site, validated analytical methods for analysis of the antibiotics in matrices at the site of the PJI are essential. We describe a validated ultra-performance convergence chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPC²-MS/MS) method for quantification of the beta-lactam antibiotics cefuroxime and flucloxacillin in synovial fluid. This method was successfully validated for antibiotic quantification in synovial fluids according to the EMA guidelines and consists of a simple sample preparation. For both antibiotics, the accuracy and precision were within requirements (RSD < 15%). In addition, matrix effects and recovery were within the range of 80–120%. Carry over was less than 20% and stability in −80 °C was at least 2 months for standards and quality controls. The limits of quantification were adequate (1–100 mg/L) to cover potential cefuroxime and flucloxacillin concentrations in synovial fluid as described in literature (r > 0.995). The method has a run time of 4.5 min and 50 μL synovial fluid is needed and the validated method will be applied during a PK/PD study to determine the exposure of the study antibiotics in synovial fluid at the site of PJIs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acefuroxime 3achromatography 3ahumans 3asynovial fluid 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atherapeutics 0aCefuroxime 0aFlucloxacillin 0aPeriprosthetic joint infection 0aSynovial fluid 0aUltra-performance convergence chromatography 0aESI 0aEMA 0aHPLC 0aIS 0aLLOQ 0aLOD 0aLOQ 0aMRM 0aPJI 0aQC 0aQCH 0aQCL 0aQCM 0aRSD 0aULOQ 0aUPC2-MS/MS 0aTHA 0aTKA1 aBahmany, S.1 aBethlehem, C.1 avan Oldenrijk, J.1 aBos, P.K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9285-23201 aKoch, B.C.P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1202-36430 tJournal of chromatography.g2021 May 30, v. 1173 p.122696-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1226963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01860naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005900155245011400214500002200328520067600350592002801026650002401054650001501078650001201093650001101105650001801116650001801134650001701152650001401169653004301183653001501226700005801241700002201299773007801321856009001399852000901489655001201498IND60656198720221118014729.0190809e20190729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065619872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2019.1055622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbliz, Dilmurat1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7074-035210aFlow of quasi-spherical nanoparticles in liquid composite molding processes.

The influence of the bimodal dispersion size characteristic of NPs and the dual-scale characteristic of the preform porous structure on the viscosity of the suspension, the permeability of the preform, and the impregnation behavior is investigated. The modeling and simulation helps not only to predict the impregnation behavior of the NP-modified matrix systems, but also to inversely study the critical particle size that may lead to cake filtration.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite materials 3afiltration 3aliquids 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3apermeability 3aviscosity 0aLiquid composite molding: Nanoparticle 0aSimulation1 aBerg, David C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8484-35631 aZiegmann, Gerhard0 tComposites.g2019 July 29, dElsevier LtdwJournal:12034x1359-835X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2019.1055623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010700169300001300276520118300289592002801472650001401500650001501514650001801529650002001547650001901567650002201586650001401608650002401622653002301646653000901669653001801678653001501696653001701711700002201728773012101750856008201871852000901953655001201962IND60634527820221119110240.0190809e20190730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063452782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2019.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlatnich, Jaye M.10aNOD-like receptors and inflammasomes: A review of their canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways  ap. 4-14.  aThe NOD-like receptor (NLR) family of proteins is a group of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) known to mediate the initial innate immune response to cellular injury and stress. The NLRP proteins represent a fourteen-member subset of the NLR family that contains an N-terminal pyrin domain. Some NLRs are known to form multi-protein complexes known as inflammasomes. Inflammasomes consist of an NLR, the adaptor protein ASC, and the effector molecule pro-caspase-1. Once activated, these inflammasomes facilitate the cleavage and activation of caspase-1, which in turn mediates the cleavage of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 into their active and secreted forms. Activated caspase-1 also drives the cleavage of gasdermin D, which triggers an inflammatory form of cell death known as pyroptosis. Several NLRs are also known to possess non-canonical, inflammasome-independent functions, regulating a variety of signaling pathways. In this review, a thorough overview of both inflammasome-dependent and -independent NLR signaling will be presented, with highlights from the field as well as promising future directions and postulates based on the known science.  aPublisher supplied data 3acaspase-1 3acell death 3ainflammasomes 3ainnate immunity 3ainterleukin-18 3ainterleukin-1beta 3areceptors 3asignal transduction 0aNOD-Like receptors 0aNLRs 0aInflammasomes 0aPyroptosis 0aInflammation1 aMuruve, Daniel A.0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2019 July 30, v. 670 p.4-14dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2019.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01824naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245005500209300002000264506007600284520057400360592002800934506003700962650002300999650002301022650002101045653001901066653001301085653001601098700001801114700002301132700003101155773017601186856007901362852000901441655001201450IND60172345020221207073957.0150602e20121030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017234502DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12117841092doi7 aPMC34978272pmcid7 a230122412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmallenburg, Frank10aVacancy-stabilized crystalline order in hard cubes  ap. 17886-17890.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe examine the effect of vacancies on the phase behavior and structure of systems consisting of hard cubes using event-driven molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations.

Remarkably, we find that vacancies increase the positional order in the system.

We used RNA-seq to characterize the hepatic transcriptional response of mature male brown trout exposed for 4 days to 1.7, 15.3, and 225.9 μg/L linuron. We identified a striking decrease in the expression of transcripts encoding the majority of enzymes forming the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. We also measured a very significant decrease in total hepatic cholesterol in fish exposed to 225.9 μg/L linuron and a negative correlation between total cholesterol and linuron treatment concentration. We hypothesize that inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis may result from the disruption of androgen signaling by linuron. Additionally, there was increased expression of a number of transcripts involved in cellular stress responses, including cyp1a (up to 560-fold), molecular chaperones, and antioxidant enzymes. We found some evidence of similar patterns of transcriptional change in fish exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration of linuron, and further research should investigate the potential for adverse effects to occur following chronic environmental exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo trutta 3aadverse effects 3aantioxidants 3abiosynthesis 3acholesterol 3adrinking water 3aenvironmental exposure 3aenzymes 3afish 3alinuron 3amales 3amammals 3amolecular chaperones 3asequence analysis 3astress response 3asurface water 3atoxicity 3atranscription (genetics)1 aPerry, Mandy

Therefore, exploring highly efficient and thermal stability photothermal conversion materials is highly essential and urgent. In this work, we develop a three-dimensional (3D) oxygen vacancy-rich WO₃ with ‘‘nanorod array grown on nanosheet array” unique architecture decorated on Ni foam (denoted as WO₃₋ₓ/NF) through a simple and effective hydrothermal method followed by an annealing route, which is applied as light-absorbing material. The 3D hierarchical porous unique structure of the WO₃₋ₓ/NF evaporator can supply a channel steam escaping and enhance the light trapping due to the multi-scattering effect, and the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effects of WO₃₋ₓ also contribute to increase the light absorption in the full solar spectrum. The as-prepared WO₃₋ₓ/NF evaporator reveals a high solar absorption (95%), an evaporation rate of 1.50 kg m⁻² h⁻¹ under one sun illumination, and a light-to-heat conversion efficiency of about 88%, as well as stable salt-resistance performance. The water purification results show that WO₃₋ₓ/NF evaporator has a significant effect on seawater desalination without significant salt accumulation and purification of heavy metal wastewater. Furthermore, the first-principles calculations reveal that WO₃ with oxygen vacancies has a narrower bandgap, which is more conducive to absorb solar energy from the whole spectrum. This work can provide a new avenue toward the design of other high photothermal conversion system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adesalination 3aevaporation rate 3afoams 3aheavy metals 3ahot water treatment 3alighting 3ananorods 3ananosheets 3aoxygen 3aseawater 3asolar energy 3asteam 3asurface plasmon resonance 3athermal stability 3awastewater 3awater purification 3awater shortages 0aWO3 with oxygen vacancies 0aNi foam 0aNarrow bandgap 0aSolar steam generation 0aWater purification1 aGao, Shenyue1 aWang, Gang1 aWang, Hui1 aBai, Jinbo1 aMa, Shenghua1 aWang, Beibei0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 602 p.767-777dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.06.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03273naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245010800207300001600315506010400331506007600435520142300511592002801934506003701962650001201999650001902011650002302030650002502053650002402078650002302102650001602125650001902141650002402160650000902184650001702193651001902210651001202229653002802241653002202269653001502291653002602306700006102332700001602393700002102409700002602430700005802456700003102514773010402545856008502649852000902734655001202743IND60753108120221207102125.0220412e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075310812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.09.7402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGenua, Flavia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3724-712210aAssociation of circulating short chain fatty acid levels with colorectal adenomas and colorectal cancer  ap. 297-304.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aShort chain fatty acid (SCFAs) are bacterially derived metabolites suggested to have protective roles against colorectal cancer (CRC) development. However, there is sparse evidence from epidemiological studies in this context. Here, we assessed whether circulating SCFA concentrations varied in patients with colorectal adenomas (CRA) and CRC. Levels of seven SCFAs were extracted from plasma samples and determined by gas chromatography for 213 individuals from Ireland and the Czech Republic (CRC, n = 84; CRA, n = 66; controls, n = 63). In the Irish CRA/CRC cohort, only levels of 2-MethylButyric acid were significantly higher in cancers compared to the adenoma and control groups (p-values = 0.016 and 0.043). Using regression analysis, we observed that levels of Acetic and Propionic acid were associated with an increased CRC risk in the Czech cohort (Odd Ratio (OR): 1.02; 95% Confidence interval (CI): 1.00–1.03; OR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.05–1.59, respectively), while i-Valeric and Valeric acid levels were associated with a decreased cancer risk (OR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.86–0.99; OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.44–1.00). In the Irish cohort, levels of SCFAs were not associated with CRC risk. The association with colorectal neoplasia varied between the studied SCFAs. Future studies need to confirm these findings and address the mechanism of how these acids may promote or prevent colorectal carcinogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenoma 3acarcinogenesis 3aclinical nutrition 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aconfidence interval 3agas chromatography 3ametabolites 3apropionic acid 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3avaleric acid 3aCzech Republic 3aIreland 0aShort chain fatty acids 0aColorectal cancer 0aMicrobiome 0aGut barrier integrity1 aMirković, Bojana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2128-67791 aMullee, Amy1 aLevý, Miroslav,1 aGallagher, William M.1 aVodicka, Pavel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2376-12431 aHughes, D.

Studies have shown that artemether (ART) exhibits effects against juveniles of Schistosoma mansoni Liberian and Puerto Rican strains, Schistosoma japonicum and Schistosoma haematobium. Aiming to assess the in vivo activity of single oral dose of ART against early juvenile stages of S. mansoni Egyptian strain, this study was established. Mice were treated with ART (400mg/kg) at two time points evenly spaced over the period of larval development (7 and 21days post-infection; pi), and a third treatment point (day 49 pi) was included to elucidate when susceptibility decreases. Administration of ART on day 7 pi reduced the total worm burden by 85.94%. The greatest reductions were seen when treatment was given on day 21 pi, with total and female worm burden reductions of 91.52% and 90.57%, respectively, and cessation of oviposition. Similar dose given on day 49 pi reduced total worm burden by 55.17% and female worm burden by 66.51%. Moreover, it induced significant reduction in the tissue egg load and significant alterations in the oogram pattern with decreased immature eggs and increased dead eggs. Antipathological activities were evident in significant reductions in granulomata count and diameter. In conclusion, ART exhibits major in vivo schistosomicidal effects against the early larval migratory stages of S. mansoni Egyptian strain, mainly the 21-day old schistosomula, hence preventing disease progression and morbidity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchistosoma haematobium 3aSchistosoma japonicum 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3adisease course 3adrugs 3aeggs 3ajuveniles 3alarval development 3amice 3amigratory behavior 3amorbidity 3aoviposition 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3apraziquantel 3aschistosomiasis 3aschistosomula1 aTaman, Amira1 aEl-Malky, Mohamed1 aAzab, Manar S.1 aEl-Hawary, Amira K.1 aEl-Tantawy, Dina A.0 tExperimental parasitology.g2013 Oct., v. 135, no. 2 p.240-245dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2013.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245014500164300001600309520105800325592002801383650001501411650002001426650001701446650002101463650002201484650001201506650001501518650001301533650001401546650001001560653002501570653003101595653002201626653001101648653001701659700001401676700001901690700001701709700001501726700001501741700001601756700001701772700001601789773008901805856008501894852000901979655001201988IND60603215820221119162609.0180713e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060321582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.08.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Yi10aConjugated polyelectrolyte-stabilized silver nanoparticles coupled with pyrene derivative for ultrasensitive fluorescent detection of iodide  ap. 678-683.  aA new sensing system is developed for selective and ultrasensitive detection of iodide based on the inner filter effect (IFE) between conjugated polyelectrolyte-stabilized silver nanoparticles (P1–AgNPs) and 4-oxo-4-(pyren-1-ylmethoxy) butanoic acid (probe 1). P1–AgNPs are designed to be capable of functioning as a composite light-absorber. Meanwhile, probe 1 is selected as an ideal fluorophore because its emission spectrum can perfectly overlap with the absorption band of P1–AgNPs. The intense fluorescence of probe 1 quenched by P1–AgNPs can be efficiently recovered after adding H2O2 and I⁻ via the oxidation-etching and regeneration of P1–AgNPs. Under the optimum conditions, this facile IFE-based approach allows the sensitive and selective determination of I⁻ in tap water, iodized salt and urine with the detection limit as low as 0.3nM (S/N=3). Interestingly, the regenerated AgNPs is in smaller size and well-dispersed perhaps due to the particular role of P1 as a polymer localizer containing pyridinyl and sulfonate groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aiodides 3ananosilver 3apolymers 3atap water 3aurine 0aSilver nanoparticles 0aConjugated polyelectrolyte 0aPyrene derivative 0aIodide 0aFluorescence1 aZhang, Ye1 aHuang, Hongmei1 aZhang, Youyu1 aDu, Beilei1 aChen, Fang1 aZheng, Qiao1 aHe, Xiaoxiao1 aWang, Kemin0 tTalanta.g2015 Jan., v. 131 p.678-683dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.08.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005800155245008900213520135300302592002801655650001101683650001401694650002301708650001901731650001401750650001401764650001001778650001301788650001501801650002501816653003301841653001401874653002801888653001401916653003201930653003001962700006901992700001902061700007402080700001502154700002602169773009102195856009002286852000902376655001202385IND60759552720221120200052.0220606e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075955272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1332082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIssaka, Eliasu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2516-876110aAdvanced catalytic ozonation for degradation of pharmaceutical pollutants―A review  aVarious chemical treatment techniques are involved in removing refractory organic compounds from water and wastewater using the oxidation reaction of hydroxyl radicals (•OH). The use of catalysts in advanced catalytic ozonation is likely to improve the decomposition of molecular ozone to generate highly active free radicals that facilitate the rapid and efficient mineralization and degradation of numerous organics. For the degradation of toxic organic pollutants in wastewater, the advanced catalytic ozonation process has been widely applied in recent years. Low utilization efficiency of ozone and ineffective mineralization of organic contaminants by ozone can be remedied with advanced catalytic ozonation. Advanced catalytic ozonation has gained popularity because of these merits. However, homogeneous catalytic ozonation has the disadvantage of producing secondary contaminants from the addition of metallic ions. Heterogeneous catalytic ozonation can overcome this drawback by utilizing metals, metallic oxides, and carbon materials as a catalyst of efficacy and stability. This review discusses various aspects of catalytic ozonation in wastewater treatment of pharmaceutical pollutants, application of catalytic ozonation process in typical wastewater, and prospects in advancing the techniques in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3achemical treatment 3amineralization 3aoxidation 3aozonation 3aozone 3atoxicity 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aRecalcitrant pharmaceuticals 0aOzonation 0aHeterogeneous catalysis 0aOxidation 0aAdvanced oxidation reaction 0aEnvironmental remediation1 aAMU-Darko, Jesse Nii-Okai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1083-35971 aYakubu, Salome1 aFapohunda, Funmilayo Omotoyosi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0867-20261 aAli, Nisar1 aVēlāyutan̲, T.

Herein, we investigate the capability of using metagenomic and metaproteomic saliva profiles to distinguish between Control (C), OSCC without active lesion (L0), and OSCC with active lesion (L1) patients. The results show that there are significantly distinct taxonomies and functional changes in L1 patients compared to C and L0 patients, suggesting compositional modulation of the oral microbiome, as the relative abundances of Centipeda, Veillonella, and Gemella suggested by metagenomics are correlated with tumor size, clinical stage, and active lesion. Metagenomics results also demonstrated that poor overall patient survival is associated with a higher relative abundance of Stenophotromonas, Staphylococcus, Centipeda, Selenomonas, Alloscordovia, and Acitenobacter. Finally, compositional and functional differences in the saliva content by metaproteomics analysis can distinguish healthy individuals from OSCC patients. In summary, our study suggests that oral microbiota and their protein abundance have potential diagnosis and prognosis value for oral cancer patients. Further studies are necessary to understand the role of uniquely detected metaproteins in the microbiota of healthy and OSCC patients as well as the crosstalk between saliva host proteins and the oral microbiome present in OSCC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGemella 3aSelenomonas 3aStaphylococcus 3aVeillonella 3ahomeostasis 3ametagenomics 3amicrobiome 3amicroorganisms 3amouth neoplasms 3apatients 3aprognosis 3asaliva 3asquamous cell carcinoma 0aSaliva 0aMouth neoplasms 0aOral microbiome 0aMass spectrometry 0aMetagenomics 0aDiagnosis 0aPrognosis1 aNeves, Leandro X.1 aTrino, Luciana D.1 aCarnielli, Carolina M.1 aLopes, Ariane F.B.1 aYokoo, Sami1 aPauletti, Bianca A.1 aDomingues, Romênia R.1 aSá, Jamile O.1 aPersinoti, Gabriella1 aPaixão, Douglas A.A.1 aRivera, César,1 ade Sá Patroni, Fabio M.1 aTommazetto, Geizecler1 aSantos-Silva, Alan R.1 aLopes, Márcio A.1 aCastro, Gilberto de,1 aBrandão, Thaís B.1 aPrado-Ribeiro, Ana Carolina1 aSquina, Fabio M.1 aTelles, Guilherme P.1 aPaes Leme, Adriana F.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2021 Aug., v. 1869, no. 8 p.140659-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12097x1570-96397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2021.1406593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245012200172520163900294592002801933650001601961650001401977650002301991650002002014650001102034650001202045650001502057650002202072650001502094650003102109650001202140650001302152650002002165650001802185650001102203650001402214653001402228700001302242700001802255700005502273700001202328700005602340773009102396856009002487852000902577655001202586IND60759552820221120200035.0220124e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075955282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1332092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaobo10aFly ash and H2O2 assisted hydrothermal carbonization for improving the nitrogen and sulfur removal from sewage sludge  aIn this study, fly ash and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) assisted hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) was used to improve the removal efficiency of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) from sewage sludge (SS). The removal rate and distribution of N and S in hydrochar were evaluated, and properties of the aqueous phase were analyzed to illustrate the N and S transformation mechanism during fly ash and H₂O₂ assisted HTC treatment of SS. The results suggested that during HTC process assisted by fly ash (10% of raw SS), dehydration, decarboxylation and hydrolysis of SS were strengthened due to the catalysis effect. The N and S removal were promoted marginally. For hydrochar achieved from HTC process with H₂O₂ addition, the N and S removal were improved slightly due to the biopolymer oxidization by ‧OH released from H₂O₂ decomposition. While for HTC treatment with fly ash and H₂O₂ supplementation, a positive synergistic effect on N and S removal was observed. The N and S removal obtained from fly ash (10% of raw SS) and H₂O₂ (48 g/L) assisted HTC increased to 81.71% and 62.83%, respectively, from those of 69.53% and 49.92% in control group. N and S removal mechanism analysis suggested that hydroxyl radicals (‧OH) produced by H₂O₂ decomposition will destroy SS structure, and the biopolymers such as polysaccharides and proteins will be decomposed to release N and S into the liquid residue. In addition, the fly ash acts as the catalyst will decrease the energy need for denification and desulfartion. Consequently, N and S removal efficiency was enhanced by fly ash and H₂O₂ assisted HTC treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adecarboxylation 3aenergy 3afly ash 3ahydrochars 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrothermal carbonization 3aliquids 3anitrogen 3apolysaccharides 3asewage sludge 3asulfur 3asynergism 0aHydrochar1 aShen, Yu1 aLiu, Xuecheng1 aMa, Tengfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5592-95441 aWu, Jin1 aQi, Gaoxiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3175-66470 tChemosphere.g2022 Mar., v. 290 p.133209-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1332093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01820naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245015200156300002000308520058800328592002800916650002300944650002000967650002800987650001901015650000901034650001401043650001401057650001501071700001701086700001901103700002101122700001301143700001501156700001701171700001601188773013501204856007401339852000901413655001201422IND60661064420221123032612.0190827e20151006xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066106442DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc05481h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Qi-Long10aDivalent metal ions modulated strong frustrated M(ii)–Fe(iii)₃O (M = Fe, Mn, Mg) chains with metamagnetism only in a mixed valence iron complex  ap. 15336-15339.  aLinking magnetically frustrated triangular FeIII3O units by divalent metal ions (Mᴵᴵ = Feᴵᴵ for 1, Mnᴵᴵ for 2) gives isostructural 1D spin chains.

The regulatory pathways essential for sustaining the self-renewal of thyroid cancer stem cells remain largely unknown. Glutamate signaling regulates the self-renewal ability of stem cells. In the present study, we found that the level of glutamate was higher in CD133+ thyroid cancer cells than in CD133- thyroid cancer cells. The transcriptional level of glutamate aspartate transporter SLC1A3 was high in CD133+ thyroid cancer cells. Activation of NF-κB signaling by CD133 was responsible for SLC1A3 high transcription level in CD133+ thyroid cancer cells. Knock down of SLC1A3 significantly reduced the level of glutamate and inhibited the self-renewal activity and tumorigenicity of CD133+ thyroid cancer cells. Overexpression of SLC1A3 rescued the negative effect of CD133 knockdown on the self-renewal capability of CD133+ thyroid cancer cells. Taken together, CD133 promotes the self-renewal capacity of CD133+ thyroid cancer cells at least partly through activation of SLC1A3 expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaspartic acid 3aglutamic acid 3aneoplasm cells 3astem cells 3athyroid neoplasms 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aThyroid cancer 0aCancer stem cells 0aSelf-renewal 0aCD133 0aSLC1A31 aWang, Zhenglin1 aLiu, Wei1 aAi, Zhilong0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2019 Mar. 26, v. 511, no. 1 p.87-91dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.02.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03337naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011200167520174600279592002802025650001402053650002602067650002002093650001702113650003502130650001102165650001502176650000902191650002202200650001602222650001202238650001502250651001202265653001602277653002602293653002702319653003602346653001202382700001902394700002302413700002102436700002202457700002002479700001802499700002502517700001702542700002102559700001902580773010202599856008502701852000902786655001202795IND60734135020221123022532.0210610e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073413502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.1013002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe, Hung Van12aA new approach of deep neural computing for spatial prediction of wildfire danger at tropical climate areas  aWildfire is an environmental hazard that has both local and global effects, causing economic losses and various severe environmental problems. Due to the adverse effects of climate changes and anthropogenic activities, wildfire is anticipated more frequent and extreme; therefore, new and more efficient tools for forest fire prevention and control are essential. This study proposes a new deep neural computing approach for spatial prediction of wildfire in a tropical climate area. For this purpose, deep neural computing (Deep-NC) with a structure of 3 hidden layers was proposed. The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function was adopted to infer wildfire dangers from the input factors. To search and optimize the weights of the model, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), and Adadelta optimizers were employed. Also, this study has established a Geographic Information System (GIS) database for Gia Lai province (Vietnam) to train and verify the newly developed deep computing approach. The twelve ignition factors, namely, slope, aspect, elevation, curvature, land use, NVDI, NDWI, NDMI, temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and rainfall, have been used to characterize the study area with respect to forest fire susceptibility. According to experimental results, the Adam optimized Deep-NC model delivered the highest predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.894, Kappa = 0.63). Accordingly, this model has been employed to establish a forest fire susceptibility map for Gia Lai province. The proposed Deep-NC model and the newly constructed forest fire susceptibility map can help local authorities in land use planning and hazard mitigation/prevention.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3aenvironmental hazards 3afire prevention 3aforest fires 3ageographic information systems 3amodels 3aprediction 3arain 3arelative humidity 3atemperature 3atropics 3awind speed 3aVietnam 0aForest fire 0aDeep neural computing 0aOptimization algorithm 0aGeographical information system 0aGia Lai1 aHoang, Duc Anh1 aTran, Chuyen Trung1 aNguyen, Phi Quoc1 aTran, Van Hai Thi1 aHoang, Nhat Duc1 aAmiri, Mahdis1 aNgo, Thao Phuong Thi1 aNhu, Ha Viet1 aHoang, Thong Van1 aTien Bui, Dieu0 tEcological informatics.g2021 July, v. 63 p.101300-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2190x1574-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.1013003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245011300162300002000275520088900295592002801184650001501212650001101227650001601238650001501254650001101269650001301280650002101293650001101314650001901325650001501344650001701359653003601376653002601412653004601438653002801484653003001512700001401542700001401556700001401570700001701584700001401601700001501615700005801630700005601688773014201744856007801886852000901964655001201973IND60743284720221121194507.0210707e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074328472DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c042782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Guobao10aFacile Synthesis of P-Doped Carbon Nanosheets as Janus Electrodes of Advanced Potassium-Ion Hybrid Capacitor  ap. 29511-29521.  aPotassium-ion hybrid capacitors (PIHCs) shrewdly integrate the merits of the high energy density of battery-type anode and the high power density of capacitor-type cathode, promising prospects for potential application in a diversity of fields.

Microalgae anaerobic digestion is a key unit process that integrates efficiency and beneficially into the production of microalgae derived biofuels. Anaerobic digestion culminating in methane fermentation improves the economic viability of microalgae liquid biofuel production and presents an opportunity for power generation from wastewater derived microalgae. However the anaerobic digestion of microalgae biomass is not straight forward due to several technical restraints including low concentration of digestible biodegradable substrate, recalcitrant substrate constituents, cell wall degradability, low carbon to nitrogen ratio, ammonia toxicity and effects from salinity and associated metal ions.Current production methods for liquid biofuel production from microalgae produce approximately 60–70% residual biomass that is currently a byproduct. Anaerobic digestion provides biogas, but it can also provide essential nutrient recovery from lipid extracted microalgae biomass. The biogas produced from the anaerobic digestion process can be used to generate onsite electrical power or thermal heat to offset biomass processing and extraction processes. When both of these processes are integrated and operated simultaneously, the benefits to microalgae biofuel production and wastewater treatment derived energy production are increased significantly. To consider the integration of anaerobic digestion into a commercial-scale integrated microalgae production and biofuel refinery facility or wastewater treatment plant we present a review of the literature, the current state of the art and future directions for research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae culture 3aammonia 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiodegradability 3abiogas 3abiomass 3abyproducts 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acell walls 3aeconomic sustainability 3aelectric power 3aenergy 3afermentation 3afuel production 3aheat 3alipids 3amethane 3amicroalgae 3apower generation 3asalinity 3atoxicity 3aunit process 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aMicroalgae 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aNutrient recovery 0aMethane biogas 0aBiofuel1 aLewis, D.M.1 aGreen, F.B.0 tAlgal research.g2014 July, v. 5 p.204-214dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2014.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03516naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245011900169300001600288520157600304592002801880596006501908650001901973650001901992650001902011650001802030650001902048650002102067650002902088650001902117650001202136650001902148650002302167650001302190650001202203650002202215650001102237650001302248650001702261650001902278650002702297650001202324650001002336650002002346650001702366650001002383651000902393653001502402653002002417653002102437653002402458700002302482700002202505700002202527700002202549700002502571700001802596700003302614773011902647856007902766852000902845655001202854IND60674352920221118114634.0191025e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067435292DNAL7 a10.1093/treephys/tpy1162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDulamsuren, Choimaa10aHydraulic architecture and vulnerability to drought-induced embolism in southern boreal tree species of Inner Asia  ap. 463-473.  aThe branch xylem of six important Inner Asian southern boreal forest trees was studied for wood-anatomical and hydraulic traits in order to infer the species’ drought tolerance from embolism resistance, potential hydraulic conductivity, mean conduit diameters and conduit density. The only studied angiosperm tree, Betula pendula Roth, was much more sensitive to cavitation than all five conifers (evergreen or summer-green), even when using 88% loss of conductivity (P₈₈) in birch, but 50% (P₅₀) in the conifers as critical thresholds. This suggests that pioneer birch forests, which have widely replaced the conifer climax forests after anthropogenic disturbance (e.g., logging, man-made fire), are more vulnerable to climate warming-induced drought than the original conifer forests. In contrast to expectation, the generally more drought-exposed light taiga species (Larix sibirica Ledeb., Pinus sylvestris L.) did not have consistently lower P₅₀ and P₈₈ values than the dark taiga conifers, suggesting that other drought survival traits are equally important. Among the dark-taiga species, only Pinus sibirica Du Tour, but not Abies sibirica Ledeb. and Picea obovata Ledeb., had relatively high P₅₀ values indicating higher vulnerability. In the light-taiga forest, P. sylvestris revealed lower embolism resistance than L. sibirica. In the face of rapid climate warming and drying in Inner Asia, the drought survival strategies of southern boreal tree species deserve further intensive study, which should include other drought survival traits.  aPublisher supplied data  cVolkswagen Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001663 3aAbies sibirica 3aBetula pendula 3aLarix sibirica 3aPicea obovata 3aPinus sibirica 3aPinus sylvestris 3aanthropogenic activities 3aboreal forests 3aclimate 3aclimax forests 3aconiferous forests 3aconifers 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3adrying 3aembolism 3aforest trees 3aglobal warming 3ahydraulic conductivity 3alogging 3ataiga 3atree physiology 3awood anatomy 3axylem 3aAsia 0acavitation 0aconduit density 0aconduit diameter 0aembolism resistance1 aAbilova, Sholpan B1 aBektayeva, Madina1 aEldarov, Mahammad1 aSchuldt, Bernhard1 aLeuschner, Christoph1 aHauck, Markus1 aMencuccini, M.,q(Maurizio),0 tTree physiology.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 39, no. 3 p.463-473dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl41003x1758-44697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpy1163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006500153245005000218520151700268592002801785650001901813650002801832650001101860650001601871650002101887650001901908650002601927650001401953650001101967650002501978653001802003653001502021653001602036653001302052653001502065700002502080700002602105700002602131773011002157856008802267852000902355655001202364IND60714124120221122183221.0201209e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071412412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.1053892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartzikos, Nikolas T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6374-002810aKey research issues of coastal storm analysis  aTaking into consideration the changing climate, researchers are mainly interested in measuring this change in many different sectors. Regarding the coastal areas, the effects are related inter alias to the sea level rise, but also the increase and the severity of storms incidence. In conjunction with the astronomical tide, coastal storms can cause extreme wave runup and overtopping phenomena in ports, and coastal structures, the consequences of which may be disastrous, mainly affecting the operation and the reliability of infrastructure. Consequently, the analysis of coastal storms is necessary for any future technical study in coastal engineering, for the design of port and coastal structures and the coastal management also. Coastal storms as multivariate and extreme events necessitate a detailed and multivariate analysis of many parameters. This work aims to review and highlight the most significant issues in coastal storm analysis, to summarise the knowledge and the current trends of coastal storms research, by exploring the scientific background through a literature overview. A guiding framework of storm analysis should include the most important aspects of this work which are: the coastal storm definition, the description of their severity, the understanding of the synoptic systems formation, the storm surges and the time-series analysis, the thresholds for their identification, the impacts, their classification, and finally the impacts of coastal storms on coastal human population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acoastal zone management 3acoasts 3aengineering 3ahuman population 3ainfrastructure 3amultivariate analysis 3asea level 3astorms 3atime series analysis 0aCoastal storm 0aDefinition 0aStorm surge 0aDuration 0aThresholds1 aPrinos, Panayotis E.1 aMemos, Constantine D.1 aTsoukala, Vasiliki K.0 tOcean & coastal management.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 199 p.105389-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.1053893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02412naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245012000173300001600293520112500309592002801434650001801462650002201480650001001502650001701512650002001529650002201549650002301571650002001594650001101614650001301625650001901638653001401657653004001671653002901711653002601740700002101766700001501787773009001802856008901892852000901981655001201990IND60605091620221122160546.0180720e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060509162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2015.03.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBledzki, A.K.10aHigh performance hybrid PP and PLA biocomposites reinforced with short man-made cellulose fibres and softwood flour  ap. 132-139.  aThis paper presents the research on hybrid thermoplastic biocomposites reinforced with a combination of short man-made cellulose fibres and softwood flour. The introduced short fibre composites are meant to be processed with injection moulding and may be an alternative to glass-fibre reinforced thermoplastics on account of their comparable specific strengths. The occurring positive hybrid effect enables to substitute up to half the weight of short fibre cellulose reinforcement with softwood flour without a significant reduction of material flexural strength. The flexural modulus of investigated hybrid biocomposites remained approximately at the same level, while impact strength was reduced with increasing softwood flour content. The proposed hybridisation leads to establishing biocomposites of suitable performance with competitive density, price and recycling possibilities in comparison to standard glass fibre reinforced counterparts. Moreover, the application of biobased polymers like polylactide as biocomposite matrix, contributes to the development of so called “green” high performance materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocomposites 3acellulosic fibers 3aflour 3aglass fibers 3aimpact strength 3ainjection molding 3amodulus of rupture 3apolylactic acid 3aprices 3asoftwood 3athermoplastics 0aA.

A thorough analysis, based on crystal field theory, allowed an unambiguous determination of all relevant free ion and crystal field parameters. We show that inclusion of methods sensitive to the nature of the lowest-energy states is essential to arrive at a correct description of the states that are most relevant for the static and dynamic magnetic properties. The spectroscopic investigations also allowed for a full understanding of the magnetic relaxation processes occurring in this system. Thus, the importance of spectroscopic studies for the improvement of single-molecule magnets is underlined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aerbium 3amagnetic materials 3amagnetic properties 3amathematical theory 3aspectral analysis 3aspectroscopy1 aFischer, Julia

However, additional resource constraints affect the overall viability of specific sites and regions. We investigated tradeoffs between growth rate, water, and CO2 availability and costs for two strains: Nannochloropsis salina and Chlorella sp. We conducted site selection exercises to produce 7.95E+10Lyr−1 (21billiongalyr−1 (BGY)) of renewable diesel (RD). Experimental trials from the National Alliance for Advanced Biofuels and Bio-Products (NAABB) team informed the growth model of our Biomass Assessment Tool. We simulated RD production by both lipid extraction (LE) and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Sites were screened for the availability of freshwater and flue gas, and prioritized by the net value of biofuel minus water (the least-expensive and available source) and flue gas delivery costs. Water sources considered were ground waters ranging in salinity from fresh to brines and seawater. We found that HTL produced more RD per unit biomass than LE, resulting in an improvement in economic efficiency of 76%. Selections constrained by production and water were concentrated along the Gulf of Mexico and southeastern Atlantic coasts. Adding flue gas constraints increased the spatial distribution to include sites nationwide. The 21BGY target required ~3.8millionha of mainly forest (41.3%) and pasture (35.7%). Exclusion in favor of barren and scrub lands forced most production to the southwestern US, but with increased water consumption (5.7 times) and decreased economic efficiency (−38%).  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella 3aNannochloropsis 3aalgae 3aalgae culture 3aarid lands 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3acoasts 3aflue gas 3aforests 3afreshwater 3afuel production 3agroundwater 3agrowth models 3alipids 3aliquefaction 3apastures 3asalinity 3aseawater 3ashrublands 3aviability 3aGulf of Mexico 3aSouthwestern United States 0aBAT 0aBGY 0aCO2 0aCONUS 0aGIS 0aHTL 0aL 0aLE 0aNATCARB 0aNP 0aRD 0aT 0aAlgal biofuel 0aSustainability 0aResource assessment 0aLand use change1 aSkaggs, Richard L.1 aWigmosta, Mark S.1 aColeman, Andre M.0 tAlgal research.g2014 July, v. 5 p.215-225dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2014.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012400169300001400293520179500307592002802102650001102130650002102141650001602162650001302178650000902191650002202200650001302222650001702235650001202252650001402264650001002278650001502288650002102303650001402324650000902338650002702347653002102374653003002395653001302425653001702438653001702455653003102472653003002503700001802533700001702551700001502568700002102583773011702604856008602721852000902807655001202816IND60557304520221120072615.0180831e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055730452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2016.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTain, You-Lin10aTargeting arachidonic acid pathway to prevent programmed hypertension in maternal fructose-fed male adult rat offspring  ap. 86-92.  aHypertension can be programmed in response to nutritional insults in early life. Maternal high-fructose (HF) intake induced programmed hypertension in adult male offspring, which is associated with renal programming and arachidonic acid metabolism pathway. We examined whether early treatment with a soluble epoxide hydrolase (SEH) inhibitor, 12-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-dodecanoic acid (AUDA) or 15-Deoxy-Δ¹²,¹⁴-prostagandin J2 (15dPGJ2) can prevent HF-induced programmed hypertension. Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats received regular chow or chow supplemented with fructose (60% diet by weight) during the whole period of pregnancy and lactation. Four groups of male offspring were studied: control, HF, HF+AUDA and HF+15dPGJ2. In HF+AUDA group, mother rats received AUDA 25 mg/L in drinking water during lactation. In the HF+15dPGJ2 group, male offspring received 15dPGJ2 1.5 mg/kg body weight by subcutaneous injection once daily for 1 week after birth. Rats were sacrificed at 12 weeks of age. Maternal HF-induced programmed hypertension is associated with increased renal protein level of SEH and oxidative stress, which early AUDA therapy prevents. Comparison of AUDA and 15dPGJ2 treatments demonstrated that AUDA was more effective in preventing HF-induced programmed hypertension. AUDA therapy increases angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) protein levels and PGE2 levels in adult offspring kidney exposed to maternal HF. 15dPGJ2 therapy increases plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels and decreases L-arginine-to-ADMA ratio. Better understanding of the impact of arachidonic acid pathway, especially inhibition of SEH, on renal programming may aid in developing reprogramming strategy to prevent programmed hypertension in children exposed to antenatal HF intake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aarachidonic acid 3abody weight 3achildren 3adiet 3aepoxide hydrolase 3afructose 3ahypertension 3akidneys 3alactation 3amales 3ametabolism 3aoxidative stress 3apregnancy 3arats 3asubcutaneous injection 0aArachidonic acid 0aDevelopmental programming 0aFructose 0aHypertension 0aNitric oxide 0aRenin–Angiotensin system 0aSoluble epoxide hydrolase1 aLee, Wei-Chia1 aWu, Kay L.H.1 aLeu, Steve1 aChan, Julie Y.H.0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2016 Dec., v. 38 p.86-92dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44770x0955-28637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2016.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002700144245009800171300002000269520131400289592002801603650002501631650002201656650001201678650001601690650001701706653002401723653002001747653002001767653002701787653002001814700006001834700005501894773014201949856007802091852000902169655001202178IND60743284920221121194618.0210707e20210623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074328492DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c044072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPendyala, Naresh Kumar10aFabrication of Perovskite Solar Cells with Digital Control of Transparency by Inkjet Printing  ap. 30524-30532.  aSemitransparency is an attractive and important property in solar cells since it opens new possibilities in a variety of applications such as tandem cell configuration and building-integrated photovoltaics. Metal halide perovskite has the optimal properties to function as the light harvester in solar cells and can be made as a thin film, while its chemical composition can change its band gap. However, achieving high transparency usually compromises the solar cell’s efficiency. Here we report on a unique approach to fabricating semitransparent perovskite solar cells that does not rely on their composition or their thickness. The approach is based on a scalable process, inkjet printing of arrays of transparent pillars, which are composed of inert photopolymerizable liquid compositions and are partly covered by the perovskite. This material can be printed at specific locations and array densities, thus providing a digital control of both the transparency and efficiency of the solar cells. The new semitransparent device structure shows 11.2% efficiency with 24% average transparency without a top metal contact. Further development including deposition of a transparent contact enabled the fabrication of fully semitransparent devices with an efficiency of 10.6% and average transparency of 19%.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3afilms (materials) 3aliquids 3asolar cells 3asolar energy 0apolymer-ink pillars 0ainkjet printing 0asemitransparent 0aperovskite solar cells 0ahigh efficiency1 aMagdassi, Shlomo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6794-05531 aEtgar, Lioz1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6158-85200 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 June 23, v. 13, no. 26 p.30524-30532dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c044073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04110naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012700169300001600296520236500312592002802677650002402705650002002729650001802749650002002767650002202787650001402809650002102823650002102844650002002865650002402885650002002909650001802929650001302947650001302960650001402973650000902987650002202996650002503018653001703043653002903060653001303089653001103102653001803113653001603131700003403147700001903181700001803200700002803218700002103246700002603267700002003293773011603313856008203429852000903511655001203520IND60625552620221119215451.0200508e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062555262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2018.10.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeter, Emanuel L.10aMomordica charantia L. lowers elevated glycaemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients: Systematic review and meta-analysis  ap. 311-324.  aMomordica charantia Linnaeus (Cucurbitaceae) has been extensively used traditionally as food and herbal medicine for type 2 diabetes mellitus in Asia, Brazil, and east Africa. In vitro and in vivo studies suggest its glycemic control potential; however, clinical studies produced conflicting results.To evaluate the efficacy of M. charantia preparations in lowering elevated plasma glucose level in prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.Electronic search of the Cochrane library, PubMed®, CINAHL, and SCOPUS databases was done from 1st January 1960–30th April 2018 without language restriction. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias of articles. Revman var. 5.3 software was used for data synthesis in meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed using Chi-square and I² tests. Treatment effect was estimated using mean difference at follow up in outcome measures between M. charantia preparations and placebo or oral hypoglycemic agents control group. The protocol of this study has a registration number PROSPERO CRD42018083653.Ten studies of type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 1045) were included in the meta-analysis. They had 4–16 weeks follow up and overall moderate to high risk of bias. Compared to placebo, M. charantia monoherbal formulation significantly reduces FPG, PPG and HBA₁c with mean difference of − 0.72 mmol/L, (95% CI: −1.33, −0.12), I² = 14%, − 1.43 mmol/L, (95% CI: −2.18, −0.67), I² = 0, − 0.26%, (95% CI: -0.49, −0.03), I² = 0 respectively. M. charantia also lowered FPG in prediabetes (mean difference −0.31 mmol/L, n = 52); the evidence was downgraded to low quality because the study had unclear risk of bias and inadequate sample size. No serious adverse effects were reported.M. charantia adjunct preparations improved glycemic control in T2DM patients. However, this conclusion is based on low to very low quality evidences for the primary outcomes and sparse data for several safety outcomes, thus, warrant further research. Particularly needed are the researches that focus on standardizing M. charantia formulation and determine its efficacy and safety in clinical trials with adequate sample size, designed with random sequence generation, allocation concealment of intervention and blinding of both research personnel and participants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMomordica charantia 3aadverse effects 3ablood glucose 3aclinical trials 3acomputer software 3adatabases 3aglycemic control 3aherbal medicines 3ahuman resources 3ahypoglycemic agents 3ain vivo studies 3ameta-analysis 3apatients 3aplacebos 3aprotocols 3arisk 3asystematic review 3atraditional medicine 0aBitter gourd 0aType 2 diabetes mellitus 0aEfficacy 0aSafety 0aMeta-analysis 0aPrediabetes1 aKasali, Félicien Mushagalusa1 aDeyno, Serawit1 aMtewa, Andrew1 aNagendrappa, Prakash B.1 aTolo, Casim Umba1 aOgwang, Patrick Engeu1 aSesaazi, Duncan0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 231 p.311-324dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2018.10.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02100naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005500155245009700210300001300307520096300320592002801283650000801311650002401319650001301343650001501356650001701371650001301388653001501401653001601416653002401432653002101456700005901477700001701536773008701553856008901640852000901729655001201738IND60605091720221122225026.0180720e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060509172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2015.04.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamill, Lee1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1925-970410aSurface porosity during vacuum bag-only prepreg processing: Causes and mitigation strategies  ap. 1-10.  aIn this study, we employ a parametric approach coupled with surface analysis to identify the source(s) of surface porosity and to develop effective mitigation strategies. Results confirmed that surface porosity was primarily associated with air that was trapped at the tool–prepreg interface during layup. The magnitude and distribution of surface porosity was affected by multiple parameters, including vacuum hold time, freezer and out time, and material and process modifications that affect air evacuation. The results indicated that prepreg out time (and thus tack) and vacuum quality were the primary drivers of surface porosity; for example, surface porosity decreased by 83% after just four days of out time and by 99% after 14days of out time. These factors were used to formulate guidelines to mitigate surface porosity by (a) increasing the driving force for air evacuation and/or (b) increasing the permeability of the tool–prepreg interface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acomposite materials 3afreezers 3aguidelines 3apermeability 3aporosity 0aA.

However, large-scale AP implementation remains impeded by a dearth of cheap, efficient catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Cobalt oxide materials can catalyze the OER and are potentially scalable due to the abundance of cobalt in the Earth’s crust; unfortunately, the activity of these materials is insufficient for practical AP implementation. Attempts to improve cobalt oxide’s activity have been stymied by limited mechanistic understanding that stems from the inherent difficulty of characterizing structure and reactivity at surfaces of heterogeneous materials. While previous studies on cobalt oxide revealed the intermediacy of the unusual Co(IV) oxidation state, much remains unknown, including whether bridging or terminal oxo ligands form O₂ and what the relevant oxidation states are. We have addressed these issues by employing a homogeneous model for cobalt oxide, the [Co(III)₄] cubane (Co₄O₄(OAc)₄py₄, py = pyridine, OAc = acetate), that can be oxidized to the [Co(IV)Co(III)₃] state. Upon addition of 1 equiv of sodium hydroxide, the [Co(III)₄] cubane is regenerated with stoichiometric formation of O₂. Oxygen isotopic labeling experiments demonstrate that the cubane core remains intact during this stoichiometric OER, implying that terminal oxo ligands are responsible for forming O₂. The OER is also examined with stopped-flow UV–visible spectroscopy, and its kinetic behavior is modeled, to surprisingly reveal that O₂ formation requires disproportionation of the [Co(IV)Co(III)₃] state to generate an even higher oxidation state, formally [Co(V)Co(III)₃] or [Co(IV)₂Co(III)₂]. The mechanistic understanding provided by these results should accelerate the development of OER catalysts leading to increasingly efficient AP systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3acatalysts 3acobalt 3acobalt oxide 3aisotope labeling 3aligands 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 3aphotosynthesis 3apyridines 3asodium hydroxide 3asolar radiation 3asuperoxide anion 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3avanadium1 aZiegler, Micah S.1 aOña-Burgos, Pascual1 aSturzbecher-Hohne, Manuel1 aKim, Wooyul1 aBellone, Donatela E.1 aTilley, T.

It is concluded that the gauge factor (GF) value of strain-sensing composite strongly depends on rGO’s content and preparing process. The composites with rGO’s content between percolation threshold and the content which rGO conducting as a complete network show better sensitive electrical response. What’s more, strong interface interaction between conducting filler and matrix benefits the improvement of GF value. The composites we prepared display significant and consistent changes in their GF values when subjected to large deformation, which are suitable for large structural deformation monitoring in advanced civil engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3acivil engineering 3adeformation 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3amonitoring 3ananocomposites 0aA.

However, there is limited research on the treatment of dual-polarization systems and the calibration methods for getting rid of distributed targets. In this paper, we contribute to proposing a new and convenient method for estimating the polarimetric channel imbalance phase at the transmitter and receiver, which can be used for both quad-pol and dual-pol SAR systems. We found a brand-new reference object in the urban area scene, namely the effective dihedrals. A statistical calculation method was proposed correspondingly, which obtained an effective estimation of the channel imbalance phases. The theoretical explanation of the proposed method was consistent with the statistical phenomena presented in the experiments. The technique was illustrated and verified through C-band SAR images, including GaoFen-3 (GF-3) data and Sentinel-1 data. The technique was also validated and successfully applied in airborne SAR data of P, L, S, C, and X bands. The estimation error could be within 7° when crosstalk items were less than −30 dB. The method realizes a fast and low-cost dual-polarization phase imbalance estimation and provides a new technical approach to supplement the traditional tropical-rainforest-based quad-pol system calibration. The method can be conveniently applied to the monitoring of polarization distortion parameters, ensuring good polarization SAR data quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata quality 3apolarimetry 3aurban areas1 aQiu, Xiaolan 1 aHan, Bin 1 aLiu, Wenju 1 aFu, Kun 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 July 01, v. 14, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141331773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03694naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245013700163300001800300520189600318592002802214596012802242596007502370650002102445650001302466650001102479650001302490650002002503650001802523650000902541650001002550650002102560650001802581650001102599650001602610650001002626650001102636650001002647651001002657653001502667653001302682653000802695653002002703700001702723700001902740700001502759700001802774700001802792700001302810700005802823700002502881773012202906856007903028852000903107655001203116IND60674353220221118114731.0191025e20181030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067435322DNAL7 a10.1093/treephys/tpy1192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Aiying,14aThe interaction between nonstructural carbohydrate reserves and xylem hydraulics in Korean pine trees across an altitudinal gradient  ap. 1792-1804.  aNonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) have been proposed to play an important role in maintaining the hydraulic integrity of trees, particularly in environments with high risks of embolism formation, but knowledge about the interaction between NSC reserves and xylem hydraulics is still very limited. We studied the variation of NSC reserves and hydraulic traits in Pinus koraiensis Sieb. et Zucc. (Korean pine) in March and June across a relatively large altitudinal gradient in Changbai Mountain of Northeast China. One of the major aims was to investigate the potential role NSC plays in maintaining hydraulic integrity of overwintering stems in facing freezing-induced embolism. Consistent with our hypotheses, substantial variations in both NSC contents and hydraulic traits were observed across altitudes and between the two seasons. In March, when relatively high degrees of winter embolism exist, the percentage loss of conductivity (PLC) showed an exponential increase with altitude. Most notably, positive correlations between branch and trunk soluble sugar content and PLC (P = 0.053 and 0.006) were observed across altitudes during this period. These correlations could indicate that more soluble sugars are required for maintaining stem hydraulic integrity over the winter by resisting or refilling freezing-induced embolism in harsher environments, although more work is needed to establish a direct causal relationship between NSC dynamics and xylem hydraulics. If the correlation is indeed directly associated with varying demands for maintaining hydraulic integrity across environmental gradients, greater carbon demands may compromise tree growth under conditions of higher risk of winter embolism leading to a trade-off between competitiveness and stress resistance, which may be at least partially responsible for the lower dominance of Korean pine trees at higher altitudes.  aPublisher supplied data  a41575153a31722013a31870593a31500222cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2016YFA0600803cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3aPinus koraiensis 3aaltitude 3acarbon 3aembolism 3afluid mechanics 3aoverwintering 3arisk 3astems 3astress tolerance 3asugar content 3asugars 3atree growth 3atrees 3awinter 3axylem 3aChina 0acavitation 0afreezing 0aNSC 0awinter embolism1 aHan, Shi-Jie1 aZhang, Jun-Hui1 aWang, Miao1 aYin, Xiao-Han1 aFang, Li-Dong1 aYang, Da1 aHao, Guang-You1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6003-70031 aGoldstein, Guillermo0 tTree physiology.g2018 Oct. 30, v. 38, no. 12 p.1792-1804dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl41003x1758-44697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpy1193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245008300163300001600246500002000262520154200282592002801824650003101852650001601883650002101899650002001920650002101940650001301961650001601974650001201990650001702002650001102019650001102030650002402041651001102065700003102076700002502107700002702132700003202159700002902191700003502220773013502255856007302390852000902463655001202472IND60587437320221116153306.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058743732DNAL7 a10.1111/jph.125822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCota, Luciano Viana10aQuantification of yield losses caused by leaf anthracnose on sorghum in Brazil  ap. 479-485.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe leaf anthracnose disease in sorghum, caused by Colletotrichum sublineolum (Henn. ex Sacc. & Trotter), is widely distributed throughout its Brazilian cultivation areas. The disease can cause significant losses in grain yield and quality. This study aimed to quantify the effects of leaf anthracnose on grain yield of different sorghum genotypes. Two elite inbred lines of sorghum, BR009 (susceptible) and BR008 (moderately resistant), and the hybrids, BR304 and MR43 (susceptible), BRS310 and DKB599 (moderately resistant) and BRS308 and AG1060 (resistant), were planted in a complete randomized block design with three replicates. The disease severity (DS) was evaluated weekly, starting from the onset of the first foliar symptoms, and yield losses were estimated using linear regression analysis. Leaf anthracnose significantly reduced sorghum yields in the susceptible genotypes. The highest yield loss of 86% was observed in the inbred line BR009, when the disease severity reached 100%. For the hybrids, the grain yield loss varied from 35% (BRS310) to 72% (BRS308). According to the adjusted model, a grain yield reduction of 23.48 kg/ha for BR304, 14.57 kg/ha for BRS310 and 15.91 kg/ha for DKB599 was observed for every 1% increase in disease severity. We demonstrate for the first time the effect of leaf anthracnose disease on grain sorghum yields under Brazilian conditions. The results from this study provide a starting point for developing new strategies for the integrated disease management of sorghum anthracnose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColletotrichum sublineolum 3aanthracnose 3acultivation area 3adisease control 3adisease severity 3agenotype 3agrain yield 3ahybrids 3ainbred lines 3aleaves 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3aBrazil1 aSouza, André Gomes Coelho1 aCosta, Rodrigo Veras1 aSilva, Dagma Dionísia1 aLanza, Fabrício Eustáquio1 aAguiar, Frederick Mendes1 aFigueiredo, José Edson Fontes0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2017 Aug., v. 165, no. 7-8 p.479-485dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000109x0931-17857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jph.125823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011600175300001800291520075100309536044101060592002801501650001501529650001801544650002101562650001501583650001001598651001101608651001801619653005301637653003301690653001401723653001301737700002201750700002201772700002701794773010501821856008601926852000902012655001202021IND60758691220221118065214.0211202e20211102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075869122DNAL7 a10.1080/00275514.2021.19544452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGentry, Savannah L.10aKoch’s postulates: Confirming Nannizziopsis guarroi as the cause of yellow fungal disease in Pogona vitticeps  ap. 1253-1263.  aNannizziopsis guarroi is an ascomycete fungus associated with a necrotizing dermatitis in captive green iguanas (Iguana iguana) and bearded dragons (Pogona vitticeps) across both Europe and North America. Clinical signs of the disease include swelling and lesion formation. Lesions develop from white raised bumps on the skin and progress into crusty, yellow, discolored scales, eventually becoming necrotic. The clinical signs are the basis of a colloquial name yellow fungal disease (YFD). However, until now, N. guarroi has not been confirmed as the primary agent of the disease in bearded dragons. In this experiment, we fulfill Koch’s postulates criteria of disease, demonstrating N. guarroi as the primary agent of YFD in bearded dragons.  aWe thank Mary Herman Rubinstein and the University of Wisconsin–Madison for financial support of the Pringle laboratory.

Stoichiometric reactions with H₂ and HBPin showed facile E–H (E = H or BPin) activation across a Ru(II)–O bond, providing access to unusual Ru–H species with strong interactions with neighboring proton and boron atoms. These complexes were found to promote the catalytic hydroboration of ketones and nitriles under mild conditions, and the activity was highly dependent on the ligand’s protonation state. Mechanistic experiments revealed a crucial role of the pendent hydroxyl groups for catalytic activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron 3acatalytic activity 3ahydrogen 3aketones 3aligands 3anitriles 3aruthenium1 aSzymczak, Nathaniel K.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Oct. 14, v. 137, no. 40 p.12808-12814dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b084063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245013200163300001600295520159700311592002801908650003001936650001501966650001701981650001901998650002902017650001602046653002702062653001902089653002102108653002402129653003002153653003002183700001902213700001602232700001602248700002602264773010502290856007702395852000902472655001202481IND60773351720221120113613.0220413e20220412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077335172DNAL7 a10.1675/063.044.03022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBean, William T.12aA Novel Automated Method for Point-Based Change Detection Increases Estimation Accuracy of Breeding Pairs in Waterbird Colonies  ap. 277-288.  aThe number of breeding pairs is an essential indicator for assessing waterbird colony status. Accurate estimates require distinguishing stationary adults (likely to be breeders on nests) from nonstationary adults (likely to be loafing or foraging breeders or non-breeders). High-resolution multi-temporal aerial imagery obtained from manned aircraft, satellites, or unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) can be analyzed to determine bird movements and derive estimates of the number of stationary adults, which corresponds to the number of active nests, and thereby breeding pairs. Automated detection of stationary objects, such as nesting waterbirds, can be complicated by small positional changes of objects, either because of image co-registration errors or because the object slightly shifts position. A non-parametric, point-based approach was developed to distinguish stationary birds from moving birds using sequences of either two or three consecutive remotely-sensed images. This approach was tested with simulated data and during a case study of nesting American White Pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos). In both cases, the non-parametric point-based approach had higher accuracy than other established methods such as ground counts. Using two consecutive images had higher sensitivity (correct classification of stationary birds) while using three consecutive images had higher specificity (correct classification of nonstationary birds). This novel, multi-temporal nearest-neighbor method is most useful when positional shifts of stationary animals is low between consecutive images.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPelecanus erythrorhynchos 3aautomation 3acase studies 3aremote sensing 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3awater birds 0aAmerican White Pelican 0abreeding pairs 0achange detection 0acolonial waterbirds 0anearest-neighbor analysis 0aunmanned aircraft systems1 aDulava, Sharon1 aBauer, Mark1 aSloan, Jeff1 aRichmond, Orien M.

AR expression is maintained throughout the progression of prostate cancer and is also associated with an aggressive, castration-resistant (CR) phenotype. Despite the critical roles of AR expression in prostate cancer progression, the exact signaling mechanism regulating AR expression remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that AR expression was increased by a low-affinity leukotriene B₄ receptor (BLT2)-linked pathway. We found that BLT2 was overexpressed in AR-positive prostate cancer cells, such as LNCaP cells, and BLT2 inhibition, using an inhibitor or siRNA knockdown, clearly attenuated AR expression and triggered apoptosis in these cells. These results suggest a role for BLT2 in AR expression and the survival of AR-positive prostate cancer cells. Moreover, we found that the NADPH oxidase family protein, Nox4, lay downstream of BLT2 and mediated the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent NF-κB stimulation, thereby inducing AR expression. Taken together, our results demonstrate that BLT2 plays a critical role in AR expression via a Nox4-ROS-NF-κB-linked pathway, thereby mediating the survival of AR-positive prostate cancer cells. Our findings point to BLT2 as a key regulator of AR expression and will contribute to the development of novel therapies for AR-positive prostate cancers, including androgen-responsive and CR prostate cancers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aandrogen receptors 3aapoptosis 3agene overexpression 3aneoplasm cells 3aphenotype 3aprostatic neoplasms 3areactive oxygen species 3asmall interfering RNA 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aKim, Geun-Young1 aKim, Jae-Hong0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Apr. 6, v. 420, no. 2 p.428-433dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.03.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011000168300001400278520161400292592002801906650000801934650001501942650001401957650001001971650001701981650001101998650001502009650001302024650001202037650002102049650000902070650000902079650001102088653002602099653001402125653003602139653001102175653002102186700001802207700001702225700001302242700001802255700001702273773011702290856008602407852000902493655001202502IND60557304820221120072628.0180831e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055730482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2016.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yaqian10aFolic acid deficiency increases brain cell injury via autophagy enhancement after focal cerebral ischemia  ap. 41-49.  aFolic acid (FA) deficiency is not only associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke, but also with increased oxidative DNA damage and brain injury after cerebral ischemia–reperfusion. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying FA deficiency-associated neuropathogenesis are not completely understood. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that neuronal autophagy in focal cerebral ischemia rats may be involved in the mechanisms of FA deficiency-induced injury to neuronal cells. The results demonstrated that, accompanied by obvious neuron damage, the expression of the autophagic markers LC3 and Beclin-1, and the formation of 8-OHdG (a marker of oxidative stress to DNA) and autophagosomes were significantly increased in the brain cortex after ischemia–reperfusion. FA deficiency further induced neuronal cell death, and significantly increased the formation of autophagosomes and the expression of LC3 and Beclin-1 in NeuN-positive cell bodies after ischemia–reperfusion. The elevated level of 8-OHdG was also observed in the ischemic cortex of FA deficiency-treated animals. Conversely, the neuronal cell injury, autophagosome accumulation and the effects of LC3 and Beclin1 overexpression caused by FA deficiency were partially blocked by an autophagic inhibitor 3-methyladenine. These results suggest that FA deficiency progresses autophagic activation and aggravates the damage in rat brain cortex following focal cerebral ischemia–reperfusion. The oxidative injury may be involved in cell morphological damage and autophagy alteration caused by FA deficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aautophagy 3abrain 3abrain damage 3acortex 3afolic acid 3aischemia 3aneurons 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3arisk 3astroke 0aFolic acid deficiency 0aAutophagy 0aCerebral ischemia–reperfusion 0aCortex 0aOxidative stress1 aHuang, Guowei1 aChen, Shuang1 aGou, Yun1 aDong, Zhiping1 aZhang, Xumei0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2016 Dec., v. 38 p.41-49dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44770x0955-28637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2016.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245006600159300001400225520118400239592002801423650002501451650002201476650002301498650001901521650002001540650002601560650001601586650001701602650003701619650000901656650001901665650001501684651001001699700001601709700001501725700001701740700001401757773016201771856008201933852000902015655001202024IND60588954820221117235750.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058895482DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-7906-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Lin10aBioremediation of PAH-contaminated farmland: field experiment  ap. 64-72.  aThe agricultural soil contaminated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is gradually emerging and becoming serious in China with the rapid development of economy. To reduce the risk of PAHs in agricultural soil and guarantee the food safety, the biological agent that Mycobacterium gilvum immobilized on modified peanut shell powder enhanced remediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-contaminated vegetable farmland was investigated under the conditions of the field experiment. The results indicated that adding biological agent could promote PAH degradation in the soil, especially high-ring PAHs. The degradation rates of PAHs in the soil could be further improved to 16.5–43.5 %, respectively, compared with the soil without the biological agent. Adding the biological agent could significantly improve soil dehydrogenase activity and microbial diversity. It also could reduce the enrichment of PAHs in mustard planted in the polluted field, which indicated that the biological treatments might be less ecological risk. The work suggested that adding the biological agent might be a promising in situ bioremediation strategy for PAH-contaminated farmland field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium gilvum 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural soils 3abioremediation 3aenzyme activity 3afield experimentation 3afood safety 3apeanut hulls 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3avegetables 3aChina1 aDeng, Fucai1 aYang, Chen1 aGuo, Chuling1 aDang, Zhi0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 Jan., v. 25, no. 1 p.64-72dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-7906-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02272naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245012200176300001400298520101900312592002801331650004401359650001101403650001801414650002401432650001301456650001901469650001301488650001101501653002001512653002301532653003001555653001601585700001601601700001801617700002201635700001901657773008801676856008901764852000901853655001201862IND60605092020221120095215.0180720e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060509202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2015.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Chang Yeong10aUsing silane-functionalized graphene oxides for enhancing the interfacial bonding strength of carbon/epoxy composites  ap. 11-17.  aSilane-functionalized graphene oxides (sGOs) were fabricated with four different self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) to reinforce an epoxy adhesive, with the aim of improving the bonding strength of carbon/epoxy composites. The oxygen-containing groups on the surface of graphene oxide (GO) were converted by the SAMs to amine, epoxy, or alkyl groups. The successful reaction between the silane molecules of the SAMs and functional groups of GO was evidenced by the results of different characterization methods such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. It was found that the average thickness of the sGO flakes was higher than that of GO flakes. The bonding strength of a carbon fiber/epoxy composite, tested with a single lap joint bonded with an epoxy adhesive, was increased by 53% after the addition of a sGO that contained amine groups. These results show that sGOs, especially those containing amine functional groups, can strengthen the interfacial bonding between the carbon fibers and epoxy adhesive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acarbon 3acarbon fibers 3acomposite materials 3aepoxides 3agraphene oxide 3amoieties 3asilane 0aA.

The only information available to date comes from anecdotal observations, analysis of mercury levels and stable isotopes. Here is presented the first insights into prey consumption by adults and chicks from the two species breeding in the Azores Archipelago, Portugal, in the mid-Atlantic Ocean. The rapidly developing field of metabarcoding was used to identify dietary items from fecal samples, to species level where possible. A total of thirteen fish, five cephalopod, one crustacean and two oligochaete operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected. Results suggest that both petrel species feed mainly on myctophid fish. However, differences were detected between the prey species consumed by (i) H. monteiroi and H. castro, (ii) two distinct H. castro populations (Vila and Praia islets), and (iii) chicks and adults within the same population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCephalopoda 3aCrustacea 3aDNA barcoding 3aHydrobates pelagicus 3aOligochaeta 3adiet 3afish 3amercury 3aprey species 3astorms 3athreatened species 3awater birds 3aAzores 3aPortugal 0aforaging ecology 0aHydrobates castro 0aHydrobates monteiroi 0aHydrobatidae 0aMadeiran Storm Petrel 0ametabarcoding 0aMonteiro's Storm Petrel 0aprey use1 aBried, Joël1 aDeakin, Zoe1 aJones, Katherine Booth1 aThomas, Robert J.1 aSymondson, W.

Inhibiting P2X7R indirectly reduces the rate of amyloid-β (Aβ)-induced neurodegeneration by suppressing secretion of inflammatory factors from activated microglia. We used RNA interference to silence P2X7R in microglial cells in vitro and found it markedly increased microglial phagocytosis of Aβ1–42. Increased phagocytic activity was dependent on decreasing the rate of interleukin-1β release from microglia and required inhibition of the COX-2 pathway. Modulation of microglial phagocytosis and secretion via silencing P2X7R may be a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aRNA interference 3ainterleukin-1beta 3aneuroglia 3apathogenesis 3aphagocytosis 3asecretion 0aAlzheimer’s disease 0aAmyloid-β peptides 0aMicroglia 0aP2X7 receptor 0aRNA interference1 aWang, Peijun1 aZhang, Jingfa1 aChen, Wei1 aGu, Limin0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 May 03, v. 434 p.363-369dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.03.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245013600171300001600307520143300323592002801756650001501784650001501799650001601814650001801830650001901848650001101867650001901878650002301897650001701920650001801937650001901955650001101974651001801985700002302003700001602026700002302042773012202065856008102187852000902268655001202277IND60121502420221121164130.0150307e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012150242DNAL7 a10.1007/s12524-014-0399-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLotliker, Aneesh A.10aPerformance of Semianalytical Algorithm and Associated Inherent Optical Properties in Coastal Waters of North Western Bay of Bengal  ap. 143-149.  aThe present study was carried out with an aim to assess two semianalytical algorithms, Garver–Siegel–Maritorena (GSM) and Generalized IOP (GIOP) and their association with Inherent Optical Properties (IOP) such as phytoplankton absorption coefficient (aₚₕ), detritus absorption (adg) and particulate backscattering (bbₚ). Ten years of Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer-Aqua (MODISA) data was processed to retrieve Chlorophyll_a (Chl_a) from GSM and GIOP. Subsequently the Rᵣₛfrom MODISA was inverted to compute aₚₕ, adgand bbₚ. Both the algorithms showed similar trend at an annual scale. However in magnitude, Chl_a from GSM was three times higher than that from GIOP. Further the Chl_a retrieved from GSM was closer to in situ values. The variability of aₚₕand adgwas similar at long-term time scale. The peak observed in variability of aₚₕand adgduring pre-monsoon was due to the occurrence of bloom whereas the peak during monsoon was due to nutrient discharge from river. The observed peak in bbₚduring monsoon can be also attributed to the increasing concentration of total particulate matter from river as well as from bottom re-suspension. The poor association of IOP with Chl_a explains the limited accuracy of satellite retrieved Chl_a from these semianalytical algorithms. Hence it is require generating IOP at the regional scale and tuning the semianalytical model for better accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aalgorithms 3achlorophyll 3acoastal water 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3amonsoon season 3aoptical properties 3aparticulates 3aphytoplankton 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3aBay of Bengal1 aBaliarsingh, S.

Insufficient information is available on its breeding ecology. This study reports the breeding ecology and factors affecting breeding of the River Tern over three years (2017-2019) along the Mahanadi River in Odisha, eastern India. Breeding was observed between February and May, with peak activity in April. The mean clutch size was 2.4 ± 0.06 SE and incubation period was 22.1 ± 0.06 days. Out of 163 nests, 68 nests succeeded in hatching at least one egg and apparent nesting success rate varied between 2.6% (2018) and 62.3% (2017). Factors affecting nesting success (95 nests) were predation (37.9%), flooding (32.6%), a cyclone (28.4%) and nest desertion (1.1%). Overall, of 124 chicks hatched, 58 were estimated to have fledged. Factors affecting chick survival were a cyclone (43.9%), predation (39.4%), and unknown causes (16.7%). A cyclone in May 2019 wiped out all eggs and chicks. Development and implementation of an evidence-based multi-species conservation action plan to protect River Tern and other globally threatened riverine ground nesters is urgently required.  aPublisher supplied data 3achicks 3aclutch size 3aeggs 3anests 3aphenology 3apredation 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3athreatened species 3awater birds 3aIndia 3aSouth East Asia 0aBreeding ecology 0achick survival 0acyclone 0aMahanadi River 0anest flooding 0anest success 0anesting ecology 0aRiver Tern 0aSterna aurantia.1 aDebata, Subrat1 aMundkur, Taej0 tWaterbirds.g2022 Apr. 12, v. 44, no. 3 p.308-316dWaterbirds SocietywJournal:6297x1524-46957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1675/063.044.03053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245008100166300001600247500001500263520168000278592002801958650003701986650002202023650001402045650001002059650002602069650002002095650002102115650003502136650002202171650002902193650001202222650001702234650001602251650001102267650002302278650002302301650001602324650002202340650001902362650001302381650001402394653002402408653001002432700002202442700001402464700001702478773010102495856007902596852000902675655001202684IND60439921320221123014801.0151024e199708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043992132DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10042003165202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBendavid-Val, R.10aViability of VA-mycorrhizal fungi following soil solarization and fumigation  ap. 185-193.  a2019-12-06  aTwo field experiments were conducted to examine the effect of soil solarization on the survival of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and root colonization of three crops. The experiments were carried out in a loamy sand soil (Rehovot) and a silty soil (Bet She'an Valley). For both experiments, assessment of indigenous AM fungal populations by the most probable number (MPN) method indicated that populations were reduced to zero after 2 or 4 weeks of solarization treatment. However, Glomus intraradices inoculum applied to the soil prior to solarization remained viable even after 8 weeks of solarization. After soil fumigation with methyl bromide both indigenous and applied AM fungi were nondetectable. Percentage root colonization by the indigenous AM fungal populations, together with plant-growth parameters, were assessed for three crops: onion and wheat (Rehovot), and carrot (Bet She'an). When sown on solarized field plots, onion and carrot seedlings showed a plant growth retardation, whereas wheat showed an increased growth response. Root colonization by indigenous AM fungi was not evident until 6 weeks after seedling emergence. Fumigation with methyl bromide reduced root colonization by indigenous AM populations, and reduced onion and wheat plant development at early growth stages. In a laboratory experiment, a temperature of 45° C for up to 24 h did not affect AM spore viability, indicating that temperatures reached during the solarization treatment cannot solely account for the reduced AM fungi viability in the field. Apparently, soil solarization temporarily delays root colonization by indigenous AM fungi until 6-8 weeks after plant emergence.  aPublisher supplied data 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aseedlings 3awheat 3afield experimentation 3asoil fumigation 3aloamy sand soils 3amost probable number technique 3aearly development 3aRhizophagus intraradices 3acarrots 3aplant growth 3asilty soils 3aonions 3agrowth retardation 3aseedling emergence 3atemperature 3asoil solarization 3amethyl bromide 3ainoculum 3aviability 0aGlomus intraradices 0acrops1 aRabinowitch, H.D.1 aKatan, J.1 aKapulnik, Y.0 tPlant and soil.g1997 Aug., v. 195, no. 1 p.185-193dKluwer Academic Publishersx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10042003165203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03096naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245009400162300002000256520122300276592002801499596006601527596006401593596007301657596008101730596009801811596009701909650001802006650001702024650001702041650001602058700005202074700001902126700001402145700002002159700002402179700002602203700006302229700006302292700006002355773014902415856007702564852000902641655001202650IND60791764020220831000000.0220831e20220817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079176402DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.2c071112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Ghada H.10aLuminescence Enhancement Due to Symmetry Breaking in Doped Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals  ap. 15862-15870.  aMetal-halide perovskite nanocrystals have demonstrated excellent optoelectronic properties for light-emitting applications. Isovalent doping with various metals (M²⁺) can be used to tailor and enhance their light emission. Although crucial to maximize performance, an understanding of the universal working mechanism for such doping is still missing. Here, we directly compare the optical properties of nanocrystals containing the most commonly employed dopants, fabricated under identical synthesis conditions. We show for the first time unambiguously, and supported by first-principles calculations and molecular orbital theory, that element-unspecific symmetry-breaking rather than element-specific electronic effects dominate these properties under device-relevant conditions. The impact of most dopants on the perovskite electronic structure is predominantly based on local lattice periodicity breaking and resulting charge carrier localization, leading to enhanced radiative recombination, while dopant-specific hybridization effects play a secondary role. Our results suggest specific guidelines for selecting a dopant to maximize the performance of perovskite emitters in the desired optoelectronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data  a601946cSimons Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000893  aNAcStanford Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005492  aNAcRowland Institute at Harvarddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009835  aMR/V023926/1cUK Research and Innovationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100014013  aNAcEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000266  aNAcGianna Angelopoulos Programme for Science, Technology and Innovationdhttps://doi.org/NA 3ahybridization 3aluminescence 3ananocrystals 3aperiodicity1 aLiu, Yun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1630-40521 aBravić, Ivona1 aNg, Xejay1 aHeckelmann, Ina1 aNarayanan, Pournima1 aFernández, Martin S.1 aMonserrat, Bartomeu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4233-40711 aCongreve, Daniel N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2914-35611 aFeldmann, Sascha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6583-53540 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2022 Aug. 17, v. 144, no. 34 p.15862-15870dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c071113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003600150245008000186300001400266520164800280592002801928650002101956650002701977650001402004650002602018650001102044650001702055650001502072650001602087650001102103650002202114650001402136650002102150650002502171650001902196653003102215653002302246653002402269700002602293700002102319700002002340700002902360700001802389773013002407856008502537852000902622655001202631IND60569212220221120135223.0180904e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056921222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2017.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVoulgaridou, Georgia-Persephoni10aHuman aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1 (ALDH3A1) exhibits chaperone-like function  ap. 16-24.  aAldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1 (ALDH3A1) is a metabolic enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of various aldehydes. Certain types of epithelial tissues in mammals, especially those continually exposed to environmental stress (e.g., corneal epithelium), express ALDH3A1 at high levels and its abundance in such tissues is perceived to help to maintain cellular homeostasis under conditions of oxidative stress. Metabolic as well as non-metabolic roles for ALDH3A1 have been associated with its mediated resistance to cellular oxidative stress. In this study, we provide evidence that ALDH3A1 exhibits molecular chaperone-like activity further supporting its multifunctional role. Specifically, we expressed and purified the human ALDH3A1 in E. coli and used the recombinant protein to investigate its in vitro ability to protect SmaI and citrate synthase (from precipitation and/or deactivation) under thermal stress conditions. Our results indicate that recombinant ALDH3A1 exhibits significant chaperone function in vitro. Furthermore, over-expression of the fused histidine-tagged ALDH3A1 confers host E. coli cells with enhanced resistance to thermal shock, while ALDH3A1 over-expression in the human corneal cell line HCE-2 was sufficient for protecting them from the cytotoxic effects of both hydrogen peroxide and tert-butyl hydroperoxide. These results further support the chaperone-like function of human ALDH3A1. Taken together, ALDH3A1, in addition to its primary metabolic role in fundamental cellular detoxification processes, appears to play an essential role in protecting cellular proteins against aggregation under stress conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aaldehyde dehydrogenase 3aaldehydes 3acitrate (si)-synthase 3acornea 3acytotoxicity 3aepithelium 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3arecombinant proteins 3athermal stress 0aAldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1 0aCorneal crystallin 0aMolecular chaperone1 aTsochantaridis, Ilias1 aMantso, Theodora1 aFranco, Rodrigo1 aPanayiotidis, Mihalis I.1 aPappa, Aglaia0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2017 Aug., v. 89 p.16-24dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2017.05.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01607naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245012800171300001800299520051100317592002800828650001900856650001300875650002300888650002300911650002300934650002000957650001000977650001100987650001600998650002001014700002301034773010601057856008501163852000901248655001201257IND60579158420221118023614.0170816e20160805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057915842DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.6b017652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKisan, Hemanta

An urgent need exists to identify other sustainable means of producing food. This is a case in Malawi, where capture fisheries and agriculture are not supplying sufficient food. Fish farming food systems by communities who rely on inland fisheries have not been evaluated. Therefore, a study was conducted in two phases: January 2016 to May 2016 and in July 2017 to evaluate if fish farming could sustainably support livelihoods of Lake Malawi riparian communities. We used mixed methods to collect and analyze data. The data collection methods included explorative surveys, household survey interviews, focus group discussion and key informant interviews. Qualitative data was analyzed using content analysis for themes. This identified themes that were quantitatively analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. We observed that fish farming was dominated by men and also not the main occupation for the respondents despite owning fishponds. The respondents have water and land, which are prerequisite for any farming. The study also observed fish farming production challenges related to quality fingerlings, formulated diets, and extension services. Cases of food insecurity amongst the respondents were also prevalent due to lack of food to cover the entire year. Weak synergies existed between fish farming and agriculture restricting bio-resource flow and water usage between these two food systems, meaning the outcomes of the food systems provide unsustainable diets. Furthermore, water availability, money spent on food, and cassava cropping increased fish farming participation. Whereas operating a bicycle taxi, casual labor, former fish farming, as well as application of agricultural wastes negatively affected fish farming. On the other hand, extreme weather events (increased incidences of droughts and floods) attributed to inter annual rainfall variation also negatively affected fish farming. The responses from Lake Malawi riparian communities indicate that they merely look upon fish farming as an alternative to capture fisheries than as an illusion. Nonetheless, the research provides a theoretical platform to explore the potential to develop sustainable fish farming food system adapted to such changes. Therefore, we have brought new evidence that progress of fish farming in Malawi is being made, but there is a long way to go before it can be considered successful and sustainable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural wastes 3acassava 3adata analysis 3adiet 3adrought 3aextension education 3afarming systems 3afingerlings 3afish culture 3afish ponds 3afloods 3afocus groups 3afood security 3afreshwater fisheries 3ahousehold surveys 3ainterviews 3alabor 3alivelihood 3amen 3aquantitative analysis 3arain 3astatistics 3awater utilization 3aLake Malawi 3aMalawi1 aSingini, Wales1 aStorebakken, Trond0 tSustainability.g2018 May 07, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100514533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02075naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245009400161300001500255506002800270520112800298592002801426506003701454650002601491650003801517650001901555773013601574856007801710852000901788655001201797IND60785334720221207100502.0180213e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078533472DNAL7 a10.25026/jtpc.v1i2.162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuncoro, Hadi10aEfek pemberian α-mangostin dari garcinia tetranda pierre terhadap morfologi p.falciparum  ap. 99-103.  aResource is Open Access  aMorphological changes assay to P. falciparum from the effects of α-mangostin from G. tetranda using TEM methods has been done.

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of ARIs using a meta-analysis of RCTs. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched for relevant articles in June 2021. Two of the authors independently assessed the eligibility of the trials. Results: Out of 390 articles retrieved from the databases, we included 18 RCTs, which involved 3648 participants, with 1838 in an intervention group and 1810 in a control group in the final analysis. In the meta-analysis of all the trials, vitamin D supplements had a beneficial effect in the treatment of ARIs (relative risk (RR) = 1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01–1.13; I² = 66.9%). Publication bias was observed in the funnel plot. In the subgroup meta-analysis of high-quality RCTs, no significant efficacy of vitamin D supplements was found (RR = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.98–1.06; I² = 24.0%). Although statistically significant changes of 7% in the treatment effects were observed, they are not considered as clinically substantial ones. Conclusions: The current meta-analysis suggests that vitamin D supplements are not clinically effective in the treatment of ARIs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfidence interval 3ameta-analysis 3arelative risk 3arespiratory tract diseases1 aMyung, Seung-Kwon 1 aCho, Hae-Eun 0 tNutrients.g2022 Mar. 08, v. 14, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu140611443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245011700211300001800328506010400346506007600450520125600526592002801782506003701810650001701847650002001864650002301884650002101907650000901928650001501937650001201952650000901964650001401973653001401987653001602001653002102017653001202038653002802050700002402078700002202102700002702124700003002151773011202181856008302293852000902376655001202385IND60776811420221207135439.0220706e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077681142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2022.04.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRychter, Anna Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6586-361110aAntioxidant effects of vitamin E and risk of cardiovascular disease in women with obesity – A narrative review  ap. 1557-1565.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProper dietary habits are a vital element of cardiovascular (CV) treatment, and - according to the current guidelines - a diet rich in antioxidants is generally recommended. It remains, however, inconclusive whether antioxidant nutrients should be supplemented for CV health, and if so, in which form and dosage. Currently available data suggest that vitamin E may be essential in preventing CVD, especially in coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis – nevertheless, vitamin E supplementation may be questionable and may even be associated with adverse outcomes. Further, current studies highlight a strong need for identifying sex-specific strategies, which could improve guidelines for both the prevention and management of cardiovascular disease (CVD). It should also be emphasized that understanding the role of genetic variants in genes involved in VE metabolism may also be crucial for more precise nutritional recommendations for patients suffering from CVD. Therefore, we summarize the current knowledge regarding vitamin E antioxidant properties, which could be essential from CV perspective, and aim to assess whether vitamin E supplementation can be beneficial in CV prevention, especially in the high-risk group of women with obesity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantioxidants 3aatherosclerosis 3aclinical nutrition 3acoronary disease 3adiet 3ametabolism 3aobesity 3arisk 3avitamin E 0aVitamin E 0aAntioxidant 0aOxidative stress 0aObesity 0aCardiovascular diseases1 aHryhorowicz, Szymon1 aSłomski, Ryszard1 aDobrowolska, Agnieszka1 aKrela-Kaźmierczak, Iwona0 tClinical nutrition.g2022 July, v. 41, no. 7 p.1557-1565dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2022.04.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245005700165300001600222520112000238592002801358650001501386650001901401650001801420650001501438650002001453650002901473650001401502650001301516650001401529650002001543650001301563653001401576653000901590653001001599700006201609700002101671700006101692700002301753700001801776700001901794700002301813773013901836856008301975852000902058655001202067IND60757139520221122024529.0211213e20211231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075713952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.11.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkuro, Kenta10aGlutamine deficiency induces lipolysis in adipocytes  ap. 155-161.  aGlutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the body, and adipose tissue is one of the glutamine-producing organs. Glutamine has important and unique metabolic functions; however, its effects in adipocytes are still unclear. 3T3-L1 adipocytes produced and secreted glutamine dependent on glutamine synthetase, but preadipocytes did not. The inhibition of glutamine synthetase by l-methionine sulfoximine (MSO) impaired the differentiation of preadipocytes to mature adipocytes, and this inhibitory effect of MSO was rescued by exogenous glutamine supplementation. Glutamine concentrations were low, and Atgl gene expression was high in epididymal white adipose tissues of fasting mice in vivo. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, glutamine deprivation induced Atgl expression and increased glycerol concentration in culture medium. Atgl expression is regulated by FoxO1, and glutamine deprivation reduced FoxO1 phosphorylation (Ser256), indicating the activation of FoxO1. These results demonstrate that glutamine is necessary for the differentiation of preadipocytes and regulates lipolysis through FoxO1 in mature adipocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3aadipose tissue 3aculture media 3aepididymis 3agene expression 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3aglutamine 3aglycerol 3alipolysis 3aphosphorylation 3aresearch 0aAdipocyte 0aAtgl 0aFoxO11 aFukuhara, Atsunori1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6289-37781 aMinemura, Tomomi1 aHayakawa, Tomoaki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4429-65581 aNishitani, Shigeki1 aOkuno, Yosuke1 aOtsuki, Michio1 aShimomura, Iichiro0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2021 Dec. 31, v. 585 p.155-161dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.11.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03434naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013400159520223500293592002802528650001402556650001202570650002202582650001202604650002002616650002002636650002302656650001102679650002402690650000902714650001902723650002702742650001402769650001102783650001602794651001602810773012702826856007402953852000903027655001203036IND60652250120221120035256.0190712e20180424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065225012DNAL7 a10.3390/su100513192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Sean  Hay10aAssessing the Needs and Gaps of Building Information Technologies for Energy Retrofit of Historic Buildings in the Korean Context  aMost domestic modern buildings from the early 1900s have been constructed as heavy mass, and for many years have relied on passive measures for climate control. Since effective passive measures eventually reduce the heating and cooling loads, thus also reducing the system size, passive and hybrid measures are the most preferred Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs). In addition, the domestic situation and climate are additional constraints in energy retrofit decision making, such as a shorter budget and time, poor maintenance history, and uncertainties in vernacular lifestyle. For this reason, the performance improvement and side-effects prior to installing ECMs should be predictable, particularly in case the originality can be damaged. This complexity confirms that simulation-based Measurement and Verification (M&amp;V) would better suit the energy retrofit of domestic historic buildings. However, many domestic investors still believe re-construction has a larger economic value than restoration. Therefore, they are even unwilling to invest in more time than a preset audit period&mdash;typically less than a week. Although simulation-based M&amp;V is theoretically favored for retrofit decision making, its process including collecting data, modeling and analysis, and evaluating and designing ECMs could still be too demanding to domestic practitioners. While some manual, repetitive, error-prone works exist in the conventional retrofit process and simulation-based M&amp;V, it is proposed here that enhanced Building Information Technology (BIT) is able to simplify, automate, and objectify, at least the critical steps of the retrofit project. The aim of this study is to find an efficient and effective energy retrofit strategy for domestic historic buildings that appeals to both domestic investors and practitioners by testing selective BIT tools on an actual historic building. This study concludes with the suggestion that software vendors are asked to develop enhanced features to resolve users&rsquo; pending demands. It is also suggested that, in the domestic context, how the current practice for each process of the energy retrofit of historic buildings needs to shift to take a full advantage of BIT.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3aclimate 3acomputer software 3acooling 3adata collection 3adecision making 3aeconomic valuation 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aheat 3ahistoric sites 3ainformation technology 3alifestyle 3amodels 3auncertainty 3aSouth Korea0 tSustainability.g2018 Apr. 24, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100513193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01592naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245013800173300001800311520056800329592002800897650002300925650002800948650002500976650002201001650001901023700002101042700002701063773010601090856008501196852000901281655001201290IND60579158520221118023607.0170816e20160805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057915852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.6b017752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCronk, William

It is based on intramolecular cycloadditions of aza-o-xylylenes formed in situ via excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) of o-acylanilides. The photoprecursors are synthesized via a two-step one-pot method from readily available starting materials. The photochemical cascade (one experimentally simple step) results in the formation of four new heterocyclic rings with high control of diastereoselectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3acycloaddition reactions 3adiastereoselectivity 3aorganic compounds 3aphotochemistry1 aMukhina, Olga A.1 aKutateladze, Andrei G.0 tOrganic letters.g2016 Aug. 05, v. 18, no. 15 p.3750-3753dAmerican Chemical Societyx1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.orglett.6b017753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001200145245011800157300002000275520162100295592002801916650002101944650001301965650004101978650001402019650001502033650000702048650001602055650001102071650001302082650001902095650002502114700001402139700001502153700001902168700001402187700001402201773012702215856008102342852000902423655001202432IND60559307020221118023712.0161206e20161206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055930702DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.6b035122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Lin10aChlorinated Methylsiloxanes Generated in the Papermaking Process and Their Fate in Wastewater Treatment Processes  ap. 12732-12741.  aSimulated experiments indicated that chlorinated volatile methylsiloxanes, detected by Q-TOF GC/MS, could be generated in a pulp-bleaching process, where poly(dimethylsiloxane)s fluids with volatile methylsiloxanes as impurities and molecular chlorine were used as a defoamer and bleaching agent, respectively. In the producing processes of one papermaking factory, the mean total concentrations of monochlorinated D4, D5, and D6, i.e., D3D(CH₂Cl), D4D(CH₂Cl), and D5D(CH₂Cl), were 0.0430–287 μg/L in aqueous samples, while they were 0.0329–270 μg/g in solid samples. In the coupled papermaking-wastewater treatment processes, D3D(CH₂Cl), D4D(CH₂Cl), and D5D(CH₂Cl) were detected in all water (0.113–8.68 μg/L) and solid samples (0.888–26.2 μg/g), with solid–water partition values (468–3982 L/kg) 1.08–4.82 times higher than those of their corresponding nonchlorinated analogs. The removing efficiencies of D3D(CH₂Cl)–D5D(CH₂Cl) in the whole wastewater treatment processes were 77.1–81.6%, and sorption to sludge (35.7–74.1%) and removal in the primary clarifier (7.19–32.5%) had major contributions to their total removal. Elimination experiments showed that 1) hydrolysis half-lives of D3D(CH₂Cl)–D5D(CH₂Cl) (0.9–346 h) in the primary clarifier (pH = 7.8–9.2) were 2.16–3.60 times shorter than those of their nonchlorinated analogs; 2) D3D(CH₂Cl)–D5D(CH₂Cl) were hardly degraded in oxic sludge treatment process, and their volatilization half-lives (7.38–21.1 h) in oxic sludge were 1.21–1.50 times longer than those of their nonchlorinated analogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3ableaching agents 3achlorine 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahalf life 3ahydrolysis 3apH 3apapermaking 3asludge 3asorption 3avolatilization 3awastewater treatment1 aHe, Xudan1 aZhi, Liqin1 aZhang, Chunhui1 aZeng, Tao1 aCai, Yaqi0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2016 Dec. 06, v. 50, no. 23 p.12732-12741dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.6b035123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010900169300001400278520175100292592002802043650001902071650002402090650002402114650002202138650001102160650003802171650002202209650001502231650001102246650001402257650002002271650002002291650002302311650003602334653001002370653001202380653001102392653002702403653001102430700001302441700001702454700001902471773013002490856008502620852000902705655001202714IND60569212520221120123540.0180904e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056921252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2017.05.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yuanzhuo10aADAR1 is targeted by miR-143 to regulate IL-1β-induced endothelial activation through the NFκB pathway  ap. 25-33.  aExcessive endothelial activation by inflammatory mediators is a critical contributing factor of sepsis pathophysiology. ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA), an enzyme that binds and edits double-stranded RNAs, exhibits immune regulatory properties. Whether ADAR1 is involved in the pathophysiology of sepsis is unclear. In the present study, we used human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) as an in vitro model system to investigate the roles of ADAR1 in interleukin (IL)-1β-induced endothelial activation. We found that stimulation with IL-1β caused opposite changes in the expression of ADAR1 and the adherence molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. ADAR1 overexpression reduced while ADAR1 knockdown enhanced IL-1β-induced HUVEC activation as assessed by ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression and THP-1 monocyte recruitment. Furthermore, ADAR1 was confirmed to be a direct target of miR-143 in HUVECs by a luciferase reporter assay, and miR-143 overexpression promoted while miR-143 knockdown inhibited HUVEC activation by IL-1β. In addition, ADAR1 overexpression prevented the enhancement effects of miR-143 overexpression on IL-1β-induced HUVEC activation. Our mechanistic studies revealed that ADAR1 overexpression reduced while ADAR1 knockdown enhanced PKR, IκBα, and NFκB phosphorylation induced by IL-1β. In addition, blocking NFκB signaling with the specific NFκB inhibitor PDTC (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate) prevented IL-1β-induced HUVEC activation enhanced by ADAR1 knockdown. Collectively, these data indicated that ADAR1 is targeted by miR-143 to regulate IL-1β-induced HUVEC activation, and the NFκB pathway acts as the downstream mediator of ADAR1. In conclusion, miR-143 and ADAR1 may serve as therapeutic targets for sepsis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIKappaB kinase 3aadenosine deaminase 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aendothelial cells 3ahumans 3aintercellular adhesion molecule-1 3ainterleukin-1beta 3aluciferase 3amodels 3amonocytes 3apathophysiology 3aphosphorylation 3asepsis (infection) 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aADAR1 0amiR-143 0aIL-1β 0aEndothelial activation 0aSepsis1 aPeng, Hu1 aZhou, Shuqin1 aZhuang, Yugang0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2017 Aug., v. 89 p.25-33dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2017.05.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245010400209300001800313520183100331592002802162650002302190650002402213650001702237650002602254650001202280650001202292650001502304650001402319650001702333650002002350650001702370653001902387653002102406653002502427653001202452653003202464653001402496700002002510700002002530700001702550700002202567700001902589773011202608856008302720852000902803655001202812IND60776811620221120075522.0220706e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077681162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2022.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUchida, Tsuneyuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4752-406610aImpact of body fat and muscle quantity on short- and long-term outcome after gastrectomy for cancer  ap. 1467-1474.  aPreoperative low skeletal muscle mass and obesity have been identified as poor prognostic factors after gastrectomy for cancer, but the predictive value of combined quantitation of skeletal muscle mass and obesity remains unclear. This study examined the impact of combined body compositions on outcomes after gastrectomy for cancer. 518 patients who had undergone gastric resection for cancer between 2004 and 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. Skeletal muscle mass (skeletal muscle mass index (SMI)) and visceral obesity (visceral fat area) were measured in preoperative computed tomographic images to categorize patients as outlined below. Impacts of these body compositions on outcomes after gastrectomy were investigated. Body composition was classified as high SMI without obesity in 231 patients (45%), high SMI with obesity in 202 (39%), low SMI without obesity in 55 (11%), and low SMI with obesity in 30 (6%). Postoperative complications developed in 128 patients (25%). Multivariate analysis identified low SMI with obesity as an independent risk factor for postoperative complications (odds ratio, 3.27; P = 0.010). Moreover, patients with low SMI without obesity had lower 5-year overall survival rates than patients with high SMI without obesity (64.4% vs. 88.0%; P < 0.001) and worse 5-year relapse-free survival rates (61.3% vs. 81.3%; P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis identified low SMI without obesity as a significant risk factor for overall survival (hazard ratio, 3.033; P < 0.001) and relapse-free survival (hazard ratio, 2.144; P = 0.008) after gastrectomy. Preoperative low SMI with obesity was an independent risk factor for postoperative complications, while low SMI without obesity was an independent risk factor for overall and relapse-free survival following gastrectomy for cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclinical nutrition 3acomputed tomography 3ahazard ratio 3amultivariate analysis 3amuscles 3aobesity 3aodds ratio 3aresection 3arisk factors 3askeletal muscle 3avisceral fat 0aGastric cancer 0aBody composition 0aSkeletal muscle mass 0aObesity 0aPostoperative complications 0aPrognosis1 aSekine, Ryuichi1 aMatsuo, Kenichi1 aKigawa, Gaku1 aUmemoto, Takahiro1 aTanaka, Kuniya0 tClinical nutrition.g2022 July, v. 41, no. 7 p.1467-1474dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2022.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245007000163520146300233592002801696650001401724650001701738650001301755650002001768650001701788650001401805650002101819700001901840700002401859700001801883700002001901773012201921856007502043852000902118655001202127IND60771382920221121225945.0220325e20220309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077138292DNAL7 a10.3390/nu140611492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Thorsten 10aSupportive Care in Oncology—From Physical Activity to Nutrition  aThe diagnosis and treatment of cancer are associated with impairment at the physical and at psychological level. In addition, side effects are a potentially treatment-limiting factor that may necessitate dose reduction, delay, or even discontinuation of therapy, with negative consequences for outcome and mean survival. Numerous studies have shown that physical activity and sports and exercise therapy programs are not only practicable but also recommendable for oncologic patients during the acute phase and in the aftercare. Furthermore, nutrition plays an important role in all stages of tumor therapy. A timely integration of a nutrition therapy and physical activity in the form of physiotherapy and sports therapy serves to prevent and reduce treatment-associated side effects. Evidence-based recommendations on cancer prevention through nutrition therapy, physical activity, and sports and exercise therapy should be integrated into treatment plans for oncology patients as well as in health care services for the general population. Individual counselling by trained nutrition and exercise specialists may be advisable to receive concrete recommendations on the respective tumor entity or specific side effects. This mini review is based on a selective literature search in the PubMed database and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials on the subjects of healthy diet and physical activity in primary prevention and follow-up about cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3adiet therapy 3aexercise 3ahealth services 3ahealthy diet 3aneoplasms 3aphysical therapy1 aSüß, Philip 1 aSchulte, Dominik M.1 aLetsch, Anne 1 aJensen, Wiebke 0 tNutrients.g2022 Mar. 09, v. 14, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu140611493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005900138245008400197500002900281500002000310520143900330592002801769596007001797596006401867650002201931650001101953650001601964650002401980650001302004650002102017700006202038773010702100856007202207852000902279655001202288IND60692481820221122025122.0200502e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069248182DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.30352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVagle, Grant L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0599-305910aNatural population variability may be masking the more‐individuals hypothesis  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSpecies richness and productivity are correlated at global and regional scales, but the mechanisms linking them are inconclusive. The most commonly invoked mechanism, the more‐individuals hypothesis (MIH), hypothesizes that increased productivity leads to increased food resource availability, which leads to an increased number of individuals supporting more species. Empirical evidence for the MIH remains mixed despite a substantial literature. Here we used simulations to determine whether interannual population variability could be masking a “true” MIH relationship. In each simulation, fixed linear relationships between productivity, richness, and 50‐yr average abundance mimicked the MIH mechanism. Abundance was allowed to vary annually and sampled for 1–40 yr. Linear regressions of richness on sampled abundance assessed the probability of detecting the fixed MIH relationship. Medium to high population variability with short‐term sampling (1–3 yr) led to poor detection of the fixed MIH relationship. Notably, this level of sampling and population variability describes nearly all MIH studies to date. Long‐term sampling (5+ yr) led to improved detection of the fixed relationship; thus it is necessary to detect support for the MIH reliably. Such sampling duration is nonexistent in the MIH literature. Robust future studies of the MIH necessitate consideration of interannual population variability.  aPublisher supplied data  aNSF IGERT 1144807cBioFrontiers Institute, University of Colorado  aNSF 1542639cBioFrontiers Institute, University of Colorado 3afood availability 3amixing 3aprobability 3aregression analysis 3asampling 3aspecies richness1 aMcCain, Christy M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6416-07030 tEcology.g2020 May, v. 101, no. 5 p.e03035-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46164x0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.30353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007800167300001400245520141500259592002801674650001301702650002401715650002701739650002101766650002501787650001201812650001301824650001101837650003201848650001501880650001301895651002101908700001901929700001901948773010801967856008102075852000902156655001202165IND60573924020221116141448.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057392402DNAL7 a10.1007/s11355-015-0287-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Hyeongsik10aDevelopment of an ecological impact assessment model for dam construction  ap. 15-31.  aThe purpose of this study was to develop a model for assessing the ecological value of a dam reservoir. Various evaluable characteristics (“elements”) that influence the ecology of the target area around the dam were grouped into three classes: (1) physical elements, such as altitude, slope, and aspect; (2) vegetation elements, such as forest physiognomy, vegetation type, age class, diameter at breast height (DBH) class, and density; and (3) habitat elements, such as ecological conditions, vegetation conservation classification, and frequency of wildlife appearances. The evaluation standard was quantified considering the ecological function of each element. The developed assessment model was applied to the Yeongju Dam in the Nakdong River basin in Korea. This study assumed that the ecological condition before the dam construction was 100 %. The results of this study showed that the physical, vegetation, and habitat elements were downgraded to 82.8, 95.5, and 90.7 %, respectively, after the construction of the dam. The overall ecological value was estimated to be 90.0 % and thus decreased by 10.0 % due to dam construction. Additionally, by combining the results for the evaluation elements, an ecologically healthy area was selected. The results of this study should prove useful for quantifying ecological impact and for establishing an ecological restoration plan for dam reservoirs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aecological function 3aecological restoration 3aecological value 3aenvironmental impact 3aforests 3ahabitats 3amodels 3atree and stand measurements 3awatersheds 3awildlife 3aKorean Peninsula1 aJung, Sang Hwa1 aPark, Daeryong0 tLandscape and ecological engineering.g2017 Jan., v. 13, no. 1 p.15-31dSpringer Japanx1860-18717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11355-015-0287-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245015000166520138500316592002801701650001801729650001801747650002501765650001601790650001601806650001301822650002201835650001801857650001901875650001701894650001501911650002101926650000901947650002901956650001201985650002201997653002802019653001302047653002502060653001802085700001402103700002002117700002902137700001402166700001702180700001502197700001802212700001302230700002002243773010302263856008602366852000902452655001202461IND60700349320221120233852.0201024e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070034932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1043532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Lulu10aDiverse effects of different Akkermansia muciniphila genotypes on Brown adipose tissue inflammation and whitening in a high-fat-diet murine model  aThe purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in the metabolic protective effects of Akkermansia muciniphila (A.muciniphila) genotypes on high-fat diet mice and explore possible mechanisms.Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into 6 groups, including high-fat diet (HFD)+ A. muciniphila I/II/PBS group, normal control diet (NCD)+ A. muciniphila I/II/PBS group, respectively. Dietary intervention and A. muciniphila gavage were performed simultaneously. Blood glucose and lipid metabolism, brown adipose morphology and activities, and intestinal barrier function were examined after the mice were sacrificed.A.muciniphila gavage improved the impaired glucose tolerance, hyperlipidemia and liver steatosis in HFD mice, and that A. muciniphila II (Amuc_GP25) was not as effective as A. muciniphila I (Amuc_GP01). This phenomenon might be because Amuc_GP01 intervention significantly inhibited brown adipose tissue whitening and inflammation induced by HFD, by repairing the intestinal barrier and relieving endotoxemia. Amuc_GP25 did not display the same results as Amuc_GP01 in HFD mice but had stronger effects in the NCD mice.This study reveals the distinct functions of different A. muciniphila genotypes on diet-induced obesity, suggesting that different A. muciniphila genotypes may affect pathological conditions differently through distinct action pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3ablood glucose 3abrown adipose tissue 3aendotoxemia 3afatty liver 3agenotype 3aglucose tolerance 3ahigh fat diet 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainflammation 3aintestines 3alipid metabolism 3amice 3anutritional intervention 3aobesity 3aprotective effect 0aAkkermansia muciniphila 0aGenotype 0abrown adipose tissue 0aHigh-fat-diet1 aOu, Zihao1 aHuang, Dongquan1 aLi, Chong,d1955 May 16-1 aLü, Zhi,1 aLiu, Wanting1 aWu, Feifan1 aNong, Caihong1 aGao, Jie1 aPeng, Yongzheng0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2020 Oct., v. 147 p.104353-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1043533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02272naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245013300164300001600297520094500313592002801258650002801286650001501314650001301329650005801342650002801400650001501428650001201443650001101455653002001466653001901486653001401505653001901519653002301538700001601561700002001577700001801597700001501615700001301630773010001643856008601743852000901829655001201838IND60569212820221120123644.0181015e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056921282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2017.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Ying10aSeparation and identification of iron-chelating peptides from defatted walnut flake by nanoLC-ESI–MS/MS and de novo sequencing  ap. 223-228.  aWalnuts are rich in unsaturated fatty acids and are processed to walnut oil. The by-product (defatted walnut flake) consists of approximately 50% protein and is usually treated as waste or low-value-use material. In this study, walnut protein was isolated and hydrolyzed to low-molecular-weight peptides. Iron-binding walnut peptides were prepared by iron-immobilized affinity chromatography (IMAC-Fe³⁺). Some iron-chelated peptides adsorbed to the IMAC-Fe³⁺ column were easily broken by NaH2PO4, whereas part of the peptides isolated from IMAC-Fe³⁺ column remained as peptide-iron complexes and could only be disrupted by EDTA-2Na. Subsequently, the iron-binding walnut peptides were separated into approximately 10 fractions by RP-HPLC. The main peak, with retention time of 32min, was further analyzed by nanoLC-ESI–MS/MS. Two main components in F32min were characterized as LAGNPDDEFRPQ and VEDELVAVV with de novo sequencing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaffinity chromatography 3abyproducts 3apeptides 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3awalnut oil 3awalnuts 3awastes 0aWalnut peptides 0aIron chelation 0aStructure 0aNanoLC–MS/MS 0ade novo sequencing1 aWei, Kaihua1 aMeng, Xiaoguang1 aHuang, Yajuan1 aZhang, Tuo1 aLi, Zhen0 tProcess biochemistry.g2017 Aug., v. 59 p.223-228dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2017.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02141naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245011300175300001600288520096500304592002801269650001101297650001201308650001301320650001301333650001201346651001101358651002301369653001701392653002201409653002001431653002801451653001801479653002201497700002101519773011801540856008801658852000901746655001201755IND60562343920221122062041.0190318e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056234392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.01.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFloren, Hannah P.10aPlastic in Cassin's Auklets (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) from the 2014 stranding on the Northeast Pacific Coast  ap. 496-498.  aOceanic plastic debris found in the digestive tracts of seabirds includes industrial plastic pellets and post-consumer user plastics.

We found that 41.5% of the birds contained plastic in their ventriculi, similar to values from the North Subarctic Pacific reported in the 1980s. Industrial pellets were found in 22.8% of our samples, and accounted for 28.1% of all the plastic pieces found. Industrial pellets tended to be larger than pieces of user plastic and accounted for 40.2% of total plastic weight. These industrial pellets were significantly smaller than those found in other species, suggesting either that Cassin's Auklets selected smaller plastic particles or that plastic was retained in ventriculi and worn down.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3apellets 3aplastics 3aseabirds 3astomach 3aOregon 3aWashington (state) 0aMicroplastic 0aNortheast Pacific 0aCassin's Auklet 0aPtychoramphus aleuticus 0aMarine debris 0aPlastic pollution1 aShugart, Gary W.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 117, no. 1-2 p.496-498dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.01.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01949naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014700168300001600315520073500331592002801066650001901094650002301113650002601136650003901162653002901201653002301230653002201253653002901275653003901304700002201343700002701365773011401392856008401506852000901590655001201599IND60603069620221119101016.0180712e20150717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060306962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2015.05.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovell, Arnau10aEffects of supercritical fluid chromatography conditions on enantioselectivity and performance of polyproline-derived chiral stationary phases  ap. 138-143.  aThe chromatographic behaviour and performance of four polyproline-derived chiral stationary phases (CSPs) were tested using supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC). A series of structurally related racemic compounds, whose enantioseparation was proved to be sensitive to the type of mobile phase used in NP-HPLC, were chosen to be tested in the SFC conditions. Good enantioselection ability was shown by the CSPs for the analytes tested in the new conditions. Resolution, efficiency and analysis time, were considerably improved with respect to NP-HPLC when CO2/alcohol mobile phases were used. Monolithic columns clearly show enhanced chromatographic parameters and improved performance respect to their bead-based counterparts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aenantioselectivity 3aequipment performance 3asupercritical fluid chromatography 0aPoly-l-proline oligomers 0aMonolithic columns 0aEnantioseparation 0aChiral stationary phases 0aSupercritical fluid chromatography1 aMéndez, Alberto,1 aMinguillón, Cristina,0 tJournal of chromatography.g2015 July 17, v. 1403 p.138-143dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2015.05.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02228naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245006300162300001400225506002800239520099100267592002801258506003701286650001101323650001101334650001201345650001401357650002601371650001601397653001501413653001701428653001601445653001001461653001301471700002001484700001901504700001901523700001801542700001601560773013301576856007601709852000901785655001201794IND60785335720221207105006.0090701e199808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078533572DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha2813292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSESTRAS, Radu E.10aTypes of tree growth and fruit setting in F1 apple hybrids  ap. 44-48.  aResource is Open Access  a1656 F1 hybrid apple seedlings, belonging to 127 combinations, have been screened according to their growing and fruit setting types, as it was phenotypically expressed. LESPINASSE (1977; 1992) amalgamated these two traits into a single one which was named ";ideotype";. The screened F1 individuals have been considered as resembling one of the following four architectural ideotypes of the trees indicated by Lespinasse: columnar, spur, standard and weeping. Different ratios of spur, standard and columnar F1 individuals were obtained depending on genitors and on the fact that a certain genitor had been used as a maternal or paternal partner in direct/reciprocal crosses. The monogenic inheritance of the columnar ideotype, proposed by Kelsey and Brown (1992); Lane (1992), does not seem to be the only genetic mechanism involved in the inheritance of this trait. Our experimental results suggest the polygenic determination of this ideotype as more probable than the monogenic one.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapples 3afruits 3ahybrids 3aideotypes 3amonogenic inheritance 3atree growth 0aF1 hybrids 0agrowing type 0ainheritance 0aapple 0aideotype1 aARDELEAN, Marin1 aGHIDRA, Vasile1 aCORDEA, Mirela1 aCOSTIN, Lucia1 aBORS, Agnes0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g1998 Aug., v. 28, no. 1 p.44-48dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha2813293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02011naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245007100168520082400239592002801063650002401091650002701115650000901142650001701151650003101168650001201199650001701211650002001228650001401248700002401262700002501286700003201311700002901343700002001372700002701392773012201419856007501541852000901616655001201625IND60771383320221121230457.0220325e20220309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077138332DNAL7 a10.3390/nu140611502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStoiloudis, Panagiotis 14aThe Role of Diet and Interventions on Multiple Sclerosis: A Review  aMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammation and neurodegeneration. The most prominent clinical features include visual loss and sensorimotor symptoms and mainly affects those of young age. Some of the factors affecting its pathogenesis are genetic and/or environmental including viruses, smoking, obesity, and nutrition. Current research provides evidence that diet may influence MS onset, course, and quality of life of the patients. In this review, we address the role of nutrition on MS pathogenesis as well as dietary interventions that show promising beneficial results with respect to MS activity and progression. Investigation with large prospective clinical studies is required in order to thoroughly evaluate the role of diet in MS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautoimmune diseases 3acentral nervous system 3adiet 3ainflammation 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aobesity 3apathogenesis 3aquality of life 3asclerosis1 aKesidou, Evangelia 1 aBakirtzis, Christos 1 aSintila, Styliani-Aggeliki 1 aKonstantinidou, Natalia 1 aBoziki, Marina 1 aGrigoriadis, Nikolaos 0 tNutrients.g2022 Mar. 09, v. 14, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu140611503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03695naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245013800170300001600308520179900324592002802123596004902151650002402200650000902224650001502233650002402248650001502272650002602287650001502313650001302328650001702341650001302358650001502371650001602386650001702402650001402419650001902433653002202452653001702474653003602491653001902527653003002546653002602576653002702602653003502629700002002664700002002684700001902704700002502723700002402748700002902772700006002801773015202861856008303013852000903096655001203105IND60791764820221117235522.0220831e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079176482DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI-01-22-0011-TA2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAppidi, Manasa R.10aDevelopment of an Experimental Approach to Achieve Spatially Resolved Plant Root-Associated Metaproteomics Using an Agar-Plate System  ap. 639-649.  aPlant–microbe interactions in the rhizosphere play a vital role in plant health and productivity. The composition and function of root-associated microbiomes is strongly influenced by their surrounding environment, which is often customized by their host. How microbiomes change with respect to space and time across plant roots remains poorly understood, and methodologies that facilitate spatiotemporal metaproteomic studies of root-associated microbiomes are yet to be realized. Here, we developed a method that provides spatially resolved metaproteome measurements along plant roots embedded in agar-plate culture systems, which have long been used to study plants. Spatially defined agar “plugs” of interest were excised and subsequently processed using a novel peptide extraction method prior to metaproteomics, which was used to infer both microbial community composition and function. As a proof-of-principle, a previously studied 10-member community constructed from a Populus root system was grown in an agar plate with a 3-week-old Populus trichocarpa plant. Metaproteomics was performed across two time points (24 and 48 h) for three distinct locations (root base, root tip, and a region distant from the root). The spatial resolution of these measurements provides evidence that microbiome composition and expression changes across the plant root interface. Interrogation of the individual microbial proteomes revealed functional profiles related to their behavioral associations with the plant root, in which chemotaxis and augmented metabolism likely supported predominance of the most abundant member. This study demonstrated a novel peptide extraction method for studying plant agar-plate culture systems, which was previously unsuitable for (meta)proteomic measurements.  aPublisher supplied data  aDE-AC05-00OR22725cU.S. Department of Energy 3aPopulus trichocarpa 3aagar 3achemotaxis 3acommunity structure 3ametabolism 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3apeptides 3aplant health 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3arhizosphere 3aroot systems 3aroot tips 3aspace and time 0aagar-plate system 0aagar removal 0aconstructed microbial community 0ametaproteomics 0aplant-associated microbes 0areductionist approach 0arhizosphere microbiome 0aspatially resolved microbiomes1 aBible, Amber N.1 aCarper, Dana L.1 aJawdy, Sara S.1 aGiannone, Richard J.1 aHettich, Robert L.,1 aMorrell-Falvey, Jennifer1 aAbraham, Paul E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2685-91230 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2022 Aug., v. 35, no. 8 p.639-649dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl43555x1943-77067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-01-22-0011-TA3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010000165300001600265520113600281592002801417650001501445650002101460650001201481650002301493650001601516650002001532650002401552650001901576650002101595651001001616700001801626700001701644700001301661700001401674773011001688856008101798852000901879655001201888IND60573924720221116141523.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057392472DNAL7 a10.1007/s11355-016-0306-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jingwei10aVisual ecology: exploring the relationships between ecological quality and aesthetic preference  ap. 107-118.  aHigh ecological quality and an attractive environment are usually two primary goals of landscape design. Understanding the relationships between ecological quality and visual aesthetic preference is needed to reach the two goals simultaneously. However, previous work has not provided definite answers regards these relationships. The current study took place in the riparian zone of Xuzhou, China, to check ecological quality using the qualitat del bosc de ribera (or riparian forest quality) index, and visual aesthetic preference using pictures as surrogates, which were assessed by undergraduate students. Regression analysis revealed a U-shaped distribution of ecological quality in relation to visual aesthetic preference, which indicated that, with higher ecological quality, the visual aesthetic preference could be higher or lower, and a lower ecological quality implied a medium visual aesthetic preference. In addition, enhancing the cover quality (introducing more native plants and reducing man-made elements) of riparian vegetation was an efficient way to align the ecological goal with a visually pleasing landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3acollege students 3aecology 3aindigenous species 3alandscaping 3aplants (botany) 3aregression analysis 3ariparian areas 3ariparian forests 3aChina1 aWang, Ronghua1 aLuo, Pingjia1 aXing, Lu1 aSun, Tong0 tLandscape and ecological engineering.g2017 Jan., v. 13, no. 1 p.107-118dSpringer Japanx1860-18717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11355-016-0306-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03516naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008100166300001600247520159300263592002801856596011301884596007201997596002602069650002502095650003602120650002502156650001702181650002102198650001702219650001102236650001602247650001302263650001802276650001902294650001202313650001402325650001702339650001902356650002102375650001902396650001302415650002902428653001602457653001902473653000802492700001702500700001602517700001802533700002402551700005702575700005102632773015202683856008202835852000902917655001202926IND60791764920221117235611.0220831e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079176492DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI-02-22-0049-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Zhenzhen10aInvolvement of Arabidopsis Acyl Carrier Protein 1 in PAMP-Triggered Immunity  ap. 681-693.  aPlant fatty acids (FAs) and lipids are essential in storing energy and act as structural components for cell membranes and signaling molecules for plant growth and stress responses. Acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) are small acidic proteins that covalently bind the fatty acyl intermediates during the elongation of FAs. The Arabidopsis thaliana ACP family has eight members. Through reverse genetic, molecular, and biochemical approaches, we have discovered that ACP1 localizes to the chloroplast and limits the magnitude of pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. Mutant acp1 plants have reduced levels of linolenic acid (18:3), which is the primary precursor for biosynthesis of the phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA), and a corresponding decrease in the abundance of JA. Consistent with the known antagonistic relationship between JA and salicylic acid (SA), acp1 mutant plants also accumulate a higher level of SA and display corresponding shifts in JA- and SA-regulated transcriptional outputs. Moreover, methyl JA and linolenic acid treatments cause an apparently enhanced decrease of resistance against P. syringae pv. tomato in acp1 mutants than that in WT plants. The ability of ACP1 to prevent this hormone imbalance likely underlies its negative impact on PTI in plant defense. Thus, ACP1 links FA metabolism to stress hormone homeostasis to be negatively involved in PTI in Arabidopsis plant defense. Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

This project was implemented to remove and document marine debris from five coastal National Park Service units in Alaska. Approximately 80km of coastline were cleaned with over 10,000kg of debris collected. Marine debris was found at all 28 beaches surveyed. Hard plastics were found on every beach and foam was found at every beach except one. Rope/netting was the next most commonly found category, present at 23 beaches. Overall, plastic contributed to 60% of the total weight of debris. Rope/netting (14.6%) was a greater proportion of the weight from all beaches than foam (13.3%).

Modern imaging technologies enable the automatic visualization of multi-parameter for characterization of biological samples, reducing subjectivity and optimizing the analysis process. Furthermore, the combination of two or more imaging techniques has contributed to discovering new physicochemical tools and interpreting datasets in real time. RESULTS: We present a new method for automatic characterization of seed quality based on the combination of multispectral and X-ray imaging technologies. We proposed an approach using X-ray images to investigate internal tissues because seed surface profile can be negatively affected, but without reaching important internal regions of seeds. An oilseed plant (Jatropha curcas) was used as a model species, which also serves as a multi-purposed crop of economic importance worldwide. Our studies included the application of a normalized canonical discriminant analyses (nCDA) algorithm as a supervised transformation building method to obtain spatial and spectral patterns on different seedlots. We developed classification models using reflectance data and X-ray classes based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The classification models, individually or combined, showed high accuracy (> 0.96) using reflectance at 940 nm and X-ray data to predict quality traits such as normal seedlings, abnormal seedlings and dead seeds. CONCLUSIONS: Multispectral and X-ray imaging have a strong relationship with seed physiological performance. Reflectance at 940 nm and X-ray data can efficiently predict seed quality attributes. These techniques can be alternative methods for rapid, efficient, sustainable and non-destructive characterization of seed quality in the future, overcoming the intrinsic subjectivity of the conventional seed quality analysis.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017/15220-7cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2018/03802-4cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2018/03807-6cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2018/01774-3cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2019/04127-1cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo 3aJatropha curcas 3aX-radiation 3aagricultural industry 3aalgorithms 3aanthropogenic activities 3adata collection 3adiscriminant analysis 3aoilseed crops 3areflectance 3aseed quality1 aMascarin, Gabriel Moura1 aSilva, Lúcia Cristina Aparecida Santos1 aArthur, Valter1 aCarstensen, Jens Michael1 aBoelt, Birte1 aBarboza da Silva, Clíssia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7279-32600 tPlant methods.g2021 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.9-9dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4337304x1746-48117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13007-021-00709-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245009100170300001600261520138100277592002801658650001501686650000901701650001301710650000901723650001101732650001101743650000701754650001501761700002901776700002601805773010101831856007901932852000902011655001202020IND60439922320221120022134.0151024e199712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043992232DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10042287159842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeelhoed, Jeanine S.10aEffects of sulphate and pH on the plant-availability of phosphate adsorbed on goethite  ap. 241-249.  aThe adsorption of phosphate on metal (hydr)oxides may be influenced by the pH and by the adsorption of other ions. In this study, the influence of sulphate and pH on phosphate adsorption on goethite and the availability to plants of adsorbed phosphate was examined. Maize plants were grown on suspensions of goethite with adsorbed phosphate, containing the same total amount of phosphate and either 0.11 mM or 2.01 mM sulphate at pH 3.7, 4.6 or 5.5. The uptake of phosphorus by the plants increased with the larger sulphate concentration and decreasing pH. Mean P uptake in the treatment with 2.01 mM sulphate and pH 3.7 was 55 µmol plant⁻¹, whereas in the treatment with 0.11 mM sulphate and pH 5.5 it was 2 µmol plant⁻¹. Batch adsorption experiments using³² P and speciation modelling of ion adsorption showed that in the presence of sulphate, the phosphate concentration in solution strongly increased with decreasing pH, due to competitive adsorption between sulphate and phosphate on goethite. Modelled phosphate concentrations in solution in the uptake experiment were all below 0.6 µM and correlated well with the observed P uptake. This correlation indicates that the strong influence of the sulphate concentration and pH on the plant-availability of adsorbed phosphate results from the competition between sulphate and phosphate for adsorption on goethite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acorn 3agoethite 3aions 3amodels 3aoxides 3apH 3aphosphorus1 aVan Riemsdijk, Willem H.1 aFindenegg, Günter R.0 tPlant and soil.g1997 Dec., v. 197, no. 2 p.241-249dKluwer Academic Publishersx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10042287159843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01782naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001900191245007800210300001800288506007600306520036100382592002800743506003700771650001500808650002600823650002300849650002000872650003100892650001800923650002200941650002200963653001300985653001500998653002001013653002501033653001701058700003101075700002401106773011301130856008401243852000901327655001201336IND60599520820221207101839.0180702e20140910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059952082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.07.0772doi7 aPMC41539922pmcid7 a251971482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhosh, Arun K.13aAn enantioselective synthesis of a MEM-protected aetheramide A derivative  ap. 5191-5194.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAetheramides A and B are very potent anti-HIV agents.

For long‐lived, migratory species, the non‐breeding period represents a critical time for investment in self‐maintenance and restoration of body condition, which in many species is linked to fitness. However, the relationships between age, non‐breeding foraging behaviour and fitness remain largely unexplored. We performed a cross‐sectional study, investigating age‐related variation in the foraging activity, distribution and diet of an extremely long‐lived seabird, the wandering albatross Diomedea exulans, during the non‐breeding period. Eighty‐two adults aged 8–33 years were tracked with geolocator‐immersion loggers, and body feathers were sampled for stable isotope analysis. We tested for variation in metrics of foraging behaviour and linked age‐related trends to subsequent reproductive performance. There was an age‐related decline in the number of landings (a proxy of foraging effort) during daylight hours, and a decrease in body feather δ¹³C values in older males but not females, yet this did not accompany an age‐related shift in distributions. Males conducted fewer landings than females, and the sexes showed some spatial segregation, with males foraging further south, likely due to their differential utilization of winds. Although younger (<20 years) birds had higher foraging effort, they all went on to breed successfully the following season. In contrast, among older (20+ years) birds, individuals that landed more often were more likely to defer breeding or fail during incubation, suggesting they have lower foraging success. As far as we are aware, this is the first demonstration of an age‐specific carry‐over effect of foraging behaviour in the non‐breeding period on subsequent reproductive performance. This link between foraging behaviour and fitness in late but not early adulthood indicates that the ability of individuals to forage efficiently outside the breeding period may be an important driver of fitness differences in old age.

Once optimized the conditions, tyrosine was detected in standard solutions by square wave voltammetry, achieving a linear range comprised between 30 and 500 μM, with a detection limit equal to 4.4 μM. To detect tyrosine in serum, the interference of another amino acid i.e. tryptophan was hindered using a sample treatment with an extraction cartridge.

This study aimed to investigate probiotic viability as well as physico-chemical and sensory characteristics of synbiotic sucrose-free mango nectar during 45-days storage time. Mango nectar samples were prepared by incorporating L. plantarum as a probiotic, inulin (0, 4, and 8%) as a prebiotic texturizer, and stevia (0, 2, and 4%) as a natural low-calorie sweetener. The results showed that the addition of inulin and stevia up to 4% improved the viability of L. plantarum bacteria during 45-day storage. The pH and TSS values of nectar samples were significantly (P < 0.05) decreased during storage time, while the viscosity values of the samples were increased. The addition of stevia and inulin improved the L* and b* color values of nectar samples, while a* value of the samples decreased. Finally, the mango nectar sample containing 4% stevia and 4% inulin was selected as optimum formulation because of the higher viability of probiotic bacteria, and acceptable physico-chemical and organoleptic properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3aconsumer demand 3ainulin 3amangoes 3ameasurement 3anectar 3apH 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3astorage time 3aviability 3aviscosity0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2021 Oct., v. 15, no. 5 p.4226-4232dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-021-00998-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03490naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011000171300001400281520169100295592002801986650002502014650001502039650001802054650001902072650001202091650000902103650002002112650001502132650001202147650001302159650004302172650002102215650001002236650002302246650000902269650002402278650001902302650002202321650001202343650001402355650001202369650001302381653001002394653001902404653002202423653002102445653001302466653001302479700001702492700001902509700001802528700002202546700002102568700001602589700001702605700001502622773010902637856008502746852000902831655001202840IND60525833220221117203241.0190401e20160615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052583322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2016.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorais-Costa, F.10aIn vitro and in vivo action of Piptadenia viridiflora (Kunth) Benth against Haemonchus contortus in sheep  ap. 43-49.  aAnthelminthic resistant populations of Haemonchus contortus are a major problem in sheep rearing, but plant extracts may offer viable alternative treatments. In our preliminary studies, Piptadenia viridiflora was frequently selected by sheep grazing in the Cerrado. The present research evaluated its in vitro and in vivo anthelmintic activity. The HPLC chromatograms of P. viridiflora aqueous extract (AE) and ethanolic extract (EE) showed the presence of flavonoids. The total condensed tannin (proanthocyanidin) was 0.2 and 1.01% in AE and EE, respectively. In an egg hatching inhibition (EHI) test, the LC90 of AE was 2.4mg/mL, and, of EE, was 2.1mg/mL. After tannin extraction, higher EHI and lower LC90 were observed. In a larval development inhibition test, the LC90 of AE was 13.66mg/g of fecal culture. The highest dose of AE administered to mice (203.0mg/kg bw) was well tolerated, suggesting low toxicity. In vivo, AE was orally administered to lambs at 283mg/kg bw, and, at weeks one, two, and three post-treatment, the mean fecal egg count (FEC) was significantly lower than in untreated lambs (P<0.05). Blood parameters were normal and similar in untreated and treated sheep. For all lamb groups, the mean total serum protein was significantly higher at week two post-treatment than at other evaluated periods (P<0.05). Piptadenia viridiflora extracts had low condensed tannin content and exhibited high anthelminthic efficacy in vitro and significantly reduced FEC. Tannins were not shown to be the principal components affecting EHI, hence it is necessary to isolate and characterize the principal active P. viridiflora compounds, and to assess their possible synergism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aPiptadenia 3aanthelmintics 3ablood proteins 3acerrado 3aeggs 3afecal egg count 3aflavonoids 3agrazing 3ahatching 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ain vitro studies 3alambs 3alarval development 3amice 3aoral administration 3aplant extracts 3aproanthocyanidins 3arearing 3asynergism 3atannins 3atoxicity 0aSheep 0aPlant extracts 0aBrazilian savanna 0aBlood parameters 0aSemiarid 0aToxicity1 aBastos, G.A.1 aSoares, A.C.M.1 aCosta, E.G.L.1 aVasconcelos, V.O.1 aOliveira, N.J.F.1 aBraga, F.C.1 aDuarte, E.R.1 aLima, W.S.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2016 June 15, v. 223 p.43-49dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2016.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03348naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006200151245009500213520178000308592002802088650001902116650001302135650002002148650001202168650001502180650001302195650001402208650002202222650001302244650002502257650002802282650001302310650001802323650001902341650001002360650001002370653002802380653000802408653001502416653002302431653001502454653002902469700002102498700006002519700005902579773010902638856008602747852000902833655001202842IND60751268420221119080717.0211029e20220103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075126842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1106032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, Harriet V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7964-936010aNitrogen use efficiency, partitioning, and storage in cool climate potted Pinot Noir vines  aOptimal timing of nitrogen (N) fertilizer to promote N use efficiency (NUE) in cool climate wine regions is largely unknown. One year-old potted Vitis vinifera L. (Vitaceae) cv. Pinot Noir vines were subjected to soil applied ¹⁵N-labelled calcium nitrate (5.5 atom%) fertilizer at four application timings (budbreak to fruit set, fruit set to veraison, veraison to harvest, or spread evenly across the growing season) over two growing seasons (2017/18 and 2018/19) at a rate of 12 g N vine⁻¹. Annual vine parts (leaves and clusters) were collected at commercial harvest in both 2018 and 2019 and the remaining vine was destructively harvested during winter dormancy. Vines were separated into organs (leaves, clusters, shoot, trunk, and roots) and organ dry matter was determined before samples were ground into a fine powder to determine total N percentage and ¹⁵N atom percentage using flash combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry (varioPYRO cube coupled to Isoprime100 mass spectrometer). Compared to the average values obtained from the other treatments, the veraison to harvest treatment significantly reduced whole vine dry matter by 39.1% and vine NUE by 42.1%. Yield was also reduced by 12.9% compared to the budbreak to fruit set treatment. NDF, defined here as the proportion of N within the vine (or vine organ) that was derived from fertilizer N, and overall vine total N content was lower in the veraison to harvest treatment due to the reduction of root and shoot NDF content. This suggests that for young, actively growing vines in cool climates, limiting N applications until veraison is inefficient and ineffective. No significant differences in NUE, N partitioning or N storage were observed between the other fertilizer N application timings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3abudbreak 3acalcium nitrate 3aclimate 3acombustion 3adormancy 3afruit set 3amass spectrometry 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient use efficiency 3aripening 3aspectrometers 3atotal nitrogen 3avines 3awines 0aNitrogen use efficiency 0a15N 0aFertilizer 0aApplication timing 0aGrapevines 0aCool climate viticulture1 aSwarts, Nigel D.1 aJones, Joanna E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9137-54861 aKerslake, Fiona1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1005-43820 tScientia horticulturae.g2022 Jan. 03, v. 291 p.110603-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1106033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02000naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245015300167300001600320520081000336592002801146650001401174650001501188650001101203650000701214650002501221653000801246653000801254653002001262653002001282653001301302700002401315700002001339700001801359700001801377700002001395773009601415856008201511852000901593655001201602IND60091610420221121040510.0161021e20130215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009161042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2012.07.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgi, Hirotsugu10aAcceleration of deposition of Aβ1−40 peptide on ultrasonically formed Aβ1−42 nucleus studied by wireless quartz-crystal-microbalance biosensor  ap. 200-205.  aHigh-frequency (∼ 55MHz) wireless quartz-crystal microbalance biosensor was used for studying heterogeneous deposition behavior of Aβ1−40 peptide on Aβ1−42 nuclei, which were grown under the stirring agitation and 200-kHz ultrasonication at pH 2.2, 4.6, and 7.4. The deposition reaction was monitored over 40h, and the deposition rate was deduced. Among the agitation nuclei, the maximum deposition rate was observed on the nucleus grown at pH 4.6. However, ultrasonication nucleus grown at pH 7.4 produced much larger deposition rate, despite the same β-sheet concentration. This result indicates that local structural modulation is caused in the nucleus by ultrasonication, which adsorbs the Aβ peptide more actively than other nuclei. The resultant deposits clearly show oligomeric structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagitation 3abiosensors 3amixing 3apH 3aultrasonic treatment 0aQCM 0aAβ 0aUltrasonication 0aDeposition rate 0aOligomer1 aFukushima, Masahiko1 aUesugi, Kentaro1 aYagi, Hisashi1 aGotō, Yūji,1 aHirao, Masahiko0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2013 Feb. 15, v. 40 p.200-205dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2012.07.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245013500160300001600295520176400311592002802075650002502103650002302128650001102151650001102162650001102173650002002184650001502204650002302219650002502242650001002267700001302277700001702290700001602307773009102323856008102414852000902495655001202504IND50067775420221116142211.0140811e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006777542DNAL7 a10.1007/s11099-013-0036-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLang, Y.10aExperimental and simulated light responses of photosynthesis in leaves of three tree species under different soil water conditions  ap. 370-378.  aWater deficit is one of the major limiting factors in vegetation recovery and restoration in loess, hilly-gully regions of China. The light responses of photosynthesis in leaves of two-year old Prunus sibirica L., Hippophae rhamnoides L., and Pinus tabulaeformis Carr. under various soil water contents were studied using the CIRAS-2 portable photosynthesis system. Light-response curves and photosynthetic parameters were analyzed and fitted using the rectangular hyperbola model, the exponential model, the nonrectangular hyperbola model, and the modified rectangular hyperbola model. Under high light, photosynthetic rate (P N) and stomatal conductance (g ₛ) were steady and photoinhibition was not significant, when the relative soil water content (RWC) varied from 56.3–80.9%, 47.9–82.9%, and 33.4–92.6% for P. sibirica, H. rhamnoides, and P. tabulaeformis, respectively. The light-response curves of P N, the light compensation point (LCP), and the dark respiration rate (R D) were well fitted using the above four models. The nonrectangular hyperbola was the best model in fitting the data; the modified rectangular hyperbola model was the second, and the rectangular hyperbola model was the poorest one. When RWC was higher or lower than the optimal range, the obvious photoinhibition and significant decrease in P N with increasing photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) were observed in all three species under high light. The light saturation point (LSP) and apparent quantum yield also decreased significantly, when the upper limit of PPFD was 200 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹. Under these circumstances, only the modified rectangular hyperbola model was able to fit well the curves of the light response, LCP, LSP, R D, and light-saturated P N.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHippophae rhamnoides 3aPinus tabuliformis 3aPrunus 3aleaves 3amodels 3aphotoinhibition 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3astomatal conductance 3atrees1 aWang, M.1 aZhang, G.

These biomass conversion inhibitors, particularly vanillin, are known to repress translation activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have reported that the mRNAs of ADH7 and BDH2 were efficiently translated under severe vanillin stress despite marked repression of overall protein synthesis. In this study, we found that expression of VFH1 (YLL056C) was also significantly induced at the protein level by severe vanillin stress. Additionally, we demonstrated that the VFH1 promoter enabled the protein synthesis of other genes including GFP and ALD6 under severe vanillin stress. It is known that transcriptional activation of VFH1 is induced by furfural and HMF, and we verified that Vfh1 protein synthesis was also induced by furfural and HMF. The null mutant of VFH1 delayed growth in the presence of vanillin, furfural and HMF, indicating the importance of Vfh1 for sufficient tolerance against these inhibitors. The protein levels of Vfh1 induced by the inhibitors tested were markedly higher than those of Adh7 and Bdh2, suggesting the superior utility of the VFH1 promoter over the ADH7 or BDH2 promoter for breeding optimized yeast strains for bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abiomass 3abreeding 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3afurfural 3agenes 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3alignocellulose 3amessenger RNA 3amutants 3aprotein content 3aprotein synthesis 3atranscriptional activation 3avanillin 3ayeasts1 aIshida, Yoko1 aKato, Sae1 aIwaki, Aya1 aIzawa, Shingo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4920-24500 tYeast.g2018 July, v. 35, no. 7 p.465-475dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39201x0749-503X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/yea.33133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03583naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001300145245011800158300001800276500001900294500002000313520188500333592002802218596004902246596004602295650001702341650001502358650001902373650001102392650002702403650002002430650001702450650002802467650002402495650001402519650001402533650001902547650000902566650001402575650001602589650001702605650001802622650002402640650001102664650001602675700001202691700001702703700001202720700001602732700005602748773012502804856007902929852000903008655001203017IND60707010820221123042229.0200812e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070701082DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.153282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Li10aMagnetic mesoporous carbon material based electrochemical sensor for rapid detection of penicillin sodium in milk  ap. 2435-2442.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn recent years, to increase growth rate and prevent infectious diseases, an excessive use of antibiotics in livestock breeding processes has resulted in the presence of antibiotic residues in animal foods. In this experiment, a new kind of electrochemical sensor is prepared based on magnetic mesoporous hollow carbon microspheres (MHM) as a penicillinase (Pen X) adsorption carrier to rapidly detect penicillin sodium (Pen G), named Pen X/MHM/MGCE. The MHM‐adsorbed penicillinase can be separated from the solution by magnetic attraction and fixed on a magnetic glassy carbon electrode by physical adsorption, which is easy to operate and avoids the interference of a crosslinking agent at the active site of the enzyme. A differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) method is used to immerse the working electrode in test samples containing different concentrations of penicillin sodium solution with 0.5 mg/mL oxidized hematoxylin. According to the quantitative relationship between the current value and the concentration of penicillin sodium, the concentration of penicillin sodium in the tested samples can be determined. The detection range of the sensor is 10⁻⁸ to 10⁻² mg/mL, the linear relationship is good (R² = 0.9983), and the detection limit (LOD) is 2.655 × 10⁻⁷ mg/mL (S/N = 3). The detection of penicillin sodium in milk using a standard addition method shows good recovery. Furthermore, the proposed method has the advantages of a wide detection range, good enzyme immobilization capacity, good precision and stability, convenient cleaning, and recycling of solid materials. Thus, it can successfully achieve rapid detection in milk samples. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The sensor provides a low detection limit and high recovery rate of electrode material; therefore, the sensor can realize the rapid and quantitative detection of penicillin sodium in milk.  aPublisher supplied data  a20180201044NYcKey Program of Jilin Province  a3D518L714071cJilin Educational Committee 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3abeta-lactamase 3acarbon 3across-linking reagents 3adetection limit 3afood science 3aglassy carbon electrode 3aimmobilized enzymes 3alivestock 3amagnetism 3amicroparticles 3amilk 3aoxidation 3apenicillins 3aporous media 3arapid methods 3asensors (equipment) 3asodium 3avoltammetry1 aXiu, Yi1 aHan, Baoqing1 aLiu, Lu1 aNiu, Xiaodi1 aWang, Hongsu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6696-93030 tJournal of food science.g2020 Aug., v. 85, no. 8 p.2435-2442dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.153283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01750naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245008100164300001800245520055800263592002800821650002600849650002200875650002300897650002300920650002200943650001700965650001500982650001300997653002101010653002601031653002601057653003301083653002501116700001701141773011301158856008401271852000901355655001201364IND60599521120221120191544.0180702e20140910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059952112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.07.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Aili10aPrenylation of tyrosine and derivatives by a tryptophan C7-prenyltransferase  ap. 5199-5202.  a7-DMATS from Aspergillus fumigatus and SirD from Leptosphaeria maculans catalyse a C7-prenylation of l-tryptophan and an O-prenylation of l-tyrosine in nature, respectively.

The unique growth pattern of spontaneous regression (SR) after progressive (P) growth in canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT) provides a valuable cancer model to study the genome-wide differences in samples between the two stages of growth. In this study, Affymetrix analysis was performed based on the canine genome to compare the gene expression profiles of CTVT P- and SR-phase tumors. A total of 459 (278 up-regulated and 181 down-regulated) genes were identified as being differentially-expressed during the SR phase by the 2-fold method. Further analysis of these genes revealed that the expression of three genes associated with IL-6 production –TIMD-4, GPNMB and PLTP – was significantly higher in SR-phase tumors than in P-phase tumors; these results were also confirmed by real time RT-PCR in tumor tissues of beagles. In addition, we found that Th17-related genes were over-expressed in the SR phase, suggesting autoimmune responses involvement in tumor regression. Although the interaction between CTVT and host immunity were partially investigated in previous studies, our results enable us to gain new insight into the genes and possible mechanisms involved in tumor regression and reveal potentially useful targets for cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeagle 3aautoimmunity 3adevelopmental stages 3adogs 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahosts 3amicroarray technology 3amodels 3aremission 3atherapeutics 3atranscriptome 3atransmissible venereal tumors 2aAnimals 2aCell Differentiationxgeneticsximmunology. 2aDog Diseasesxgeneticsximmunology. 2aDogs 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic 2aInterleukin-6xgenetics 2aNeoplasm Regression, Spontaneousxgeneticsximmunology. 2aT-Lymphocytesximmunology 2aTh17 Cellsximmunology 2aTransforming Growth Factor betaxgenetics 2aVenereal Tumors, Veterinaryxgeneticsximmunology. 0aCTVT 0aAffymetrix 0aIPA 0aTIL 0aIL-6 0aTh171 aLiao, Albert Tai-Ching1 aJan, Tong-Rong1 aWang, Yushan,1 aLei, Han-Jung1 aTsai, Mong-Hsun1 aChen, Mo-Fen1 aLee, Chien-Yueh1 aLin, Yi-Chen1 aChu, Rea-Min1 aLin, Chen-Si0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2013 Feb. 15, v. 151, no. 3-4 p.207-216dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2012.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245017900168520134800347592002801695650002001723650001701743650001301760650000701773650002401780650001201804653004701816653001901863653002501882653003101907653001701938653001601955700001401971700001701985700001802002700001302020773009202033856008602125852000902211655001202220IND60750831220221120180112.0211009e20220101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075083122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1228742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Xueying10aOne-pot alkali cutting-assisted synthesis of fluorescence tunable amino-functionalized graphene quantum dots as a multifunctional nanosensor for sensing of pH and tannic acid  aHerein, a one-pot alkali cutting-assisted synthesis approach has been developed to gain fluorescence (FL) tunable amino functionalized GQDs (NH₂-GQDs), which exhibit concentration- and excitation-dependent FL behaviors, due to the self-assembled J-type aggregation effect and different electronic transitions governed by graphene basal plane and functional groups. While NH₂-GQDs possess brighter FL emission than pristine GQDs, owning to the functionalization of amino groups with strong electron withdrawing ability. Particularly, the pH-dependent FL behavior of NH₂-GQDs further reflects the FL emission mechanism originated from the intrinsic zigzag sites and introduced amino and carboxylic groups, which is available for pH sensing. Moreover, the NH₂-GQDs also show a FL quenching upon reaction with tannic acid (TA), resulting in the construction of a FL turn-off TA sensing platform. A good linear relationship is obtained between logarithm of FL intensity (log F) and TA concentration in a linear dynamic range of 1–40 μM and a limit of detection of 43.3 nM (3σ/s, n = 9) is achieved, with a precision of 0.08% RSD at a concentration level of 5 μM (n = 9). This work features a simple and direct approach to acquire multifunctional nanosensor, providing great potential for further applications in chem/biosensing.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3agraphene 3apH 3asensors (equipment) 3atannins 0aAmino-functionalized graphene quantum dots 0aAlkali cutting 0aTunable fluorescence 0aMultifunctional nanosensor 0apH detection 0aTannic acid1 aYu, Jiayu1 aYan, Yongcun1 aSong, Weiling1 aHai, Xin0 tTalanta.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 236 p.122874-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1228743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245008800171300002000259520127100279592002801550650001101578650002601589650002001615650002001635650001201655650001001667650002701677650000901704650001801713650001701731650002601748650002601774650002401800700001801824700001601842700001301858700001701871773010701888856008901995852000902084655001202093IND60586069420221120072424.0171116e20171116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058606942DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b026922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Shunchun10aData Processing Method for the Measurement of Unburned Carbon in Fly Ash by PF-SIBS  ap. 12093-12099.  aIn thermal power plants, the unburned carbon in fly ash is an important indicator of the boiler combustion efficiency. Online detection of unburned carbon content could benefit the optimization of the boiler operation. In this paper, a new scheme named as the particle flow-spark induced breakdown spectra was employed for the rapid measurement of unburned carbon content in fly ash. In order to improve the measurement accuracy, a series of data processing methods which mainly include spectral interference correction and quantitative analysis methods were specially carried out in this paper. The W 248.88 nm and Fe 254.60 nm lines were used as the correction lines to obtain the true C 247.86 nm integral intensity from the overlapping peak, and then the corrected intensity was substituted into the multivariate linear model to improve the measurement accuracy. The result shows that the regression coefficient (R²) of the multivariate calibration model and the averaged absolute error are 0.987 and 0.15 wt %, respectively. The limit of detection of unburned carbon content determination is 0.28 wt %. These results are enough to meet the requirement of power industry standard and the commercial instruments for online analysis of unburned carbon in fly ash.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acombustion efficiency 3adetection limit 3aenergy industry 3afly ash 3afuels 3ainformation processing 3airon 3alinear models 3apower plants 3aprocessing technology 3aquantitative analysis 3aregression analysis1 aZhang, Lifeng1 aXu, Jialong1 aYu, Ziyu1 aLü, Zhimin,0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Nov. 16, v. 31, no. 11 p.12093-12099dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.7b026923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245011400163300001400277520175600291592002802047650001202075650002302087650001002110650001302120650001602133650001502149650001602164650004402180650001902224650001302243650001102256650001102267650001802278650001802296650001802314651001102332700002002343700002002363700002302383700002202406773008902428856004802517852000902565655001202574IND4484073120221120205023.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448407312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-010-9564-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBardy, Marion10aPodzolisation and exportation of organic matter in black waters of the Rio Negro (upper Amazon basin, Brazil)  ap. 71-88.  aIn the Rio Negro basin, podzols develop at the expense of clay-depleted laterites through localized and spectacular weathering fronts. This natural process leads to the remobilization of previously accumulated organic matter (OM) which is redistributed within soil profiles and exported towards rivers, hence their typical black coloration. We investigate the fate of OM in the soilâwater continuum in the Rio Negro basin through description of the composition of OM potentially mobile at different stages of podzol development and exploration of evidence for contributions from different soil horizons to the exportation of OM into waters. OM was water-extracted from seven key soil samples from a sequence representative of the transition between latosol and podzol on the low elevation plateaux of the Rio Negro basin, thus enabling following both vertical and lateral differentiations. The chemical structure of freeze-dried samples, investigated using 13C nuclear magnetic resonance and thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM), shows contrasting features depending on the horizon considered. The bulk features of water extracts were first compared with samples collected in the water-tables and rivers draining the soil sequence. A molecular level comparison was then performed with groundwater draining the well-developed podzol. This approach evidenced a contribution from deep horizons of well-developed podzols. It highlights that OM is certainly remobilised after being accumulated in Bh horizons during the development of podzols through accumulation of OM redistributed from surface horizons. The identification of specific compounds opens new perspective to trace a âpodzolic originâ of OM in drainage networks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPodzols 3achemical structure 3acolor 3adrainage 3agroundwater 3ahydrolysis 3amethylation 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorganic matter 3aplateaus 3arivers 3arunoff 3asoil horizons 3asoil profiles 3asoil sampling 3aBrazil1 aDerenne, Sylvie1 aAllard, Thierry1 aBenedetti, Marc F.1 aFritsch, Emmanuel0 tBiogeochemistry.g2011 Oct., v. 106, no. 1 p.71-88dSpringer-Verlagx0168-25637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-010-9564-9  aDNAL 7aarticle03254naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008400166300001800250520166000268592002801928596007301956596007302029596003602102650001902138650002502157650001502182650001402197650001202211650002102223650002002244650001702264650001702281650002802298650001502326650002202341650001802363650001502381650001402396650001302410651001802423700001402441700002002455700001802475700005702493773010702550856008202657852000902739655001202748IND60676956320221122131808.0191122e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067695632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10646-019-02117-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Ying-Chao10aEvaluation of the sensitivity of Microhyla fissipes tadpoles to aqueous cadmium  ap. 1150-1159.  aCadmium (Cd) exposure is harmful to amphibians in natural environments and the Cd concentration is a key parameter in water monitoring. Cd pollution has been a severe issue in the Yangtze River and its southern reaches in recent years. Acute toxicity assays were employed to determine the tolerance limits of Cd for Microhyla fissipes tadpoles and five different concentrations of Cd (0, 50, 100, 200 and 300 μg/L) were involved to detect its chronic effects on metamorphosis, growth, locomotion, genotoxicity and enzymatic activities of M. fissipes tadpoles. The results showed that the 24-h and 48-h LC₅₀ values of Cd on M. fissipes tadpoles were 2591.3 μg/L and 1567.9 μg/L, respectively, and the presumable non-lethal concentration obtained was 172.2 μg/L. During the 70-day chronic toxicity assays, Cd showed negative impacts on survival, growth, metamorphosis and the frequency of erythrocytes nuclear abnormality of M. fissipes tadpoles. However, the Cd exposure caused the increased body size and condition of tadpoles at complete metamorphosis (GS46). The tadpoles exposed to 200 μg/L of Cd exhibited degraded locomotor performance at GS46. Weight increments of tadpoles were inhibited at Day 14 and massive deaths were observed over the next 14 days. The enzymatic activities of tadpoles experienced a shock response stage (GS30-GS35) and a complete recovery stage (GS36-GS41) in all treatments. However, the enzymatic activities (except alkaline phosphatase) of tadpoles at GS46 increased after Cd exposure, especially at high concentrations. In summary, Cd is a threat to M. fissipes tadpoles as that causes reduced fitness.  aPublisher supplied data  aLQ16C040001cZhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China  aLQ16C040001cZhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China  a31500308cYoung Scientists Fund 3aacute toxicity 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aamphibians 3abody size 3acadmium 3achronic toxicity 3aenzyme activity 3aerythrocytes 3agenotoxicity 3alethal concentration 50 3alocomotion 3along term effects 3ametamorphosis 3amonitoring 3apollution 3atadpoles 3aYangtze River1 aTang, Yun1 aChen, Zhi-Qiang1 aChen, Jing-Yi1 aDing, Guo-Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2485-27100 tEcotoxicology.g2019 Dec., v. 28, no. 10 p.1150-1159dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870048x0963-92927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-019-02117-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02988naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009900170520147200269592002801741650002701769650001701796650003101813650001701844650002201861650002101883650000901904650004301913650001401956650002201970650002601992650001802018650002102036650001302057650002802070653003402098653002102132653004402153700001702197700001602214700001302230700001502243700001702258700001502275773010902290856008602399852000902485655001202494IND60751268820221119080702.0211029e20220103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075126882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1106122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xianyan10aComprehensive mining of storage oil related genes in developing seed of Abelmoschus esculentus  aOkra (Abelmoschus esculentus), famous for its desired nutritional and medicinal values, could accumulate approximately 20% (w/w) seed oil dominated with unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs). However, the mechanism of oil biosynthesis and metabolic regulation in its seeds remains poorly understood. Here, storage oil profiles and transcriptome of okra seeds at different developmental stages were analyzed. Seed oil accumulated at a high rate during 21 to 28 days after flowering (DAF). Total of 136.6 million clean reads were obtained and 109,171 unigenes were assembled from the seed transcriptome. Differentially expressed genes among three developing stages of seeds were functionally annotated into the storage lipid metabolism pathway. Comparative analysis was performed for structural genes and transcription factor genes that participate in fatty acid biosynthesis, triacylglycerol assembly, oil body formation, and triacylglycerol degradation. A complex regulating network was built accordingly. Additionally, expressions of 12 key functional genes responsible for okra oil accumulation were examined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), demonstrating that RNA-sequencing data were reliable. This study will facilitate further investigation of molecular mechanism responsible for unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and oil accumulation in plant seed, providing valued reference for creating new okra varieties with better lipid composition and high oil yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbelmoschus esculentus 3abiosynthesis 3agene expression regulation 3alipid bodies 3alipid composition 3alipid metabolism 3aokra 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aseed oils 3asequence analysis 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome 3atriacylglycerols 3aunigenes 3aunsaturated fatty acids 0aOkra (Abelmoschus esculentus) 0aSeed development 0aLipid biosynthesis and oil accumulation1 aMu, Xiaopeng1 aCui, Hongli1 aSun, Yan1 aXue, Jinai1 aJia, Xiaoyun1 aLi, Runzhi0 tScientia horticulturae.g2022 Jan. 03, v. 291 p.110612-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1106123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245006900174300002000243520134500263592002801608650001701636650001901653650002201672650001301694650001601707650001501723650001001738650001301748650001201761650002401773700002001797700001601817773010701833856008901940852000902029655001202038IND60586069620171214000000.0171116e20171116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058606962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b029972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMüller, Karsten10aHydrogen Storage in Formic Acid: A Comparison of Process Options  ap. 12603-12611.  aFormic acid (53 g H₂/L) is a promising liquid storage and delivery option for hydrogen for fuel cell power applications. In this work we compare and evaluate several process options using formic acid for energy storage. Each process requires different steps, which contribute to the overall energy demand. The first step, i.e. production of formic acid, is thermodynamically unfavorable. However, the energy demand can be reduced if a formate salt is produced via a bicarbonate route instead of forming the free acid from hydrogen and carbon dioxide. This bicarbonate/formate approach also turns out to be comparatively more efficient in terms of hydrogen release than the formic acid route even though less energy efficient, catalytic decomposition of formic acid has the advantage of reaching higher volumetric power densities during hydrogen release. Efficiencies of all process options involve aqueous media and are dependent on concentration. Heating water leads to additional energy demand for hydrogen release and thus lowers the overall efficiency. Separation and purification of hydrogen contribute a minor impact to the overall energy demand. However, its effect on efficiency is not negligible. Other process options like thermal decomposition of formic acid or direct formic acid fuel cells thus far do not appear competitive.  aPublisher supplied data 3abicarbonates 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy efficiency 3aformates 3aformic acid 3afuel cells 3afuels 3ahydrogen 3aliquids 3athermal degradation1 aBrooks, Kriston1 aAutrey, Tom0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Nov. 16, v. 31, no. 11 p.12603-12611dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.7b029973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03278naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024003500122040001800157100001800175245011600193300001800309520179400327592002802121650001602149650001602165650001402181650001302195650001202208650002002220650001502240650001702255650001402272650001202286650001302298650001202311650001502323650001702338653001702355653001802372653002402390653002202414700002102436700002102457700002902478700002702507700002002534773012802554856008102682852000902763655001202772IND60652375820221118021920.0190712e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065237582DNAL7 a30732660 307326602pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800180039202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoth, Katie A14aThe intergenerational transmission of family meal practices: a mixed-methods study of parents of young children  ap. 1269-1280.  aThe current mixed-methods study explored qualitative accounts of prior childhood experiences and current contextual factors around family meals across three quantitatively informed categories of family meal frequency patterns from adolescence to parenthood: (i) ‘maintainers’ of family meals across generations; (ii) ‘starters’ of family meals in the next generation; and (iii) ‘inconsistent’ family meal patterns across generations. Quantitative survey data collected as part of the first (1998–1999) and fourth (2015–2016) waves of the longitudinal Project EAT (Eating and Activity in Adolescents and Young Adults) study and qualitative interviews conducted with a subset (n 40) of Project EAT parent participants in 2016–2017. Surveys were completed in school (Wave 1) and online (Wave 4); qualitative interviews were completed in-person or over the telephone. Parents of children of pre-school age (n 40) who had also completed Project EAT surveys at Wave 1 and Wave 4. Findings revealed salient variation within each overarching theme around family meal influences (‘early childhood experiences’, ‘influence of partner’, ‘household skills’ and ‘family priorities’) across the three intergenerational family meal patterns, in which ‘maintainers’ had numerous influences that supported the practice of family meals; ‘starters’ experienced some supports and some challenges; and ‘inconsistents’ experienced many barriers to making family meals a regular practice. Family meal interventions should address differences in cooking and planning skills, aim to reach all adults in the home, and seek to help parents who did not eat family meals as a child develop an understanding of how and why they might start this tradition with their family.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescence 3aadolescents 3achildhood 3achildren 3acooking 3adata collection 3ainterviews 3ameals (menu) 3aparenting 3aparents 3aplanning 3asurveys 3atelephones 3ayoung adults 0aFamily meals 0aMixed methods 0aPre-school children 0aIntergenerational1 aUy, Marc James A1 aWinkler, Megan R1 aNeumark-Sztainer, Dianne1 aFisher, Jennifer Orlet1 aBerge, Jerica M0 tPublic health nutrition.g2019 May, v. 22, no. 7 p.1269-1280dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800180039203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010400170300001400274520173500288592002802023650002802051650001102079650002502090650002202115650001902137650001002156650002202166650001502188650001102203650002302214650001702237650002502254650002502279650001002304650001002314651001302324651001202337651001202349651001102361653004202372653002202414653001102436700002102447700002202468700002102490700001902511700002102530773010902551856008502660852000902745655001202754IND60525833720221117203228.0190401e20160615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052583372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2016.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDebeljak, Zoran10aFirst insights into the genetic diversity of Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto (s.s.) in Serbia  ap. 57-62.  aCystic echinococcosis (CE) caused by Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto (s.s.) is a cosmopolitan zoonotic infection which is endemic in Serbia where it is subject to mandatory reporting. However, information on the incidence of the disease in humans and prevalence of hydatid infection in livestock remains limited. We used sequenced data of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox 1) mitochondrial gene to examine the genetic diversity and population structure of E. granulosus (s.s.) from intermediate hosts from Serbia. We also compared our generated nucleotide sequences with those reported for neighbouring European countries. Echinococcus canadensis was molecularly confirmed from pig and human hydatid isolates. E. granulosus (G1) was confirmed from sheep and cattle hydatid isolates as well as the first molecular confirmation in Serbia of E. granulosus G2 in sheep and E. granulosus G3 in sheep and cattle hydatid isolates. The Serbian E. granulosus (s.s.) parsimony network displayed 2 main haplotypes (SB02 and SB05) which together with the neutrality indices were suggestive of bottleneck and/or balancing selection. Haplotype analysis showed the presence of the common E. granulosus haplotype described from other worldwide regions. Investigation of the pairwise fixation (Fst) index suggested that Serbian populations of E. granulosus (s.s.) from sheep and cattle hosts showed moderate genetic differentiation. Six of the Serbian haplotypes (SB02-SB07) were shared with haplotypes from Bulgaria, Hungary and/or Romania. Further studies using a larger number of hydatid isolates from various locations across Serbia will provide more information on the genetic structure of E. granulosus (s.s.) within this region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinococcus granulosus 3acattle 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3adisease incidence 3aechinococcosis 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ahumans 3aintermediate hosts 3amitochondria 3anucleotide sequences 3apopulation structure 3asheep 3aswine 3aBulgaria 3aHungary 3aRomania 3aSerbia 0aEchinococcus granulosus sensu stricto 0aGenetic diversity 0aSerbia1 aBoufana, Belgees1 aInterisano, Maria1 aVidanovic, Dejan1 aKulisic, Zoran1 aCasulli, Adriano0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2016 June 15, v. 223 p.57-62dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2016.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04391naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245013100197300001800328500002000346520234800366592002802714650002402742650002002766650002102786650002202807650002202829650002402851650003202875650002502907650002202932650001702954650002202971650002602993650001903019650002203038650000903060650001303069650002303082650002003105650002603125650002503151650001603176650001303192650001303205650001103218650001903229650001103248651001303259700006403272700002403336700003003360700006003390700006003450700001903510700001903529773012203548856007403670852000903744655001203753IND60769052920221119133638.0220301e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076905292DNAL7 a10.1111/are.157312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManan, Hidayah1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7818-902410a16S rRNA sequences of Exiguobacterium spp. bacteria dominant in a biofloc pond cultured with whiteleg shrimp, Penaeus vannamei  ap. 2029-2041.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBiofloc technology is being applied increasingly in shrimp aquaculture. Many countries have adopted this technology to increase shrimp aquaculture production. Owing to its major importance, this study was conducted to identify the bacterial population from biofloc aquaculture shrimp pond water of Singkir Laut, Kedah, Malaysia. Samples of mature biofloc were collected from the biofloc pond water at different shrimp ages (day of culture [DOC]): DOC30, DOC60 and DOC90. Overall, 43 sequences of bacterial species were blasted, which were identified as Exiguobacterium spp., Bacillus spp., Vibrio spp., Acinetobacter junii, Cobetia marina, Rheinheimera aquimaris and Pseudoalteromonas spp. These bacterial species were identified mostly from heterotrophic plate count agar. The bacterial species of Exiguobacterium aestuarii, Exiguobacterium profundum and Exiguobacterium aurantiacum were identified with 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 98.45–99.44%. Bacterial species of Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus velezensis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus safensis and Bacillus subtilis were identified with 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 98.81–99.21%. Bacterial species of Vibrio diazotrophicus, Vibrio diabolicus, Vibrio natriegens and Vibrio harveyi were identified with 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 98.03–99.19%. Bacteria from Rheinheimera aquimaris were also identified with 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 98.69–99.26%; this bacterium is a novel bacterium identified from biofloc samples of the present study and has not been reported from biofloc samples in any previous study. Exiguobacterium spp. from the novel strains of E. aestuarii and E. profundum were identified as dominant, with 23 of 43 samples isolated from a shrimp pond at time points DOC30, DOC60 and DOC90; these bacteria are Gram‐variable rod‐shaped organisms that are capable of producing extracellular enzyme activity to break down chemical structures, thereby helping to remove organic compounds from aquaculture waste. Exiguobacterium spp. are usually identified in tidal flat sediments and on muddy sea coasts.

VD₃ dissolved in 5 mL ethanol corresponding to 0.3 to 6.0% mass of GA, was blended in 5.0% w/v GA solution, followed by freeze drying. The encapsulation efficiency decreased while loading capacity increased with an increased amount of VD₃. At the highest VD₃ level, the loading capacity (3.47%) was the highest, and the encapsulation efficiency (61.24%) was satisfactory, and the treatment was further studied. The magnitude of negative zeta‐potential increased from 3.1 to 31.0 mV at pH 2.0 to 7.4. During the 100‐day storage at 3 °C of capsules reconstituted at pH 2.0 to 7.4, the hydrodynamic diameter decreased at all pH conditions, most evident for reduction to 81.3 nm at pH 7.4, and no precipitation was observed, indicating the significance of steric repulsion on capsule stability. Bioaccessibility of VD₃ in capsules (95.76%) was significantly higher than the nonencapsulated VD₃ (68.98%). The in vivo pharmacokinetic study in Sprague–Dawley rats after a single‐dose of 300 µg VD₃ showed the area‐under‐curve of serum 25(OHD) level in 48 hr of the encapsulation treatment was 4.32‐fold of the nonencapsulated VD₃ and more than twice higher than the VD₃‐GA physical mixture. During 2‐week supplementation of 60 µg VD₃/d, rats receiving capsules or physical mixture had 25(OH)D levels of at least 81 ng/mL higher than that of the nonencapsulated VD₃ group. The studied encapsulation system holds great potential as a value‐added ingredient to supplement VD₃ in beverages with a wide pH range. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The findings of this study demonstrated the improved dispersion stability and absorption of vitamin D₃ after encapsulation in gum arabic. The capsules exhibited good dispersion stability across a pH range between 2.0 and 7.4, showing potential application in beverages. Furthermore, the enhanced absorption of VD₃ after encapsulation highlights the nutritional benefits of the studied encapsulation system.  aPublisher supplied data  aTEN00487cUSDA NIFA Hatch Projects  a223984cUSDA NIFA Hatch Projects  cThe University of Tennessee 3aabsorption 3abeverages 3abioavailability 3ablood serum 3acholecalciferol 3aencapsulation 3aethanol 3agum arabic 3ahydrodynamics 3aingredients 3apH 3apharmacokinetics 3avalue added 3azeta potential1 aWang, Tiannan1 aD'Souza, Doris1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7388-46741 aDia, Vermont1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2804-43231 aChen, Guoxun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6226-40501 aZhong, Qixin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6071-342X0 tJournal of food science.g2020 Aug., v. 85, no. 8 p.2368-2379dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.153403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245008500168300002000253520153300273592002801806650001501834650001201849650001301861650001801874650003101892650001901923650002101942650001201963700002201975773013801997856008002135852000902215655001202224IND60586069920221120072341.0171116e20171116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058606992DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b071512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAwasthi, Ankur A.10aExcited-State Proton Transfer on the Surface of a Therapeutic Protein, Protamine  ap. 10306-10317.  aProton transfer reactions on biosurfaces play an important role in a myriad of biological processes. Herein, the excited-state proton transfer reaction of 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (HPTS) has been investigated in the presence of an important therapeutic protein, Protamine (PrS), using ground-state absorption, steady-state, and detailed time-resolved emission measurements. HPTS forms a 1:1 complex with Protamine with a high association constant of 2.6 × 10⁴ M–¹. The binding of HPTS with Protamine leads to a significant modulation in the ground-state prototropic equilibrium causing a downward shift of 1.1 unit in the acidity constant (pKₐ). In contrast to a large number of reports of slow proton transfer of HPTS on biosurfaces, interestingly, HPTS registers a faster proton transfer event in the presence of Protamine as compared to that of even the bulk aqueous buffer medium. Furthermore, the dimensionality of the proton diffusion process is also significantly reduced on the surface of Protamine that is in contrast to the behavior of HPTS in the bulk aqueous buffer medium, where the proton diffusion process is three-dimensional. The effect of ionic strength on the binding of HPTS toward PrS suggests a predominant role of electrostatic interaction between anionic HPTS and cationic Protamine, which is further supported by molecular docking simulations which predict that the most preferable binding site for HPTS on the surface of Protamine is surrounded by multiple cationic arginine residues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aacidity 3aarginine 3abinding sites 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aionic strength 3amolecular models 3aprotons1 aSingh, Prabhat K.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 Nov. 16, v. 121, no. 45 p.10306-10317dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-61067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b071513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02485naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245008100209300001800290520111900308592002801427650004101455650001701496650002301513650001301536650001701549650002001566650001001586650001801596650001501614650002001629650002201649650001401671650001001685650002401695650001001719700002201729700003201751700002501783700003301808773010701841856008201948852000902030655001202039IND60676956920221122100401.0191122e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067695692DNAL7 a10.1007/s10646-019-02124-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmaral, Karina D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3371-069610aEffect of azadirachtin on mortality and immune response of leaf-cutting ants  ap. 1190-1197.  aLeaf-cutting ants are difficult pests to control because they have numerous defense strategies and are highly selective in their plant harvesting choices. The search for effective pest control methods that have minimal negative effects on the environment has been continuous. Azadirachtin, a compound extracted from the neem tree (Azadirachta indica), is a promising alternative for the control of various pests, as it is toxic to some insects but readily degrades in the environment. In this study, we evaluated the effects of azadirachtin on the mortality, through topical exposure to the compound, and immune response, by introducing an artificial antigen into leaf-cutting ants Atta sexdens and Acromyrmex subterraneus subterraneus. Azadirachtin caused death to minor and major workers of both species in a concentration-dependent manner. Topical application of the compound did not diminish the immune response of ants in a microfilament encapsulation assay. Azadirachtin showed no effect on the immune response of workers but increased worker mortality, which indicates its potential as an ant control agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcromyrmex subterraneus subterraneus 3aAtta sexdens 3aAzadirachta indica 3aantigens 3aazadirachtin 3acontrol methods 3adeath 3aencapsulation 3aharvesting 3aimmune response 3aleaf-cutting ants 3amortality 3apests 3atopical application 3atrees1 aGandra, Lailla C.1 aOliveira, Marco Antonio de,1 ade Souza, Danival J.1 aDella Lucia, Terezinha M.

Due to the ubiquitous presence of these fungi in food and potential risk for human health, a rapid and sensitive in vitro detection assay is required. Analytical methods for OTA detection/identification are generally based on liquid–liquid extraction, clean-up using an immunoaffinity column (IAC), and identification by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD). However, IACs are costly and have a short lifespan. Therefore, an interesting approach would appear to be the design and chemical synthesis of a mimotope peptide simulating mycotoxin-specific antibodies. We have developed a promising alternative method that is based on the use of peptides which are able to bind to specific chemical functions and/or molecular structures. Accordingly, a number of peptides (derived from the structures of major redox proteins) were selected and produced by chemical solid phase syntheses. The ability of such peptides to bind to ochratoxin A was evaluated by HPLC. The peptide NF04 (structurally derived from an oxidoreductase enzyme), which was found to be the sole potently reactive compound among tested molecules, was further evaluated in a peptide-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (peptide-based ELISA), thus confirming its specific interaction with ochratoxin A.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aPenicillium 3aantibodies 3abiosensors 3acarcinogenicity 3achemical structure 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afluorescence 3afungi 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahuman health 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3aochratoxin A 3apeptides 3aproteins 3arisk 3asynthesis 0aPeptide binding 0aPeptide-based assay 0aOchratoxin A 0aMycotoxin1 aAndreotti, N.1 aHassine, A.

The most prominent inhibitory effect was observed for clomipramine, which at a concentration of 2 μM, prevented aorta constriction in response to low and moderate doses of 5HT and multiply attenuated it in response to high doses (10 μM). The inhibitors of the 5HT-transporter attenuated the strength of norepinephrine-induced aorta constriction by 40–60% and eliminated long-term tonic constriction. Application of clomipramine or fluoxetine on the vessels preliminarily constricted by norepinephrine resulted in 100% relaxation, which was maintained in the presence of the NO-synthase inhibitor L-NAME. The inhibitors of the 5HT-transporter decreased but did not prevent 5HT-induced [Ca²⁺]cyₜ increase in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) of the aorta even at high concentrations. Clomipramine and fluoxetine did not affect the vasopressin-induced [Ca²⁺]cyₜ increase in SMCs and the strength of constriction of isolated aorta rings. We found that the sensitivity of the rat aorta to the vasoconstrictor effect of 5HT and the role of the 5HT-transporter in regulation of the vascular tone increased with aging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaorta 3acalcium 3acalcium signaling 3amyocytes 3anorepinephrine 3arats 3aserotonin 3asmooth muscle1 aMironova, G.

The influence of reaction conditions (pH and temperature) on the antigen–antibody reaction of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and its monoclonal antibody (anti-AFP) as a model of PPI was investigated in real time with a label-free fusion, where anti-AFP was covalently immobilized on the carboxylated silicon nitride sensor chips via amide bonds. Optimal pH and temperature were rapidly found by successive and alternate injections of AFP and the regeneration solution (glycine-HCl, pH 1.5) onto the anti-AFP immobilized sensor chip. The resultant optimized reaction conditions (30°C, pH 5.0) gave a 10 times higher detection limit, compared with the response under the commonly employed conditions (25°C, pH 7.4). The proposed system was revealed to provide rapid tracking response against the change in temperature and pH. Consequently, the proposed RIfS system has a potential for the effective tool towards PPI analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3amodels 3amonitoring 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apH 3aprotein-protein interactions 3areflectometry 3asilicon 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature 0aProtein–protein interaction 0aLabel-free detection 0aReflectometric interference 0aImmunosensor 0aMicrofluidics1 aTakama, Masaaki1 aMasubuchi, Manami1 aOoya, Tooru1 aTakeuchi, Toshifumi0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2013 Feb. 15, v. 40 p.247-251dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2012.07.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005300150245013800203300001600341520146300357592002801820650002301848650001501871650001301886650001101899650002001910650001601930650002901946650001801975650002101993650001202014700001602026700001902042700001402061700002102075700001402096700001602110773008702126856008502213852000902298655001202307IND60650895820221122172206.0200419e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065089582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2018.05.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWahab, H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9086-338414aThe identification and characterisation of carbonaceous interface layers of graphene using polarisation-dependent X-ray reflectometry  ap. 252-265.  aThe complex refractive index has been determined for graphene for linearly polarised light in p- and s-geometry at energies across the carbon 1s edge. The imaginary part was measured with absorption spectroscopy. The real part was derived using Kramers-Kronig transformations. Results have been validated by X-ray reflectometry of substrate-supported graphene. Theoretical modelling demonstrates that reflection spectra are strongly affected by the relative difference between the reflectance of graphene and its substrate. Measured reflection spectra show that graphene is often sandwiched between a carbonaceous layer of surface-adsorbates and another carbonaceous layer between graphene and substrate. Reflectometry distinguishes adventitious layers from the graphene because of a different energy-dependence of the refractive index. The carbonaceous interface layers can be modelled well with the refractive index function measured for an adventitious surface layer on silicon. The carbon observed at the substrate-interface may originate from the transfer of a graphene sheet from a deposition-substrate. The optically-effective thickness and anisotropy of adventitious carbonaceous layers can be extracted from reflectance spectra. The bonds of adventitious carbon tend to be normal to the basal plane of graphene. Transferred graphene typically has a substrate-interface three times its own thickness and is covered by one layer of surface adsorbates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray reflectivity 3aanisotropy 3agraphene 3amodels 3apolarized light 3areflectance 3areflectance spectroscopy 3areflectometry 3arefractive index 3asilicon1 aJansing, C.1 aMertins, H.-Ch1 aKim, J.H.1 aChoi, Shiu Hong,1 aGaupp, A.1 aTimmers, H.0 tCarbon.g2018 Oct., v. 137 p.252-265dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2018.05.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03520naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245012800187300001600315520134100331592002801672650002101700650002401721650001601745650002201761650002701783650003701810650001501847650001401862650001201876650003601888650003001924650001101954650002701965650002801992650003502020650006302055650004902118650002202167650002102189650001902210650003202229650004002261650002302301650001202324650002902336650003102365651001102396653001302407653002402420653001702444653004202461653002602503700002202529700002202551700002102573700002002594700002102614700002602635773011302661856005102774852000902825655001202834IND50087217720221121121609.0140412e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008721772DNAL7 a222144882pmid7 a10.1080/19440049.2011.6415082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoff, Rodrigo10aBioactivity-based screening methods for antibiotics residues: a comparative study of commercial and in-house developed kits  ap. 577-586.  aTwo bioactivity-based screening methods for antibiotic residue analysis (FAST Antimicrobial Screening Test and Premi®Test) were compared, in terms of sensitivity, with a new in-house developed tube test assay using Escherichia coli. Tests were performed using antibiotic standards, spiked samples and real incurred samples. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for several antibiotics was established and compared with maximum residue levels (MRLs) in samples. The results of all evaluated tests are compared with liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry multi-residue screening tests to compare parameters such as sample preparation, cost, time of analysis and confidence in results. For all tests, values of half the maximum residue limit (0.5 × MRL) were considered as a satisfactory target for a screening method. The potential and limitations of each method are discussed to indicate more rational and effective strategies for high-throughput residue monitoring and surveillance programmes. It was concluded that bioactivity-based screening methods are a useful tool, but the best compromise between minimum performance limits, cost and selectivity must be taken into account. For laboratories equipped with mass spectrometry, multi-class screening methods provide more specific responses with high sensitivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibiotic residues 3aantibiotics 3amass spectrometry 3amaximum residue limits 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amonitoring 3ascreening 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxanalysis 2aBiological Assayxmethods 2aCattle 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aDrug Residuesxanalysis 2aEscherichia colixdrug effects 2aFood Contaminationxanalysisxstatistics & numerical data. 2aGeobacillus stearothermophilusxdrug effects 2aKidneyxchemistry 2aLiverxchemistry 2aMeatxanalysis 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aMicrobiological Techniquesxmethods 2aMusclesxchemistry 2aPoultry 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 2aVeterinary Drugsxanalysis 0aBrazil 0abioassay 0ain-house validation 0amicrobiology 0aveterinary drug residues, antibiotics 0aanimal products, meat1 aRibarcki, Fabiana1 aZancanaro, Ivomar1 aCastellano, Lara1 aSpier, Carolina1 aBarreto, Fabiano1 aFonseca, Suzana Horta0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 29, no. 4 p.577-586dTaylor & Francis Groupx1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2011.641508  aDNAL 7aarticle02433naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009300157300002000250520147900270592002801749650001301777650001101790650001901801650001401820700001501834700001301849700001701862700001201879773014401891856007502035852000902110655001202119IND60782253920221120215235.0220706e20220705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078225392DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ta02795j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Yiyuan10aOrganic-conjugated polyanthraquinonylimide cathodes for rechargeable magnesium batteries  ap. 14111-14120.  aRechargeable Mg batteries (RMBs) are advantageous for large-scale energy storage because of the abundant reserves of Mg and high safety, but inorganic cathodes suffer from the availability of few species, low capacities, and sluggish Mg²⁺-diffusion kinetics. Organic materials provide more selections for RMB cathodes with designable structures. However, the open framework of organic RMB cathodes tends to store MgCl⁺ ions, largely affecting the energy density by making a certain amount of chlorine-containing electrolyte indispensable. Herein, three polyanthraquinonylimides (PAQIs; N14, N26 and P26) were synthesized and investigated as organic RMB cathodes. The large conjugated structure favors high capacities (122 mA h g⁻¹ for N26 and 164 mA h g⁻¹ for P26) and good cycling stabilities (115 mA h g⁻¹ for N26 and 111 mA h g⁻¹ for P26 maintained after 500 cycles), as well as good rate capabilities. More significantly, a comprehensive mechanism study demonstrated that the PAQIs stored Mg²⁺ rather than MgCl⁺ through carbonyl enolization, and N26 and P26 delivered high specific power densities of 2780 and 2431 W kg⁻¹, respectively, at 2000 mA g⁻¹. The present study developed high-performance organic PAQI cathodes for RMBs and demonstrated the Mg²⁺-storage mechanism, and suggests that organic materials based on the enolization chemistry of multi-electron transfer could be potential candidates for high-power RMB cathode materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3amagnesium1 aChen, Dong1 aRen, Xin1 aCao, Yuliang1 aXu, Fei0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 July 5, v. 10, no. 26 p.14111-14120dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ta02795j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03904naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006900145245015100214300001800365500001900383500002000402520198000422592002802402650002402430650001902454650002502473650001602498650000902514650001602523650001102539650001702550650001002567650000902577650001402586650001502600700008802615700008502703700006102788700008802849700007002937700006503007700007003072700006703142773012503209856007903334852000903413655001203422IND60707011620221120131804.0200812e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070701162DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.153442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuizellini, Glória Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3365-506514aThe anticholesterol oxidation effects of garlic (Allium sativum L.) and leek (Allium ampeloprasum L.) in frozen fish burgers submitted to grilling  ap. 2416-2426.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study determined the total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of garlic (Allium sativum L.) and leek (Allium ampeloprasum L.), as well as evaluated their anticholesterol oxidation potential in fish burgers. The total phenolic contents were 1.1 ± 0.1 mg GAE/g FW to garlic and 1.3 ± 0.4 mg GAE/g FW for leek. Leek extract showed antioxidant activity index (1.3 ± 0.01) in DPPH and β‐carotene/linoleic acid assay (66.5 ± 1.6%); however, in ORAC assay, no statistic differences were observed (P > 0.05). Besides that, bioactive compounds of garlic and leek extracts were identified by ultra‐high performance liquid chromatography‐electrospray by ionization‐mass spectrometry (UHPLC‐ESI‐MS). Fish burgers were prepared using different concentrations of leek and garlic and stored at −18 °C for 90 days. Thus, at days 0, 30, 60, and 90, the samples were grilled and analyzed as to their cholesterol and cholesterol oxidation products contents. Storage and grilling led to an increase in cholesterol oxidation products; however, addition of garlic and leek minimized cholesterol oxidation products formation. After 90 days, samples containing 3% leek + 0.5% garlic ware the most effective in inhibiting the cholesterol oxides formation during storage and showed the lowest increase in cholesterol oxidation products content (21.16%). Thus, the findings of this research indicate the potential application of garlic and leek as natural inhibitors of cholesterol oxidation in food. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Garlic and leek have a set of bioactive compounds with a wide antioxidant capacity when used in meat foods such as fish burgers. Garlic and leek used as natural antioxidants perform well in the shelf life of fish burgers and can be substitutes for synthetic antioxidants in this type of product. The presence of both vegetables reduced the formation of prejudicial products to human health generated during the shelf life of the food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium ampeloprasum 3aAllium sativum 3aantioxidant activity 3acholesterol 3afish 3afrozen fish 3agarlic 3ahuman health 3aleeks 3ameat 3aoxidation 3ashelf life1 aTorres, Elizabeth Aparecida Ferraz da Silva,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1012-14181 aFreitas, Rosana Aparecida Manólio Soares1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6907-10211 aSaldanha, Tatiana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4291-46391 aSawaya, Alexandra Christine Helena Frankland1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7524-66281 aGamallo, Ormindo Domingues1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3335-36141 aSoares, Maiara Jurema1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4225-04811 ade Oliveira, Vanessa Sales1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7866-04961 aSampaio, Geni Rodrigues1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7763-46640 tJournal of food science.g2020 Aug., v. 85, no. 8 p.2416-2426dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.153443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245010200163300001800265520157400283592002801857596005601885650001201941650002301953650001101976650002001987650002602007650003702033650001502070650000902085650001902094650001702113650000902130650000902139650001702148650001302165650001102178700005502189700001602244700001502260700001302275700001702288700001902305773010702324856008202431852000902513655001202522IND60676957220221120142938.0191122e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067695722DNAL7 a10.1007/s10646-019-02134-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Borui10aRice busk biochar treatment to cobalt-polluted fluvo-aquic soil: speciation and enzyme activities  ap. 1220-1231.  aRice busk biochar was mixed with cobalt (Co)-polluted soil to examine the efficacy of biochar for Co immobilization and detoxification in fluvo-aquic soil. The Co speciation (modified BCR sequential extraction), fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis and soil enzyme activities were investigated. In soil, the Co ions (acid-soluble fraction) could be uptake by biochar due to the microporous structure on the surface, as well as the oxygen-containing functional groups and conjugated structure in the molecular structure. Therefore, when the biochar concentration was lower than the optimum concentration (~6 g·kg⁻¹), there was transformation of Co from the acid-soluble fraction to the oxidizable fraction, resulting in lower environmental risk. However, if the biochar concentration continued increasing, the distribution coefficient of Co in the acid-soluble fraction increased (P < 0.05). The biochar could also reduce the toxicity of Co, resulting in the negative correlations between soil enzyme activities (FDA hydrolysis, urease and alkaline phosphatases) and Co in the acid-soluble fraction (r = –0.816, –0.928 and –0.908, respectively, P < 0.01). When the biochar concentration ranged from 5.83 to 6.76 g·kg⁻¹, the efficacy for Co immobilization and detoxification reached the maxima. To conclude, in fluvo-aquic soil, rice busk biochar is an effective amendment for immobilizing Co ions and reducing the toxicity of Co. The biochar concentration in soil should range from 5.83 to 6.76 g·kg⁻¹ to reach the optimum efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data  a20160939023cBeijing Municipal Education Commission 3abiochar 3achemical structure 3acobalt 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescein diacetate 3afluorescein diacetate hydrolysis 3ahydrolysis 3aions 3apolluted soils 3aporous media 3arice 3arisk 3asoil enzymes 3atoxicity 3aurease1 aHuang, Qing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5309-92761 aSu, Yuefeng1 aSun, Liuye1 aWu, Tong1 aWang, Guange1 aKelly, Ryan M.0 tEcotoxicology.g2019 Dec., v. 28, no. 10 p.1220-1231dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870048x0963-92927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-019-02134-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245016200215300001800377520157900395592002801974650001402002650002502016650002502041650001802066650001702084650002402101650001702125650001502142650001202157650001502169650001602184650001102200650001302211650001602224650001602240650001402256773013402270856008302404852000902487655001202496IND60751381220221120034616.0211023e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075138122DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-021-01005-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYazıcı, Sercan Özbek1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3406-429110aOptimization of all extraction process for phenolic compounds with maximum antioxidant activity from extract of Taraxacum assemanii by statistical strategies  ap. 4388-4402.  aThe aim of this study is to optimize all extraction steps that simultaneously provide the maximum extraction of phenolic compounds and the best antioxidant activity from Taraxacum assemanii using simplex-centroid design and Box-Behnken design (BBD). Analyzes were carried out to determine the best model to achieve based on total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), antioxidant radical activity (AAR), ferric reducing power (RP), and hydroxyl radicals scavenging activity (HRSA). Ethanol-water mixtures (68%) as solvent and maceration extraction combined with ultrasound pretreatment were found the best method for the extraction. Three independent variables (extraction time, extraction temperature, and liquid/solid ratio) for optimization of extraction conditions were evaluated. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) results revealed that extraction time and temperature had a significant influence on all responses. The maximum TPC (13.16 ± 0.91 mgGAE/gDW) and TFC (3.21 ± 0.56 mgQE/gDW) with the best AAR (173.45 ± 3.56 DPPH μM/gDW), RP (2.45 ± 0.45 AU) and HRSA (76.01 ± 2.67%) were observed under optimal extraction conditions, which are 46 °C, 37:1 solvent/solid ratio and 88 min. There is a good correlation between AAR, RP and HRSA with TFC. In addition, vitamin C and vitamin E contents in the plant were detected as 27.8 mg/100 g and 2.35 mg/100 g. The concentrations of five phenolic compounds were quantified in extracts by HPLC. Ferulic acid and caffeic acid concentrations were found to increase significantly after optimization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTaraxacum 3aanalysis of variance 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3acaffeic acid 3aexperimental design 3aferulic acid 3aflavonoids 3aliquids 3amaceration 3ameasurement 3amodels 3asolvents 3atemperature 3aultrasonics 3avitamin E0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2021 Oct., v. 15, no. 5 p.4388-4402dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-021-01005-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001900167245009200186300001600278520067500294592002800969650002300997650001901020650002701039650002201066650000901088650002001097650001101117650001601128650001101144650002101155650001901176650001601195650001001211650001701221650001301238650001501251650001301266650004401279650002201323650002101345650001101366650002401377650003301401650006101434650001901495650004101514650002101555650003901576650001701615650002101632700002301653700002201676700002001698700002101718700001801739773008501757856008401842852000901926655001201935IND4477062420221120044333.0141111e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447706242DNAL7 a215961082pmid7 a10.1016/j.fitote.2011.04.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBijak, Michał10aAnticoagulant effect of polyphenols-rich extracts from black chokeberry and grape seeds  ap. 811-817.  aBlood coagulation consists of a series of zymogens that can be converted by limited proteolysis to active enzymes leading to the generation of thrombin.

Water stress (WS) was imposed on 30-day-old plants for 2 weeks. Leaf RWC decreased significantly under WS conditions with simultaneous decrease in net photosynthetic rate (P N) and stomatal conductance (g ₛ). Even though no significant difference was observed between DT and DS varieties with regard to RWC, DT varieties were able to maintain significantly higher P N than DS varieties. Higher values of water use efficiency (WUE) were also observed in DT varieties during WS conditions. The decline in P N due to WS could be attributed to both reduction in g ₛ (i.e. stomatal limitation) and to reduction in chlorophyll content (Chl). No significant difference in leaf area index (LAI) was found between DT and DS types and LAI was not reduced by WS. Significant differences were found among the studied groundnut varieties, but not between DT and DS types, in terms of root, aboveground, and total dry mass. These growth parameters significantly decreased under WS conditions. Based on the results, a sequence of physiological responses in groundnut crop subjected to WS was postulated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArachis hypogaea 3achlorophyll 3aleaf area index 3aleaves 3apeanuts 3aphotosynthesis 3aphysiological response 3asoil water deficit 3astomatal conductance 3awater content 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency1 aThushara, S.

The clinical detrimental effects of tetanus have decreased immensely since the introduction of global vaccination programs, which depend on sustainable vaccine production. One of the major critical points in the manufacturing of these vaccines is the stable and reproducible production of high levels of toxin by the bacterial seed strains. In order to minimize time loss, the amount of TeNT is often monitored during and at the end of the bacterial culturing. The different methods that are currently available to assess the amount of TeNT in the bacterial medium suffer from variability, lack of sensitivity, and/or require specific antibodies. In accordance with the consistency approach and the three Rs (3Rs), both aiming to reduce the use of animals for testing, in-process monitoring of TeNT production could benefit from animal and antibody-free analytical tools.In this paper, we describe the development and validation of a new and reliable antibody free targeted LC-MS/MS method that is able to identify and quantify the amount of TeNT present in the bacterial medium during the different production time points up to the harvesting of the TeNT just prior to further upstream purification and detoxification. The quantitation method, validated according to ICH guidelines and by the application of the total error approach, was utilized to assess the amount of TeNT present in the cell culture medium of two TeNT production batches during different steps in the vaccine production process prior to the generation of the toxoid. The amount of TeNT generated under different physical stress conditions applied during bacterial culture was also monitored.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium tetani 3aanimals 3aantibodies 3abacterial culture 3acell culture 3aculture media 3amortality 3aneurotoxins 3atetanus 3atoxicity 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aTargeted LC-MS/MS 0aAntibody free protein quantification 0aTetanus vaccine 0aConsistency approach 0a3Rs principles1 aEsson, Raphael1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3973-47251 aAbachin, Eric1 aVanhamme, Melissa1 aDobly, Alexandre1 aCarpick, Bruce1 aUhlrich, Sylvie1 aDierick, Jean-François1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2291-86351 aVanhee, Celine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6634-37060 tTalanta.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 236 p.122883-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1228833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01506naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012800169300001800297520037100315592002800686650002100714650002100735650002300756650002300779650002300802650001100825653001800836653002400854653001400878653001900892653001600911653001100927773011300938856008401051852000901135655001201144IND60599522020221120191623.0180702e20140924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059952202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.07.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZarei, Maaroof12aA straightforward approach to 2-azetidinones from imines and carboxylic acids using dimethyl sulfoxide and acetic anhydride  ap. 5354-5357.  aThe direct synthesis of 2-azetidinones from imines and carboxylic acids under mild conditions is developed.

Early work in the 1950s yielded classifications of certain regimes of TDS and PE as “underdeveloped,” “bitter,” or “ideal,” with the modifiers “weak” or “strong” simply correlated with TDS. Although this standard is still widely used today, it omits a rich variety of sensory attributes perceptible in coffee. In this work, we used response surface methodology to evaluate the influence of TDS and PE on the sensory profile of drip brewed coffee. A representative wet‐washed Arabica coffee was roasted to three different levels (light, medium, or dark), with each roast then brewed to nine target brews that varied systematically by TDS and PE. Descriptive analysis found that 21 of the 30 evaluated attributes differed significantly across the brews for one or more experimental factors, yielding linear or second‐order response surfaces versus TDS and PE. Seven attributes exhibited a significant response surface for all three roast levels tested: burnt wood/ash flavor, citrus flavor, sourness, bitterness, sweetness, thickness, and flavor persistence. An additional seven attributes also showed a significant response surface fit across some but not all roasts. Importantly, sweetness exhibited an inverse correlation with TDS irrespective of roast, while dark chocolate flavor and blueberry flavor decreased with TDS for medium roast. These results provide new insight on how to optimize brewing conditions to achieve desired sensory profiles in drip brewed coffee. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This research provides guidance on how best to achieve specific flavor profiles in drip brewed coffee.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aCoffea arabica 3abitterness 3ablueberries 3achocolate 3aresponse surface methodology 3asensory evaluation 3asourness 3asweetness 3awood1 aRistenpart, William D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4935-63101 aGuinard, Jean‐Xavier1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6386-30550 tJournal of food science.g2020 Aug., v. 85, no. 8 p.2530-2543dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.153263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03870naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100004100169245019000210300001600400520173600416592002802152650002302180650002002203650001802223650002202241650001502263650001402278650002202292650002702314650001502341650002302356650001502379650001602394650001502410650001802425650002202443650006802465650006302533650002102596650005002617650002302667650003302690650005702723650002602780650002002806651001102826651001102837653002402848653002302872653001502895700003002910700002202940700002302962700001902985700002403004700001903028773011303047856005103160852000903211655001203220IND50087217920221121121702.0140412e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008721792DNAL7 a222926052pmid7 a10.1080/19440049.2011.6421022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira, Mauro Lúcio Gonçalves12aA multi-residue method for the determination of pesticides in high water content matrices by gas chromatography–single quadrupole mass spectrometry with electron ionisation (EI-GC/MS)  ap. 657-664.  aAn EI-GC/MS method for the determination of pesticide residues in vegetable matrices with high water content was validated using papaya samples. The validation of a multi-residue pesticide method was in agreement with national and international regulations enabling the Ministry of the Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply of Brazil to cover a large number of matrices and pesticide residues in its monitoring and control programmes. The extraction used 60 mL of ethyl acetate and 30 g of sample previously processed. After extraction, clean-up of all the extracts was carried out by percolation through GBC cartridges. The samples were then injected in an EI-GC/MS system. Calibration curves were prepared in quadruplet by fortifying blank extracts with a standard solution containing all the pesticides studied at 0.000, 0.005, 0.010, 0.020, 0.030, 0.050, 0.080 and 0.100 mg kg⁻¹. For the recovery study, blank samples were fortified at 0.010, 0.020, 0.030, 0.050 and 0.080 mg kg⁻¹ and then submitted to the extraction procedure. The complete procedure was repeated over four different days by two analysts. The regression parameters of calibration curves were calculated for each validation day. Linearity, selectivity, specificity, robustness, limits of detection and quantification were also assessed. The uncertainty was estimated for each analyte at each spike level studied.

We first aimed to measure the regeneration potential of a typical edge pool liverwort, Cladopodiella fluitans (Nees) H. Buch. We introduced C. fluitans in floating baskets in a restored peatland. We tested three fragment sizes (patches of 2cmÂ², stretched patches and shredded fine fragments of 0.1â1mm), two introduction densities (ratio between surface of collected areas and surface of restored areas of 1:5 and 1:10) as well as the effect of a straw mulch. After two years, the percentage covers of C. fluitans were five times larger in experimental units protected with straw than in those without protection. Yet, the fragment sizes and the densities tested had no effect on the regeneration of the liverwort. The second experiment aimed to test a moss layer transfer approach to restore plant diversity around pool margins. We tested four communities, dominated by (1) Sphagnum cuspidatum Hoffman, (2) Sphagnum fallax (H. Klinggraff) H. Klinggraff, (3) Sphagnum papillosum Linberg as well as (4) a mixed community composed of equal quantities of C. fluitans, S. cuspidatum and S. papillosum. We introduced plant material in two density ratios (1:5 and 1:10). Sphagnum mosses did colonize pool margins, and showed even more than 60% cover for some treatments after three growing seasons, but the recovery of the introduced vascular plants remained below 5% for most species. The establishment of pool vascular species thus seems to be more intricate than for bryophytes and specific introduction techniques might be needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBryopsida 3aSphagnum 3amosses and liverworts 3apeatlands 3astraw mulches 3avascular plants1 aNatacha, Fontaine1 aLine, Rochefort0 tAquatic botany.g2011 Feb., v. 94, no. 2 p.107-111dElsevier B.V.x0304-37707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2010.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02213naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245008400178300001400262520107000276592002801346650000901374650001601383650001201399650001601411650001201427650001201439650001501451650001701466650002401483650001301507650001501520650001401535650004301549700002901592773011601621856008101737852000901818655001201827IND60573921520221116141415.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057392152DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-016-1084-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeña-Uribe, César Arturo10aInsulin-induced changes in metabolism-related proteins during maize germination  ap. 77-84.  aInsulin regulates a wide range of metabolic processes in mammals, such as homeostasis and the breakdown of glucose. Recently, the existence of an insulin-related growth factor in maize (ZmIGF) and a possible receptor for this growth factor has been reported. This peptide exerts effects on plant growth and promotes germination by activating the target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathways, which is similar to the insulin response in mammals. In this study, we analyzed the insulin response in maize embryos using a proteomic approach. Our results indicated that insulin modulates the expression of proteins involved in processes, such as storage protein degradation, protein processing, redox and desiccation stress, and glucose metabolism. The involvement of TOR signaling pathways was analyzed using the TOR inhibitor, rapamycin. The results showed that the modulation of these proteins by insulin is independent of the TOR pathway. These results indicated that insulin promotes changes in metabolism-related proteins to ensure successful germination in maize.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3agermination 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin 3amammals 3ametabolism 3aplant growth 3aprotein degradation 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3arapamycin 3atarget of rapamycin signaling pathways1 aReyes de la Cruz, Homero0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2017 Jan., v. 128, no. 1 p.77-84dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-68577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-016-1084-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02377naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245012900128300001800257520096600275592002801241650002801269650002801297650002601325650002301351650001601374650001701390650003001407650001601437650001601453650001701469650002101486650001601507650001301523650001301536650001401549650001801563650000901581650002301590653002301613653001801636653003001654700001701684700001601701700001601717773015301733852000901886655001201895IND60705755020221120233556.0200807e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070575502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPawar, S.V.10aIn Vitro Evaluation of Different Fungicides and Bio-Agents against Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn Incitent of Sheath Blight of Rice  ap. 3622-3626.  aAn experiment was conducted in which different fungicides viz., Mancozeb (0.2% and 0.3%), Thiophanate methyl (0.1% and 0.2%), Hexaconazole (0.1% and 0.2%), Propiconazole (0.1% and 0.2%), Difenconazole (0.1% and 0.2%), Flusilazole + Carbendazim (0.05% and 0.1%), Azoxystrobin (0.1% and 0.2%) and antibiotic Validamycin (0.1% and 0.2%) and bioagents were used under in vitro to check their efficacy against Rhizoctonia solani causing sheath blight of rice.

To Maurice Maeterlinck, the Nobel laureate in literature, the most striking feature of plants was the diversity of flowers, organs that evolved to enhance sexual reproduction (1). Charles Darwin was fascinated with the rapid expansion and dominance of flowering plants (angiosperms) in the late Cretaceous, a phenomenon he called "the abominable mystery" (2). Along with the evolution of flowers came the need for plants to trigger flowering at the right time. On page 704 of this issue, Wahl et al. report that an internal cue—the sugar metabolite trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P)—helps to ensure that flowering occurs at the time optimal for successful reproduction (3).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngiospermae 3aevolution 3aflowering 3aflowers 3ametabolites 3asexual reproduction 3asugars1 aFrommer, Wolf B.0 tScience.g2013 Feb. 8, v. 339, no. 6120 p.659-660dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12346013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01736naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001200112245012500124300001800249520074200267592002801009650002701037650002201064650001601086650001601102650002001118650001501138650001301153650002001166653001201186653003001198700002001228773015301248852000901401655001201410IND60705755120221120233644.0200807e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070575512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRekhā,10aIn vitro Inhibitory Effect of Fungicides on Mycelium Growth of Colletotrichum graminicola Causing Anthracnose of Sorghum  ap. 3627-3629.  aSorghum is attacked by a broad range of plant pathogens.

In this study, we considered the time-span in which the species is suppressed during active (restoration actions) and passive (spontaneous) vegetation recovery. In particular, we envisaged that A. artemisiifolia growth and fitness may be strongly reduced and that the species may rapidly be suppressed within a short time during succession as a consequence of the increase of vegetation cover, both natural or artificially induced, in a disturbed area of northern Italy. Three different treatments were applied within an abandoned quarry area commonly invaded by A. artemisiifolia: (i) spontaneous succession i.e. (control), (ii) hayseed and (iii) a commercial seed mixture. We determined the effect of mixtures of grassland species, established from native hayseed or from a commercial seed mixture, on A. artemisiifolia growth and fitness traits over time in comparison to a non-seeded area left to spontaneous succession. The results demonstrated that, after the first growing season, compared with spontaneous succession, both commercial seed and hayseed resulted in a strong reduction of A. artemisiifolia abundance and growth rate, in terms of both vegetative and reproductive traits. After the second growing season, A. artemisiifolia was completely suppressed in the commercial seed treatment, and after the third growing season it was also suppressed in the spontaneous succession and hayseed treatments. This study indicated that both active and passive vegetation recovery (by niche filling and competitive exclusion) could be used as methods individually or in combination with other methods, such as mowing and biological control, to suppress A. artemisiifolia from anthropogenic habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmbrosia artemisiifolia 3abiological control 3acompetitive exclusion 3agrasslands 3agrowing season 3ahabitat destruction 3aindigenous species 3amowing 3aniches 3aperennials 3areproductive traits 3aseed mixtures 3aseed treatment 3avegetation cover 3aItaly 0aWeed 0aHayseed 0aBiodiversity gain 0aRestoration 0aSeeding 0aWeed management1 aMontagnani, Chiara1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2030-25351 aGilardelli, Federica1 aGuarino, Maria Francesca1 aCitterio, Sandra0 tActa oecologica.g2017 July, v. 82 p.32-40dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:2127x1146-609X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2017.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02574naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010100167300001400268520131900282592002801601650001801629650001201647650001201659650001901671650001201690650001101702650001401713650001801727650001801745650001301763650001901776650001701795650000901812650002701821650001601848650001601864700002301880700003101903773011601934856008102050852000902131655001202140IND60573921620221116141436.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057392162DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-016-1086-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCimò, Giuseppe10aMicrospore embryogenesis induced through in vitro anther culture of almond (Prunus dulcis Mill.)  ap. 85-95.  aAnther culture is one of the most widely used methods to induce gametic embryogenesis. The aim of this investigation was to induce microspore embryogenesis in almond (Prunus dulcis Mill.), through this technique. Anthers were cultured at the vacuolated developmental stage, and seven cultivars, two culture media and two temperature treatments were assessed. Although evidence of the microspore induction was observed in all the genotypes and treatments tested (symmetrical nucleus division and multinucleated structures), calli were produced merely by anthers cultured in the medium P and the regeneration of embryos was detected only in anthers of the cultivars Filippo Ceo, Lauranne and Genco, placed on medium P and subjected to the Control treatment (direct culture at 25 ± 1 °C, without the hot thermal shock at 35 ± 1 °C for 7 days). Characterization by SSR marker analysis of the embryo genotypes revealed that the regenerants had a single allele for each locus whereas the parent cultivar was heterozygous, indicating their development from haploid microspores. This study reports the evidence of gametic embryogenesis and, particularly, of microspore embryogenesis through in vitro anther culture, in almond, and, for the first time to our knowledge, the production of homozygous embryos.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus dulcis 3aalleles 3aalmonds 3aanther culture 3aanthers 3acallus 3acultivars 3aculture media 3aembryogenesis 3ahaploidy 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amicrospores 3atemperature1 aMarchese, Annalisa1 aGermana, Maria Antonietta,0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2017 Jan., v. 128, no. 1 p.85-95dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-68577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-016-1086-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245014400165520153900309592002801848650003001876650001901906650001501925650001201940650001101952650002701963650001801990650002002008650001202028650002102040650001702061650002002078653001702098653001702115653002002132653002002152700001802172700001502190700001802205773011602223856008702339852000902426655001202435IND60776809420221117230855.0220830e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077680942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1157042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Ziyi10aPerformance study of solar aided molten carbonate fuel cell-steam turbine-combined cooling, heating and power system with different schemes  aThe efficient use of solar energy and fuel cells has become an important way to achieve the goal of “carbon neutral” power generation. This paper firstly proposes a new molten carbonate fuel cell-steam turbine-combined cooling, heating and power (MCFC-ST-CCHP) system. In order to further improve the performance of the MCFC-ST-CCHP system, three solar aided MCFC-ST-CCHP systems with different solar energy integration modes are proposed in this paper. Solar energy is used to drive the methane dry reforming reaction or replace part of the heating load of high pressure boiler drum or high pressure economizer in heat recovery steam generator. The performances of different systems are studied and compared. The results show that the energy efficiencies, the exergy efficiencies and the specific CO₂ emission rates of three systems are 65.89%, 63.77%, 480.79 g/kWh; 66.25%, 65.12%, 477.93 g/kWh; and 65.86%, 64.88%, 481.08 g/kWh, respectively. The best solar integration mode is to replace part of the heating load of high pressure boiler drum. The impact of solar irradiation intensity on new solar aided MCFC-ST-CCHP system with the best solar integration mode further investigated. The results show that when the direct normal irradiance (DNI) of solar energy changes throughout the day, the new system’s solar heat collection efficiency, solar power generation and solar-to-electricity efficiency increase first and then decrease, and the specific CO₂ emission rate of the system decreases first and then increases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonates 3acooling 3aexergy 3agenerators (equipment) 3aheat recovery 3alight intensity 3amethane 3apower generation 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 0aMCFC-ST-CCHP 0aSolar energy 0aEnergy analysis 0aExergy analysis1 aDuan, Liqiang1 aWang, Zhen1 aZhang, Hanfei0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 July 01, v. 263 p.115704-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1157043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006200142245011800204300002000322520097500342592002801317596010801345650001401453650002301467650001201490700006101502700005601563700002301619700005901642700005701701773014901758856007701907852000901984655001201993IND60791762320221117235335.0220831e20220819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079176232DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.2c061432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakahashi, Keisuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9328-169410aSynthesis of Heterogeneous Catalysts in Catalyst Informatics to Bridge Experiment and High-Throughput Calculation  ap. 15735-15744.  aThe coupling of high-throughput calculations with catalyst informatics is proposed as an alternative way to design heterogeneous catalysts. High-throughput first-principles calculations for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction are designed and performed where 1972 catalyst surface planes for the CH₄ to CH₃ reaction are calculated. Several catalysts for the OCM reaction are designed based on key elements that are unveiled via data visualization and network analysis. Among the designed catalysts, several active catalysts such as CoAg/TiO₂, Mg/BaO, and Ti/BaO are found to result in high C₂ yield. Results illustrate that designing catalysts using high-throughput calculations is achievable in principle if appropriate trends and patterns within the data generated via high-throughput calculations are identified. Thus, high-throughput calculations in combination with catalyst informatics offer a potential alternative method for catalyst design.  aPublisher supplied data  aJPMJCR17P2cCore Research for Evolutional Science and Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003382 3acatalysts 3adata visualization 3amethane1 aTakahashi, Lauren1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9922-88891 aLe, Son Dinh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6407-84111 aKinoshita, Takaaki1 aNishimura, Shun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3084-14441 aOhyama, Junya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7438-52360 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2022 Aug. 19, v. 144, no. 34 p.15735-15744dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c061433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011500169300001400284520107000298592002801368650001501396650002701411650001901438650003901457650001101496650002601507650000701533650001501540650001701555650002301572650002001595653001701615653002601632653002901658653004801687700002201735700002001757700002001777700001901797773011201816856008401928852000902012655001202021IND60603067720221119102114.0180712e20150710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060306772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2015.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReck, Jason M.10aAdsorption equilibrium and kinetics of monomer–dimer monoclonal antibody mixtures on a cation exchange resin  ap. 46-59.  aAdsorption equilibrium and kinetics are determined for a monoclonal antibody (mAb) monomer and dimer species, individually and in mixtures, on a macroporous cation exchange resin both under the dilute limit of salt gradient elution chromatography and at high protein loads and low salt based on batch adsorption equilibrium and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) experiments. In the dilute limit and weak binding conditions, the dimer/monomer selectivity in 10mM phosphate at pH 7 varies between 8.7 and 2.3 decreasing with salt concentration in the range of 170–230mM NaCl. At high protein loads and strong binding conditions (0–60mM NaCl), the selectivity in the same buffer is near unity with no NaCl added, but increases gradually with salt concentration reaching high values between 2 and 15 with 60mM added NaCl. For these conditions, the two-component adsorption kinetics is controlled by pore diffusion and is predicted approximately by a dual shrinking core model using parameters based on single component equilibrium and kinetics measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acation exchange resins 3achromatography 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3amodels 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apH 3aphosphates 3aporous media 3asalt concentration 3asodium chloride 0aIon exchange 0aMonoclonal antibodies 0aMonomer/dimer separation 0aProtein adsorption equilibrium and kinetics1 aPabst, Timothy M.1 aHunter, Alan K.1 aWang, Xiangyang1 aCarta, Giorgio0 tJournal of chromatography.g2015 July 10, v. 1402 p.46-59dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2015.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03260naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013000160520163000290592002801920650002001948650002801968650001201996650001002008650001802018650001102036650002102047650001102068650001202079650001202091650001302103650001302116650001102129650001802140650002402158650001602182650001002198650001902208650002802227650003502255650001702290650001402307650001602321651001002337651001102347651002902358700002302387700002202410700002802432700002502460773012602485856007402611852000902685655001202694IND60652248220221117160314.0190712e20180505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065224822DNAL7 a10.3390/su100514362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTesta, Riccardo10aTropical Fruits as an Opportunity for Sustainable Development in Rural Areas: The Case of Mango in Small-Sized Sicilian Farms  aOver the last decades, in many rural areas in Southern Europe, farmers have abandoned agricultural activity, especially on small-sized farms, leading to an exodus from rural areas towards urbanized ones. In this context, in the early 1980s, some Sicilian farmers introduced mango on their small-sized farms, as certain areas of Sicily are well suited to tropical and subtropical crops, but also to meet increasing consumer interest for these fruits, as they are perceived as functional foods. This paper aimed to evaluate the economic sustainability of mango and to determine whether its introduction could be considered as an alternative to traditional crops. In particular, an economic-financial analysis of mango orchards on small-sized Sicilian farms was performed by adopting a discounted cash flow approach. In order to provide as comprehensive information as possible, mango was compared with two traditional crops that have always played an important socio-economic role in Southern Italy: wine grape and orange. Results showed a clear economic convenience for mango orchards, denoting an annual gross margin of 14,617.03 &euro;/ha, on average 20 times higher than orange orchards and just less than 40 times higher in respect to vineyards. The higher profitability of mango was also confirmed without considering public grants for the planting phase, and by varying current sales prices and costs. However, it should be considered that the cultivation of mango could represent an opportunity for sustainable development only for certain Sicilian areas, as it is closely related to favorable pedo-climatic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop production 3aeconomic sustainability 3afarmers 3afarms 3afruit growing 3afruits 3afunctional foods 3agrants 3amangoes 3aoranges 3aorchards 3aplanting 3aprices 3aprofitability 3aprofits and margins 3arural areas 3asales 3asocioeconomics 3asustainable development 3atropical and subtropical crops 3aurbanization 3avineyards 3awine grapes 3aItaly 3aSicily 3aSouthern European region1 aTudisca, Salvatore1 aSchifani, Giorgio1 aDi Trapani, Anna  Maria1 aMigliore, Giuseppina0 tSustainability.g2018 May 05, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100514363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03336naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002900112245013100141300001600272506002800288520201300316592002802329506003702357650003502394650001602429650002002445650002302465650002202488650002002510650002102530650001302551650001902564650002402583650002602607650001702633650000902650650002002659651001402679653002802693653000802721653002302729773014102752852000902893655001202902IND60785332020221207100516.0101104e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078533202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWidowati, Ladiyani Retno14aThe Rule of Organic Fertilizer on Fertilizer Efficiency and Requirement Rate for Vegetable Crop on Inceptisols Ciherang, Bogor  ap. 221-228.  aResource is Open Access  aUtilization of organic fertilizer is an alternative to increase soil health and supply a small amount of plant nutrient. Meanwhile agricultural soil in Indonesia commonly have low organic carbon content (<2%) therefore application of organic fertilizer is recommended. Based on that, the aim of the research is to measure the effectiveness of organic fertilizer on caisim (Brassica chinensis L.) growth, to measure the release of N-NO3- and N-NH4+, to determine the recommendation of organic fertilizer for caisim on Incentisols Ciherang, Bogor. The research had been conducted at Research and Soil Testing Laboratory and green house of Soil Research Institute, Laladon – Bogor on April to July 2008 using soil sample of Inceptisols Ciherang, Bogor. The treatments were: Control (no fertilizer), NPK, NPK + 500 kg organic fertilizer, ¾ NPK + 500 kg organic fertilizer, ½ NPK + 500 kg organic fertilizer, ¼ NPK + 500 kg organic fertilizer, organic fertilizer 500kg, organic fertilizer 1000 kg, NPK + 750 kg organic fertilizer, and NPK + 250 kg organic fertilizer. The five replications research had been conducted with Completely Randomized Design. The result indicated thats: (1) NPK fertilizer increased with addition of organic fertilizer approved by the evidence of increasing of plant high 2-10%, leaves number 1-2%, and crop production 16-36%. The relative agronomic effectiveness (RAE) of treatment NPK+various rate of organic fertilizer were higher than NPK alone with value of 136-181%. (2) The release of NH4+-N and NO3--N from anorganic fertilizer (NPK treatment) in four weeks incubation period showed balance proportion with N rate. Nitrogen released from organic fertilizer in the same incubation period are 5.39 mg NH4+-N kg-1 and 12.39 mg NO3- -N kg-1. (3) The best organic fertilizer rate based on fertilizer curve for Inceptisols Cicadas-Bogor having low C and N-organic is 560 kg organic fertilizer + NPK (300 kg Urea ha-1; 50 kg SP-36 ha-1; 50 kg KCl ha-1) produce caisim 134 g bag-1.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrassica rapa subsp. chinensis 3aInceptisols 3aNPK fertilizers 3aagricultural soils 3aammonium nitrogen 3acrop production 3afertilizer rates 3anitrogen 3aorganic carbon 3aorganic fertilizers 3aresearch institutions 3asoil quality 3aurea 3avegetable crops 3aIndonesia 0aAgronomic effectiveness 0aNPK 0aorganic fertilizer0 tJurnal tanah Tropika dan Kualitas Lingkungan.g2009 Sept., v. 14, no. 3 p.221-228dUniversity of LampungwJournal:27737x2086-66827nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245008800204500001900292520161300311592002801924650002101952650001001973650000901983650001401992650002102006650001302027650002102040650002402061653002302085653002502108653001802133653001002151653002102161700005702182700002302239700001902262700002202281773012102303856008302424852000902507655001202516IND60700347020221121192705.0200819e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070034702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2020.1031722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurini, Luca1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4164-826310aEvaluation of Brix Refractometry for the Estimation of Colostrum Quality in Jennies  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDonkey placenta does not allow the passage of immunoglobulins; thus, foals are born hypogammaglobulinemic and an adequate intake of high-quality colostrum in the first 24 hours of life is crucial for the surviving. The study aims to assess the relation between colostrum immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration evaluated by the single radial immunodiffusion (SRID) test and the Brix refractometer in donkeys to establish a cutoff value for high quality of colostrum based on Brix refractometry. Colostrum was collected at foaling, and at 6, 12, and 24 hours after foaling from the left and the right half of nine Amiata jennies. A total of 72 colostrum samples were analyzed. A Friedman test with a Dunn’s test for multiple comparisons was used for assessing the differences between the left and right half at each sampling time. No differences were found between the left and right halves; the average value was used to analyze the effect of sampling time on the IgG concentrations and Brix values. The relationship between colostrum IgG concentrations (SRID test) versus Brix value and Brix value versus time was analyzed using two different mixed linear models. A strong statistically significant relation has been found between IgG concentrations and Brix values (R² = 0.84). The relation between IgG concentrations and Brix refractometer showed a cutoff point of 17% Brix score for the identification of high-quality colostrum. The Brix value (%) decreased continuously from 16.29 by 0.29 × hour. Jennies’ and donkey foals’ management may be greatly improved using this simple and cheap device.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdequate Intakes 3aasses 3abrix 3acolostrum 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aplacenta 3arefractive index 3aveterinary medicine 0aBrix refractometer 0aColostrum evaluation 0aColostrum IgG 0aJenny 0aPassive transfer1 aNocera, Irene1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9536-44531 aBonelli, Francesca1 aMele, Marcello1 aSgorbini, Micaela0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2020 Sept., v. 92 p.103172-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2020.1031723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245016600207500001900373520089900392592002801291650001301319650001301332650001301345650002301358650001101381650001101392650001301403650001401416650002001430650001401450650002401464653002501488653000801513653003401521653001301555653001001568700002001578700002201598700002401620700002001644700001701664700002901681700002001710700002001730773012101750856008301871852000901954655001201963IND60700347120221121192635.0200819e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070034712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2020.1031782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeonardi, Fabio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4164-677510aPlatelet-rich Plasma Combined With a Sterile 3D Polylactic Acid Scaffold for Postoperative Management of Complete Hoof Wall Resection for Keratoma in Four Horses  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aKeratoma is a nonmalignant horse tumor that grows in the space between the horn of the hoof and the distal phalanx. Keratoma causes lameness in the horse, and surgical excision is the treatment of choice. Four horses underwent removal of a keratoma by complete hoof wall resection. The remaining wound was treated with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) combined with a sterile three-dimensional polylactic acid scaffold. The PRP was applied at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 days postoperatively. The surgical site was cleaned with gauzes and swabs soaked in Ringer’s lactate solution before applying PRP and the foot bandage. Healthy granulation tissue developed at 6–21 days postoperatively. The hoof wall defect was completely filled with new hoof wall within 6–8 months after surgery. All horses returned to their previous exercise level, and no recurrence of lameness was reported by the owner.  aPublisher supplied data 3abandages 3aexcision 3aexercise 3agranulation tissue 3ahooves 3ahorses 3alameness 3aneoplasms 3apolylactic acid 3aresection 3aveterinary medicine 0aPlatelet-rich plasma 0aPRP 0aRegenerative medicine therapy 0aKeratoma 0aHorse1 aAngelone, Mario1 aBiacca, Cristiano1 aBattaglia, Beatrice1 aPecorari, Laura1 aConti, Virna1 aCosta, Giovanna Lucrezia1 aRamoni, Roberto1 aGrolli, Stefano0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2020 Sept., v. 92 p.103178-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2020.1031783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245016500173300001600338520118100354592002801535650001601563650002101579650001301600650001201613650002501625650001801650650001301668650001001681650000901691650001401700650002601714650001001740650001801750650001601768653001001784653001401794653001801808653001401826653001801840653002301858773011801881856008501999852000902084655001202093IND60411417520221121043820.0150924e20151117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041141752DNAL7 a10.1080/02827581.2015.10548742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHågvar, Sigmund,10aDecomposing cones of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H.

Numbered sticks allowed individual recovery after 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 years. During the first nine years, cones decomposed fastest in the moss site. After 13 years, dry weight loss was about 60% in both habitats, but cones still retained their shape. In the moss site, cones were then situated in the middle of the organic layer, with their underside about 3 cm above the bleached layer. Cones in the needle mat profile had sunk less. One cone with rather intact shape was found below a nylon strip laid out 28 years earlier. Compared to needle litter from Norway spruce and Scots pine, spruce cones had low concentrations of Ca, Mn, and Fe. The concentration of these elements, as well as N, Al, and S, was greatly increased during decomposition. Ca, Mn, Fe, and Al were immobilized for a long time, as their total amount per cone increased with time. Cones decomposed slower than needles, so their role in humus composition and carbon storage may be greater than indicated by their fraction of fresh litter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aPinus sylvestris 3aaluminum 3acalcium 3acarbon sequestration 3aforest litter 3ahabitats 3ahumus 3airon 3amanganese 3amosses and liverworts 3anylon 3asoil profiles 3aweight loss 0aCones 0achemistry 0adecomposition 0araw humus 0aspruce forest 0avertical transport0 tScandinavian journal of forest research.g2015 Nov. 17, v. 30, no. 8 p.643-652dTaylor & Francisx1651-18917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2015.10548743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245014000170300001600310520112600326592002801452650001301480650002801493650001101521650001701532650002101549650001501570650002801585650002001613650001701633650001001650650001501660650002301675650002201698650001401720650001901734650001501753650001401768651002001782653001701802653002801819653003701847653000901884653003401893653001001927700001901937700001601956700002001972700001501992700001302007700002002020700002502040773011802065856008802183852000902271655001202280IND60562341820221122062151.0190318e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056234182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.01.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Songlin10aEffects of nutrient load on microbial activities within a seagrass-dominated ecosystem: Implications of changes in seagrass blue carbon  ap. 214-221.  aNutrient loading is a leading cause of global seagrass decline, triggering shifts from seagrass- to macroalgal-dominance. Within seagrass meadows of Xincun Bay (South China Sea), we found that nutrient loading (due to fish farming) increased sediment microbial biomass and extracellular enzyme activity associated with carbon cycling (polyphenol oxidase, invertase and cellulase), with a corresponding decrease in percent sediment organic carbon (SOC), suggesting that nutrients primed microorganism and stimulated SOC remineralization. Surpisingly, however, the relative contribution of seagrass-derived carbon to bacteria (δ13Cbacteria) increased with nutrient loading, despite popular theory being that microbes switch to consuming macroalgae which are assumed to provide a more labile carbon source. Organic carbon sources of fungi were unaffected by nutrient loading. Overall, this study suggests that nutrient loading changes the relative contribution of seagrass and algal sources to SOC pools, boosting sediment microbial biomass and extracellular enzyme activity, thereby possibly changing seagrass blue carbon.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3acatechol oxidase 3aecosystems 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzyme activity 3afish culture 3afungi 3amacroalgae 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3anutrients 3apollution load 3aseagrasses 3asediments 3aSouth China Sea 0aSeagrass bed 0aSediment organic carbon 0aExtracellular enzymes activities 0aPLFA 0aMicrobial community structure 0aδ13C1 aJiang, Zhijian1 aWu, Yunchao1 aZhang, Jingping1 aArbi, Iman1 aYe, Feng1 aHuang, Xiaoping1 aMacreadie, Peter Ian0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 117, no. 1-2 p.214-221dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.01.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011500160520138300275592002801658650001701686650002801703650001301731650002301744650001801767650001701785650001801802650001801820650001701838650001201855651001601867700001701883700002301900700002201923700001801945700002201963700001701985773012202002856007502124852000902199655001202208IND60771380720221121030116.0220325e20220319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077138072DNAL7 a10.3390/nu140613022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarmash, Dalia 14aThe Association between Diet Quality and Health Status in Mobile Food Pantry Users in Northeastern Connecticut  aLow-income Americans tend to have poor diet quality and disease prevalence overall. Mobile food pantries aim to improve these outcomes, and have rarely been studied. This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the association between diet quality and health status in mobile food pantry users. Data were collected from two mobile food pantry sites in Northeastern Connecticut (n = 83). Sociodemographic food security and diet quality data were collected. Overall, diet quality was low among all participants with intakes of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains of concern. Participant adherence to the 2020–2025 US Dietary Guidelines were low, with no participants meeting recommendations for whole grains. Obesity, diabetes, and hypertension prevalence in this population exceeded national averages. After adjusting for covariates, hypertension was associated with higher dairy and added sugar intake, as well as a greater intake of added sugar from sugar-sweetened beverages (p < 0.05). Although results were not statistically significant, participants with obesity, diabetes, and hypertension showed a trend of having lower adherence to the guidelines than those without these chronic diseases. Questions assessing participant interest in changing their diets were also posed, indicating overall high interest in learning about current diet quality and weight improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadded sugars 3across-sectional studies 3adiabetes 3adisease prevalence 3afood pantries 3afood quality 3afood security 3ahealth status 3ahypertension 3aobesity 3aConnecticut1 aHa, Kyungho 1 aSakaki, Junichi R.1 aGorski, Isabella 1 aRule, Brazil 1 aPuglisi, Michael 1 aChun, Ock K.0 tNutrients.g2022 Mar. 19, v. 14, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu140613023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245007500181300001600256520129800272592002801570650001501598650001901613650002001632650001801652650002301670650001801693650002001711650001901731650002601750650001901776650001601795650001501811650001601826651001101842653001801853653002701871653000801898653002501906653001501931700001801946700001901964773011801983856008502101852000902186655001202195IND60411417720221121060308.0150924e20151117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041141772DNAL7 a10.1080/02827581.2015.10621312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFløistad, Inger Sundheim10aTesting species of genus Abies for Christmas tree production in Norway  ap. 653-663.  aTen exotic Abies species were tested in two field trials, where the aim was to find suitable species and provenances for Christmas tree production in coastal and fjord areas in Norway. The material included 14 provenances of Abies nordmanniana , 3 provenances of Abies bornmuelleriana , 3 provenances of Abies koreana , 2 provenances of Abies amabilis , and 1 provenance each of Abies equi-trojani , Abies alba , Abies procera , Abies homolepis , Abies nephrolepis , and Abies forrestii . Field trials were established at Gulen in Sogn og Fjordane County and at Verdal in Nord-Trøndelag County. Christmas tree classification was done seven and eight growing seasons after establishment. The Christmas tree yield was higher in Gulen (64%) than in Verdal (45%), which is situated further north. Also, the survival and the height growth were higher in Gulen than in Verdal. A more humid climate and a longer growth season in Gulen may explain some of the differences. Of the 10 species, A. nordmanniana , A. homolepis , and A. bornmuelleriana produced the highest Christmas tree yield at Gulen, while A. homolepis and A. koreana had the highest yield at Verdal. Due to early bud burst, A. equi-trojani and A. bornmuelleriana are only suited for Christmas tree growing in the best climatic areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies alba 3aAbies amabilis 3aAbies homolepis 3aAbies koreana 3aAbies nordmanniana 3aAbies procera 3aChristmas trees 3aclassification 3afield experimentation 3agrowing season 3ahumid zones 3aprovenance 3atree yields 3aNorway 0aAbies species 0aChristmas tree quality 0afir 0amorphological traits 0aprovenance1 aNyeggen, Hans1 aSkage, Jan-Ole0 tScandinavian journal of forest research.g2015 Nov. 17, v. 30, no. 8 p.653-663dTaylor & Francisx1651-18917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2015.10621313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002400112245004700136300001400183506002800197520132000225592002801545506003701573650001301610650002701623650002901650650001801679650002001697650001501717650002701732650002101759650001801780650001401798650002001812650002001832650001201852650001801864650001501882650002401897650002301921650001301944650002901957650001701986653002202003653002402025700001802049773014002067852000902207655001202216IND60785332420221207095716.0130812e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078533242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZdybicka-Barabas, A10aApolipophorins and insects immune response  ap. 58-68.  aResource is Open Access  aInsect lipoproteins, called lipophorins, are non-covalent assemblies of lipids and proteins serving as lipid transport vehicles. The protein moiety of lipophorin comprises two glycosylated apolipoproteins, apolipophorin I (apoLp-I) and apolipophorin II (apoLp-II), constantly present in a lipophorin particle, and an exchangeable protein, apolipophorin III (apoLp-III). ApoLp-III is an abundant protein occurring in hemolymph in lipid-free and lipid-bound state and playing an important role in lipid transport and insect innate immunity. In immune response apoLp-III serves as a pattern recognition molecule. It binds and detoxifies microbial cell wall components, i.e., lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid, and β-1,3-glucan. ApoLp-III activates expression of antimicrobial peptides and proteins, stimulates their antimicrobial activity, participates in regulation of the phenoloxidase system and in hemolymph clotting. In addition, the protein is involved in cellular immune response, influencing hemocyte adhesion, phagocytosis and nodule formation, and in gut immunity. Although apoLp-III is the best studied apolipophorin in insect immunity so far, a literature review suggests that all the three apolipoproteins, apoLp-I, apoLp-II and apoLp-III, function together in a coordinated defense against pathogens  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadhesion 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aantimicrobial properties 3aapolipophorin 3aapolipoproteins 3acell walls 3acell-mediated immunity 3adigestive system 3aglycosylation 3ahemocytes 3aimmune response 3ainsect immunity 3ainsects 3ainvertebrates 3alipophorin 3alipopolysaccharides 3alipoteichoic acids 3amoieties 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3aphagocytosis 0aapolipophorin III 0aGalleria mellonella1 aCytryńska, M0 tInvertebrate survival journal.g2013 Aug., v. 10, no. 1 p.58-68dUniversity of Modena and Reggio EmiliawJournal:27775x1824-307X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02155naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245007900161300002000240520063300260592002800893596009800921596009801019650003101117650002301148650001201171700001701183700001701200700001801217700002001235700001401255700001601269700001601285700001801301700005701319700001501376700005601391700005101447773014901498856007701647852000901724655001201733IND60791762720221117235308.0220831e20220817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079176272DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.2c065602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQian, Hao-Dong10aCatalytic Asymmetric Vinylogous and Bisvinylogous Propargylic Substitution  ap. 15779-15785.  aDistinct regio- and enantioselectivity control in copper-catalyzed vinylogous and bisvinylogous propargylic substitution has been accomplished by using a novel chiral N,N,P ligand.

Formaldehyde-free, in reality any-ldehyde-free pine tannin foams have been developed but present lower mechanical resistance undergoing compression. In this work, formaldehyde-free pine tannin/furanic rigid foams are prepared by a new approach, namely using alternative non-toxic, non-volatile aldehydes as hardeners: glyoxal or glutaraldehyde. Physical properties – thermal conductivity, cell size – and mechanical – compressive strength – are tested. It was found that glyoxal can completely substitute formaldehyde to prepare foams with good properties for insulation whereas glutaraldehyde is not suitable for the purpose because of its lower reactivity with pine tannins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus radiata 3abark 3afoams 3aformaldehyde 3aglutaraldehyde 3atannins 3athermal conductivity 0aPine tannin 0aRigid foam 0aInsulation material 0aFormulation 0aResins1 aBasso, M.C.1 aPizzi, A.1 aLaborie, M.-P.1 aGarcia, D.1 aCelzard, A.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2013 Feb., v. 45 p.401-405dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2012.12.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03292naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245017300165300001400338520165800352592002802010650001902038650002302057650001902080650001402099650001902113650001402132650003902146650002202185650001602207650001802223650002502241650001202266650001302278650002102291650000902312650001902321653003002340653003102370653003002401653002102431700001402452700002002466700002002486700002002506700002102526700001402547773011002561856008202671852000902753655001202762IND60569210820221120135118.0190411e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056921082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2017.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBourgault, M.10aYield, growth and grain nitrogen response to elevated CO2 in six lentil (Lens culinaris) cultivars grown under Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) in a semi-arid environment  ap. 50-58.  aAtmospheric CO2 concentrations ([CO2]) are predicted to increase from current levels of about 400ppm to reach 550ppm by 2050. The direct benefits of elevated [CO2] (e[CO2]) to plant growth appear to be greater under low rainfall conditions, but there are few field (Free Air CO2 Enrichment or FACE) experimental set-ups that directly address semi-arid conditions. The objectives of this study were to investigate the following research questions: 1) What are the effects of e[CO2] on the growth and grain yield of lentil (Lens culinaris) grown under semi-arid conditions under FACE? 2) Does e[CO2] decrease grain nitrogen in lentil? and 3) Is there genotypic variability in the response to e[CO2] in lentil cultivars? Elevated [CO2] increased yields by approximately 0.5tha−1 (relative increase ranging from 18 to 138%) by increasing both biomass accumulation (by 32%) and the harvest index (by up to 60%). However, the relative response of grain yield to e[CO2] was not consistently greater under dry conditions and might depend on water availability post-flowering. Grain nitrogen concentration was significantly reduced by e[CO2] under the conditions of this experiment. No differences were found between the cultivars selected in the response to elevated [CO2] for grain yield or any other parameters observed despite well expressed genotypic variability in many traits of interest. Biomass accumulation from flowering to maturity was considerably increased by elevated [CO2] (a 50% increase) which suggests that the indeterminate growth habit of lentils provides vegetative sinks in addition to reproductive sinks during the grain-filling period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLens culinaris 3abiomass production 3acarbon dioxide 3acultivars 3afilling period 3aflowering 3afree air carbon dioxide enrichment 3agenetic variation 3agrain yield 3aharvest index 3aindeterminate growth 3alentils 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3arain 3asemiarid zones 0aSource-sink relationships 0aPhysiological pre-breeding 0aClimate change adaptation 0aTerminal drought1 aBrand, J.1 aTausz-Posch, S.1 aArmstrong, R.D.1 aO’Leary, G.L.1 aFitzgerald, G.J.1 aTausz, M.0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2017 July, v. 87 p.50-58dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49616x1161-03017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2017.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01914naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001200112245009300124300001400217506002800231520082600259592002801085506003701113650001201150650001701162650001701179650001101196650001001207650001501217653002501232653001501257653001601272653001701288700001601305700003501321700001901356700002201375700001101397773009901408852000901507655001201516IND60785332520221207100504.0120119e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078533252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTatang,10aVegetation analysis of two insectivorous plants in Padang Pinang Anyang, Belitung Island  ap. 93-96.  aResource is Open Access  aNepenthes gracilis and Drocera burmannii are rare species, found at Padang Pinang Anyang, Belitung island .

An interdisciplinary research team set up an experimental dialogue process concerning the use of introduced tree species in Southern Sweden for the purposes of climate change adaptation. The process involved stakeholders at a regional level, including those with divergent opinions regarding introduced tree species and their use in forestry. Through a process of repeated meetings and exchanges with researchers, the participant's knowledge was deepened and group relationships developed such that the group was able to jointly formulate a set of policy recommendations. The investigation revealed that dialogue processes may improve decision-making by identifying priorities for action or further research. However, when a collaborative process targets complex environmental issues on larger geographical and temporal scales, as matters about forests typically do, a collaborative process must be integrated with external actors and institutions in order to attain tangible outcomes. Consequently, to fully access the benefits of using collaborative processes to handle complex challenges in forest policy and management, the connections between political sphere, the private sector, authorities and research institutions must be concretely established.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3aclimate change 3adecision making 3aforest management 3aforest policy 3aforests 3ainterdisciplinary research 3apolitics 3aprivate sector 3aresearch institutions 3aresearchers 3astakeholders 3atrees 3aSweden 0aCollaborative processes 0aforest management 0aclimate change adaptation 0aintroduced tree species 0acomplex problems 0apolicy recommendations1 aSandström, Camilla1 aRist, Lucy1 aRosvall, Ola1 aSamuelsson, Lars1 aIdenfors, Annika0 tScandinavian journal of forest research.g2015 Nov. 17, v. 30, no. 8 p.749-756dTaylor & Francisx1651-18917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2015.10653433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245004300209300001600252506007600268520096900344592002801313506003701341650001201378650001501390650001401405700002401419700001901443700002201462700002301484700001901507700002301526700002101549700003001570700001901600700002701619700002201646700002001668700002401688700002301712700002001735773012401755856007901879852000901958655001201967IND60300867620221207091256.0150703e20130208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030086762DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12315302doi7 aPMC66935032pmcid7 a232233942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWieczorek, Mark A.14aThe Crust of the Moon as Seen by GRAIL  ap. 671-675.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Holy GRAIL? The gravity field of a planet provides a view of its interior and thermal history by revealing areas of different density. GRAIL, a pair of satellites that act as a highly sensitive gravimeter, began mapping the Moon's gravity in early 2012. Three papers highlight some of the results from the primary mission. Zuber et al. (p. 668, published online 6 December) discuss the overall gravity field, which reveals several new tectonic and geologic features of the Moon. Impacts have worked to homogenize the density structure of the Moon's upper crust while fracturing it extensively. Wieczorek et al. (p. 671, published online 6 December) show that the upper crust is 35 to 40 kilometers thick and less dense—and thus more porous—than previously thought. Finally, Andrews-Hanna et al. (p. 675, published online 6 December) show that the crust is cut by widespread magmatic dikes that may reflect a period of expansion early in the Moon's history.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agravity 3asatellites 3atectonics1 aNeumann, Gregory A.1 aNimmo, Francis1 aKiefer, Walter S.1 aTaylor, G.

Here, batch and column experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of humic acid (HA) on Cr(VI) removal by pyrite in systems containing cations such as Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺. HA was observed to have inhibitory effect on Cr(VI) uptake by pyrite under the experimental conditions studied (e.g., pH 3 to 8). HA sorbed onto pyrite surface and thus (1) competed against Cr(VI) for pyritic surface sites and/or (2) increased electrostatic repulsion between Cr(VI) and pyrite. In systems with HA and Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺, the Cr(VI) uptake by pyrite decreased drastically relative to HA alone due to the aggregation of HA with Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺. The formation of such HA aggregates/precipitates blocked Cr(VI) ions to reach its binding sites, thereby resulting in a substantial decrease in Cr(VI) uptake. Overall, the results have major implications for proper design and operation of PRBs with pyrite as the reactive material.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding sites 3acalcium 3acations 3achromium 3aelectrostatic interactions 3agroundwater 3ahumic acids 3amagnesium 3apH 3apyrite1 aBulbul, Muhammet Samet1 aKeskin, Selda0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2017 Jan., v. 228, no. 1 p.48-48dSpringer International Publishingx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-016-3233-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245020500171520176400376592002802140650003002168650002802198650001202226650001802238650002002256650003402276650002202310650001902332650001502351650001702366650002002383650002602403650001002429650001802439650001302457653001802470653001702488653001702505653002202522653000802544700002002552773011602572856008702688852000902775655001202784IND60776810020221120124559.0220830e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077681002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1157182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKartal, Furkan10aInvestigation of an integrated circulating fluidized bed gasifier/steam turbine/proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell system for torrefied biomass and modeling with artificial intelligence approach  aIn this study, the Aspen Plus simulator was used to develop a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) gasifier/steam turbine/proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell integrated system. Since integrated systems comprise many thermochemical, biochemical, and physical processes, equipment, chemicals, etc., determining output parameters is challenging and important. In this context, twenty torrefied biomass samples were parametrically analyzed for syngas properties and H₂ production rates. So, using solid fuel characteristics and gasifier operating parameters, a data set including PEM fuel cell module outputs was created. Thereafter, the created data set was utilized to train the artificial neural network (ANN) model. This paper, as far as we know, examines the impacts of different torrefied biomass samples on PEM fuel cell outputs for a sophisticated integrated system dependent on gasification conditions, and provides a more generalized and rapid prediction model for the integrated system with complicated equations. Additionally, parametric studies assist in determining the proposed new integrated system's minimal operating condition, which is highlydependent on the fuel characteristic. High steam/fuel ratio, high carbonization degree, and low pressure lowered PEM efficiency while increasing power and voltage outputs. The ANN model also accurately forecasts PEM fuel cell output parameters (R² greater than 0.99 and MAPE less than 1%) based on torrefied biomass proximate analysis data and gasification process operating parameters. As a consequence, a CFB gasifier/steam turbine/PEM fuel cell system, which contains diverse modules and thermochemical processes, can be examined using ANN models trained on a large and high-quality dataset.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aartificial intelligence 3abiomass 3acarbonization 3adata collection 3aelectric potential difference 3aenergy conversion 3afluidized beds 3afuel cells 3agasification 3aneural networks 3aproximate composition 3asteam 3asynthesis gas 3aturbines 0aPEM fuel cell 0aGasification 0aCFB gasifier 0aTorrefied biomass 0aANN1 aÖzveren, Uğur0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 July 01, v. 263 p.115718-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1157183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002700145245012300172300001600295520205600311592002802367650001302395650002002408650001602428650001702444650001902461650000902480650002202489650001302511650001302524650001302537650001802550650001102568650001202579700002602591700001802617700001802635773010102653856007902754852000902833655001202842IND60439920420221120024249.0151024e199708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043992042DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10042488032972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Prieto, S.J.10aChanges in the soil organic N fractions of a tropical Alfisol fertilized with 15N-urea and cropped to maize or pasture  ap. 151-160.  aQualitative and quantitative changes in soil and fertilizer-derived organic N fractions were assessed during a cropping season in an intertropical Alfisol, under maize and pasture, fertilized with¹⁵ N-urea. Before the sowing, after fertilizing and after the harvest, the organic N of top soil samples was fractionated by a two-step acid hydrolysis under reflux (H1 = 1 M HCl for 3 h; H2 = 3 M HCl for 3 h). The total hydrolysable N (HN) from H1 decreased significantly during the cropping season in both maize and pasture soils. Contrastingly, the content of HN from H2 and that of non-hydrolysable N did not vary significantly during the cropping season. The easily hydrolysable fractions, especially amino acid N, amino sugar N and amide N, were the most active N pools and the major source of N potentially available for plants. The urea-derived N that remained in the soil was mainly in organic forms at both 7 and 108 d after fertilizing (70–82% and 93–98%, respectively), higher figures being found in pasture than in maize soil. The total amount of urea-derived HN decreased significantly during the crop period in both maize and pasture soils. This decrease was largely due to the decline in HN from H1. The amount of non-hydrolysable urea-derived N was significantly higher in pasture than in maize soil and it decreases in the former and increases in the latter, during the cropping season. During the crop period, the decrease of urea-derived organic N was 4.6 to 9.1 times higher than that of native organic N. Shortly after fertilizing, the proportion of urea-derived N in the easily hydrolysable (H1) organic fractions was higher than that of soil N, whereas the reverse was true for the slowly hydrolysable (H2) or insoluble fractions. These differences were less marked, but still significant, at the end of cropping. The easily hydrolysable organic N fractions were more sensitive than total N to the impact of land use intensification and are, therefore, a more useful index for early detection of soil biological degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlfisols 3aacid hydrolysis 3aamino acids 3aamino sugars 3abiodegradation 3acorn 3ahydrochloric acid 3aland use 3anitrogen 3apastures 3asoil sampling 3asowing 3atopsoil1 aJocteur-Monrozier, L.1 aHétier, J.M.1 aCarballas, T.0 tPlant and soil.g1997 Aug., v. 195, no. 1 p.151-160dKluwer Academic Publishersx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10042488032973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02003naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001400112245006600126300001800192520095100210592002801161650001701189650001101206650001401217650001201231650001101243650000901254650001301263651001001276653001301286653001501299653001801314653001301332653001601345700002201361700002601383700001701409700001701426773015301443852000901596655001201605IND60705756220221120222659.0200807e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070575622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagaraj, 10aAdoption of Improved Production Technologies by Paddy Growers  ap. 3687-3695.  aThe present study was conducted in two taluks of Raichur district in Karnataka state during 2014–15. To analyse the adoption of improved production technologies by paddy growers. The total sample constituted 180 paddy growers comprising of 60 marginal farmers, 60 small farmers and 60 big farmers from 12 villages of two taluks in Raichur district. The results revealed that more than half of the paddy growers (50.60%) belonged to medium adoption category, whereas 29.44 and 20.00 per cent of the paddy growers were belonging to high and low adoption categories respectively. Non-availability of labours, lack of knowledge to manage the diseases and low price of the product were the major management, technicaland marketing problems faced by paddy growers respectively. Providing agricultural inputs and machines on hire basis and providing efficient credit facilities were the important suggestions of paddy growers to overcome the problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3acredit 3aequipment 3agrowers 3aprices 3arice 3avillages 3aIndia 0aAdoption 0aTechnology 0aPaddy growers 0aProblems 0aSuggestions1 aKrishnamurthy, B.1 aLakshminarayana, M.T.1 aNataraju, M.1 aNishitha, K.0 tTrends in Biosciences.g2015 July, v. 8, no. 14 p.3687-3695dSociety for Advancement of Science and Rural DevelopmentwJournal:2106x0976-24857nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02402naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003000145245010100175300001600276520096900292592002801261650001201289650001501301650001401316700001901330700001901349700002201368700002701390700002201417700002101439700002001460700002501480700001901505700002401524700001901548700002301567700002001590700002101610700002301631700002301654700002301677700002001700773012401720856007901844852000901923655001201932IND60300867820221119220418.0150703e20130208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030086782DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12317532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndrews-Hanna, Jeffrey C.10aAncient Igneous Intrusions and Early Expansion of the Moon Revealed by GRAIL Gravity Gradiometry  ap. 675-678.  aThe Holy GRAIL?

Zuber et al. (p. 668, published online 6 December) discuss the overall gravity field, which reveals several new tectonic and geologic features of the Moon. Impacts have worked to homogenize the density structure of the Moon's upper crust while fracturing it extensively. Wieczorek et al. (p. 671, published online 6 December) show that the upper crust is 35 to 40 kilometers thick and less dense—and thus more porous—than previously thought. Finally, Andrews-Hanna et al.

This work intended to compare the results by zonal elution with that by nonlinear chromatography when it comes to the analysis of the interaction between seven drugs and immobilised β2-adrenoceptor (β2-AR). The results of the zonal elution showed that clorprenaline, clenbuterol, methoxyphenamine, salbutamol, terbutaline, tulobuterol and bambuterol have only one type of binding site on immobilised β2-AR, while nonlinear chromatography confirmed the existence of at least two types of binding sites between β2-AR and clorprenaline, clenbuterol and bambuterol. On these sites, both zonal elution and nonlinear chromatography presented the same rank order for the association constants of the seven drugs. Compared with the data from zonal elution, the association constants calculated using nonlinear chromatography gave a good linear response to the corresponding values by radio-ligand binding assay. The sampling efficiencies of nonlinear chromatography were clearly higher than zonal elution. Nonlinear chromatography will probably become a powerful alternative for the high throughput determination of drug-protein interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaffinity chromatography 3abeta-2 adrenergic receptors 3abinding sites 3aclenbuterol 3adrugs 3amodels 0aAffinity chromatography 0aZonal elution 0aNonlinear chromatography 0aDrug–protein interaction 0aβ2-Adrenoceptor1 aWang, Jing1 aZheng, Yuqing Yuan1 aYang, Lingjian1 aZhang, Yajun1 aBian, Liujiao1 aZheng, Jianbin1 aLi, Zijian1 aZhao, Xinfeng1 aZhang, Youyi0 tJournal of chromatography.g2015 July 03, v. 1401 p.75-83dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2015.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02501naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006100142245013200203300002000335520106300355592002801418596008701446596010101533596008401634650003101718650001601749650001701765650001401782650002601796650002201822650001401844700005801858773014901916856007702065852000902142655001202151IND60791763020220831000000.0220831e20220817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079176302DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.2c066642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScharf, Manuel J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8408-213512aA Catalytic Asymmetric Pictet–Spengler Platform as a Biomimetic Diversification Strategy toward Naturally Occurring Alkaloids  ap. 15451-15456.  aTetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) alkaloids constitute a large and diverse class of bioactive natural products, with the parent compounds and related downstream biosynthetic secondary metabolites spanning thousands of isolated structures. Chemoenzymatic synthetic approaches toward the relevant THIQs rely on Pictet–Spenglerases such as norcoclaurine synthase (NCS), the scope of which is strictly limited to dopamine-related phenolic substrates. To overcome these limitations in the context of chemical synthesis, we herein report asymmetric Pictet–Spengler reactions of N-carbamoyl-β-arylethylamines with diverse aldehydes toward enantioenriched THIQs. The obtained products proved to be competent intermediates in the synthesis of THIQ, aporphine, tetrahydroberberine, morphinan, and androcymbine natural products. Novel catalyst design with regard to the stabilization of cationic intermediates was crucial to accomplish high reactivity while simultaneously achieving unprecedented stereoselectivity for the reaction of biologically relevant substrates.  aPublisher supplied data  a694228cH2020 Future and Emerging Technologiesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100010664  aEXC2033-390677874-RESOLVcDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaftdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001659  aNAcStudienstiftung des Deutschen Volkesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004350 3a(S)-norcoclaurine synthase 3abiomimetics 3abiosynthesis 3acatalysts 3asecondary metabolites 3astereoselectivity 3asynthesis1 aList, Benjamin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9804-599X0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2022 Aug. 17, v. 144, no. 34 p.15451-15456dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c066643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01649naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010400167300001600271520063100287592002800918650001200946650001800958650001300976650001800989650002301007700001901030700001901049700002001068700002101088773008601109856008401195990002301279852000901302655001201311IND60103854520221119085710.0141107e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010385452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2012.04.1012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Eun Ju10aCritical heat flux characteristics of nanofluids based on exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets (xGnPs)  ap. 193-197.  aIn this paper, nanofluids containing xGnPs and xGnPs oxide were prepared due to superb thermal properties and low cost.

Although the largest CHF enhancement was observed for the nanofluid with 0.005vol% xGnP oxide, no reduction was observed in the contact angle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboiling 3acontact angle 3agraphene 3aheat transfer 3athermal properties1 aPark, Sung Dae1 aBang, In Cheol1 aPark, Young-Bin1 aPark, Hyung Wook0 tMaterials letters.g2012 Aug. 15, v. 81 p.193-197dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2012.04.1013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01909naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002700154245007300181300001500254520098800269592002801257650001801285650002701303650001201330650002001342700001901362773011801381856008801499990002301587852000901610655001201619IND60107281920221121100655.0141108e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010728192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2010.09.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPopovych, Oleksandr V.10aMacroscopic entrainment of periodically forced oscillatory ensembles  ap. 98-108.  aLarge-amplitude oscillations of macroscopic neuronal signals, such as local field potentials and electroencephalography or magnetoencephalography signals, are commonly considered as being generated by a population of mutually synchronized neurons. In a computational study in generic networks of phase oscillators and bursting neurons, however, we show that this common belief may be wrong if the neuronal population receives an external rhythmic input. The latter may stem from another neuronal population or an external, e.g., sensory or electrical, source. In that case the population field potential may be entrained by the rhythmic input, whereas the individual neurons are phase desynchronized both mutually and with their field potential. Intriguingly, the corresponding large-amplitude oscillations of the population mean field are generated by pairwise desynchronized neurons oscillating at frequencies shifted far away from the frequency of the macroscopic field potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata analysis 3aelectroencephalography 3aneurons 3aneurophysiology1 aTass, Peter A.0 tProgress in biophysics and molecular biology.g2011 Mar., v. 105, no. 1-2 p.98-108dElsevier Ltdx0079-61077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2010.09.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03254naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001800167245007700185300001400262520184500276592002802121650001502149650001802164650001402182650001202196650002402208650001302232650001502245650002902260650002302289650002402312650002402336650001102360650002302371650002402394650004002418650003702458650004602495650001702541700001602558773009602574856008202670990002302752852000902775655001202784IND60107464520221121172721.0141108e20130107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010746452DNAL7 a230322182pmid7 a10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.09.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHubbard, M.E.10aMultiphase modelling of vascular tumour growth in two spatial dimensions  ap. 70-89.  aIn this paper we present a continuum mathematical model of vascular tumour growth which is based on a multiphase framework in which the tissue is decomposed into four distinct phases and the principles of conservation of mass and momentum are applied to the normal/healthy cells, tumour cells, blood vessels and extracellular material. The inclusion of a diffusible nutrient, supplied by the blood vessels, allows the vasculature to have a nonlocal influence on the other phases. Two-dimensional computational simulations are carried out on unstructured, triangular meshes to allow a natural treatment of irregular geometries, and the tumour boundary is captured as a diffuse interface on this mesh, thereby obviating the need to explicitly track the (potentially highly irregular and ill-defined) tumour boundary. A hybrid finite volume/finite element algorithm is used to discretise the continuum model: the application of a conservative, upwind, finite volume scheme to the hyperbolic mass balance equations and a finite element scheme with a stable element pair to the generalised Stokes equations derived from momentum balance, leads to a robust algorithm which does not use any form of artificial stabilisation. The use of a matrix-free Newton iteration with a finite element scheme for the nutrient reaction–diffusion equations allows full nonlinearity in the source terms of the mathematical model. Numerical simulations reveal that this four-phase model reproduces the characteristic pattern of tumour growth in which a necrotic core forms behind an expanding rim of well-vascularised proliferating tumour cells. The simulations consistently predict linear tumour growth rates. The dependence of both the speed with which the tumour grows and the irregularity of the invading tumour front on the model parameters is investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3ablood vessels 3aequations 3ahybrids 3amathematical models 3amomentum 2aAlgorithms 2aBlood Vesselsxpathology 2aCell Proliferation 2aComputer Simulation 2aExtracellular Space 2aHumans 2aModels, Biological 2aModels, Theoretical 2aNeoplasmsxblood supplyxpathology. 2aNeoplastic Stem Cellsxpathology 2aNeovascularization, Pathologicxpathology 2aTumor Burden1 aByrne, H.M.0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g2013 Jan. 7, v. 316 p.70-89dElsevier Ltdx0022-51937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.09.0313Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01680naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007200169300001600241520058100257592002800838650002200866650001900888650002400907650001300931650003300944650001600977650003700993650001501030700001601045700001401061700001301075700001601088773008601104856008401190990002301274852000901297655001201306IND60103854720221119085919.0141107e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010385472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2012.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Qiuping10aMicrowave-assisted synthesis of hexagonal structure ZnO micro-tubes  ap. 198-201.  aZnO micro-tubes were successfully synthesized by microwave assisted from a facile chemical solution reaction without addition of any surfactant in only 20min.

Among these dyes, plant poisoning, soil polluting and water polluting nature of organic dyes are not yet identified. The plant poisoning and non-poisoning organic dyes are identified through adsorption mechanism of cationic malachite green (MG) and anionic methyl orange (MO) on brinjal plant root powder (cellulose). The positive ΔHᵒ (44kJmol⁻¹) of MG higher than 40kJmol⁻¹ confirmed the adsorption of MG on cellulose is chemisorption and the negative ΔHᵒ (−11kJmol⁻¹) less than 40kJmol⁻¹ showed that the adsorption of MO on cellulose is physisorption. The ΔGᵒ values for the adsorption of MG and MO on BPR are not much increased with increase of temperature which indicated that the adsorption is independent of the temperature. The entropy change for the adsorption of MG and MO has proved that the MG (+ΔSᵒ) has less disorder at the adsorption interface and MO (−ΔSᵒ) has the high disorder at the adsorption interface. The recovery of both dyes has been studied in water at 80°C on BPR surface and observed that the MO recovery is 95% and MG is 10%. The poor desorption of MG is due to the strong chemisorption on BPR (cellulose) surface proves its plant poisoning nature. The high recovery of MO due to physisorption mechanism proves that MO is not poisoning the plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acellulose 3adesorption 3adyeing 3aeffluents 3aeggplants 3aentropy 3ahumans 3aindustry 3amalachite green 3amethyl orange 3apoisoning 3asoil 3atemperature 3atoxicity1 aKannan, Chellapandian0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 May 15, v. 189, no. 1-2 p.294-300dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.02.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01853naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012500168300001800293520072600311592002801037650002201065650001401087650002301101650002301124650002201147650001301169700001901182700002001201700002101221700002501242700002101267700002401288773008901312856008101401852000901482655001201491IND60109383720221119121425.0141109e20110624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010938372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.04.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorita, Hiroyuki10aSynthesis of ‘thianthrene dimer’ by the coupling reaction of stannylthianthrenes in the presence of copper catalysts  ap. 4672-4679.  aThe coupling reaction of 1-tributylstannylthianthrene (5) and 2-tributylstannylthianthrene (7) in the presence of copper catalysts at rt afforded the thianthrene dimer 1,1′-bithianthrene (3), 2,2′-bithianthrene (8), and 1,2′-dithianthrene (9) in high yields.

While these substrates have primarily been utilized to develop low-cost diagnostic devices, it is important to study whether these materials are suitable for more general chemical sensing applications. Here, we report chemical syntheses (inorganic and organic) and sensing using threads as microchannels. We first characterized the liquid transport through thread channels and then measured typical sample losses due to adsorption and evaporation. Next, we demonstrated synthesis of ferric hydroxide in a Y-geometry thread reactor and detected the product by colorimetry. Our low-cost device gave a product yield of 84% compared to a test tube-based synthesis. We also synthesized (with ∼72% yield) and detected colorless 2,4-dichloro-N-(2-morpholinoethyl) benzamide in an attempt to demonstrate an organic reaction in a thread device. Finally, we successfully detected bovine serum albumin and the glucose present in blood plasma as examples of detection of chemical substances relevant in diagnostics. Our results indicate that cotton and silk threads are indeed suitable materials for incorporation into field-deployable disposable chemical reaction and sensing systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3ablood plasma 3abovine serum albumin 3achemical reactions 3acolorimetry 3acotton 3adiagnostic techniques 3aevaporation 3aferric hydroxide 3aglucose 3apaper 3asilk 3asynthesis1 aRoychowdhury, Abhijit1 aTaneja, Neetika1 aJanrao, Ravindra1 aKhandare, Jayant1 aPaul, Debjani0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Sept., v. 186 p.439-445dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2013.06.0363Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013100170300001600301520137300317592002801690650001301718650001401731650001801745650001601763650001201779650002201791650001601813650002101829650001201850650000901862650002001871700001901891700001801910700002301928700002101951700002001972700001901992773010202011856008402113990002302197852000902220655001202229IND60110639920221118104739.0141109e20130313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011063992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxlet.2012.12.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurohane, Kohta10aLack of transient receptor potential melastatin 8 activation by phthalate esters that enhance contact hypersensitivity in mice  ap. 192-196.  aWe studied the involvement of sensory neurons in skin sensitization to allergens using a mouse model in which the T-helper type 2 response is essential. Skin sensitization to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) has been shown to be enhanced by several phthalate esters, including dibutyl phthalate (DBP). For different types of phthalate esters, we found a correlation between the ability of transient receptor potential (TRP) A1 activation and that of enhancing skin sensitization. A TRPA1-specific antagonist, HC-030031, was shown to suppress skin sensitization in the presence of DBP. However, since phthalate esters also activate TRPV1, phthalate esters could activate other types of TRP channels non-selectively. Furthermore, sensitization to FITC is also enhanced by menthol, which activates TRPA1 and TRPM8. Here we established an in vitro system for measuring TRPM8 activation. The selectivity for TRPM8 was established by the fact that two TRPM8 agonists (menthol and icilin) induced calcium mobilization, whereas agonists of TRPA1 and TRPV1 did not. We demonstrated that phthalate esters do not activate TRPM8. TRPA1-antagonist HC-030031 did not inhibit TRPM8 activation induced by menthol or icilin. These results show that phthalate esters activate TRPA1 and TRPV1 with selectivity. TRPM8 activation is not likely to be involved in the sensitization to FITC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aallergens 3aanimal models 3aantagonists 3acalcium 3adibutyl phthalate 3afluorescein 3ahypersensitivity 3amenthol 3amice 3asensory neurons1 aSahara, Yurina1 aKimura, Ayako1 aNarukawa, Masataka1 aWatanabe, Tatsuo1 aDaimon, Takashi1 aImai, Yasuyuki0 tToxicology letters.g2013 Mar. 13, v. 217, no. 3 p.192-196dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-42747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxlet.2012.12.0253Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03613naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002500188245012200213300001600335506007600351520145600427592002801883506003701911650001601948650001201964650001301976650003701989650001302026650001602039650002702055650001402082650004002096650002902136650004802165650004202213650003102255650001902286650002402305650002902329650002902358650004302387650001302430650003002443650006002473650002002533650006602553650006102619650001602680650002602696700001302722700001802735700002202753700001802775773010402793856008102897852000902978655001202987IND60102092520221207085133.0141106e20110715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010209252DNAL7 a216198842pmid7 aPMC37634862pmcid7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2011.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoshi, Kishore Kumar12aA Proteasome Assembly Defect in rpn3 Mutants Is Associated with Rpn11 Instability and Increased Sensitivity to Stress  ap. 383-399.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRpn11 is a proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme that is essential for viability. Recent genetic studies showed that Rpn11 is functionally linked to Rpn10, a major multiubiquitin chain binding receptor in the proteasome. Mutations in Rpn11 and Rpn10 can reduce the level and/or stability of proteasomes, indicating that both proteins influence its structural integrity. To characterize the properties of Rpn11, we examined its interactions with other subunits in the 19S regulatory particle and detected strong binding to Rpn3. Two previously described rpn3 mutants are sensitive to protein translation inhibitors and an amino acid analog. These mutants also display a mitochondrial defect. The abundance of intact proteasomes was significantly reduced in rpn3 mutants, as revealed by strongly reduced binding between 20S catalytic with 19S regulatory particles. Proteasome interaction with the shuttle factor Rad23 was similarly reduced. Consequently, higher levels of multiUb proteins were associated with Rad23, and proteolytic substrates were stabilized. The availability of Rpn11 is important for maintaining adequate levels of intact proteasomes, as its depletion caused growth and proteolytic defects in rpn3. These studies suggest that Rpn11 is stabilized following its incorporation into proteasomes. The instability of Rpn11 and the defects of rpn3 mutants are apparently caused by a failure to recruit Rpn11 into mature proteasomes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamino acids 3amutants 3amutation 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aproteins 3aproteolysis 3atranslation (genetics) 3aviability 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aCanavaninexpharmacology 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEndopeptidasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHygromycin Bxpharmacology 2aImmunoblotting 2aImmunoprecipitation 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aMitochondriaxmetabolism 2aMutant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMutation 2aParomomycinxpharmacology 2aProteasome Endopeptidase Complexxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Binding 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTemperature 2aUbiquitinxmetabolism1 aChen, Li1 aTorres, Nidza1 aTournier, Vincent1 aMadura, Kiran0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2011 July 15, v. 410, no. 3 p.383-399dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01634naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245011900176300001400295520067100309592002800980650001401008650001301022650002301035650001601058650001101074700001801085700001701103773008401120856008401204990002301288852000901311655001201320IND60103854820221119090009.0141107e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010385482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2012.04.1212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoa, Nguyen Thi Quynh10aNanographitic layer-mediated synthesis of carbon-TiO₂ hybrid nanobelts by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition  ap. 20-22.  aVertically-aligned, self-assembled carbon–Fe:TiO₂ hybrid nanobelts were synthesized using a simple and low-cost metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Residual C, a by-product of MOCVD reaction, was utilized to form a nanographitic layer at the tip of the nanobelts, by which the Fe:TiO₂ nanobelt growth was mediated as the growth temperature was determined judiciously at 510°C. The Fe:TiO₂ coating on the nanographitic layer is governed by Volmer–Weber and step-flow growth modes.

The p53 protein is known to have a central role in the response of the cell to cytotoxic or radiotoxic insults resulting in DNA damage. A reasonable requirement for a model describing intracellular signalling pathways is taking into account the basic feature of eukaryotic cells: the distinction between nucleus and cytoplasm. Our aim is to show, on a simple reaction network describing p53 dynamics, how this basic distinction provides a framework which is able to yield expected oscillatory dynamics without introducing either positive feedbacks or delays in the reactions. Furthermore we prove that oscillations appear only if some spatial constraints are respected, e.g. if the diffusion coefficients correspond to known biological values. Finally we analyse how the spatial features of a cell influence the dynamic response of the p53 network to DNA damage, pointing out that the protein oscillatory dynamics is indeed a response that is robust towards changes with respect to cellular environments. Even if we change the cell shape or its volume or better its ribosomal distribution, we observe that DNA damage yields sustained oscillations of p53.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3acellular microenvironment 3acytoplasm 3acytotoxicity 3aeukaryotic cells 3amodels 2aActive Transport, Cell Nucleusxphysiology 2aAtaxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins 2aBiological Clocksxphysiology 2aCell Cycle Proteinsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCell Nucleusxmetabolism 2aDNA Damagexphysiology 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aDiffusion 2aHumans 2aIntracellular Spacexmetabolism 2aModels, Biological 2aModels, Theoretical 2aProtein Transportxphysiology 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinasesxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aTissue Distributionxphysiology 2aTumor Suppressor Protein p53xmetabolism 2aTumor Suppressor Proteinsxmetabolismxphysiology.1 aClairambault, Jean1 aNatalini, Roberto0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g2013 Jan. 7, v. 316 p.9-24dElsevier Ltdx0022-51937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.08.0353Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01734naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009300170300001600263520072400279592002801003650002001031650002101051650003401072650001701106650002201123650001401145700002501159773012201184856008201306990002301388852000901411655001201420IND60101240720221120092157.0141106e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010124072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeem.2012.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrieger, James E.10aVerifiable and non-verifiable anonymous mechanisms for regulating a polluting monopolist  ap. 410-426.  aOptimal regulation of a polluting natural monopolist must correct for both external damages and market power to achieve a social optimum.

Several toxicity studies on SY are reported, however immunomodulatory properties have not been explored yet. To investigate the immunotoxic properties of SY, splenocytes were isolated, cultured and subjected to mitogen stimulated proliferation assay (lipopolysaccharide, LPS or concanavalin A, Con A), mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assay, immunophenotypic analysis of cell surface receptor expression and assay for cytokines release in the culture supernatants were performed in the presence of SY. Since SY did not exhibit any cytotoxicity up to 250μg/ml, this dose was used for further studies. It was observed that SY (250μg/ml) significantly (p<0.05) suppressed the mitogen induced proliferation of splenocytes and MLR response. Further, immunophenotypic analysis revealed that SY alters the relative expression of CD3e/CD4/CD8 in T cells and CD19 in B-cells. Consistent with the suppression of T-cell and B-cell responses and altered surface receptor expression, SY also lowered the expression of IL2, IL4, IL6, IL-17, IFN-γ and TNF-α cytokines. These results suggest that non-cytotoxic dose of SY may have immunomodulatory effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconcanavalin A 3alipopolysaccharides 3ainterleukin-17 3aT-lymphocytes 3ainterferon-gamma 3acytotoxicity 3aimmunomodulators 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-6 3afood coloring 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3asplenocytes 3acolor 3aimmunotoxicity 3atoxicity testing 3ainterleukin-4 3aB-lymphocytes 0afunctional response1 aKumar, Arvind1 aTripathi, Anurag1 aDas, Mukul0 tToxicology letters.g2013 Mar. 13, v. 217, no. 3 p.197-204dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-42747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxlet.2012.12.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012600169300001600295520136600311592002801677650002301705650000801728650001301736650001601749650002401765650003301789650001201822650002701834650001101861650001701872650002301889650001801912700002001930700002201950700002301972700001901995773009402014856008402108852000902192655001202201IND60105936320221121062906.0141108e20110310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010593632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2010.12.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGallo, Loreana10aInfluence of spray-drying operating conditions on Rhamnus purshiana (Cáscara sagrada) extract powder physical properties  ap. 205-214.  aThe aim of this work was to study Rhamnus purshiana (Cáscara sagrada) extract spray-drying in order to obtain powders with good rheological properties for direct compression (DC) and stability attributes. The experiments were carried out in a Büchi B-290 Mini Spray Dryer using colloidal silicon dioxide as carrier agent. A 2⁵⁻¹ fractional factorial statistical design was used to find adequate spray-drying operating conditions to produce Cáscara sagrada powders with good flow, good compactability properties, high process yield, low moisture content, low hygroscopicity, and caking tendency. Morphology, size, structural and thermal properties of the particles were also evaluated. The operating variables studied were air inlet temperature, atomization air flow rate, pump feed rate, aspiration capacity, and feed solids concentration. The 2⁵⁻¹ factorial experimental design used was a good strategy to establish spray-drying operating conditions to produce Cáscara sagrada extract powders with good properties for direct compression and high process yields. Colloidal silicon dioxide was an effective drying adjuvant. Its use in relatively high concentrations together with low atomization air flow rates improved powder flowability, increased the product's glass transition temperature, and decreased its moisture content and hygroscopicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFrangula purshiana 3aair 3aair flow 3aatomization 3aexperimental design 3aglass transition temperature 3apowders 3arheological properties 3asilica 3aspray drying 3athermal properties 3awater content1 aLlabot, Juan M.1 aAllemandi, Daniel1 aBucalá, Verónica1 aPiña, Juliana0 tPowder technology.g2011 Mar. 10, v. 208, no. 1 p.205-214dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2010.12.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02143naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245010800176300001600284520081900300592002801119650001101147650001801158650002401176650001301200650001001213650001501223650001301238650001101251650003001262650001401292650001301306651001701319700001901336700001501355700002701370700001701397700001601414700002401430700002301454700003701477773007701514856008501591852000901676655001201685IND60111250720221120152826.0141109e20121231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011125072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.10.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGessner, Bradford D.10aPneumococcal serotype distribution among meningitis cases from Togo and Burkina Faso during 2007–2009  ap.

Although there is evidence for a genetic component of the disorder, other causes, such as prenatal insults are considered among the potential factors that may contribute to the development of the syndrome. Over the past few decades, several animal models have been developed in an attempt to understand the potential contribution of exposure to excess steroids on the development of this syndrome. The current review summarizes the phenotypes of current animal models exposed to excess steroid during the prenatal and early postnatal period and how they compare with the phenotype seen in women with PCOS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aanimal ovaries 3aetiology 3aphenotype 3apolycystic ovary syndrome 3apostpartum period 3asteroids 3awomen1 aVeiga-Lopez, Almudena0 tSteroids.g2013 Aug., v. 78, no. 8 p.734-740dElsevier Inc.x0039-128X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.steroids.2013.05.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245016900175300001600344520147500360592002801835650000801863650001101871650002201882650001901904650001101923650001901934650001401953650002201967650001601989650002502005650001502030700002502045700002902070773010802099856008502207852000902292655001202301IND60101333920221121094355.0141106e20110515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010133392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopes, Rodrigo J.G.10aIntegrated detoxification methodology of hazardous phenolic wastewaters in environmentally based trickle-bed reactors: Experimental investigation and CFD simulation  ap. 108-118.  aCentralized environmental regulations require the use of efficient detoxification technologies for the secure disposal of hazardous wastewaters. Guided by federal directives, existing plants need reengineering activities and careful analysis to improve their overall effectiveness and to become environmentally friendly. Here, we illustrate the application of an integrated methodology which encompasses the experimental investigation of catalytic wet air oxidation and CFD simulation of trickle-bed reactors. As long as trickle-bed reactors are determined by the flow environment coupled with chemical kinetics, first, on the optimization of prominent numerical solution parameters, the CFD model was validated with experimental data taken from a trickle bed pilot plant specifically designed for the catalytic wet oxidation of phenolic wastewaters. Second, several experimental and computational runs were carried out under unsteady-state operation to evaluate the dynamic performance addressing the TOC concentration and temperature profiles. CFD computations of total organic carbon conversion were found to agree better with experimental data at lower temperatures. Finally, the comparison of test data with simulation results demonstrated that this integrated framework was able to describe the mineralization of organic matter in trickle beds and the validated consequence model can be exploited to promote cleaner remediation technologies of contaminated waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbon 3aenvironmental law 3amineralization 3amodels 3aorganic matter 3aoxidation 3areaction kinetics 3aremediation 3atemperature profiles 3awastewater1 aAlmeida, Teresa S.A.1 aQuinta-Ferreira, Rosa M.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 May 15, v. 189, no. 1-2 p.108-118dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02239naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001100148245012700159300001600286500001500302520097300317592002801290650001101318650001201329650001701341650001601358650002001374650002301394650002301417650002001440653001701460700001501477700001501492700001101507700001501518700001601533700001501549700001801564700001501582773011701597856008201714852000901796655001201805IND60100689320221119210435.0141105e20110615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010068932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2011.03.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, He10aFacile synthesis of amino-functionalized hollow silica microspheres and their potential application for ultrasound imaging  ap. 392-398.  a2019-12-04  aBy using the positive charged polystyrene (PS) microsphere as template, mono-disperse amino-(–NH₂) functionalized hollow silica microspheres (HSMS-NH₂) with ∼1310nm in diameter and uniform shells were successfully prepared with a modified sol–gel process. The amino functionalized silica were coated on the PS microspheres via ammonia catalysis, co-hydrolysis and condensation of TEOS and APTES, and then the PS templates were selectively dissolved in THF solution to form the functional hollow microspheres. The controllable thickness (35–85nm) and amino density (2.46×10⁻⁵–6.18×10⁻⁵mol/g) of the shells could be facilely tuned by changing the amount of TEOS and APTES. In vitro ultrasound images of as-prepared HSMS-NH₂ with different concentrations in the physiological saline solution were further investigated.

A codon-optimized synthetic gene encoding this enzyme was transformed into rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica) under the control of the rice seed storage protein Gt1 promoter. The transgenic line C19 was identified as the one with the highest endoglucanase activity among the total of 36 independent transgenic lines obtained. The cellulase activity in the C19 seeds was estimated at about 830U/g of dried seeds using CMC as substrate. The enzymes produced in the seeds had an optimum pH of 5.0 and optimum temperature of 80°C, which is similar to the enzymes produced by the native bacterium host. This study demonstrates that the transgenic rice seeds could be used as a bioreactor for production of enzymes for cellulosic biomass conversion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidothermus cellulolyticus 3aOryza sativa 3abacteria 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3acellulose 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aglucose 3ahydrolysis 3apH 3arice 3aseed storage 3aseeds 3asynthetic genes 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3atransgenic plants1 aZhang, Wei1 aLin, Chaoyang1 aXu, Xiaoli1 aShen, Zhicheng0 tProtein expression and purification.g2012 Apr., v. 82, no. 2 p.279-283dElsevier Inc.x1046-59287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2012.01.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03981naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245010900187300001600296520160800312592002801920650002501948650002901973650001602002650003002018650001102048650001702059650001302076650001402089650001602103650001102119650002402130650003902154650005902193650002202252650003302274650005402307650001102361650005502372650002902427650006102456650002802517650001302545650005702558650003602615650002202651650005502673650005202728650007202780650006002852650002402912700002502936700001902961700002102980700002103001700001803022700002103040700001903061700002103080773010403101856008103205852000903286655001203295IND60102092620221116182348.0141106e20110715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010209262DNAL7 a216215462pmid7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2011.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlikhani, Nyosha10aTargeting Capacity and Conservation of PreP Homologues Localization in Mitochondria of Different Species  ap. 400-410.  aMitochondrial presequences and other unstructured peptides are degraded inside mitochondria by presequence proteases (PrePs) identified in Arabidopsis thaliana (AtPreP), humans (hPreP), and yeast (Cym1/Mop112). The presequences of A. thaliana and human PreP are predicted to consist of 85 and 29 amino acids, respectively, whereas the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cym1/Mop112 presequence contains only 7 residues. These differences may explain the reported targeting of homologous proteins to different mitochondrial subcompartments. Here we have investigated the targeting capacity of the PreP homologues' presequences. We have produced fusion constructs containing N-terminal portions of AtPreP(1–125), hPreP(1–69), and Cym1(1–40) coupled to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and studied their import into isolated plant, mammalian, and yeast mitochondria, followed by mitochondrial subfractionation. Whereas the AtPreP presequence has the capacity to target GFP into the mitochondrial matrix of all three species, the hPreP presequence only targets GFP to the matrix of mammalian and yeast mitochondria. The Cym1/Mop112 presequence has an overall much weaker targeting capacity and only ensures mitochondrial sorting in its host species yeast. Revisiting the submitochondrial localization of Cym1 revealed that endogenous Cym1/Mop112 is localized to the matrix space, as has been previously reported for the plant and human homologues. Moreover, complementation studies in yeast show that native AtPreP restores the growth phenotype of yeast cells lacking Cym1, demonstrating functional conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aamino acids 3agreen fluorescent protein 3ahumans 3amitochondria 3apeptides 3aphenotype 3aproteinases 3ayeasts 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBlotting, Western 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aMetalloproteasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMitochondriaxmetabolism 2aMitochondrial Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPeptide Hydrolasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPeptidesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Transport 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSerine Endopeptidasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSpecies Specificity1 aBerglund, Anna-Karin1 aEngmann, Tanja1 aSpånning, Erika1 aVögtle, F.-Nora1 aPavlov, Pavel1 aMeisinger, Chris1 aLanger, Thomas1 aGlaser, Elzbieta0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2011 July 15, v. 410, no. 3 p.400-410dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03181naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012500172300001600297520203300313592002802346650002902374650002602403650001602429650001302445650001702458650001402475650001502489650001402504650001302518651001202531700002302543700002102566700001702587700002002604773007702624856008502701852000902786655001202795IND60111250820221120152130.0141109e20121231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011125082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.10.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElmdaghri, Naima10aChanging epidemiology of pediatric Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates before vaccine introduction in Casablanca (Morocco)  ap. G46-G50.  aThe objective of this study was to describe the evolution over time of serotypes and antimicrobial resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates responsible for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children ≤5years in Casablanca (Morocco), before vaccine introduction. Isolates recovered from cases of IPD in children ≤5years during two study periods (1994–2001 and 2006–2010) were compared in terms of serotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility. Serogrouping was done using Pneumotest Kit and serotyping was done by the Quellung capsular swelling. Antibiotic susceptibility pattern was determined by Etest method. The theoretical coverages of the 7-, 10- and 13-valent pneumococcal vaccines were determined. A total of 85 and 102 isolates were studied for the two periods, respectively. During the first period, the most prevalent serogroups/serotypes were 5, 7, 1, 14, 6, 23, 19, 2, 15 and 18, whereas during the second study period, the most frequent were 19, 14, 6, 23, 5, 1 and 18. From 2006 to 2010, serotype 19A accounted for 7.8% of the isolates, whereas serogroups 33 and 22 were rarely isolated (1% each). Assuming cross protection among serogroups, the respective coverage rates for the first vs. second periods reached 40% vs. 53.9% for PCV7, 74.1% vs. 71.6% for PCV10 and 75.3% vs. 82.4% for PCV13. The prevalence of penicillin-nonsusceptibility increased (22.4% vs. 48.5%) as well as the levels of penicillin-resistance (5.9% vs. 15.8%). Penicillin-nonsusceptibility was relatively low across both study periods in serogroups 7, 15, 1 and 5, whereas it was high in serogroups 14, 19 and 23. In conclusion, serotype fluctuations and increases in antibiotic resistance of S. pneumoniae occurred in Casablanca before vaccine introduction. Both of these variations are probably linked to the increase in antibiotic use that has occurred in Casablanca over time. There is a need for a continuous surveillance to assess the vaccine formulations, monitor vaccine impact and to guide treatment recommendations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3achildren 3aepidemiology 3aevolution 3amonitoring 3aserotypes 3avaccines 3aMorocco1 aBenbachir, Mohamed1 aBelabbes, Houria1 aZaki, Bahija1 aBenzaid, Hanane0 tVaccine.g2012 Dec. 31, v. 30S6 p.G46-G50dElsevier Ltdx0264-410X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.10.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01951naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010200171300001600273520081100289592002801100650002201128650001501150650002201165650002601187650001801213650001601231650001401247650003701261700002201298700001801320700002001338700001701358773008601375856008401461990002301545852000901568655001201577IND60103855120221119085740.0141107e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010385512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2012.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilambarasan, A.10aMonodispersed synthesis of hierarchical wurtzite ZnS nanostructures and its functional properties  ap. 209-211.  aWurtzite type ZnS with flower-like hierarchical morphology has been synthesised at low temperature by wet chemical route using l-threonine as a surface modifying and morphology directing agent.

We identified tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 4 (TRAF4) as a key component mediating pro-oncogenic TGF-β-induced SMAD and non-SMAD signaling. Upon TGF-β stimulation, TRAF4 is recruited to the active TGF-β receptor complex, where it antagonizes E3 ligase SMURF2 and facilitates the recruitment of deubiquitinase USP15 to the TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI). Both processes contribute to TβRI stabilization on the plasma membrane and thereby enhance TGF-β signaling. In addition, the TGF-β receptor-TRAF4 interaction triggers Lys 63-linked TRAF4 polyubiquitylation and subsequent activation of the TGF-β-activated kinase (TAK)1. TRAF4 is required for efficient TGF-β-induced migration, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and breast cancer metastasis. Elevated TRAF4 expression correlated with increased levels of phosphorylated SMAD2 and phosphorylated TAK1 as well as poor prognosis among breast cancer patients. Our results demonstrate that TRAF4 can regulate the TGF-β pathway and is a key determinant in breast cancer pathogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3atumor necrosis factors 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 3aprognosis 3ametastasis 3atransforming growth factor beta 3apatients 3aplasma membrane 3abreast neoplasms 0apathogenesis1 aZhou, Fangfang1 aGarcía de Vinuesa, Amaya1 ade Kruijf, Esther M.1 aMesker, Wilma E.1 aHui, Li1 aDrabsch, Yvette1 aLi, Yihao1 aBauer, Andreas1 aRousseau, Adrien1 aSheppard, Kelly-Ann1 aMickanin, Craig1 aKuppen, Peter J.K.1 aLu, Chris X.1 aDijke, Peter ten,0 tMolecular cell.g2013 Sept. 12, v. 51 p.559-572dElsevier Inc.x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2013.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02198naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015000169300001800319520112200337592002801459650001701487650001301504650001401517650002201531650004301553650002101596650000701617700002101624700001701645700001901662773008501681856008501766852000901851655001201860IND60109149420221119001847.0141109e20111015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010914942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2011.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Shaodong10aComparison of two aerosol-based detectors for the analysis of gabapentin in pharmaceutical formulations by hydrophilic interaction chromatography  ap. 2301-2306.  aComparison of hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) columns coupled with an evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) or charged aerosol detector (CAD) was done for the detection of gabapentin in pharmaceutical formulations. The chromatographic separations were achieved on four HILIC columns: ZIC HILIC, ZIC pHILIC, Luna HILIC, and Atlantis HILIC. Experimental factors such as mobile phase composition, acetonitrile content, and mobile phase pH were evaluated. Validation of method was done in terms of linearity, sensitivity, accuracy, and precision. The performance of ELSD detection method is comparable to that of CAD. The intra-day and inter-day variations were below 1.7% and 3.2% for CAD and 2.8%, and 3.4% for ELSD, respectively. In addition, detection sensitivities of ELSD, CAD, and UV detectors were also compared for HILIC and reversed phase (RP) modes and the highest sensitivities were obtained in the HILIC mode when connected with CAD and ELSD. The developed HILIC aerosol based detection methods were successfully applied to the analysis of gabapentin in commercial tablets and capsules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aaerosols 3adetectors 3adrug formulations 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3alight scattering 3apH1 aPark, Jeong Hill1 aLee, Jeongmi1 aKwon, Sung Won0 tTalanta.g2011 Oct. 15, v. 85, no. 5 p.2301-2306dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2011.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013800169300001400307520143600321592002801757650002501785650001901810650001001829650001301839650001301852650001701865650001301882650001601895700001801911700002101929700002201950700001701972773009901989856008402088852000902172655001202181IND60101944320221121033718.0141106e20121115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010194432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2012.06.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavid, Oana C.10aHydrogen separation from multicomponent gas mixtures containing CO, N₂ and CO₂ using Matrimid® asymmetric hollow fiber membranes  ap. 49-56.  aThe application of hollow fiber membranes for the separation of industrial gas mixtures relies on the correct characterization of the permeation of the involved gaseous components through the hollow fiber membranes. Thus, this study is focused on the characterization of the permeation through Matrimid® hollow fiber membranes of four gas mixtures containing H₂ (H₂/N₂, H₂/CO, H₂/CO₂), and the quaternary gas mixture H₂/N₂/CO/CO₂, working at a constant temperature of 303K and pressures up to 10bar. The main differences and similarities in the gas permeation properties of hollow fibers with respect to flat membranes, as well as in the permeation of gas mixtures with respect to pure gases, are discussed. Our results suggest that for mixtures containing H₂ and CO₂ hollow fiber membranes perform better than flat membranes given that a lower depression in the permeability of H₂ has been observed. At 2.3bar feed pressure, ideal selectivity values obtained for H₂/N₂, H₂/CO and H₂/CO₂ gas pairs were 74.4, 42.6 and 5 respectively, with a H₂ permeance of 50.2×10⁻⁸m³(STP)m⁻²s⁻¹kPa⁻¹. The specific behavior observed in the permeation through hollow fiber has been explained by a combination of different phenomena such as hollow fiber membrane substructure resistance, CO₂ induced plasticization and competitive sorption effects between the components of the gaseous mixtures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acarbon dioxide 3agases 3ahydrogen 3anitrogen 3apermeability 3asorption 3atemperature1 aGorri, Daniel1 aNijmeijer, Kitty1 aOrtiz, Inmaculada1 aUrtiaga, Ane0 tJournal of membrane science.g2012 Nov. 15, v. 419-420 p.49-56dElsevier B.V.x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2012.06.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245018900170300001600359520139000375592002801765650002101793650002301814650002301837650001701860650001301877650001901890650002101909650001701930650002801947650001801975650003001993650002502023650002502048650001902073650000902092700002202101700002502123700002002148700002602168700002302194700002402217700002302241700002002264773010802284856008102392990002302473852000902496655001202505IND60107628720221122013032.0141108e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010762872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pep.2012.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Clelton A.12aA novel protein refolding protocol for the solubilization and purification of recombinant peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein from Xylella fastidiosa overexpressed in Escherichia coli  ap. 284-289.  aXylella fastidiosa is a Gram-negative xylem-limited plant pathogenic bacterium responsible for several economically important crop diseases. Here, we present a novel and efficient protein refolding protocol for the solubilization and purification of recombinant X. fastidiosa peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (XfPal). Pal is an outer membrane protein that plays important roles in maintaining the integrity of the cell envelope and in bacterial pathogenicity. Because Pal has a highly hydrophobic N-terminal domain, the heterologous expression studies necessary for structural and functional protein characterization are laborious once the recombinant protein is present in inclusion bodies. Our protocol based on the denaturation of the XfPal-enriched inclusion bodies with 8M urea followed by buffer-exchange steps via dialysis proved effective for the solubilization and subsequent purification of XfPal, allowing us to obtain a large amount of relatively pure and folded protein. In addition, XfPal was biochemically and functionally characterized. The method for purification reported herein is valuable for further research on the three-dimensional structure and function of Pal and other outer membrane proteins and can contribute to a better understanding of the role of these proteins in bacterial pathogenicity, especially with regard to the plant pathogen X. fastidiosa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aXylella fastidiosa 3abacterial proteins 3adenaturation 3adialysis 3ahydrophobicity 3ainclusion bodies 3alipoproteins 3aouter membrane proteins 3apathogenicity 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3apurification methods 3arecombinant proteins 3asolubilization 3aurea1 aBeloti, Lilian L.1 aToledo, Marcelo A.S.1 aCrucello, Aline1 aFavaro, Marianna T.P.1 aMendes, Juliano S.1 aSantiago, André S.1 aAzzoni, Adriano R.1 aSouza, Anete P.0 tProtein expression and purification.g2012 Apr., v. 82, no. 2 p.284-289dElsevier Inc.x1046-59287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2012.01.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03251naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003700135040001800172100002000190245009200210300001800302520114300320592002801463650001001491650002001501650001401521650001301535650001201548650000901560650001801569650001801587650002401605650003001629650002001659650003601679650002101715650004401736650005801780650001101838650002201849650001101871650001401882650001101896650002001907650002601927650005101953650000902004650002602013650001702039650001702056651001102073651002602084700002302110700002302133700002102156700002202177700002602199700003002225700003302255700001502288700002802303773009502331856008302426990002302509852000902532655001202541IND60102590220221120193928.0141106e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010259022DNAL7 a222849212pmid7 aPMC33607982pmcid7 a10.1016/j.jpeds.2011.12.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAfeiche, Myriam10aWindows of Lead Exposure Sensitivity, Attained Height, and Body Mass Index at 48 Months  ap. 1044-1049.  aOBJECTIVE: To examine longitudinal associations of prenatal, infancy, and early childhood lead exposure during sensitive periods with height and body mass index (BMI). STUDY DESIGN: A total of 773 participants were recruited between 1994 and 2005 in Mexico City. Lead exposure history categories were constructed for the prenatal period (maternal patellar lead concentration) and for infancy and childhood (mean child blood lead concentration at birth to 24 months and 30-48 months, respectively). Linear regression models were used to study lead exposure history with height and BMI at 48 months. RESULTS: Mean height at age 48 months was significantly lower in children with a blood lead level exceeding the median during infancy (−0.84 cm; 95% CI, −1.42 to −0.25) than in children with a level below the median. Prenatal lead exposure was not associated with height at 48 months. Results for attained BMI generally trended in the same direction as for height. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest an effect of lead exposure early in life on height attainment at 48 months, with the exposure window of greatest sensitivity in infancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3abody mass index 3achildhood 3achildren 3ainfancy 3alead 3alinear models 3aprenatal care 3aregression analysis 2aBody Heightxdrug effects 2aBody Mass Index 2aChild Developmentxdrug effects 2aChild, Preschool 2aEnvironmental Exposurexadverse effects 2aEnvironmental Illnessxepidemiologyxphysiopathology. 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aInfant 2aInfant, Newborn 2aLeadxadverse effects 2aLead Poisoningxepidemiologyxphysiopathology. 2aMale 2aRetrospective Studies 2aRisk Factors 2aTime Factors 3aMexico 0aMexicoxepidemiology.1 aPeterson, Karen E.1 aSánchez, Brisa N.1 aSchnaas, Lourdes1 aCantonwine, David1 aEttinger, Adrienne S.1 aSolano-González, Maritsa1 aHernández-Ávila, Mauricio,1 aHu, Howard1 aTéllez-Rojo, Martha M.0 tJournal of pediatrics.g2012 June, v. 160, no. 6 p.1044-1049dMosby, Inc.x0022-34767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2011.12.0223Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01700naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245014500168300001600313520070500329592002801034650001401062650002401076650002201100650003401122700001801156773012201174856008201296990002301378852000901401655001201410IND60101241020221120092357.0141106e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010124102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeem.2012.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerino, Grischa10aDoes more stringent environmental regulation induce or reduce technology adoption? When the rate of technology adoption is inverted U-shaped  ap. 456-467.  aWe show that for a broad class of technologies the relationship between policy stringency and the rate of technology adoption is inverted U-shaped. This happens when the marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves of conventional and new technologies intersect, which invariably occurs when emissions are proportional to output and technological progress reduces emissions per output. This outcome does not result from policy failure. On the contrary, in social optimum, the relationship between the slope of the marginal damage curve and the rate of technology adoption is also inverted U-shaped. Under more general conditions, these curves can look even more complicated (e.g., such as inverted W-shaped).  aPublisher supplied data 3aemissions 3ainnovation adoption 3aissues and policy 3amarginal abatement cost curve1 aRequate, Till0 tJournal of Environmental Economics and Management.g2012 Nov., v. 64, no. 3 p.456-467dElsevier Inc.x0095-06967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2012.03.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003900135040001800174100001700192245008700209300001600296506007600312520117400388592002801562506003701590650002901627650001801656650002001674650002201694650001301716650001501729650005801744650004101802650005001843650004301893650003101936650001901967650004501986650003602031650002402067650006102091700002202152700001902174700002302193773010502216856008502321852000902406655001202415IND60100343820221207073405.0141105e20110315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010034382DNAL7 a213427942pmid7 aPMC37039612pmcid7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.01.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGokce, Emine10aIncreasing proteome coverage with offline RP HPLC coupled to online RP nanoLC–MS  ap. 610-614.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFractionation prior to mass spectrometry is an indispensable step in proteomics. In this paper we report the success of performing offline reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionation on a C18 2.0mm×150mm column at the peptide level with microliter per minute flow rates prior to online nano-flow reversed phase liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (nanoLC–MS) using the well-studied fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A C18 75μm×150mm column was used online and the online elution gradients for each fraction were adjusted in order to obtain well resolved separation. Comparing this method directly to only performing nanoLC–MS we observed a 61.6% increase in the number of identified proteins. At a 1% false discovery rate 1028 proteins were identified using two dimensions of RPLC versus 636 proteins identified in a single nano-flow separation. The majority of proteins identified by one dimension of nano-LC were present in the proteins identified in our two dimensional strategy. Although increasing analysis time, this non-orthogonal and facile pre-fractionation method affords a more comprehensive examination of the proteome.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3afractionation 3afungal proteins 3amass spectrometry 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aChromatography, Reverse-Phasexmethods 2aMass Spectrometryxmethods 2aNanotechnology 2aPeptide Fragmentsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aProteomexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aProteomicsxmethods 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxanalysisxmetabolism.1 aAndrews, Genna L.1 aDean, Ralph A.1 aMuddiman, David C.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Mar. 15, v. 879, no. 9-10 p.610-614dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.01.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01530naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245012600161300001600287520063000303592002800933650001100961650001100972650001900983651001001002700001801012700001501030773013801045856004801183852000901231655001201240IND50062216220221119111410.0130321e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006221622DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-013-2039-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jing12aA redescription of grey pomfret Pampus cinereus (Bloch, 1795) with the designation of a neotype (Teleostei: Stromateidae)  ap. 140-145.  aPampus cinereus (Bloch, 1795) (Stromateidae), a species believed to be widely distributed throughout the Indo-Western Pacific region, was redescribed and a neotype was designated. The designation of a neotype was necessary because of ambiguous data in Bloch’s original description and the loss of the original type specimen. Morphological data indicated that 10 recently-collected specimens from the coasts of southern China agreed well with Bloch’s original description and figure of P. cinereus.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the anti-dermatophytic potential of biologically synthesized Au NPs using the cell free supernatant of Streptomyces sp. VITDDK3. The synthesized Au NPs were characterized using UV–visible spectra at 550nm. XRD pattern analysis revealed peaks at 38.10° (111), 44.28° (200), 64.42° (220) and 77.37° (311) corresponding to the diffraction facets of Au. SEM analysis showed that the Au NPs were cubical in shape with an average size of 90nm. The synthesized Au NPs were tested by the well diffusion method for antifungal activity (zones of inhibition) against Microphyton gypseum (10±0.47mm) and Trichophyton rubrum (13±1.03mm).  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptomyces 3aTrichophyton rubrum 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantifungal properties 3agold 3ananoparticles 3ascanning electron microscopy1 aThenmozhi, Mohankumar1 aKannabiran, Krishnan1 aRajakumar, Govindasamy1 aVelayutham, Kanayairam1 aRahuman, Abdul Abdul0 tMaterials letters.g2013 Feb. 15, v. 93 p.360-362dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2012.11.1253Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02122naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100001700197245011000214300001600324520097700340592002801317650001401345650001001359650000901369650001501378650002001393700001801413700001901431700003301450700002001483700001801503773010501521856009001626990002301716852000901739655001201748IND60110969020221119065242.0141109e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011096902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2011.10.0142doi7 aPMC32548362pmcid7 a221781682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHah, Zaegyoo10aIntegration of Crawling Waves in an Ultrasound Imaging System. Part 2: Signal Processing and Applications  ap. 312-323.  aThis paper introduces methods to generate crawling wave interference patterns from the displacement fields generated from radiation force pushes on a GE Logiq 9 scanner. The same transducer and system provides both the pushing pulses to generate the shear waves and the tracking pulses to measure the displacements. Acoustic power and system limitations result in largely impulsive displacement fields. Measured displacements from pushes on either side of a region-of-interest (ROI) are used to calculate continuously varying interference patterns. This technique is explained along with a brief discussion of the conventional mechanical source-driven crawling waves for comparison. We demonstrate the method on three example cases: a gelatin-based phantom with a cylindrical inclusion, an oil-gelatin phantom and mouse livers. The oil-gelatin phantom and the mouse livers demonstrate not only shear speed estimation, but the frequency dependence of the shear wave speeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aliver 3amice 3amonitoring 3aultrasonography1 aHazard, Chris1 aMills, Bradley1 aBarry, Chrisq(Christopher),1 aRubens, Deborah1 aParker, Kevin0 tUltrasound in medicine & biology.g2012 Feb., v. 38, no. 2 p.312-323dElsevier Inc.x0301-56297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2011.10.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02337naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245007300173300001600246520110900262592002801371650001601399650001101415650001001426650002401436650003501460650001301495650001901508650001101527650001201538650001101550650001201561650001901573650002001592650001701612650001401629700002301643700002201666773009601688856008701784990002301871852000901894655001201903IND60107562720221119201049.0141108e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010756272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pneurobio.2010.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRinkwitz, Silke10aZebrafish: An integrative system for neurogenomics and neurosciences  ap. 231-243.  aRapid technological advances over the past decade have moved us closer to a high throughput molecular approach to neurobiology, where we see the merging of neurogenetics, genomics, physiology, imaging and pharmacology. This is the case more in zebrafish than in any other model organism commonly used. Recent improvements in the generation of transgenic zebrafish now allow genetic manipulation and live imaging of neuronal development and function in early embryonic, larval, and adult animals. The sequenced zebrafish genome and comparative genomics give unprecedented insights into genome evolution and its relation to genome structure and function. There is now information on embryonic and larval expression of over 12,000 genes and just under 1000 mutant phenotypes. We review the remarkable similarity of the zebrafish genetic blueprint for the nervous system to that of mammals and assess recent technological advances that make the zebrafish a model of choice for elucidating the development and function of neuronal circuitry, transgene-based neuroanatomy, and small molecule neuropharmacology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aadults 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3agenetically modified organisms 3agenomics 3aimage analysis 3alarvae 3amammals 3amodels 3amutants 3anervous system 3aneurophysiology 3apharmacology 3aphenotype1 aMourrain, Philippe1 aBecker, Thomas S.0 tProgress in neurobiology.g2011 Feb., v. 93, no. 2 p.231-243dElsevier Ltdx0301-00827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pneurobio.2010.11.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245017800160300001600338520114700354592002801501650001701529650002201546650001901568650001601587650001501603650001801618650001701636650001501653650001101668650002901679650001501708650001501723650001301738650002401751650002101775650001401796650000901810650001001819650002901829700001501858700001901873700001201892700001801904700001901922700001901941700001401960700001701974773011501991856008202106990002302188852000902211655001202220IND60103007820221120124241.0141106e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010300782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jpba.2013.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Jun12aA sensitive LC–MS/MS method for simultaneous determination of six flavonoids in rat plasma: Application to a pharmacokinetic study of total flavonoids from mulberry leaves  ap. 189-195.  aA simple and sensitive LC–MS/MS method has been developed and validated for the determination of rutin, isoquercitrin, astragalin, quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin in rat plasma using naringin as the internal standard (IS). The plasma samples were pretreated and extracted by liquid–liquid extraction. Chromatographic separation was accomplished on a C18 column with a 10min gradient elution using acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.3mLmin⁻¹. A tandem mass spectrometric detection was conducted using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) via an electrospray ionization (ESI) source and operating in the negative ionization mode. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of each analyte was lower than 1ngmL⁻¹. Intra-day and inter-day precisions were less than 11.9%. The relative errors of accuracy were in the range of −9.2% to 6.1%. The mean recoveries of flavonoids and IS were higher than 53.8%. The proposed method was further applied to investigate the pharmacokinetics of all analytes after a single oral administration of total flavonoids from mulberry leaves to rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aaqueous solutions 3achromatography 3aformic acid 3aionization 3aisoquercitrin 3aisorhamnetin 3akaempferol 3aleaves 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3amonitoring 3amulberries 3anaringin 3aoral administration 3apharmacokinetics 3aquercetin 3arats 3arutin 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aFeng, Ying1 aOuyang, Hui-zi1 aYu, Bin1 aChang, Yan-xu1 aPan, Gui-xiang1 aDong, Gai-ying1 aWang, Tao1 aGao, Xiu-mei0 tJournal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis.g2013 Oct., v. 84 p.189-195dElsevier B.V.x0731-70857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2013.06.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02339naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245007500174300001400249520119300263592002801456650002901484650002701513650001901540650002301559650002401582650002401606650001401630650001101644700002101655700002301676700002301699700002301722773010401745856008401849990002301933852000901956655001201965IND60108858020221122194613.0141108e20120305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010885802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seppur.2011.11.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBicalho, Isabele C.10aSeparation of yeast from alcoholic fermentation in small hydrocyclones  ap. 62-70.  aIn the fermentation process of ethanol production, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is recovered and recycled to a new stage of fermentation. This separation process is a challenge because the yeast is small and low density. Thus, the hydrocyclone is an interesting alternative because it uses the same principle of centrifugal separation, requires low maintenance and can be readily sterilized. This work aimed to study the separation process of yeast from fermentation using hydrocyclones. A factorial experimental design (3⁴) was applied, and the results were used for the determination of empirical mathematical models that describe capacity, total separation efficiency and flow ratio as functions of different geometric variables and pressure drops. Total separation efficiencies were obtained between 36.54% and 92.02%, capacities from 0.1183 to 0.4579m³/h and flow ratios ranging from 31.74% to 84.30%. The centrifugal forces generated within these devices were also investigated, which ranged from 291 to 4153g. The effect of the separation process on cell viability was also evaluated for the largest pressure drop conditions, verifying the reduction of viability below 7%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aalcoholic fermentation 3acell viability 3aethanol production 3aexperimental design 3amathematical models 3arecycling 3ayeasts1 aMognon, José L.1 aShimoyama, Juliana1 aAtaíde, Carlos H.1 aDuarte, Claudio R.0 tSeparation and purification technology.g2012 Mar. 5, v. 87 p.62-70dElsevier B.V.x1383-58667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2011.11.0233Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01848naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014100163300001800304520062700322592002800949650001400977650002300991650002301014650001101037650001501048650001201063650001201075650001301087650001201100653002501112653004101137653001601178653001101194653002801205700001501233700001901248773008101267856008101348852000901429655001201438IND60109630920221118054215.0161018e20130701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010963092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2013.04.1062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Ruian10aMCM-41-immobilized bidentate nitrogen copper(I) complex: a highly efficient and recyclable catalyst for Buchwald N-arylation of indoles  ap. 5444-5450.  aThe heterogeneous N-arylation reaction of indoles with aryl halides was achieved in toluene at 110 °C by using 4 mol % MCM-41-immobilized bidentate nitrogen copper(I) complex [MCM-41–2N-CuI] as catalyst and K3PO4 as base, yielding a variety of N-arylindoles in good to excellent yields.

A C8 guard column was used to desalt the samples before analytical separation on a C18 column and detection with tandem mass spectrometry. The mobile phase consisted of methanol/acetonitrile/water (v/v/v, 22.5/22.2/55) was used for desalting and the mobile phase consisted of methanol/acetonitrile/water (v/v/v, 43/43/14) was for analytical separation, water in both mobile phases contained 0.1% ammonium acetate. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for olanzapine was 0.085ng/ml. The method was linear from LLOQ to 34ng/ml with a coefficient of determination >0.998. Intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision were determined with variability less than 13.24% (R.S.D). This sensitive method was successfully applied to quantify the concentration of olanzapine in rat brain microdialysates.

The Mann–Kendall test was used for detecting monotonic trends over the whole investigation period or, if trend breaks occurred, over the period before and after the trend breaks. The relationships between phytoplankton community composition and the environmental variables were assessed by a redundancy analysis (RDA), which could support some results of the trend analyses. Water temperature increased but salinity and inorganic nitrogen concentrations decreased in the southern Baltic Proper. Spring phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll a concentrations increased in the Baltic Proper and decreased in Mecklenburg Bight. The biomass of Diatomophyceae decreased in spring at some stations but increased in autumn. If the Diatomophyceae spring blooms decreased, the total Dinophyceae biomass increased. Strong spring blooms of Diatomophyceae occurred in the 1980s and since 2000, but those of Dinophyceae in the 1990s. These two groups showed alternating oscillations. Trends in most phytoplankton components were different in the Baltic Proper and the Belt Sea area, confirming that Darss Sill is a biological border.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDinophyceae 3aautumn 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3acommunity structure 3aenvironmental factors 3anitrogen content 3aphytoplankton 3asalinity 3aspring 3asummer 3awater temperature 3aBaltic Sea1 aTuimala, Jarno1 aSuikkanen, Sanna1 aVandepitte, Leen1 aKraberg, Alexandra0 tJournal of marine systems.g2011 Aug., v. 87, no. 2 p.145-159dElsevier B.V.x0924-79637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2011.03.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01669naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092024002200121024001900143040001800162100002100180245013400201300001300335506007600348520020000424592002800624506003700652650002800689650001800717650001700735650001600752650001100768650003000779650002500809700001900834700001900853700002200872700001900894700002100913700001900934700001600953700001600969700001700985773012101002856007901123852000901202655001201211IND4500980520221207084407.0150421e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450098052DNAL7 a10.1128/JB.06670-112doi7 aPMC32948012pmcid7 a223287482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Ŭn-gyŏng,10aDraft Genome Sequence of Gluconobacter morbifer G707T, a Pathogenic Gut Bacterium Isolated from Drosophila melanogaster Intestine  ap. 1245.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGluconobacter morbifer G707T, a minor member of gut microbiota, was isolated from fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster).

They have been traditionally landfilled or incinerated as only limited recycling processes are being implemented in some parts of Europe. With the implementation of separated collection systems for the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes (OFMSWs) and the need to preserve the environment, compostable diapers have appeared in the market to avoid the main environmental impacts associated to non-biodegradable disposable diapers. In this study, a full-scale composting of door-to-door collected OFMSW with a 3% (w/w) of compostable diapers has also been carried out. Previously, lab-scale experiments confirmed that almost 50% of carbon of compostable diapers is emitted as CO2 under aerobic controlled conditions. The results obtained at full-scale demonstrate that both the composting process and the final end product (compost) are not altered by the presence of compostable diapers in crucial aspects such as pathogenic content, stability and elemental composition (including nutrients and heavy metals). The main conclusion of this study is that the collection of the OFMSW with compostable diapers can be a new way to transform this waste into high-quality compost.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acomposting 3acomposts 3aelemental composition 3aenvironmental impact 3aheavy metals 3amunicipal solid waste 3anutrients 3arecycling 3aEurope 0aComposting 0aCompostable diapers 0aBiodegradation 0aCompost quality 0aMunicipal waste1 aMestre-Montserrat, Maria1 aPuig-Ventosa, Ignasi1 aSánchez, Antoni0 tWaste management.g2013 May, v. 33 p.1097-1103dElsevier Ltdx0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.01.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001200189245006800201300001600269520158600285592002801871650002501899650001301924650001501937650001001952650001901962650001701981650001401998650001102012650001402023650002202037650001302059650001402072650001602086650001302102700001602115700002302131700001502154700002602169700002202195773011202217856008202329990002302411852000902434655001202443IND60110480520221117221751.0141109e20130615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011048052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.taap.2013.03.0212doi7 aPMC36777732pmcid7 a235669562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Bin10aProtein tyrosine adduct in humans self-poisoned by chlorpyrifos  ap. 215-225.  aStudies of human cases of self-inflicted poisoning suggest that chlorpyrifos oxon reacts not only with acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase but also with other blood proteins. A favored candidate is albumin because in vitro and animal studies have identified tyrosine 411 of albumin as a site covalently modified by organophosphorus poisons. Our goal was to test this proposal in humans by determining whether plasma from humans poisoned by chlorpyrifos has adducts on tyrosine. Plasma samples from 5 self-poisoned humans were drawn at various time intervals after ingestion of chlorpyrifos for a total of 34 samples. All 34 samples were analyzed for plasma levels of chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos oxon (CPO) as a function of time post-ingestion. Eleven samples were analyzed for the presence of diethoxyphosphorylated tyrosine by mass spectrometry. Six samples yielded diethoxyphosphorylated tyrosine in pronase digests. Blood collected as late as 5days after chlorpyrifos ingestion was positive for CPO-tyrosine, consistent with the 20-day half-life of albumin. High plasma CPO levels did not predict detectable levels of CPO-tyrosine. CPO-tyrosine was identified in pralidoxime treated patients as well as in patients not treated with pralidoxime, indicating that pralidoxime does not reverse CPO binding to tyrosine in humans. Plasma butyrylcholinesterase was a more sensitive biomarker of exposure than adducts on tyrosine. In conclusion, chlorpyrifos oxon makes a stable covalent adduct on the tyrosine residue of blood proteins in humans who ingested chlorpyrifos.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aalbumins 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3ablood proteins 3achlorpyrifos 3ahalf life 3ahumans 3aingestion 3amass spectrometry 3apatients 3apoisoning 3apralidoxime 3atyrosine1 aEyer, Peter1 aEddleston, Michael1 aJiang, Wei1 aSchopfer, Lawrence M.1 aLockridge, Oksana0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g2013 June 15, v. 269, no. 3 p.215-225dElsevier Inc.x0041-008X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2013.03.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003500147245013500182300001600317520103700333592002801370650002101398650001301419650001401432650002301446650002001469650003101489650001001520650001301530650002401543650001701567650002601584650001601610650004301626650002401669700001701693773012301710856008101833852000901914655001201923IND60104635320221120050716.0141107e20120925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010463532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2012.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlesson, Chellakkan Selvanesan10aExpression pattern and signalling pathways in neutrophil like HL-60 cells after treatment with estrogen receptor selective ligands  ap. 179-190.  aEstrogens play a role in the regulation of genes associated with inflammation and immunity in neutrophils. Estrogen signalling is mediated by estrogen receptor (ER)α, ERβ, and G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor-1 (GPER). The mechanisms by which estrogen regulate genes in neutrophils are poorly understood. Our aim was to identify the presence of ERs and to characterize estrogen responsive genes in terminally differentiated neutrophil like HL-60 (nHL-60) cells using estradiol and selective ER agonists. ERs were identified by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Microarray technique was used to screen for differentially expressed genes and the selected genes were verified by quantitative PCR. We show the presence of functional ERα, ERβ and GPER. Microarray analysis showed the presence of genes that are uniquely regulated by a single ligand and also genes that are regulated by multiple ligands. We conclude that ERs are functionally active in nHL-60 cells regulating genes involved in key physiological functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aagonists 3aestradiol 3aestrogen receptors 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aimmunity 3aimmunocytochemistry 3ainflammation 3amicroarray technology 3aneutrophils 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction1 aSahlin, Lena0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2012 Sept. 25, v. 361, no. 1-2 p.179-190dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2012.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03312naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100001800193245018500211300001400396506007600410520150200486592002801988506003702016650001102053650001002064650001202074650001002086650001802096650003602114650002102150650002002171650001102191650001002202650002502212650001602237650001002253650001802263650001102281650001202292650001302304650001102317650005202328650002402380650002002404700001902424700001902443700002002462700002402482700002202506700002002528773007902548856008602627852000902713655001202722IND60105459620221207130947.0141108e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010545962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2012.07.0282doi7 aPMC36529782pmcid7 a229481282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Pu-Qing10aExpression of corticotropin releasing factor receptor type 1 (CRF₁) in the human gastrointestinal tract and upregulation in the colonic mucosa in patients with ulcerative colitis  ap. 62-69.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBrain corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) acting on CRF receptor type 1 (CRF₁) is a main signaling pathway in the stress response. CRF is also produced in a variety of peripheral sites and acts locally as a proinflammatory mediator. We investigated CRF₁ mRNA expression in the human gastrointestinal tract, and localized CRF₁ immunoreactive cells in the colonic mucosa of healthy subjects and patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). In 4 male healthy subjects (24–29 years), CRF₁ transcript was detected by RT-PCR throughout the gastrointestinal tract with the highest levels in the ileum and rectum and the lowest level in the colon. Immunohistochemistry on whole thickness sigmoid colon sections showed that CRF₁ was localized in the lamina propria and epithelial cells and enteric neurons. In sigmoid colonic biopsies, immunohistochemically double-labeled cells with CRF₁ and CD163, a marker for macrophages, represent 79% of total CRF₁ immunoreactive (IR) cells in healthy subjects. In 10 UC patients, the total number of CRF₁ IR cells and CRF₁/CD163 double-labeled macrophages was increased by 4.2 and 4.0 folds respectively compared to healthy subjects. These findings indicate that CRF₁ is distributed throughout the GI tract of healthy human subjects. The increase of CRF₁ IR cells prominently in macrophages of the sigmoid colonic mucosa of UC patients provides anatomical support for a role of CRF₁ signaling in modulating the immune-inflammatory process of UC.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiopsy 3abrain 3acolitis 3acolon 3acorticotropin 3acorticotropin-releasing hormone 3aepithelial cells 3agene expression 3ahumans 3aileum 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amacrophages 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3amucosa 3aneurons 3apatients 3arectum 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3astress response1 aWu, S.

Oesophageal lining epithelium consisted of ciliated and goblet cells, with no pluricellular glands. Mannosylated sialosulfomucins were observed. Fundic mucosa of stomach presented surface cells producing sialomucins with terminal sialic acid linked to galactose. In gastric glands neck and oxynticopeptic cells were found. Neck cells had sialomucins with mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine and fucose-α-(1,2)-linked residues. Cytoplasm of oxynticopeptic cells showed N-acetylgalactosamine and fucose residues. Secretion of surface cells in pyloric mucosa was similar to that of fundic ones, differing in having fucose. Goblet cells in the small intestine of N. natrix produced sulfo- and sialomucins, with sialic acid linked to galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine residues. Mucins also presented residues of mannose.

METHODS: Fifty clinical isolates were collected during the period 2001–2004 and analyzed by multilocus sequence typing and capsular serotyping. RESULTS: The six major sequence types (STs) identified by multilocus sequence typing were ST1, ST12, ST19, ST17, ST23, and ST10. Five major clonal complexes (CCs) and one single ST (ST61) from 11 different STs were found. CC1 (n=14) was the most common one, followed by CC12 (n=13), CC19 (n=9), CC17 (n=7), and CC23 (n=6). The most common serotypes were serotype III, followed by Ib, V, Ia, and IV. The most invasive strains in adults belonged to ST1 (CC1) and serotype V, and those in neonates belonged to ST17 (CC17) and serotype III. In addition, ST19 was distributed in adults and neonates. CONCLUSIONS: These results are similar to those of previous reports, but some geographic differences were found, suggesting that limited clonal lineages play important roles in GBS-associated diseases worldwide. Continued tracking of GBS in the population through clinical isolates is important for epidemiologic investigations and vaccine development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3aadults 3aepidemiological studies 3ageographical variation 3amonitoring 3amultilocus sequence typing 3aneonates 3apathogens 3apregnant women 3aserotypes 3avaccine development 3aTaiwan1 aHo, Cheng-Mao1 aLin, Hui-Ju1 aShih, Mu-Chin1 aHo, Mao-Wang1 aLin, Hsiao-Chuan1 aLin, Hsiu-Shen1 aChang, Chao-Chin1 aLu, Jang-Jih0 tJournal of microbiology, immunology and infection.g2011 Dec., v. 44, no. 6 p.430-434dElsevier B.V.x1684-11827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2011.04.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01846naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013500169300001800304520067700322592002800999650001301027650002301040650002301063653002301086653001801109653002101127653001801148653002001166700002401186700002201210700002001232700001901252700002001271773008801291856008401379852000901463655001201472IND60110089920221119234535.0161019e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011008992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2013.02.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTasic, Gordana12aA highly regioselective, protecting group controlled, synthesis of bicyclic compounds via Pd-catalysed intramolecular cyclisations  ap. 2243-2246.  aIntramolecular Pd-catalysed cyclisation reactions for the preparation of bicyclic compounds have been studied as a model system towards the synthesis of corialstonine and corialstonidine.

Cyclisation via the intramolecular Heck reaction, for both derivatives, proved to be highly regioselective and while the O-protected compound favoured the exo mode of cyclisation, the unprotected alcohol preferred the endo cyclisation pathway.

SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) is an essential infrastructure for this evolution. This paper proposes a new conceptual design of an intelligent SCADA with a decentralized, flexible, and intelligent approach, adaptive to the context (context awareness). This SCADA model is used to support the energy resource management undertaken by a distribution network operator (DNO). Resource management considers all the involved costs, power flows, and electricity prices, allowing the use of network reconfiguration and load curtailment. Locational Marginal Prices (LMP) are evaluated and used in specific situations to apply Demand Response (DR) programs on a global or a local basis. The paper includes a case study using a 114 bus distribution network and load demand based on real data.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3ainfrastructure 3amodels 3aprices 3arenewable energy sources 3aresource management1 aMorais, Hugo1 aFaria, Pedro1 aRamos, Carlos0 tRenewable energy.g2013 Apr., v. 52 p.143-153dElsevier Ltdx0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2012.10.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01994naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014900163300001800312520066100330592002800991650001401019650001201033650001401045650002301059650002301082650001301105650001401118650002401132653002501156653005601181653002701237653002701264653002001291700001501311700001401326700001601340700001701356700001601373773008101389856008101470852000901551655001201560IND60109631120221118054221.0161018e20130701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010963112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2013.04.1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jing10aSynthesis of salen Mn(III) immobilized onto the ZnPS-PVPA modified by 1,2,3-triazole and their application for asymmetric epoxidation of olefins  ap. 5460-5467.  aA series of chiral salen Mn(III) complexes immobilized onto ZnPS-PVPA modified by 1,2,3-triazole through click chemistry were synthesized.

We examined whether Ni(II) elicits a toxicologically significant activation of the tumor suppressor p53, which is typically associated with genotoxic responses. We found that treatments of H460 human lung epithelial cells with NiCl₂ caused activating phosphorylation at p53-Ser15, accumulation of p53 protein and depletion of its inhibitor MDM4 (HDMX). Confirming the activation of p53, its knockdown suppressed the ability of Ni(II) to upregulate MDM2 and p21 (CDKN1A). Unlike DNA damage, induction of GADD45A by Ni(II) was p53-independent. Ni(II) also increased p53-Ser15 phosphorylation and p21 expression in normal human lung fibroblasts. Although Ni(II)-induced stabilization of HIF-1α occurred earlier, it had no effect on p53 accumulation and Ser15 phosphorylation. Ni(II)-treated H460 cells showed no evidence of necrosis and their apoptosis and clonogenic death were suppressed by p53 knockdown. The apoptotic role of p53 involved a transcription-dependent program triggering the initiator caspase 9 and its downstream executioner caspase 3. Two most prominently upregulated proapoptotic genes by Ni(II) were PUMA and NOXA but only PUMA induction required p53. Knockdown of p53 also led to derepression of antiapoptotic MCL1 in Ni(II)-treated cells. Overall, our results indicate that p53 plays a major role in apoptotic death of human lung cells by Ni(II). Chronic exposure to Ni(II) may promote selection of resistant cells with inactivated p53, providing an explanation for the origin of p53 mutations by this epigenetic carcinogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aapoptosis 3acarcinogens 3acaspase-3 3achronic exposure 3adeath 3aepigenetics 3aepithelial cells 3afibroblasts 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenotoxicity 3ahumans 3ahypoxia 3amechanism of action 3amutation 3anecrosis 3anickel 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein depletion1 aMorse, Jessica L.1 aZhitkovich, Anatoly0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g2013 June 15, v. 269, no. 3 p.233-239dElsevier Inc.x0041-008X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2013.03.0233Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02859naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010800166300001800274520141100292592002801703650001501731650001501746650001501761650001101776650001701787650001701804650001901821650002401840650002301864650001401887650001301901650001301914650002601927650000901953650001501962653002001977653001101997653001502008653001602023653001302039700001902052700001702071700001502088700001702103700001602120700001702136773008302153856008402236852000902320655001202329IND60111525320221119225342.0160903e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011152532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2013.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Lianghu10aCopper leaching of MSWI bottom ash co-disposed with refuse: Effect of short-term accelerated weathering  ap. 1411-1417.  aCo-disposal of refuse with municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI) bottom ash (IBA) either multi-layered as landfill cover or mixed with refuse could pose additional risk to the environment because of enhanced leaching of heavy metals, especially Cu.

The results showed that weathering had little or no beneficial effect on Cu leaching in SPLP and TCLP, which can be explained by the adsorption and complexation of Cu with DOM. However, the Cu leaching of weathered IBA was reduced significantly when situated in fresh simulated landfill leachate. This was attributed to weakening Cu complexation with fulvic acid or hydrophilic fractions and/or intensifying Cu absorption to neoformed hydr(oxide) minerals in weathered IBA. The amount of total leaching Cu and Cu in free or labile complex fraction (the fraction with the highest mobility and bio-toxicity) of the 408-h weathered IBA were remarkably decreased by 86.3% and 97.6% in the 15-day co-disposal leaching test. Accelerated weathering of IBA may be an effective pretreatment method to decrease Cu leaching prior to its co-disposal with refuse.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3abottom ash 3acopper 3afulvic acids 3aheavy metals 3ahydrophilicity 3aindole butyric acid 3alandfill leachates 3alandfills 3aleaching 3aminerals 3amunicipal solid waste 3arisk 3aweathering 0aMSWI bottom ash 0aCopper 0aWeathering 0aCo-disposal 0aLandfill1 aGuo, Guangzhai1 aShi, Xinlong1 aZuo, Minyu1 aNiu, Dongjie1 aZhao, Aihua1 aZhao, Youcai0 tWaste management.g2013 June, v. 33 p.1411-1417dElsevier Ltdx0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2013.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02881naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001500156245012900171300001800300520168800318592002802006650001402034650001902048650001902067650002202086650001602108700001202124700002202136700001802158700001502176700002002191700001602211700002002227700001802247773010802265856009002373990002302463852000902486655001202495IND60110985620221118022519.0141109e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011098562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2012.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yong10aUltrasound Findings of Papillary Thyroid Microcarcinoma: A Review of 113 Consecutive Cases with Histopathologic Correlation  ap. 1681-1688.  aPapillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) is a malignant thyroid tumor of less than 1 cm in size. Ultrasound (US) is the preferred imaging modality for PTMC. This study retrospectively evaluated the US results from 113 consecutive cases of PTMC with 127 nodules and correlated the results with the histopathologic findings. The results showed none of the PTMC nodules had a cystic element. Half of the PTMC nodules had a well-defined boundary and the remaining half had an ill-defined boundary. A percent (6.3%) of the nodules had a halo sign. Microcalcification was present in approximately half of the PTMC nodules. The cancerous tissue with a papillary structure was hypoechogenic and the amount of fibrous stroma determined whether the nodule echogenicity was heterogeneous or homogeneous. Heterogeneous echogenicity was associated with a fibrous stroma proportion of >20%. Only PTMC nodules with predominantly follicular structures containing a large proportion of colloid demonstrated isoechogenicity. Well-defined boundaries on US were associated with well-defined histologic margins, with or without the presence of an intact fibrous pseudo-capsule. A halo sign with a well-defined boundary detected by US was associated with the presence of an intact fibrous pseudo-capsule. Half of the PTMC nodules with ill-defined boundaries exhibited infiltration into the surrounding thyroid tissue, while the remaining half of the PTMC nodules with ill-defined boundaries on US presented irregular nodule margins by histology, rather than nodule infiltration. Psammoma bodies detected at a frequency ≥5 per ×200 microscopic field of view were detectable on US as microcalcifications.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3aimage analysis 3athyroid neoplasms 3aultrasonics1 aLi, Lin1 aWang, Yi-Xiang J.1 aFeng, Xiao-Li1 aZhao, Feng1 aZou, Shuang-Mei1 aHao, Yu-Zhi1 aYing, Jian-Ming1 aZhou, Chun-Wu0 tUltrasound in medicine & biology.g2012 Oct., v. 38, no. 10 p.1681-1688dElsevier Inc.x0301-56297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2012.05.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02196naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245007200166300001300238520114900251592002801400650001001428650000901438650001101447650001401458650002601472650004301498650001301541650001101554700002001565700001901585700001701604700001201621700001601633773007801649856008601727852000901813655001201822IND60105459820221120045703.0141108e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010545982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2012.08.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jun10aChange in plasma visfatin level after severe traumatic brain injury  ap. 8-12.  aHigher plasma visfatin concentration has been associated with ischemic stroke. Thus, we sought to investigate change in plasma visfatin level after traumatic brain injury and to evaluate its relation with disease outcome. Seventy-six healthy controls and 98 patients with acute severe traumatic brain injury were recruited. Twenty-seven patients (27.6%) died and 48 patients (49.0%) suffered from unfavorable outcome (Glasgow outcome scale score of 1–3) in 6 months. On admission, plasma visfatin level was increased in patients than in healthy controls and was highly correlated with Glasgow Coma Scale score. A multivariate analysis identified plasma visfatin level as an independent predictor for 6-month mortality and unfavorable outcome. According to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the predictive value of the plasma visfatin concentration was similar to Glasgow Coma Scale score's. In a combined logistic-regression model, visfatin did not improve the predictive value of Glasgow Coma Scale score. Thus, increased plasma visfatin level is associated with 6-month clinical outcomes after severe traumatic brain injury.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3acoma 3amodels 3amortality 3amultivariate analysis 3anicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase 3apatients 3astroke1 aWeng, Jian-Feng1 aHong, Wei-Cong1 aLuo, Li-Feng1 aYu, Wei1 aLuo, Shi-Da0 tPeptides.g2012 Nov., v. 38, no. 1 p.8-12dElsevier Inc.x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2012.08.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03280naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011800165300001800283500001500301520179700316592002802113650001502141650001202156650001802168650002102186650002002207650001702227650001402244650001902258650001702277650003802294650001502332650001402347650001102361650001302372650001902385650001202404653002102416700002002437700002002457700001902477700002102496700002302517773012002540856008202660990002302742852000902765655001202774IND60100182320221120164227.0141105e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010018232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaci.2011.10.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKapoor, Simi10aTolerance-like mediated suppression by mesenchymal stem cells in patients with dust mite allergy–induced asthma  ap. 1094-1101.  a2019-12-04  aBACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can suppress and enhance immune functions. MSCs show promise as off-the-shelf cellular therapy for several disorders, including inflammation. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of MSCs on the proliferation of PBMCs to allergic subjects (dust mite [DM]), allergic asthmatic subjects, or both. METHODS: Proliferation was studied by using tritiated thymidine uptake with or without MSCs. The refractoriness of PBMCs to DM was examined after preconditioning with MSCs and after repeated challenge with low-dose DM. Flow cytometry was used to study regulatory T cells and dendritic cells (DCs), and ELISA was used to study cytokine production. RESULTS: Seven subjects with allergic asthma met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. MSCs significantly (P < .05) reduced the proliferation of 6 subjects with allergic asthma but not those with allergy alone. The effect was specific to the allergen because MSCs did not affect challenges to tetanus toxoid. There was no change in CD4/CD25/forkhead box protein 3–positive cells, although there were decreased IFN-γ and increased IL-10 levels. Numbers of mature DCs were increased 6-fold. Refractoriness to DM was achieved by means of repeated exposure to low-dose DM and MSCs and also MSC- preconditioned MSC. CONCLUSION: MSCs suppressed the proliferation of DM-challenged PBMCs from allergic asthmatic subjects but not from allergic subjects without asthma. MSCs blunted the maturation of DCs but not regulatory T cells. Repeated exposure to low-dose DM and MSCs, as well as preconditioning of PBMCs with MSCs, caused refractoriness to DM. These findings have implications for the use of MSCs in attenuation of the inflammatory responses to allergic triggers in asthmatic patients with off-the-shelf MSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3adust mites 3atetanus 3aT-lymphocytes 3ainterferon-gamma 3adendritic cells 3ainflammation 3aallergens 3aflow cytometry 3atherapeutics 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3astem cells 3athymidine 3aasthma 3apatients 3ainterleukin-10 3atritium 0ahypersensitivity1 aPatel, Shyam A.1 aKartan, Saritha1 aAxelrod, David1 aCapitle, Eugenio1 aRameshwar, Pranela0 tThe Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.g2012 Apr., v. 129, no. 4 p.1094-1101dMosby, Inc.x0091-67497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2011.10.0483Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01957naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002100191245013500212300001800347506007600365520064000441592002801081506003701109650002101146650002301167650001201190650001601202650001301218650001001231650001401241650000901255700002501264700001901289700002201308700002701330773009701357856008401454852000901538655001201547IND60110018620221207100419.0141109e20121121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011001862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.09.0252doi7 aPMC34984632pmcid7 a231621722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernando, Rasika10aPreparation of bifunctional isocyanate hydroxamate linkers: synthesis of carbamate and urea tethered polyhydroxamic acid chelators  ap. 6367-6371.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTwo novel bifunctional N-methylhydroxamate–isocyanate linkers 20 and 21 were prepared in good yield and high purity from the corresponding amine salts using a biphasic reaction with phosgene.

However, little is known about the evolutionary history of tachykinin (TAC) and tachykinin receptor (TACR) genes in vertebrates, especially in the teleost group. In the present study, five TACs and six TACRs genes were identified in the zebrafish genome. Genomic synteny analysis and phylogenetic tree analysis indicate that the increased numbers of TAC and TACR genes in vertebrates are the result of both genome duplications and local individual gene duplication. The full-length cDNA sequences encoding multiple TAC3s (TAC3a and TAC3b) and TACR3s (TACR3a1, TACR3a2 and TACR3b) were subsequently cloned from zebrafish brain samples. Sequence analysis suggested that four putative neurokinin B (NKB)-like peptides (NKBa-13, NKBa-10, NKBb-13 and NKBb-11) might be generated by the processing of two zebrafish TAC3 precursors. Tissue distribution studies in zebrafish revealed that TAC3 and TACR3 are mainly expressed in the brain regions. The biological activities of four zebrafish NKB peptides and three TACR3s were further examined using transcription reporter assays in cultured eukaryotic cells. All the synthetic NKB peptides were able to evoke the downstream signaling events of TACR3s with the exception of NKBb-11. These results indicated that the multiple TAC/TACR genes identified in vertebrates evolved from gene duplication events and that the TAC3/TACR3 systems also operate in the teleost group.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3abrain 3acomplementary DNA 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene duplication 3agenes 3ainvertebrates 3amammals 3anucleotide sequences 3apeptides 3aphylogeny 3asequence analysis 3atissue distribution1 aLi, Shuisheng1 aLiu, Yun1 aQi, Xin1 aChen, Huapu1 aCheng, Christopher H.K.1 aLiu, Xiaochun1 aZhang, Yong1 aLim, Jonathan,0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2012 Sept. 25, v. 361, no. 1-2 p.202-212dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2012.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011000169300001600279520130600295592002801601650001801629650001301647650001501660650001301675650001101688650001801699650001201717650001901729650001601748651001701764651001301781700001801794700001601812700001701828700001501845700001601860773010101876856008501977990002302062852000902085655001202094IND60101790620221120050325.0141106e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010179062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmarsys.2011.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSemprucci, F.10aMeiofauna in sandy back-reef platforms differently exposed to the monsoons in the Maldives (Indian Ocean)  ap. 208-215.  aMaldives comprise some of the most characteristic and significant atoll systems, but the meiobenthic assemblages of these islands are still largely unknown. A study on meiofauna was conducted on three Maldivian sandy back-reef platforms differently exposed to stronger westerly monsoons. Clear high energy effects of the waves causing currents and erosions were observed at the completely exposed and isolated offshore reef of Thoddoo Island. Wave energy of medium intensity was confirmed at Rasdhoo by depositional structures (finolhu), while a medium to low energy level was recorded at Gulhi on the basis of the presence of a low sandy bar. The meiofaunal assemblage counted 17 major taxa. Copepods and nematodes were dominant, followed by platyhelminthes and polychaetes. The nematode assemblage was rather rich and composed of 28 families and 84 genera. Desmodoridae were the most abundant family, followed by Draconematidae, Xyalidae, Epsilonematidae and Chromadoridae. The meiofauna resulted strongly affected by erosion effects, both in terms of abundance and richness, but we were not able to distinguish the two different sedimentation rates. Instead, the structure of the nematode community seemed to be more sensitive in distinguishing each type of hydrodynamic condition and energy level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChromadoridae 3aCopepoda 3aPolychaeta 3aXyalidae 3aenergy 3ahydrodynamics 3aislands 3amonsoon season 3awater power 3aIndian Ocean 3aMaldives1 aColantoni, P.1 aSbrocca, C.1 aBaldelli, G.1 aRocchi, M.1 aBalsamo, M.0 tJournal of marine systems.g2011 Sept., v. 87, no. 3-4 p.208-215dElsevier B.V.x0924-79637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2011.04.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012700166300001800293520152700311592002801838650001701866650001801883650002201901650002001923650001001943650001701953650001601970650001101986650001001997650001502007650002002022650002102042650001902063650002002082700002202102700001902124700001602143700002202159773009302181856008102274990002302355852000902378655001202387IND60110569820221116142833.0141109e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011056982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tiv.2013.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJetten, M.J.A.10aBaseline and genotoxic compound induced gene expression profiles in HepG2 and HepaRG compared to primary human hepatocytes  ap. 2031-2040.  aEfforts are put into developing toxicogenomics-based toxicity testing methods using in vitro human cell models for improving human risk assessment/replacing animal models. Human in vitro liver models include HepG2, HepaRG and primary human hepatocytes (PHH). Studies on comparability/applicability of these cell types mainly focus on assessing baseline biotransformation capacities/cytochrome P450-inducibility, but compound-induced gene expression profiles are at least as important. Therefore, we compared baseline and aflatoxin B1- and benzo(α)pyrene-induced gene expression profiles in HepG2, HepaRG and PHH (11-13 donors). At baseline, all liver models differ from each other with respect to whole genome gene expression levels. PHH show profound inter-individual differences, and are most similar to HepaRG. After compound exposure, induced gene expression profiles are more similar between cell models, especially for benzo(α)pyrene. Pathways involved in compound metabolism are induced in all 3 models, while others are more pronounced in a specific cell model. Examples are transcriptomic modifications of carbohydrate-related genes (HepaRG) and of receptor-related genes (PHH) after benzo(α)pyrene exposure, and of cell cycle-related genes (HepG2) after aflatoxin B1 exposure. PHH gene expression responses are the most heterogeneous. In conclusion, at base line level PHH are more similar to HepaRG than to HepG2, but for toxicogenomics applications both cell lines perform equally well in comparison to PHH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaflatoxin B1 3aanimal models 3abiotransformation 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenotoxicity 3ahepatocytes 3ahumans 3aliver 3ametabolism 3arisk assessment 3atoxicity testing 3atoxicogenomics 3atranscriptomics1 aKleinjans, J.C.S.1 aClaessen, S.M.1 aChesné, C.1 avan Delft, J.H.M.0 tToxicology in vitro.g2013 Oct., v. 27, no. 7 p.2031-2040dElsevier Ltdx0887-23337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tiv.2013.07.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245015500167300001600322520158500338592002801923650002301951650004601974650001602020650002102036650001102057650001502068650002602083650001502109650002102124650001802145650002702163650002902190650001002219700001202229700001402241773010502255856008502360852000902445655001202454IND60100344220221122074321.0141105e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010034422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.02.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Sheng10aDetermination of higenamine in human plasma and urine using liquid chromatography coupled to positive electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 763-768.  aHigenamine is an active ingredient of Aconite root in Chinese herbal medicine and might be used as a new agent for a pharmaceutical stress test and was approved to undergo clinical pharmacokinetic study. Therefore, there exists a need to establish a sensitive and rapid method for the determination of higenamine in human plasma and urine. This paper described a sensitive and rapid method based on liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) for the determination of higenamine in human plasma and urine. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) was used to isolate the compounds from biological matrices followed by injection of the extracts onto an Atlantis dC18 column with isocratic elution. The mobile phase was 0.05% formic acid in water–methanol (40:60, v/v). The mass spectrometry was carried out using positive electrospray ionization (ESI) and data acquisition was carried out in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The method was fully validated over the concentration range of 0.100–50.0ng/mL and 1.00–500ng/mL in plasma and urine, respectively. The lower limits of quantification (LLOQs) were 0.100 and 1.00ng/mL in plasma and urine, respectively. Inter- and intra-batch precision was less than 15% and the accuracy was within 85–115% for both plasma and urine. Extraction recovery was 82.1% and 56.6% in plasma and urine, respectively. Selectivity, matrix effects and stability were also validated in human plasma and urine. The method was applied to the pharmacokinetic study of higenamine hydrochloride in Chinese healthy subjects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aformic acid 3aherbal medicines 3ahumans 3aionization 3aliquid chromatography 3amonitoring 3apharmacokinetics 3arapid methods 3asolid phase extraction 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aurine1 aHu, Pei1 aJiang, Ji0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 879, no. 11-12 p.763-768dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.02.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01301naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003500150245008700185300001800272520036300290592002800653650002300681650002300704650001700727650002200744700002500766700003100791773009600822856008400918852000901002655001201011IND60109935020221117072142.0141109e20120530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010993502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.03.0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-Martínez, Joaquín C.10aStudy of the aggregation behavior of a π-conjugated dendrimer with a twisted core  ap. 2752-2755.  aA dendrimer having phenylene vinylene and phenylene ethynylene moieties, a twisted core, and eighteen chiral centers on the periphery has been prepared in high yield by using Sonogashira and Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reactions.

After using diverse types of cell therapy, at present there is a growing experimental evidence that transplantation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) can be useful to reverse the sequels of trauma affecting the brain and spinal cord. Although we still do not know many details about how these cells achieve their beneficial effects, the application of BMSC in humans, for brain or spinal cord repair, is beginning. An exquisite caution and strict methodological controls are needed to determine with certainty whether we can open a door of hope for many patients who currently suffer severe neurological deficits that are now supposedly irreversible.  aPublisher supplied data 3abone marrow 3abone marrow transplant 3abrain 3ahumans 3apatients 3aspinal cord 3astromal cells1 aZurita, Mercedes0 tProgress in neurobiology.g2011 Mar., v. 93, no. 3 p.341-349dElsevier Ltdx0301-00827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pneurobio.2010.12.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02262naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245008700161300001800248520122500266592002801491650002201519650001501541650002301556650002301579650001001602650001701612650001301629650001401642700001401656700001601670700001701686700001801703773008901721856008101810852000901891655001201900IND60109473320221122231808.0141109e20120311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010947332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2012.01.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Gang10aPhotochromism of new unsymmetrical isomeric diarylethenes bearing a pyridine group  ap. 2267-2275.  aA new class of unsymmetrical isomeric diarylethenes bearing a terminal pyridine group was synthesized and their structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The effects of the nitrogen atom position in the pyridine group on their properties including photochromism, acidchromism, and fluorescence were investigated systematically. Among the three isomeric derivatives, the cyclization quantum yield and the absorption maxima of the ortho-substituted diarylethene were the biggest, while the fluorescence quantum yield of the para-substituted diarylethene was the biggest. Furthermore, the three isomeric diarylethenes exhibited multi-addressable switching behaviors by the stimulation of acid/base and light. Addition of trifluoroacetic acid to solutions of these diarylethenes produced the protonated derivatives, which also showed excellent photochromic behaviors, but only the para-substituted diarylethene exhibited a notable color change of solution from crimson to violet. The results revealed that the effects of the nitrogen atom position in the terminal pyridine group played a very important role during the process of photoisomerization for these isomeric diarylethene derivatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3acolor 3afluorescence 3anitrogen 3apyridines1 aLiu, Ming1 aPu, Shouzhi1 aFan, Congbin1 aCui, Shiqiang0 tTetrahedron.g2012 Mar. 11, v. 68, no. 10 p.2267-2275dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2012.01.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01767naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245009300162300001400255520066000269592002800929650001800957650002700975650002101002650000901023650001301032650001801045650001101063650001301074650001001087700001601097700001601113700001801129700001401147700001501161773011401176856008201290852000901372655001201381IND60100803620221120042139.0141105e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010080362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2011.11.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, R.K.10aDeposition of continuous platinum shells on gold nanoparticles by chemical precipitation  ap. 91-95.  aContinuous platinum shells consisting of ∼5 atomic layers were deposited onto preformed gold seeds in aqueous medium by reducing hexachloroplatinic acid with ascorbic acid.

The proposed approach includes four main steps: (i) the initial screening of column chemistry, mobile phase pH and organic modifier, (ii) the selectivity optimization through changes in gradient time and mobile phase temperature, (iii) the adaptation of column geometry to reach sufficient resolution, and (iv) the robust resolution optimization and identification of the method design space. This procedure was employed to obtain a complex chromatographic separation of 15 antipsychotic basic drugs, widely prescribed. To fully automate and expedite the QbD method development procedure, short columns packed with sub-2μm particles were employed, together with a UHPLC system possessing columns and solvents selection valves. Through this example, the possibilities of the proposed QbD method development workflow were exposed and the different steps of the automated strategy were critically discussed. A baseline separation of the mixture of antipsychotic drugs was achieved with an analysis time of less than 15min and the robustness of the method was demonstrated simultaneously with the method development phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aantipsychotics 3aexperimental design 3alinear models 3apH 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3ascreening 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aGuillarme, Davy1 aRudaz, Serge0 tJournal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis.g2013 Oct., v. 84 p.215-223dElsevier B.V.x0731-70857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2013.06.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011100167300001600278520139200294592002801686650002301714650002301737650001301760650001901773650001801792650000901810650002301819650001801842650003701860650001901897700001801916700001901934700002001953773008701973856008202060990002302142852000902165655001202174IND60110335220221122064912.0141109e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011033522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tice.2012.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jung Sick10aMicroanatomy and ultrastructure of the foot of the infaunal bivalve Tegillarca granosa (Bivalvia: Arcidae)  ap. 316-324.  aIn this study, the morphology and ultrastructure of the foot of Tegillarca granosa was compared with the bivalves from different habitats. The sediment of habitat of T. granosa is mostly a mixture of sand (68.93%) and mud (24.12%). The foot is wedge-shaped with multiple projections on the surface and covered with ciliary tufts. The epithelial layer is simple and composed of ciliated columnar epithelia and mucous cells. Although the mucous cells are distributed mostly in the epithelial layer, they are developed even in the connective tissues and muscle layers, and the mucous cells mostly contain acidic carboxylated mucosubstances. From the TEM observation, secretory cells are classified into three types. Type A secretory cell has a goblet form and is most widely distributed among the three types. Type B secretory cell has an oval form and the secretory granule has fibrous substance. Type C secretory cell has an elongated elliptic form and membrane-bounded secretory granules. The muscle fiber bundles are composed mainly of smooth muscle fibers. The smooth muscle fibers can be divided into two types. Type A muscle fibers have evenly distributed thick microfilaments between the thin microfilaments of cytoplasm. Type B muscle fiber has cluster of condensed microfilaments in the medulla cytoplasm while the cortical cytoplasm has loose distribution of thin microfilaments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTegillarca granosa 3aconnective tissues 3ahabitats 3amicrofilaments 3amuscle fibers 3asand 3asecretory granules 3asmooth muscle 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrastructure1 aLee, Yeon Gyu1 aPark, Jung Jun1 aShin, Yun Kyung0 tTissue and cell.g2012 Oct., v. 44, no. 5 p.316-324dElsevier Ltdx0040-81667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tice.2012.04.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245012200181300001600303520119700319592002801516650001901544650001601563650001101579650001301590650001501603650002401618650000701642650002101649650002701670650002901697650001501726700002001741700002101761700002501782773010501807856008501912852000901997655001202006IND60100344320221121010423.0141105e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010034432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.02.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChalla, Balasekhara Reddy10aLC–ESI-MS/MS method for the quantification of entecavir in human plasma and its application to bioequivalence study  ap. 769-776.  aLiquid chromatography–electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–ESI-MS/MS) was used for a quantitative estimation of entecavir (EV) in human plasma using lamivudine (LM) as internal standard (IS). The method herein described is simple, sensitive, and specific. Chromatographic separation was performed on XBridge-C18, 4.6mm×50mm, 5-μm column with an isocratic mobile phase composed of 10mM ammonium hydrogen carbonate (pH 10.5):methanol (85:15 v/v), pumped at 0.3ml/min. EV and LM were detected using proton adducts at m/z 278.1→152.1 and 230.2→112.0 in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) positive mode. Solid phase extraction method was employed in the extraction of EV and LM from the biological matrix. This method was validated over a linear concentration range of 50.0–20000.0pg/ml with a correlation coefficient (r) ≥0.9983. Intra and inter-day precision of EV was found within the range of 1.2–4.2 for EV and 4.4–4.5 for LM. EV was stable throughout three freeze/thaw cycles, bench top and postoperative studies. This method was successfully used in the analysis of plasma samples following oral administration of EV (0.5mg) in 26 healthy human volunteers.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatography 3acorrelation 3ahumans 3ahydrogen 3amonitoring 3aoral administration 3apH 3apharmacokinetics 3asolid phase extraction 3atandem mass spectrometry 3avolunteers1 aAwen, Bahlul Z.1 aChandu, Babu Rao1 aRihanaparveen, Shaik0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 879, no. 11-12 p.769-776dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.02.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245024300170300001400413520121200427592002801639650001401667650002301681650004901704650004601753650001601799650001301815650001101828650001301839650001401852650001101866650001401877700001301891773011201904856008502016990002302101852000902124655001202133IND60102276020221118091622.0141106e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010227602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcata.2013.03.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Hongchang10aAmine-catalyzed olefin epoxidation mechanism with enantioselectivity: Oxidation by secondary amine N,N-dioxo-radical derived from electron spin resonance, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry and density functional theory calculation  ap. 73-84.  aBy DFT calculation we found that secondary amine nitroxide radical is easily oxidized into N,N-dioxo-radical. The radical peroxide is the direct oxidant of the amine-catalyzed epoxidation. The calculation gives the transitional structures and activation barriers of ethylene epoxidation carried out by the two oxygen atoms of pyrrolidine N,N-dioxo-radical. The barriers are 11.9 and 9.6kcal/mol, respectively, indicating that the N,N-dioxo-radical has a strong epoxidation activity. If the secondary amine catalyst is chiral, the oxidant structure can lead to the enantioselectivity of the epoxidation. It is often easy for the amine-catalyzed epoxidation to produce a large amount of diol. This is because the N,N-dioxo-radical is easily protonated by HCO₃ ⁻ and the protonated radical peroxide oxidizes olefin into diol. Pyridine can suppress the formation of diols because it can suppress the protonation of N,N-dioxo-radical. ESI-MS detection confirmed that the N,N-dioxo-radical and its protonated product are present in Aggarwal epoxidation system. Based on these results, an amine-catalyzed olefin epoxidation mechanism with enantioselectivity and a possible path of diol formation were proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aenantiomers 3aethylene 3aolefin 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apyridines1 aLi, Yong0 tJournal of Molecular Catalysis.

Plasma metabolites along the interrelated transmethylation pathway were also altered indicating impaired methylation capacity. Here we extend these findings to further characterize the impact of TCE exposure in mice exposed to water only or two doses of TCE in the drinking water (0, 2, and 28mg/kg/day) postnatally from birth until 6weeks of age on redox homeostasis and biomarkers of oxidative stress in the cerebellum. In addition, pathway intermediates involved in methyl metabolism and global DNA methylation patterns were examined in cerebellar tissue. Because the cerebellum is functionally important for coordinating motor activity, including exploratory and social approach behaviors, these parameters were evaluated in the present study. Mice exposed to 28mg/kg/day TCE exhibited increased locomotor activity over time as compared with control mice. In the novel object exploration test, these mice were more likely to enter the zone with the novel object as compared to control mice. Similar results were obtained in a second test when an unfamiliar mouse was introduced into the testing arena. The results show for the first time that postnatal exposure to TCE causes key metabolic changes in the cerebellum that may contribute to global DNA methylation deficits and behavioral alterations in TCE-exposed mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3abiomarkers 3acerebellum 3adrinking water 3aenvironmental exposure 3aglutathione 3ahomeostasis 3alocomotion 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amice 3aoxidative stress 3atrichloroethylene1 aCooney, Craig A.1 aMelnyk, Stepan B.1 aRau, Jenny L.1 aSwearingen, Christopher J.1 aWessinger, William D.0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g2013 June 15, v. 269, no. 3 p.263-269dElsevier Inc.x0041-008X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2013.03.0253Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010100167300001600268520102700284592002801311650004401339650001601383650002201399650003701421650002201458650001601480650000901496650001101505650000701516650003301523650002201556700001401578700001401592700001601606700001801622773010901640856008201749852000901831655001201840IND60100884620221122070202.0141105e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010088462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2012.10.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Changlun10aEu(III) uptake on rectorite in the presence of humic acid: A macroscopic and spectroscopic study  ap. 249-256.  aThis work contributed to the comprehension of humic acid (HA) effect on Eu(III) uptake to Na-rectorite by batch sorption experiments, model fitting, scanning electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. At low pH, the presence of HA enhanced Eu(III) sorption on Na-rectorite, while reduced Eu(III) sorption at high pH. The experimental data of Eu(III) sorption in the absence and presence of HA were simulated by the diffuse-layer model well with the aid of FITEQL 3.2 software. The basal spacing of rectorite became large after Eu(III) and HA sorption on Na-rectorite. Some of Eu(III) ions and HA might be intercalated into the interlayer space of Na-rectorite. EXAFS analysis showed that the REᵤO (the bond distance of Eu and O in the first shell of Eu) and N values (coordination number) of Eu(III)–HA-rectorite system were smaller than those of Eu(III)-rectorite system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acomputer software 3ahumic acids 3aions 3amodels 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspectral analysis1 aYang, Xin1 aWei, Juan1 aTan, Xiaoli1 aWang, Xiangke0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 393 p.249-256dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2012.10.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02158naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245008800170300001500258520118700273592002801460650001101488650001601499650002401515650001301539650001201552650001101564700001801575700002301593773010201616856008201718990002301800852000901823655001201832IND60108058020221119174416.0141108e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010805802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rser.2013.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCandelise, Chiara14aThe dynamics of solar PV costs and prices as a challenge for technology forecasting  ap. 96-107.  aAn effective energy technology strategy has to balance between setting a stable long term framework for innovation, while also responding to more immediate changes in technology cost and performance. Over the last decade, rather than a steady progression along an established learning curve, PV costs and prices have been volatile, with increases or plateaus followed by rapid reductions. The paper describes, and considers the causes of, recent changes in PV costs and prices at module and system level, both international trends and more place-specific contexts. It finds that both module and system costs and price trends have reflected multiple overlapping forces. Established forecasting methods – experience curves and engineering assessments – have limited ability to capture key learning effects behind recent PV cost and price trends: production scale effects, industrial re-organization and shakeouts, international trade practices and national market dynamics. These forces are likely to remain prominent aspect of technology learning effects in the foreseeable future – and so are in need of improved, more explicit representation in energy technology forecasting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aengineering 3ainternational trade 3alearning 3amarkets 3aprices1 aWinskel, Mark1 aGross, Robert J.K.0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2013 Oct., v. 26 p.96-107dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2013.05.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245008000171300001400251520129500265592002801560650001401588650001501602650001701617650001001634650002501644650001301669650002401682650001801706650001701724650002401741650001501765773012001780856008101900852000901981655001201990IND60104634420221122053036.0141107e20120905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010463442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2011.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchleutker, Johanna10aPolymorphisms in androgen signaling pathway predisposing to prostate cancer  ap. 25-37.  aProstate cancer is the most frequent male malignancy diagnosed in western countries and androgens are known to mediate key physiological processes in prostate tissue. Since endogenous androgens have long been considered to be risk factors for prostate cancer, genes involved in androgen biosynthesis and metabolism have been extensively studied. In this review, association of androgen pathway genes, their polymorphic sites and risk of prostate cancer in different ethnic backgrounds is addressed together with their use to predict susceptibility and clinical outcomes of prostate cancer patients. The effect of the polymorphisms seems vary in different patients, populations and ethnic backgrounds. To date it is evident that the association between androgen pathway gene polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk is complex and many of the results are characterized by irreproducibility, which can be attributed to a variety of biological, statistical and technical reasons. In the future, with increasing knowledge, developing technologies and new genomic biomarkers it likely becomes possible to better estimate the risk of prostate cancer, and distinguish indolent disease from aggressive based on molecular profiling, and the analysis of gene–gene and gene–environment interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aandrogens 3abiomarkers 3abiosynthesis 3agenes 3agenetic polymorphism 3apatients 3aprostatic neoplasms 3arisk estimate 3arisk factors 3asignal transduction 3atechnology0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2012 Sept. 5, v. 360, no. 1-2 p.25-37dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2011.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02235naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245007700167300001600244520087600260592002801136650002101164650001801185650002201203650001701225650002601242650001301268650003701281650001301318650001601331650001301347650002001360653002101380653001501401653001501416653002301431653002901454653002601483653001201509653005101521700001901572773009501591856008201686852000901768655001201777IND60110725020221120060529.0161023e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011072502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibs.2013.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHulpke, Sabine14aThe MHC I loading complex: a multitasking machinery in adaptive immunity  ap. 412-420.  aRecognition and elimination of virally or malignantly transformed cells are pivotal tasks of the adaptive immune system. For efficient immune detection, snapshots of the cellular proteome are presented as epitopes on major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules for recognition by cytotoxic T cells. Knowledge about the track from the equivocal protein to the presentation of antigenic peptides has greatly expanded, leading to an astonishingly elaborate understanding of the MHC I peptide loading pathway. Here, we summarize the current view on this complex process, which involves ABC transporters, proteases, chaperones, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control. The contribution of individual proteins and subcomplexes is discussed, with a focus on the architecture and dynamics of the key player in the pathway, the peptide-loading complex (PLC).  aPublisher supplied data 3aABC transporters 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadaptive immunity 3acytotoxicity 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aepitopes 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3apeptides 3aproteinases 3aproteome 3aquality control 0aABC transporters 0aproteasome 0achaperones 0aER quality control 0amacromolecular complexes 0aMHC class I molecules 0atapasin 0atransporter associated with antigen processing1 aTampé, Robert0 tTrends in biochemical sciences.g2013 Aug., v. 38 p.412-420dElsevier Ltdx0968-00047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibs.2013.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01344naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011200162300001800274520030000292592002800592650002300620650002300643650002200666700001700688700001300705700001300718700001300731700001800744700001400762700002100776700001800797773008900815856008100904852000900985655001200994IND60109472020221122214756.0141109e20120311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010947202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2012.01.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNa, Risong10aThermal [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of azomethine imines with allenoates for dinitrogen-fused heterocycles  ap. 2349-2356.  aThe thermal [3+2] cycloaddition reactions of two classes of azomethine imines with allenoates have been investigated.

Furthermore, recent studies have reported G protein-independent/β-arrestin-dependent signaling pathway for some GPCRs. Dopamine D₂ and D₃ receptors (D₂R, D₃R), the major targets of currently used antipsychotic drugs, are co-expressed in some of the same dopaminergic neurons and regulate the same overlapping effectors. However, the specific subunits of G proteins that regulate each signaling pathway are not clearly identified. In addition, the existence of β-arrestin-dependent/G protein-independent signaling is not clear for these receptors. In this study, we determined the G protein subtypes and β-arrestin dependency involved in the signaling of D₂R and D₃R, which was measured by inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. For the inhibition of cAMP production in HEK-293 cells, D₂R used the Gαo subunit but D₃R used the βγ subunit of Gi family proteins. For the regulation of ERK activation, D₂R used the α subunits of Gi/o proteins both in HEK-293 cells and COS-7 cells, but D₃R used Gαo and Gβγ in HEK-293 cells and COS-7 cells, respectively. β-Arrestin-dependent/G protein-independent ERK activation was not observed for both D₂R and D₃R. Agonist-induced β-arrestin translocation was observed with D₂R but not with D₃R, and β-arrestins exerted inhibitory influences on G protein-dependent ERK activation by D₂R, but not D₃R. These results show that the D₂R and D₃R, which have overlapping cellular expressions and functional roles, employ distinct G protein subunits depending on the cell types and the effectors they control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenylate cyclase 3aantipsychotics 3adopamine 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aneurons 3aprotein subunits 3areceptors 3asignal transduction1 aMin, Chengchun1 aZheng, Mei1 aCho, Dong-Im1 aCheong, Soo-Jin1 aKurose, Hitosh1 aKim, Kyeong-Man0 tPharmacological research.g2013 Jan., v. 67, no. 1 p.31-41dElsevier Ltdx1043-66187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2012.09.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009200166300001600258520157800274592002801852650001501880650001601895650001501911650002101926650001801947650001901965650000901984650001101993650001402004650001202018650001502030700002102045700001802066700001702084700001502101700002102116700001802137700002202155700002202177773010902199856008202308852000902390655001202399IND60100884720221122070144.0141105e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010088472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2012.10.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgiso, Masayo10aImmobilization of carbohydrate clusters on a quartz crystal microbalance sensor surface  ap. 257-263.  aThe immobilization of carbohydrates on gold surfaces is a prerequisite technology for carbohydrate-related studies, including those of carbohydrate–biomolecule interactions. Glycolipid domains in cell membranes, such as lipid rafts, are thought to play an important role in cell biology through their carbohydrate portions. To understand the recognition of glycolipid domains such as receptors for bacterial toxins and viruses, we immobilized clusters of carbohydrates on a gold surface by using polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers as a scaffold. The PAMAM dendrimers were adsorbed on the gold-coated surface of a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor and were observed by means of QCM with dissipation (QCM-D). After adsorption of the PAMAM dendrimers, lysoganglioside-GM₁ and 12-aminododecyl-N-acetylglucosaminide (GlcNAc–C12–NH₂) were immobilized on the amino groups of PAMAM dendrimers by means of an NH₂ cross-linker. Immobilization of the carbohydrates was confirmed by observation of their specific interaction with anti-ganglioside GM₁ antibody or wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). Surfaces with different GlcNAc–C12–NH₂ cluster sizes and densities were prepared by varying the size of the PAMAM dendrimers or the concentration of GlcNAc–C12–NH₂ immobilized on the dendrimers, respectively. Analysis of the binding between the GlcNAc–C12–NH₂-immobilized surface and WGA revealed that the size of the PAMAM dendrimers influenced the GlcNAc–C12–NH₂–WGA interaction, with larger dendrimers resulting in higher WGA binding constants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aagglutinins 3aantibodies 3abacterial toxins 3acarbohydrates 3acell membranes 3agold 3aquartz 3areceptors 3aviruses 3awheat germ1 aMatsuoka, Kōji,1 aOkada, Tomoko1 aImai, Tomoko1 aItoh, Miki1 aImamura, Takeshi1 aHaga, Yoshimi1 aHatanaka, Kenichi1 aMinoura, Norihiko0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 393 p.257-263dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2012.10.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02041naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024002200135024001900157040001800176100002400194245010000218300001400318520089300332592002801225650001001253650001401263650001301277650001801290650001901308650001801327650001301345650001801358700002101376700002201397700002301419773009401442856008701536990002301623852000901646655001201655IND60107561920221119201121.0141108e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010756192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pneurobio.2010.09.0042doi7 aPMC36222812pmcid7 a209506682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakahashi, Nagahide10aLinking oligodendrocyte and myelin dysfunction to neurocircuitry abnormalities in schizophrenia  ap. 13-24.  aMultiple lines of evidence in schizophrenia, from brain imaging, studies in postmortem brains, and genetic association studies, have implicated oligodendrocyte and myelin dysfunction in this disease. Recent studies suggest that oligodendrocyte and myelin dysfunction leads to changes in synaptic formation and function, which could lead to cognitive dysfunction, a core symptom of schizophrenia. Furthermore, there is accumulating data linking oligodendrocyte and myelin dysfunction with dopamine and glutamate abnormalities, both of which are found in schizophrenia. These findings implicate oligodendrocyte and myelin dysfunction as a primary change in schizophrenia, not only as secondary consequences of the illness or treatment. Strategies targeting oligodendrocyte and myelin abnormalities could therefore provide therapeutic opportunities for patients suffering from schizophrenia.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3acognition 3adopamine 3aglutamic acid 3aimage analysis 3amyelin sheath 3apatients 3aschizophrenia1 aSakurai, Takeshi1 aDavis, Kenneth L.1 aBuxbaum, Joseph D.0 tProgress in neurobiology.g2011 Jan., v. 93, no. 1 p.13-24dElsevier Ltdx0301-00827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pneurobio.2010.09.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01404naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007000169300001600239520048900255592002800744650002600772650001600798650002100814650001000835650001000845650001700855650001400872700002000886773009400906856008101000852000901081655001201090IND60110805120221120035724.0141109e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011080512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tim.2012.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWright, Gerard D.10aAntibiotic resistance is ancient: implications for drug discovery  ap. 157-159.  aAn unfailing observation over the past 70 years is that resistance to all antibiotics emerges eventually after use in the clinic.

We found that these residues perform vital antioxidant functions inside lipid bilayers and protect cells from oxidative destruction. First, tyrosineâ and tryptophanâcontaining peptides representing stretches from the transmembrane domains of different integral membrane proteins, including presenilin and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, prevent oxidative lysis in clonal and primary cells. Second, longâchain acylated tyrosine and tryptophan, but not phenylalanine or shortâchain acylated derivatives, are potent inhibitors of lipid peroxidation and oxidative cell death.

Best reductions on total heat evolved (THE) and on cumulative CO₂ with no increase in CO emissions are observed when dodecaphenyl POSS is used. This may be related to its thermal degradation pathway, releasing via this process volatile organic species contributing on intumescence and producing an effective protective layer having a foliated structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical structure 3acombustion 3aemissions 3aethylene 3afire behavior 3aflame retardants 3aheat 3ainsulating materials 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3asynergists 3athermal degradation 3azinc1 aGiraud, Stéphane1 aDevaux, Eric1 aLemort, Guillaume0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2012 Mar., v. 97, no. 3 p.383-391dElsevier Ltdx0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2011.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03375naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245015000163300001600313500001500329520180900344592002802153650003402181650002002215650001302235650001702248650002802265650001102293650001702304650001002321650001402331650001902345650002102364650002402385650002102409650001702430650001502447650001502462650001402477650003002491653001702521700001902538700001402557700001602571700001702587700001702604700001402621700001502635773009302650856008102743852000902824655001202833IND60103540520221119180514.0141106e20120627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010354052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2012.04.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yanchun10aInactivation of PI3K/Akt signaling mediates proliferation inhibition and G2/M phase arrest induced by andrographolide in human glioblastoma cells  ap. 962-967.  a2019-12-04  aAIMS: Andrographolide, a principal diterpenoid lactone isolated from the traditional herbal medicine Andrographis paniculata, has been reported to show anti-tumor activity. Since the high lipid solubility of andrographolide permits it to penetrate the blood–brain barrier and concentrate in the brain, we hypothesized that andrographolide may be a potential chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of glioblastomas. To clarify this point, we investigated the growth inhibitory effect and mechanisms of actions of andrographolide on human glioblastoma U251 and U87 cells. MAIN METHODS: MTT assay and trypan blue exclusion assay were used to investigate the proliferation inhibitory and cytotoxic effects of andrographolide, respectively. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed using flow cytometry. Apoptosis analysis proceeded by detecting the cleavage of caspase-3. The levels of proteins were probed by Western blotting. KEY FINDINGS: The results showed that non-toxic concentrations of andrographolide inhibited the proliferation of human glioblastoma cells through induction of G2/M arrest, which was accompanied by down-regulating Cdk1 and Cdc25C proteins. Additionally, andrographolide decreased the activity of PI3K/Akt signaling, as demonstrated by down-regulation of the expression of phos-PI3K, phos-Akt, phos-mTOR and phos-p70s6k in U251 and U87 cells. Furthermore, additive effects on the proliferation inhibition, G2/M arrest and down-regulation of G2/M phase-related proteins were observed, when a combined treatment of andrographolide with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was used in U251 and U87 cells. SIGNIFICANCE: We prove that andrographolide inhibits the proliferation of human glioblastoma cells via inducing G2/M arrest, which is mediated by inhibiting the activity of PI3K/Akt signaling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aadditive effect 3aproteins 3adrug therapy 3aAndrographis paniculata 3ahumans 3acytotoxicity 3abrain 3acaspase-3 3aflow cytometry 3aWestern blotting 3ablood-brain barrier 3aherbal medicines 3aditerpenoids 3asolubility 3acell cycle 3aapoptosis 3aanticarcinogenic activity 0achemotherapy1 aZhang, Pengfei1 aQiu, Feng1 aChen, Lixia1 aMiao, Caixia1 aLi, Jianchun1 aXiao, Wei1 aMa, Enlong0 tLife sciences.g2012 June 27, v. 90, no. 25-26 p.962-967dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2012.04.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01791naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245011000173300001800283520073300301592002801034650002301062650002301085650003101108650001601139650004401155650001401199700001901213700002201232700002101254773009701275856008401372852000901456655001201465IND60110017720221118234429.0141109e20121114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011001772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.08.1162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNabeshima, Tatsuya10aSynthesis and guest recognition of molecular cleft consisting of terpyridine–Pt(II) acetylide complexes  ap. 6182-6185.  aThe stable molecular clefts 1 consisting of inert Pt–acetylide moieties and a 1,1′:3′,1″-terphenyl spacer were synthesized.

The effect of spark timing, blend ratio and EGR rate on the emission characteristics (unburned hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOₓ) and particulate size and distribution) was analyzed. BSFC (Brake specific fuel consumption) and MBT (maximum brake torque timing) at full load were also discussed. Results show that the blends of gasoline and n-butanol decrease engine specific HC, CO and NOₓ emissions compared to those of gasoline. Pure n-butanol increases engine specific HC and CO emissions and decreases NOₓ and particle number concentration compared to those of gasoline. n-Butanol addition can decrease particle number concentration emissions compared with that of gasoline. Advancing spark timing increases engine specific HC, NOₓ emissions and particle number concentration while it decreases engine specific CO emissions. EGR can reduce engine specific NOₓ emissions and particle number concentration simultaneously in spark-ignition engine fueled with gasoline and n-butanol blends.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon monoxide 3aenergy use and consumption 3agasoline 3anitrogen oxides 3aparticulate emissions 3atorque1 aHuang, Zuohua1 aCai, Jian1 aGong, Jing1 aWu, Xuesong1 aLee, Chia-fon0 tFuel.g2012 Mar., v. 93 p.611-617dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2011.11.0403Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01466naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245007600160300001400236520057200250592002800822650002500850650001000875650001300885650001400898650002000912650001600932700001500948700001300963773008600976856008101062852000901143655001201152IND60110258020221116163229.0141109e20120610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011025802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2012.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Z.X.10aStudy on the oscillation dissolved behavior of oxysophocarpine in water  ap. 76-79.  aIn this paper, the enthalpies of dissolution of oxysophocarpine in water were measured using a RD496-2000 Calvet microcalorimeter at 298.15K under atmospheric pressure, showing that the dissolution process was an endothermic and exothermic oscillation behavior.

C72-C79.  aThe cost of Expanded Programs on Immunization (EPI) is an important aspect of the economic and financial analysis needed for planning purposes. Costs also are needed for cost-effectiveness analysis of introducing new vaccines. We describe a costing tool that improves the speed, accuracy, and availability of EPI costs and that was piloted in Colombia.The ProVac CostVac Tool is a spreadsheet-based tool that estimates overall EPI costs considering program inputs (personnel, cold chain, vaccines, supplies, etc.) at three administrative levels (central, departmental, and municipal) and one service delivery level (health facilities). It uses various costing methods. The tool was evaluated through a pilot exercise in Colombia. In addition to the costs obtained from the central and intermediate administrative levels, a survey of 112 local health facilities was conducted to collect vaccination costs. Total cost of the EPI, cost per dose of vaccine delivered, and cost per fully vaccinated child with the recommended immunization schedule in Colombia in 2009 were estimated.The ProVac CostVac Tool is a novel, user-friendly tool, which allows users to conduct an EPI costing study following guidelines for cost studies. The total costs of the Colombian EPI were estimated at US$ 107.8 million in 2009. The cost for a fully immunized child with the recommended schedule was estimated at US$ 153.62. Vaccines and vaccination supplies accounted for 58% of total costs, personnel for 21%, cold chain for 18%, and transportation for 2%. Most EPI costs are incurred at the central level (62%). The major cost driver at the department and municipal levels is personnel costs.The ProVac CostVac Tool proved to be a comprehensive and useful tool that will allow researchers and health officials to estimate the actual cost for national immunization programs. The present analysis shows that personnel, cold chain, and transportation are important components of EPI and should be carefully estimated in the cost analysis, particularly when evaluating new vaccine introduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3acold 3acost effectiveness 3acost estimates 3aguidelines 3ahuman resources 3aprogram planning 3asurveys 3atransportation 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aColombia 0aCosts and cost analysis 0aVaccines 0aImmunization programs 0aColombia1 aRomero Maroto, Martín,1 aArce, Patricia1 aResch, Stephen1 aJanusz, Cara B.1 aToscano, Cristiana M.1 aDe la Hoz-Restrepo, Fernando0 tVaccine.g2013 July 02, v. 31 p.C72-C79dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.05.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01980naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007300165300001800238520080200256592002801058650002201086650002301108650002001131650004401151650002201195653002501217653001401242653003301256653002601289653001101315700002401326700002401350700002701374700002201401773008101423856008101504852000901585655001201594IND60109630420221118054256.0161018e20130701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010963042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2013.04.1112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTalhi, Oualid10aDiastereoselective synthesis of benzofuran-3(2H)-one-hydantoin dyads  ap. 5413-5420.  aA convenient diastereoselective rearrangement of the racemic (R/S)-spiro[chroman-2,4′-imidazolidine]-2′,4,5′-triones 3a–c into (2′R,5S)- and (2′S,5R)-5-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-2-yl)imidazolidine-2,4-diones 4a–c under alkali conditions is described.

Thermal stability of M (A&P) has been analyzed and compared with APP/PER mixture. In air atmosphere, the mass loss of M (A&P) at different heating rates was investigated using TGA. The kinetics of thermal degradation and activation energy was described using Flynn-Wall-Ozawa and Kissinger methods. It showed that there were two degradation stages. Expanded carbon structure with honeycomb was formed in the first stage between 200 and 450 °C. The second stage was the oxidation of carbon with Eₐ as high as 151.7 kJ/mol, so the expanded carbon had a good thermal stability. The reaction order of thermal degradation was found to be 0.935, so the mechanism of M (A&P) thermal degradation was controlled by the process of random nuclear formation and growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aactivation energy 3aair 3aammonium polyphosphates 3acarbon 3acombs (social insects) 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aheat 3aoxidation 3apolymerization 3athermal degradation 3athermal stability1 aQu, Yongtao1 aLi, Shaoxiang0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2012 Mar., v. 97, no. 3 p.404-409dElsevier Ltdx0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2011.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245020600167300001800373520158200391592002801973650001302001650001302014650001702027650001602044650002102060650002102081650001702102650000902119650002202128650001802150650001502168650002102183650003102204650002802235650001902263650001102282650001902293650002002312650003602332700001902368700002402387700002402411700002102435700002302456700002302479773009402502856008102596990002302677852000902700655001202709IND60110569020221116142822.0141109e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011056902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tiv.2013.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasad, Raju Y.10aInvestigating oxidative stress and inflammatory responses elicited by silver nanoparticles using high-throughput reporter genes in HepG2 cells: Effect of size, surface coating, and intracellular uptake  ap. 2013-2021.  aSilver nanoparticles (Ag NP) have been shown to generate reactive oxygen species; however, the association between physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles and cellular stress responses elicited by exposure has not been elucidated. Here, we examined three key stress-responsive pathways activated by Nrf-2/ARE, NFκB, and AP1 during exposure to Ag NP of two distinct sizes (10 and 75nm) and coatings (citrate and polyvinylpyrrolidone), as well as silver nitrate (AgNO₃), and CeO₂ nanoparticles. The in vitro assays assessed the cellular response in a battery of stable luciferase-reporter HepG2 cell lines. We further assessed the impact of Ag NP and AgNO₃ exposure on cellular redox status by measuring glutathione depletion. Lastly, we determined intracellular Ag concentration by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) and re-analyzed reporter-gene data using these values to estimate the relative potencies of the Ag NPs and AgNO₃. Our results show activation of all three stress response pathways, with Nrf-2/ARE displaying the strongest response elicited by each Ag NP and AgNO₃ evaluated here. The smaller (10-nm) Ag NPs were more potent than the larger (75-nm) Ag NPs in each stress-response pathway, and citrate-coated Ag NPs had higher intracellular silver concentrations compared with both PVP-coated Ag NP and AgNO₃. The cellular stress response profiles after Ag NP exposure were similar to that of AgNO₃, suggesting that the oxidative stress and inflammatory effects of Ag NP are likely due to the cytotoxicity of silver ions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acitrates 3acoatings 3acytotoxicity 3aglutathione 3ahuman cell lines 3ain vitro studies 3ainflammation 3aions 3amass spectrometry 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3aoxidative stress 3aphysicochemical properties 3areactive oxygen species 3areporter genes 3asilver 3asilver nitrate 3astress response 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aMcGee, John K.1 aKillius, Micaela G.1 aSuarez, Danielle A.1 aBlackman, C.

A mixed-bed ion-exchange (IEX) column, packed with both weak anion exchange (WAX) and weak cation exchange (WCX) materials, was used for the first dimensional separation of complex samples at the protein level using volatile solvents. The peptides from digestion of each fraction were then identified by 2D SCX-RP-LC–MS/MS. We applied this 3D strategy to mouse mammary tumor 4T1 cell lysate and identified a total of 3084 proteins in a typical experiment. The moderate separation performance of the mixed-bed IEX column facilitated the in-depth identification of the proteins in the complex sample. There were some acceptable inter-fraction overlaps. Nearly half (45.8%) of the proteins were only identified in single fractions, while 82.3% were identified in no more than 3 fractions. The identified proteins covered a broad range of pI, size and grand average hydrophobicity (GRAVY) values. Detailed analysis of proteins identified in each fraction elucidated the separation characteristics of mixed-bed IEX. Retention on mixed-bed IEX was associated, but not restricted to the extreme pI values (pI<5, pI>10) and to the percentage of charged residues of both signs. In conclusion, we have exploited the mixed-bed IEX column to establish an efficient and comprehensive identification method for complex samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanion exchange 3acation exchange 3achromatography 3afractionation 3ahydrophobicity 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 3apeptides 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asolvents1 aYao, Ling1 aZhang, Yan1 aXue, Ting1 aDai, Guangchen1 aChen, Keying1 aHu, Xiaofang1 aXu, Lisa X.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 Sept. 15, v. 905 p.96-104dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2012.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245008100169300001600250520159700266592002801863650001901891650001901910650001801929650001801947650001601965650001501981650002801996650001602024650001902040650001602059650001202075650001102087650001002098650002302108650001202131650001802143650000902161650001202170650002102182650001602203700001902219700001702238700001902255700001802274700002102292700001402313700001602327700001702343700001702360700001402377700001902391773008102410856008602491852000902577655001202586IND60105459020221120033046.0141108e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010545902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2012.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacedo, I.C.10aCafeteria diet-induced obesity plus chronic stress alter serum leptin levels  ap. 189-196.  aObesity is a disease that has become a serious public health issue worldwide, and chronic stressors, which are a problem for modern society, cause neuroendocrine changes with alterations in food intake. Obesity and chronic stress are associated with the development of cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders. In this study, a rat model was used to evaluate the effects of a hypercaloric diet plus chronic restraint stress on the serum leptin and lipids levels and on the weight of specific adipose tissue (mesenteric, MAT; subcutaneous, SAT and visceral, VAT). Wistar rats were divided into the following 4 groups: standard chow (C), hypercaloric diet (HD), stress plus standard chow (S), and stress plus hypercaloric diet (SHD). The animals in the stress groups were subjected to chronic stress (placed inside a 25cm×7cm plastic tube for 1h per day, 5 days per week for 6 weeks). The following parameters were evaluated: the weight of the liver, adrenal glands and specific adipose tissue; the delta weight; the Lee index; and the serum levels of leptin, corticosterone, glucose, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. The hypercaloric diet induced obesity in rats, increasing the Lee index, weight, leptin, triglycerides, and cholesterol levels. The stress decreased weight gain even in animals fed a hypercaloric diet but did not prevent a significant increase in the Lee index. However, an interaction between the independent factors (hypercaloric diet and stress) was observed, which is demonstrated by the increased serum leptin levels in the animals exposed to both protocols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3aadrenal glands 3aanimal models 3aanimal stress 3ablood serum 3acafeterias 3acardiovascular diseases 3acholesterol 3acorticosterone 3afood intake 3aglucose 3aleptin 3aliver 3ametabolic diseases 3aobesity 3apublic health 3arats 3asociety 3atriacylglycerols 3aweight gain1 aMedeiros, L.F.1 aOliveira, C.1 aOliveira, C.M.1 aRozisky, J.R.1 aScarabelot, V.L.1 aSouza, A.1 aSilva, F.R.1 aSantos, V.S.1 aCioato, S.G.1 aCaumo, W.1 aTorres, I.L.S.0 tPeptides.g2012 Nov., v. 38, no. 1 p.189-196dElsevier Inc.x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2012.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245007500175300001600250520134600266592002801612650001101640650001401651650001101665650002201676650001401698650001801712650002001730650001101750650001101761650001701772650001501789650001301804650001301817651001901830700001601849700001801865700001901883700002201902700001901924700003101943700001901974700002101993773009802014856008502112990002302197852000902220655001202229IND60101789920221119215604.0141106e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010178992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmarsys.2011.02.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrochier, Timothée10aIchthyoplankton transport from the African coast to the Canary Islands  ap. 109-122.  aThe Canary Upwelling System (CUS), a major eastern boundary upwelling system, sustains large cross-border fisheries of small pelagic fish, which poses the question of stock connectivity. Studies suggest that ichthyoplankton transport from the northwest African coast to the Canary Islands (CI) is facilitated by coastal-upwelling associated filaments. Here we analyze connections between larval supply to the CI and sardine and anchovy populations that spawn over the continental shelf. For both species, ichthyoplankton observations (1) at the shelf and (2) near the island of Gran Canaria (GC) are used. Predictions of ichthyoplankton transport to GC are obtained from the Ichthyop Lagrangian transport model, which is forced by a high-resolution hydrodynamic model (ROMS) that reproduces the regional circulation. Results show that upwelling filaments play an important role in the transport of larvae to GC. However, (1) filaments are not the only mechanism, and (2) filament presence does not necessarily imply larval transport. Anchovy and sardine larval presence at GC appears to be independent of the respective adult spawning seasonality. Combining of observed and modeled data does not succeed in reproducing the observed larval patterns at GC. Various hypotheses are proposed to explain this discrepancy in larval transport to GC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanchovies 3acoasts 3acontinental shelf 3afisheries 3ahydrodynamics 3aichthyoplankton 3alarvae 3amodels 3apelagic fish 3aprediction 3asardines 3aspawning 3aCanary Islands1 aMason, Evan1 aMoyano, Marta1 aBerraho, Amina1 aColas, François,1 aSangrà, Pablo1 aHernández-León, Santiago1 aEttahiri, Omar1 aLett, Christophe0 tJournal of marine systems.g2011 Aug., v. 87, no. 2 p.109-122dElsevier B.V.x0924-79637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2011.02.0253Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002500156245010500181300001600286520173100302592002802033650001502061650001702076650001902093650001202112650001002124650001302134650001002147650001302157650001602170700002602186700002002212700003302232773010502265856009002370990002302460852000902483655001202492IND60110968720221119065208.0141109e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011096872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2011.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDamodaran, Nedumaran10aSpeckle Noise Reduction in Ultrasound Biomedical B-Scan Images Using Discrete Topological Derivative  ap. 276-286.  aOver three decades, several despeckling techniques have been developed by researchers to reduce the speckle noise inherently present in ultrasound B-scan images without losing the diagnostic information. The topological derivative (TD) is the recently adopted technique in the area of biomedical image processing. In this work, we computed the topological derivative for an appropriate function associated to the ultrasound B-scan image gradient by assigning a diffusion factor k, which indicates the cost endowed to that particular image. In this article, a novel image denoising approach, called discrete topological derivative (DTD) has been implemented. The algorithm has been developed in MATLAB7.1 and tested over 200 ultrasound B-scan images of several organs such as the liver, kidney, gall bladder and pancreas. Further, the performance of the DTD algorithm has been estimated by calculating important performance metrics. A comparative study was carried out between the DTD and the traditional despeckling techniques. The calculated peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) (the ratio between the maximum possible power of a signal and the power of corrupting noise that affects the fidelity of its representation) value of the DTD despeckled liver image is found to be 28 which is comparable with the outperformed speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion (SRAD) filter. SRAD filter is an edge-sensitive diffusion method for speckled images of ultrasonic and radar imaging applications. Canny edge detection and visual inspection of DTD filtered images by the trained radiologist found that the DTD algorithm preserves the hypoechoic and hyperechoic regions resulting in improved diagnosis as well as tissue characterization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3agall bladder 3aimage analysis 3akidneys 3aliver 3apancreas 3aradar 3atopology 3aultrasonics1 aRamamurthy, Sivakumar1 aVelusamy, Sekar1 aKanakaraj Manickam, Gayathri0 tUltrasound in medicine & biology.g2012 Feb., v. 38, no. 2 p.276-286dElsevier Inc.x0301-56297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2011.10.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02000naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100001600154245015600170300001600326500002400342520077300366650001901139650000801158650001001166650001701176650002001193650003001213650003501243650001101278650002001289650002801309700001701337773010101354852000901455856006901464930003301533945002501566946001101591655001201602IND4381841020221119204138.0060710e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438184102DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-006-0296-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aLeach, R.C.10aSingle nucleotide polymorphic marker enabling rapid and early screening for the homoeolocus of β-amylase-R1: a gene linked to copper efficiency on 5RL  ap. 301-307.  aIncludes references  aThis study describes the development of a PCR marker to detect the β-amylase-R1 gene of rye.

Because rye chromosome segments do not normally recombine with wheat chromosomes, this marker provides a means for tracking all linked genes on that alien 5RL chromosome segment. Reaction conditions were optimised for an annealing temperature of 60°C for a high stringency. The reaction was also optimised for low reaction volumes reducing the cost of the reagents required for the reaction. This PCR test can be used in breeding or mapping programs for the rapid screening of progeny containing translocations of 5RL and hence select for the copper efficiency trait of rye. 3aSecale cereale 3arye 3agenes 3abeta-amylase 3agenetic markers 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3acopper 3aplant nutrition 3anutrient use efficiency1 aDundas, I.S.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2006 July, v. 113, no. 2 p.301-307dSpringerx0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-006-0296-03electronic resource  a20061119b20061202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/08/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02987naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245007500162300001600237520178500253650002302038650001602061650001302077650002402090650001602114650001902130650002302149650001402172650001002186653003702196653001602233653001802249653002002267653002202287700002402309773010602333852000902439856008502448939003302533946001102566655001202577IND4449654620221119204205.0110225e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444965462DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-010-9821-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraza, Rita 10aSpreading recruitment over time to cope with environmental variability  ap. 283-292.  aSeedling establishment is one of the most vulnerable life cycle stages, and a key component for the population dynamics in short-lived plants. In unpredictable environments, timing of emergence is critical for the success of plant performance, and different adaptive bet-hedging strategies have evolved to reduce the risk of failure in recruitment. In this study we describe the spatio-temporal pattern of seedling emergence (overall rate and timing) and survival in four contrasting Mediterranean habitats for Plantago coronopus, a small herb with dimorphic seeds. We then explore the importance of spreading germination within years, as well as the role of the two types of seeds from a broader temporal perspective. Populations strongly differed for all recruitment components analyzed in a given year, but this spatial differentiation diluted when a longer period was considered. Apical (smaller) seeds germinated later and in a significantly lower proportion than basal (larger) seeds. Both late emergents and seedlings from apical seeds had lower survival probability in a rainy year. However, our results suggest that in a population having the lowest production of apical seeds, late emergents coming from apical seeds may constitute a large fraction of yearly recruitment and that their performance was non-significantly different from that of early emergents over the 4-year study period. This study provides evidence of the importance of two related traits (spreading seedling emergence through time by producing dimorphic seeds) as bet-hedging strategies to cope with environmental unpredictability. This is at least partly accomplished by increasing the potential of recruitment in favourable years, instead of buffering such important process in extremely bad years. 3aPlantago coronopus 3agermination 3ahabitats 3apopulation dynamics 3aprobability 3arisk reduction 3aseedling emergence 3aseedlings 3aseeds 0aAnnual and perennial populations 0aBet-hedging 0aMediterranean 0aSeed dimorphism 0aSeedling survival1 aGarcía, María B. 0 tPlant ecology.g2011 Feb., v. 212, no. 2 p.283-292dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1385-02377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-010-9821-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b20110305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02833naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172100001600181245010500197300001600302500002400318500001500342520125600357650002201613650002501635650003501660650002101695650001801716650004101734650002201775651001001797653002201807653002001829700001901849700001901868700001301887700001201900700001301912700001901925773014701944852000902091856009402100856006202194930003302256945002502289946001302314655001202327IND4381841120221119204108.0060710e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438184112DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1752-1688.2006.tb03839.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aX100 0aX2001 aOlivera, F.10aArcGIS-SWAT: a geodata model and GIS interface for SWAT.

The ArcGIS-SWAT data model is a system of geodatabases that store SWAT geographic, numeric, and text input data and results in an organized fashion. Thus, it is proposed that a single and comprehensive geodatabase be used as the repository of a SWAT simulation. The ArcGIS-SWAT interface uses programming objects that conform to the Component Object Model (COM) design standard, which facilitate the use of functionality of other Windows-based applications within ArcGIS-SWAT. In particular, the use of MS Excel and MATLAB functionality for data analysis and visualization of results is demonstrated. Likewise, it is proposed to conduct hydrologic model integration through the sharing of information with a not-model-specific hub data model where information common to different models can be stored and from which it can be retrieved. As an example, it is demonstrated how the Hydrologic Modeling System (HMS) - a computer application for flood analysis - can use information originally developed by ArcGIS-SWAT for SWAT. The application of ArcGIS-SWAT to the Seco Creek watershed in Texas is presented. 3asimulation models 3awatershed management 3ageographic information systems 3amodel validation 3adata analysis 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3acomputer software 3aTexas 0ahydrologic models 0amodel interface1 aValenzuela, M.1 aSrinivasan, R.1 aChoi, J.1 aCho, H.1 aKoka, S.1 aAgrawal, Anup.0 tJournal of the American Water Resources Association.g2006 Apr., v. 42, no. 2 p.295-309dAmerican Water Resources Associationx1093-474X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2006.tb03839.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.awra.org/jawra/index.html3electronic resource  a20060911b20061003c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/07/19  aOther US 7aarticle02507naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011400127300001200241500001500253520137200268650001301640650002801653650002501681650001401706650001201720650002001732650001801752650001601770650001801786650001501804653001701819653002301836653001901859653002201878653002301900700001701923773007901940852000902019930003302028945001302061946001102074655001202085IND2201224220221119204132.0991021e199904  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220122422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFikiin, K.A.10aPredictive equations for thermophysical properties and enthalpy during cooling and freezing of food materials  ap. 1-6.  a2019-12-05  aGood knowledge of thermophysical characteristics of a wide range of foodstuffs has a major importance for the accurate prediction of their unsteady-state temperature distribution, the process duration and energy consumption in cooling and freezing (heating and thawing). Such information is necessary to predict the microbiology and biochemistry of spoilage and to control the product safety and quality, as well as for the design, optimisation and efficient operation of refrigerating and thermal systems in the food and biotechnological industries. The purpose of this paper is to present reliable unified equations for determination of the specific heat capacity, enthalpy, thermal conductivity, Kirchhoff function, etc. on the basis of generalised parameters (moisture content, actual and initial freezing temperatures). The relationship between the volumetric specific enthalpy and the Kirchhoff function is also derived. The proposed formulae have large areas of application. They cover practically all industrially processed food materials except those consisting mainly of fats. The equations may easily be used for both simple and rapid engineering calculations and for implementation in more sophisticated mathematical models and computer software, including the cases in which advanced enthalpy methods for numerical heat transfer simulations are involved. 3afreezing 3afood processing quality 3athermal conductivity 3aequations 3acooling 3afood processing 3awater content 3atemperature 3aspecific heat 3aprediction 0aabsorptivity 0akirchhoff function 0athermodynamics 0athermal radiation 0athermal properties1 aFikiin, A.G.0 tJournal of food engineering.g1999 , v. 40, no. 1/2 p.1-6x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a19991201b19991209c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03563naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245010100164300001600265520163800281650003801919650002001957650002101977650001801998650001102016650002102027650001402048650002102062650003102083650001802114650002402132650001302156650001802169650001702187650001202204650002202216650002102238650002002259650001502279650003202294650002202326650001302348650002802361650004002389653002802429653001702457653002202474653001702496700002302513700002102536700002002557700002302577700002402600700001902624700002202643773011002665852000902775856008502784939003302869946001102902655001202913IND4449652720221119204208.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444965272DNAL7 a10.1007/s11032-010-9432-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWitzel, Katja 10aMapping of quantitative trait loci associated with protein expression variation in barley grains  ap. 301-314.  aBarley (Hordeum vulgare) is an important cereal crop grown for both the feed and malting industries. Hence, there is great interest to gain deeper insight into the determinants of grain nutritional quality in order to improve the assessment of new traits. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was employed for the characterization of the grain proteome of doubled-haploid introgression lines (IL) representing a wild barley genome (Hordeum spontaneum Hs213) within a modern cultivar background (H. vulgare cv. Brenda). Proteome maps were subjected to differential cluster analysis and revealed ILs with similar or different protein expression patterns compared to the Brenda parent. A total of 51 quantitative trait loci for protein expression (pQTL) were detected, and proteins underlying these pQTL were further examined by mass spectrometry. Identification was successful for 49 of the segregating spots and functional annotation of proteins revealed that most proteins are involved in metabolism and disease/defence-related processes. Among those, multigene families of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases, heat shock proteins, peroxidases, and serpins were identified. Overall, eight pQTL signals were discovered in two independently grown sets of plants. The mapped spots included protein disulfide isomerase, α-amylase inhibitor BDAI, NADP malic enzyme, adenosine kinase and peroxidase BP1. Specific marker information of proteins involved in developmental events and protein storage as well as in disease- and defence-related processes now allows for targeted breeding approaches to improve the grain quality in barley. 3aHordeum vulgare subsp. spontaneum 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aadenosine kinase 3aalpha-amylase 3abarley 3acluster analysis 3acultivars 3adoubled haploids 3aglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate 3agrain quality 3aheat shock proteins 3aindustry 3aintrogression 3amalic enzyme 3amalting 3amass spectrometry 3amultigene family 3anutritive value 3aperoxidase 3aprotein disulfide-isomerase 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteome 3aquantitative trait loci 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 0a2-D gel electrophoresis 0aQTL analysis 0aProteome analysis 0aBarley grain1 aPietsch, Christof 1 aStrickert, Marc 1 aMatros, Andrea 1 aRöder, Marion S. 1 aWeschke, Winfriede 1 aWobus, Ulrich 1 aMock, Hans-Peter 0 tMolecular breeding.g2011 Mar., v. 27, no. 3 p.301-314dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1380-37437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-010-9432-23Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b20110305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02694naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100001200154245012600166300001600292500002400308520135100332650001001683650002101693650002201714650001901736650001101755650001801766650002101784650002501805650001201830650002601842651001001868653002201878653001801900653002701918700001201945700001401957773011801971852000902089856006902098930003302167945002502200946001102225655001202236IND4381838520221119204206.0060710e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438183852DNAL7 a10.1017/S00218596060059952doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aLin, L.10aStudy on the n-alkane patterns of five dominant forage species of the typical steppe grassland in Inner Mongolia of China  ap. 159-164.  aIncludes references  aThe alkane patterns of the dominant forage species of the typical steppe grassland in Inner Mongolia were clarified, and the effects of species, sampling time and site on the concentrations of alkanes were evaluated. The results showed that alkanes with odd-numbered carbon chains in the range C25 (n-pentacosane)-C35 (n-pentatriacontane) were predominant in cuticular wax in five dominant grasses of the typical steppe. The C31 (n-hentriacontane) alkanes were always present in the highest concentration in the grass species, especially in the Stipa daicalensis and Stipa grandis. Samples of Artemisia frigida contained not only high concentrations of odd-chain alkanes, but also the even-chain ones compared with other species. The effects of species and sampling time on alkane concentrations were significant, accounting for 0·912 and 0·067 of the total variance, respectively. The site effects on odd-chain alkanes were less than on even-chain. The results of principal component analysis indicated that the patterns of alkane concentrations in the five dominant species could be clearly distinguished during the whole growing season. Therefore, it should be possible to achieve accurate and precise estimations of intake and diet composition of grazing animals of the typical steppe grassland in Inner Mongolia using the alkane technique. 3aStipa 3aLeymus chinensis 3aArtemisia frigida 3aforage grasses 3aleaves 3aplant cuticle 3aepicuticular wax 3achemical composition 3aalkanes 3aquantitative analysis 3aChina 0aStipa daicalensis 0aStipa grandis 0aCleistogenes squarrosa1 aLiu, G.1 aZhang, Y.0 tJournal of agricultural science.g2006 Apr., v. 144, no. 2 p.159-164dCambridge University Pressx0021-85967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00218596060059953electronic resource  a20060808b20060906c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/08/08  aNon-US 7aarticle03210naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245007200173300001800245520179000263650002102053650001702074650001202091650001402103650001202117651001702129651001802146651001402164651001402178651002002192651001302212651001202225651001802237651001102255651000902266653001202275653002302287653002802310653001502338653001002353653002002363700003302383700002102416773012202437852000902559856009202568930003302660946001102693655001202704IND4406980720221119204139.0080620e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440698072DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2699.2008.01896.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlzate, Fernando10aPanbiogeographical analysis of the genus Bomarea (Alstroemeriaceae)  ap. 1250-1257.  aA panbiogeographical analysis of the genus Bomarea was undertaken in order to determine generalized tracks and biogeographical nodes, and to evaluate the current distribution of the genus based on the available tectonic information and the biogeographical regionalization of Latin America. The Neotropical region from northern Mexico to northern Argentina, and the Nearctic and Andean regions. A total of 2205 records of 101 species were analysed, representing 95% of the species assigned to Bomarea. Localities were represented on maps and their individual tracks were drawn. Based on their comparison, generalized tracks were detected and mapped. Nodes were identified in the areas where different generalized tracks were superimposed. Five generalized tracks were recovered. One is located in the Eastern Central America and Western Panamanian Isthmus provinces (Caribbean subregion, Neotropical region), which was supported by three species of Central American distribution. The four remaining generalized tracks were located in South America, in the North Andean Paramo, Cauca and Puna biogeographical provinces. These tracks were supported by species of Bomarea with an Andean distribution. Biogeographical nodes were established in the Central Andean region of Colombia, central Ecuador and central Peru. The nodes obtained for Bomarea support a hybrid origin for the Andean region, which presents diverse components from both northern and southern South America. Likewise, the track recovered between Colombia and Ecuador includes Andean and Neotropical areas, providing further support for this hypothesis. The nodes obtained are coherent with vicariant elements evident for Bomarea. Species of three clades proposed for Bomarea are distributed in specific generalized tracks. 3aAlstroemeriaceae 3abiogeography 3ahybrids 3atectonics 3atropics 3aAndes region 3aArctic region 3aArgentina 3aCaribbean 3aCentral America 3aColombia 3aEcuador 3aLatin America 3aMexico 3aPeru 0aBomarea 0ageneralized tracks 0ahistorical biogeography 0aNeotropics 0anodes 0apanbiogeography1 aQuijano-Abril, Mario Alberto1 aMorrone, Juan J.0 tJournal of biogeography.g2008 July, v. 35, no. 7 p.1250-1257dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0305-02707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2008.01896.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080620b20080704c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02579naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245013000126300001400256500001500270520133700285650002101622650002401643650001101667650001401678650001801692650002501710650001901735650002001754650001301774650002301787650002701810650001501837653001701852653001301869653001101882653002701893700001801920700001901938700001701957773008101974852000902055930003302064945001302097946001102110655001202121IND2201224620221119204212.0991021e199904  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220122462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertola, N.10aOptimisation of the design parameters in an activated sludge system for the wastewater treatment of a potato processing plant  ap. 27-33.  a2019-12-05  aAerated biological reactors at a laboratory scale, fed continuously with a model wastewater system, were used to obtain design parameters of an activated sludge process for the wastewater treatment of a potato processing plant. Experiments were performed using different dilution rates (D) ranging between 0.01 and 0.13 h(-1) to determine parameters such as: maximum specific microbial growth rate (micromax), saturation constant (K(s)), coefficient of microbial decay (k(d)) and true biomass yield (Y(X/S)). Design parameters were calculated from the mass balances of substrate consumption and biomass production under steady state, considering a Monod-type equation to represent the effect of substrate concentration on biomass production rate. The values of Y(X/S) and k(d) were obtained from the linear plot of q(s) (specific rate of substrate consumption) vs. D. Experimental data regression led to Y(X/S) = 0.45 gVSS/g COD and k(d) = 0.024 h(-1). By non-linear regression of q(s) vs. substrate concentration (S(S)) data the following values were obtained micromax = 0.09 h(-1) and K(s) = 0.006 g/l. Critical dilution rate was also calculated; it corresponds to the D value for which the cells of a reactor operating under such conditions are destroyed or are eliminated from the system at the same rate than they are produced. 3aactivated sludge 3amathematical models 3amixing 3aequations 3adeterioration 3awastewater treatment 3amicroorganisms 3afood processing 3apotatoes 3abiomass production 3achemical oxygen demand 3awastewater 0aoptimization 0adilution 0agrowth 0asaturation coefficient1 aPalladino, L.1 aBevilacqua, A.1 aZaritzky, N.0 tJournal of food engineering.g1999 , v. 40, no. 1/2 p.27-33x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a19991201b19991209c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01504naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001800143245002700161300001300188520068000201650001200881650001100893650001500904650001400919650002200933650001000955700001300965773007400978852000901052856008301061930003301144946001301177655001201190IND4368737720221119204010.0050409e20050318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436873772DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11051692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahadevan, L.10aSelf-Organized Origami  ap. 1740.  aIn origami, form follows the sequential spatial organization of folds. This requires continuous intervention and raises a natural question: Can origami arise through self-organization? We answer this affirmatively by examining the possible physical origin for the Miura-ori leaf-folding patterns that arise naturally in insect wings, leaves, and other laminae-like organelles. In particular, we point out examples where biaxial compression of an elastically supported thin film, such as that due to differential growth, shrinkage, desiccation, or thermal expansion, spontaneously generates these patterns, and we provide a simple theoretical explanation for their occurrence. 3ainsects 3aleaves 3aorganelles 3ashrinkage 3athermal expansion 3awings1 aRica, S.0 tScience.g2005 Mar. 18, v. 307, no. 5716 p.1740-1740x0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11051693Available from publisher's Web site  a20050421b20050501c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02858naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170100001500179245012900194300001600323500002400339520141400363650002501777650001801802650001801820650002701838650001901865650002001884650001901904650001101923650001801934650001701952650002101969650001901990650001902009650001702028700001302045700001602058700001602074700001102090773009702101852000902198856007602207930003302283945002502316946001102341655001202352IND4381826320221119204003.0060710e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438182632DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3180.2006.00509.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF900 0aM001 0aF6001 aKONG, C.H.10aHerbicidal potential of allelochemicals from Lantana camara against Eichhornia crassipes and the alga Microcystis aeruginosa  ap. 290-295.  aIncludes references  aIn the field, the growth of the aquatic weed Eichhornia crassipes and the alga Microcystis aeruginosa may be inhibited by fallen leaves of Lantana camara. This study showed that extracts of L. camara leaves and their fractions reduced the biomass of E. crassipes and M. aeruginosa within 7 days under laboratory conditions. Two fractions with highly inhibitory activity from the extract were isolated and subsequently identified as the pentacyclic triterpenoids, lantadene A and lantadene B. Both compounds significantly inhibited E. crassipes and M. aeruginosa growth, even at a low concentration. At all concentrations tested, their inhibitory activities were much higher than that of salicylic acid, a putative allelochemical from L. camara. The results indicated that the predominant allelochemicals involved in L. camara against either E. crassipes or M. aeruginosa are not phenolic acids, but lantadene A and lantadene B. Field trials showed that released levels of lantadene A and lantadene B were significantly correlated with amounts and decomposition periods of L. camara leaves floated in water. The amount released from 5 kg L. camara leaves was over the inhibition threshold of both E. crassipes and M. aeruginosa and reached a maximum at days 15-20. This study suggested that allelochemicals of L. camara could potentially be used to improve the management of weeds and algae in aquatic systems. 3aEichhornia crassipes 3anoxious weeds 3aaquatic weeds 3aMicrocystis aeruginosa 3aLantana camara 3aallelochemicals 3aplant extracts 3aleaves 3atriterpenoids 3aplant growth 3aapplication rate 3asalicylic acid 3abiodegradation 3aweed control1 aWANG, P.1 aZHANG, C.X.1 aZHANG, M.X.1 aHU, F.0 tWeed research.g2006 Aug., v. 46, no. 4 p.290-295dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0043-17377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2006.00509.x3electronic resource  a20070103b20070202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/11/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02145naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245011800129300001400247520115300261650001801414650001701432650002001449650001401469650001101483650001301494653001601507653001101523653002201534653001601556700002001572700001601592700001601608773008101624852000901705930003301714945001301747946001101760655001201771IND2201224820221119204037.0991021e199904  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220122482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaidment, G.G.10aAnalysis of the expansion valves used for controlling refrigerant feed into delicatessen cabinets in supermarkets  ap. 47-58.  aDelicatessen cabinets can be found in most supermarkets and are used to retail and display unwrapped chilled foods, including fresh and cooked meats, salads and pies. High operating costs for these cabinets have been regularly reported and this is mainly due to evaporation losses which occurs whilst unwrapped food is on display. One of main reasons for this has been cited to be low humidity within the display area, however, the cause of this is not clear. The role of the expansion device in the poor performance of the delicatessen cabinet is examined in this paper. This includes the results from a practical and theoretical investigation into the behaviour of thermostatic expansion valves (TEV) in the delicatessen cabinet. This showed standard expansion valve designs to be unstable and to constrain the level of humidity achieved in the display area. Alternative expansion devices are reviewed and the performance of the short tube restrictor device modelled. This has shown that this device will overcome the shortcomings of the traditional expansion devices and will significantly reduce the operating costs of the delicatessen cabinet. 3arefrigerators 3asupermarkets 3aoperating costs 3aequipment 3adesign 3ahumidity 0aperformance 0avalves 0aserving equipment 0arestrictors1 aMissenden, J.F.1 aJames, R.W.1 aTozer, R.M.0 tJournal of food engineering.g1999 , v. 40, no. 1/2 p.47-58x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a19991201b19991209c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03479naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245014100174300001600315520187200331650001302203650002002216650001402236650001702250650000902267650001702276650003302293650002702326650001502353650003202368650004502400650001302445650001602458650001602474651001202490653002002502653001602522653002402538653001302562653002802575700002502603700002002628700002102648700002702669773012002696852000902816856009202825930003302917946001102950655001202961IND4402800520221119204008.0080314e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440280052DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01826.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuillaumet, Alban10aTesting Bergmann's rule in the presence of potentially confounding factors: a case study with three species of Galerida larks in Morocco  ap. 579-591.  aTo test Bergmann's rule (which predicts a larger body size in colder areas within warm-blooded vertebrate species) in three partially sympatric species of larks (Galerida theklae, Galerida cristata and Galerida randonii) that occur in Morocco.

A comprehensive statistical framework was then designed to test Bergmann's rule in our three Galerida species (using altitude as a proxy for cold temperatures), while controlling for the possible influence of interspecific hybridization and competition and accounting for spatial autocorrelation. The method we propose is conservative in the sense that potentially confounding factors are adjusted so as to maximize their influence on the variable of interest. Bergmann's rule was strongly supported in G. theklae and G. randonii. However, body size did not respond to altitude in G. cristata, a result that was not simply explained by species-specific differences in geographical ranges and altitudinal span. In G. cristata, we detected a tendency for body size to increase with aridity, in agreement with an alternative definition of Bergmann's rule. However, since G. cristata also hybridizes with G. randonii in a contact zone located in the most arid part of the range of G. cristata, we could not tease apart the relative contribution of selection and hybridization in driving this pattern. This study highlights the need for careful statistical designs that allow meaningful variables to be picked out from large sets of potential factors. When taking these factors into account, we found that Bergmann's rule was still strongly supported in two out of the three species examined. 3aaltitude 3aautocorrelation 3abody size 3acase studies 3acold 3acytochrome b 3adry environmental conditions 3ageographical variation 3ahaplotypes 3ainterspecific hybridization 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asympatry 3atemperature 3avertebrates 3aMorocco 0aBergmann's rule 0acompetition 0aconfounding factors 0aGalerida 0aspatial autocorrelation1 aFerdy, Jean-Baptiste1 aDesmarais, Eric1 aGodelle, Bernard1 aCrochet, Pierre-André0 tJournal of biogeography.g2008 Apr., v. 35, no. 4 p.579-591dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0305-02707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01826.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080315b20080404c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01826naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245006400125300001400189520100100203650001201204650001901216650001001235650002801245650001301273650001601286650001301302700002101315700001701336773008101353852000901434930003301443945001301476946001101489655001201500IND2201224420221119204041.0991021e199904  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220122442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwok, K.C.10aReaction kinetics of heat-induced colour changes in soymilk  ap. 15-20.  aThe kinetics of colour changes in soymilk heated over a wide range of temperatures (80 degrees C-140 degrees C) and times (0-180 min) were studied using both instrumental analysis and sensory evaluation methods. On the basis of the CIELAB uniform colour space, the L*-value decreased following first order kinetics, but unlike cow's milk, soymilk did not exhibit an initial whitening phenomenon upon heating. The a*-and b*-values increased following zero order kinetics. The reciprocal of percentage reflectance (1/R) measured at 450 nm increased according to a first order reaction. Chroma (C*) and hue (h*) can be described well with zero order reaction kinetics. Sensory evaluation based on a nine-point quality scale showed a linear response between panel score and heating time. Compared with previously reported results for cow's milk, the changes in the CIELAB values in soymilk due to heat appeared to follow similar patterns, but the reactions were slower and less temperature sensitive. 3asoymilk 3aheat treatment 3acolor 3afood processing quality 3akinetics 3atemperature 3aduration1 aMacDougall, D.B.1 aNiranjan, K.0 tJournal of food engineering.g1999 , v. 40, no. 1/2 p.15-20x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a19991201b19991209c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02169naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002800142245007400170300001800244520100300262650001501265650001501280650001501295650001701310650003901327650002401366650001101390650002501401650002001426650000901446700002501455700002101480700001801501700002301519773009401542852000901636856008201645930003301727946001101760655001201771IND4408565820221119204114.0080801e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440856582DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2007009212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaposhnikov, Sergey A.10aSingle-cell gel electrophoresis (the comet assay): Loops or fragments  ap. 3005-3012.  aSingle-cell gel electrophoresis, or the comet assay, is widely used to measure DNA damage and repair. Upon electrophoresis, the DNA of lysed, agarose-embedded cells known as nucleoids, extends towards the anode in a structure resembling a comet, the relative intensity of the tail reflecting the frequency of DNA breaks. The structural organization of the DNA within comet preparations is not fully understood. We have used fluorescent in situ hybridization with large-insert genomic probes and human Cot-I DNA to investigate whether the production of the comet tail is simply explained by the relaxation of supercoiled DNA loops. We find that, under neutral electrophoresis conditions, when the tail and head DNA are double-stranded, the probed sequence of DNA is seen as a linear array, consistent with extension from a fixed point on the nuclear core or matrix. After alkaline electrophoresis, the appearance of the fluorescent probes suggests that linear DNA has coalesced into a granular form. 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aelectrodes 3afluorescence 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agel electrophoresis 3ahumans 3anucleotide sequences 3asupercoiled DNA 3atail1 aSalenko, Veniamin B.1 aBrunborg, Gunnar1 aNygren, Jonas1 aCollins, Andrew R.0 tElectrophoresis.g2008 July, v. 29, no. 14 p.3005-3012dWiley-VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2007009213Available from publisher's Web site  a20080801b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01296naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245006400163300001600227500002400243520042100267650001400688650001400702650002000716650002200736650002400758650001500782700002000797773012000817852000900937856004800946655001200994IND4443679020221119204012.0101015e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444367902DNAL7 a10.3103/S01476874100300512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBadawy, W.

The pressing of the apples led to the highly selective extraction of the flavan-3-ols with the lowest molecular weights: In the apples, the number average degree of polymerization of the flavanols was 14.7, and it dropped to 2.2 in the NCM. Keeving had the highest impact on the reduction of both flavanol content and number average degree of polymerization. The flavanol concentrations were decreased in the permeate by fining (30%) much more than by depectinization. The clarification step led to a further decrease of the number average degree of polymerization. Hydroxycinnamic acids were less affected by the extraction process (with extraction yields >50%) and not affected by clarification. The color evolved with all treatments: L*, a*, b*, and chromaticity distance index measures indicated a reduction of orange-yellow saturation except after sedimentation. 3apolyphenols 3aapples 3apectins 3apectinesterase 3aenzymatic treatment 3afood processing 3aapple juice 3afiltration 3acolor 3afood composition 3agelatin 3aflavanols 3achemical treatment 0aclarification 0aapple must 0aprefermentation clarification1 aBaron, A.1 aLe Quere, J.M.1 aRenard, C.M.G.C.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 June 27, v. 55, no. 13 p.5118-5122dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf06372243Available from publisher's Web site  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/04/22  aOther US 7aarticle02478naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245005000131300001400181500001500195520130200210650002401512650001101536650003001547650001401577650001201591650002201603650001101625650001001636650001601646650001701662650001301679653001701692653001201709653001701721653001901738653001901757653001601776653002101792653002901813700001901842773008101861852000901942930003301951945001301984946001101997655001202008IND2201224720221119204030.0991021e199904  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220122472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiranoudis, C.T.10aDesign of tray tunnels for food deep chilling  ap. 35-46.  a2019-12-05  aA mathematical model for the semi-batch operation of tray tunnels for food deep chilling is presented and analyzed. Design aspects are discussed involving both single tunnels and systems of parallel tunnels. In both cases, optimum flowsheet configuration and operating conditions are sought and verified by appropriate formulation of design and optimization strategies. The optimization objective is the total annual cost of the plant, subject to constraints imposed by the operation of the chilling tunnel, thermodynamics and construction. The decision variables were the number of trucks, the operating temperature and flowrate of the cooling air stream, the refrigeration cycle heat exchanger temperature, as well as the total number of sections involved. The Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) nature of the design problem required mathematical programming techniques for its solution. The optimization was carried out for a wide range of production capacities, and the optimal points, where a new truck or a new section is introduced, were evaluated. The analysis focused on the design of tray tunnels for the most popular food product treated by deep chilling--meat slabs. A characteristic case study is presented in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 3amathematical models 3atrucks 3afood processing equipment 3aequations 3acooling 3acosts and returns 3adesign 3atrays 3atemperature 3acase studies 3aair flow 0aoptimization 0atunnels 0aconstruction 0asingle tunnels 0athermodynamics 0aflow charts 0aparallel tunnels 0aproduction possibilities1 aMarkatos, N.C.0 tJournal of food engineering.g1999 , v. 40, no. 1/2 p.35-46x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a19991201b19991209c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03924naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002100186245016000207300001800367520227400385650002602659650001002685650001202695650002602707650002002733650003902753650002402792650005702816650004502873650003702918650000902955650000902964650001702973650003102990650003003021653002303051700002003074700002403094700001303118700001403131700002503145773011003170852000903280856008503289930003303374946001103407655001203418IND4409922420221119203722.0080905e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440992242DNAL7 a186511282pmid7 aPMC25970492pmcid7 a10.1007/s00125-008-1094-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzales, J.

The aims of this study were to determine whether chemical agents that induce ER stress regulate glucose production in vivo and to identify a physiological setting in which this may be important. Methods A pancreatic clamp test was performed in anaesthetised rats, and insulin and glucagon were replaced at basal levels. [6,6-²H₂]Glucose was infused in the absence (CON, n = 10) or presence of ER stress-inducing agents, namely, tunicamycin (Tun, n = 10) or thapsigargin (Thap, n = 10). Results Arterial insulin, glucagon, corticosterone and NEFA concentrations were constant throughout experiments and not different among groups. After 1 h, the glucose concentration was significantly increased in Tun and Thap rats (1.5 ± 0.2 and 2.1 ± 0.3 mmol/l, respectively; mean ± SD), but did not change in CON rats. Glucose production increased (p < 0.05) by 11.0 ± 1.6 and 13.2 ± 2.2 μmol kg⁻¹ min⁻¹ in Tun and Thap rats, respectively, but did not change in CON rats. When glucose was infused in a fourth group (HYPER) to match the increase in glucose observed in the Tun and Thap rats, glucose production decreased by ~22 μmol kg⁻¹ min⁻¹. Liver phosphorylase activity was increased and glycogen decreased in the Tun and Thap groups compared with the CON and HYPER groups. Given that glucose deprivation induces ER stress in cells, we hypothesised that hypoglycaemia, a condition that elicits increased glucose production, would activate the UPR in the liver. Three hour hyperinsulinaemic (5 mU kg⁻¹ min⁻¹) -euglycaemic (EUG, ~7.2 mmol/l, n = 6) or -hypoglycaemic (HYPO, ~2.8 mmol/l, n = 6) clamps were performed in conscious rats. Several biochemical markers of the UPR were significantly increased in the liver, but not in kidney or pancreas, in HYPO vs EUG rats. Conclusions/interpretation Based on our findings that the chemical induction of the UPR increased glucose production and that prolonged hypoglycaemia activated the UPR in the liver, we propose that the UPR in the liver may contribute to the regulation of glucose production during prolonged hypoglycaemia. 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aliver 2aAnimals 2aCorticosteronexblood 2aGlucagonxblood 2aGlucosexmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aHypoglycemiaxblood 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxadministration & dosagexblood. 2aInsulinxadministration & dosagexblood. 2aLiverxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aThapsigarginxpharmacology 2aTunicamycinxpharmacology 0aGlucose production1 aGentile, C.

First, the soil compartment is directly coupled to the atmosphere via the land surface and to the aquifers. Second, extremely fine (5 cm vertical) resolutions of the soil system can be realized at regional scales (several hundreds of km2). This high-resolution modelling could be achieved by parallel computation techniques. The RHSM approach is applied to the Beerze-Reusel drainage basin, which belongs to the Meuse River basin. Moisture transport in the soil system was calculated with extremely high vertical resolution at a regional scale based on rainfall-evaporation data for the year 2000. As a result, highly resolved regional groundwater recharge pattern addressing the heterogeneity of soil systems could be determined. A real case application of concept of regional hydrologic soil modelling is presented. 3awatersheds 3asoil hydraulic properties 3ahydrologic models 3agroundwater recharge 3amathematical models 3aequations 2aModels, Theoretical 2aSoil 2aWater Movements 2aWater Supply 3aNetherlands1 aDu, Y.1 aBurger, C.1 aDelfs, J.1 aKuntz, D.1 aBeinhorn, M.1 aHess, M.1 aWang, W.1 aGrift, B. van der1 aStroet, C. te0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2007 Aug., v. 148, no. 3 p.855-866dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2007.01.0463Available from publisher's Web site  a20080717b20080801c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/07/17  aNon-US 7aarticle03285naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245010400171300001300275520179200288650001502080650002402095650001502119650001702134650002902151650002502180650001002205650001302215650001402228650002202242650001502264650002102279650001302300650001802313650002202331650001602353650001502369651001402384653002002398653001902418653002602437700002002463700002502483700002602508773009302534852000902627856008502636939003302721946001302754655001202767IND4449648320221119203934.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444964832DNAL7 a10.1007/s11252-010-0141-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIves, Christopher D. 14aThe influence of riparian corridor width on ant and plant assemblages in northern Sydney, Australia  ap. 1-16.  aProtecting riparian corridors is a commonly applied environmental policy in urban landscapes. However, empirical data demonstrating their efficacy for biodiversity conservation outcomes is scarce. In this study we investigated whether riparian corridor width influences the diversity and community structure of ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and vascular plant assemblages therein. Eighteen corridors of differing widths were selected from within the Ku-ring-gai Local Government Area, Sydney Australia. Ants were sampled using pitfall traps positioned within rectangular vegetation transects (30 × 10 m). Both ant and plant species richness, when standardised for sampling effort, were unrelated to riparian corridor width. However, significant compositional differences between sites were evident with increased width up to ~50 m. Narrow corridors contained greater abundances of opportunistic ant species and higher proportions of exotic plants. We interpret this to be the result of the greater disturbance/edge influence derived from adjacent upland urban environments. Site beta diversity did not increase with corridor width, suggesting that the exclusion of novel upslope habitats in narrow riparian corridors is not a significant cause of community assemblage modification at these sites. To minimise the impact of deleterious edge effects on ant fauna, environmental managers should seek to retain riparian corridors wider than ~50 m. However, we observed substantial between-site variability of biotic assemblages, irrespective of corridor width. Therefore we recommend that environmental management practice needs to take a catchment-wide approach and consider other parameters that may contribute to riparian health so as to optimise the protection of riparian biodiversity. 3aFormicidae 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3aedge effects 3aenvironmental management 3aenvironmental policy 3afauna 3ahabitats 3ahighlands 3aintroduced plants 3alandscapes 3alocal government 3amanagers 3apitfall traps 3aspecies diversity 3aurban areas 3avegetation 3aAustralia 0aRiparian forest 0aCorridor width 0aCommunity composition1 aHose, Grant C. 1 aNipperess, David A. 1 aTaylor, Mark Patrick 0 tUrban ecosystems.g2011 Mar., v. 14, no. 1 p.1-16dBoston : Springer USx1083-81557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-010-0141-83Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b20110305c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02388naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163072000900181100002200190245006300212300001800275500002400293500001500317506007600332520035700408506003700765650001700802650001600819650002500835650001700860650001000877650001100887650001900898650001500917650001000932650002100942650001200963650003800975650004201013650004701055650004101102650002801143650002401171650002601195650002601221653002801247653002601275700002201301700001601323700002501339700002401364773013301388852000901521856008001530856006901610930003301679945002501712946001301737655001201750IND4381821720221207081309.0060710e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438182172DNAL7 a168205112pmid7 aPMC14893712pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.00157-062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 aCornick, Nancy A.10aIn Vivo Transduction of an Stx-Encoding Phage in Ruminants  ap. 5086-5088.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe assessed the ability of a kanamycin-marked Stx phage to move into a commensal, ovine Escherichia coli strain in the ruminant gastrointestinal tract.

SD and DOCA rats were fed a normal or a methionine (8 g/kg)-supplemented diet for 10 weeks. Systolic BP was monitored and plasma homocysteine, methionine and cysteine levels were determined at the end of the experiment. Vasoconstriction and vasodilatation of aortic rings were measured. The methionine-supplemented diet induced a greater increase in homocysteinaemia concentration in DOCA rats than in SD rats and an increase in plasma cysteine concentration in DOCA rats. This diet was associated with an increase in systolic BP in SD rats and with a lesser development of DOCA-salt hypertension. An enhanced aortic constriction and a decreased responsiveness to acetylcholine, bradykinin and sodium nitroprusside in the SD rats fed the methionine-rich diet were consistent with the elevated systolic BP. In DOCA rats the increased responsiveness to bradykinin was in accordance with the systolic BP-lowering effect. In conclusion, the methionine-enriched diet cannot simply be considered as model of hyperhomocysteinaemia, since other metabolites and mechanisms seemed to be implicated in these complex interactions. The differential vasopressive effect of the methionine supplementation in SD and DOCA rats, and in particular the lowering of systolic BP obtained with a greater degree of hyperhomocysteinaemia in DOCA rats, suggest that more complex interactions exist between hyperhomocysteinaemia and BP than the simple positive association described previously. 3aacetylcholine 3abradykinin 3acysteine 3adesoxycorticosterone 3adiet 3ahomocysteine 3ahypertension 3ametabolites 3amethionine 3amodels 3anitroprusside 3arats 3asystolic blood pressure 3avasoconstriction 3avasodilation 2aAcetylcholinexpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aAortaxdrug effects 2aBlood Pressurexdrug effects 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aBradykininxpharmacology 2aCalcium Chloridexpharmacology 2aCysteinexblood 2aDesoxycorticosterone 2aDietary Supplements 2aGlutathionexblood 2aHomocysteinexblood 2aHypertensionxbloodxchemically inducedxphysiopathology. 2aMale 2aMethioninexadministration & dosagexblood. 2aNitroprussidexpharmacology 2aNorepinephrinexpharmacology 2aOrgan Sizexdrug effects 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSodiumxmetabolism 2aVasoconstrictor Agentsxadministration & dosage1 aMaupoil, V.1 aLaurant, P.1 aJacqueson, A.1 aBerthelot, A.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2004 June, v. 91, no. 6 p.857-865dCABI Pubx0007-11457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01670naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002800152245007800180300001600258500002800274520069600302650002900998650002001027650001501047650002101062653000901083653000901092700002101101773012201122852000901244856009201253946001101345655001201356IND4403914420221119204051.0080404s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440391442DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2008.01113.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Heusden, G.

Fluorescence microscopy of strains expressing a Wss1p-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion shows that the protein is present in a single sharp spot near the nuclear membrane, distinct from the spindle pole bodies and nucleolus.

The design is a systematic review of observational studies published in the last 30 years. Four electronic databases were searched for publications (1977-2007). BMI was elected as the only measure of obesity, and all diagnostic criteria for GDM were accepted. Studies with selective screening for GDM were excluded. There were no language restrictions. The methodological quality of primary studies was assessed. Some 1745 citations were screened, and 70 studies (two unpublished) involving 671 945 women were included (59 cohorts and 11 case-controls). Most studies were of high or medium quality. Compared with women with a normal BMI, the unadjusted pooled odds ratio (OR) of an underweight woman developing GDM was 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69 to 0.82). The OR for overweight, moderately obese and morbidly obese women were 1.97 (95% CI 1.77 to 2.19), 3.01 (95% CI 2.34 to 3.87) and 5.55 (95% CI 4.27 to 7.21) respectively. For every 1 kg m⁻² increase in BMI, the prevalence of GDM increased by 0.92% (95% CI 0.73 to 1.10). The risk of GDM is positively associated with prepregnancy BMI.

This study examined mating behavior, survival, reproduction, and dispersion of membranous wing-clipped and wing-intact adults of the predatory stinkbug Podisus nigrispinus (Dallas) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), a generalist predator of cotton pests in South America. After laboratory studies demonstrated that wing-clipping did not alter mating behavior or reproductive output, field studies were conducted in experimental plots. In each experiment, 50 mated females (5-10 days old) were released at a central point. After 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, dispersion was measured via drop-cloth samples at distances up to 16 m from the release point. After 96 h, plants on each survey and release point were collected and, in the laboratory, they were inspected for egg masses. During the first 24 to 48 h after release, predators from both groups disappeared, but recovery of the wing-clipped predators was significantly greater (38.6% for wing-clipped and 17.3% for wing-intact predators) in all three releases. Importantly, oviposition rates on the release site were about three times greater for wing-clipped females (0.07 vs. 0.02 egg masses per plant), indicating that limiting flight induces females to stay and lay their eggs, hence, allowing local establishment of a new generation of predators. 3acotton 3aphytophagous insects 3aegg masses 3aeconomic threshold 3areproductive behavior 3asurveys 3apredators 3aflight 3apests 3amating behavior 3aPodisus nigrispinus 3aeggs 3afemales 3aadults 3acrops 3aSouth America 0aHemiptera1 aTorres, Jorge B.1 aVivan, Lucia M.0 tBioControl.g2009 Feb., v. 54, no. 1 p.9-17dSpringer Netherlandsx1386-61417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10526-008-9150-4 7aarticle02683naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002000156245007900176300002000255500002400275500001500299520086500314650000901179650001001188650001301198650002801211650001801239650002401257650002101281650001601302650001401318650002101332650001001353650001201363650005301375650002001428650003401448650000901482650002601491650002001517650002101537650001101558650002301569650001301592650002401605650002101629650002801650650002401678650002501702653001701727700001601744700002101760700002601781700001501807700001701822773012001839852000901959856007701968655001202045IND4462714820221119203550.0120210s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446271482DNAL7 a216271622pmid7 a10.1021/jf20138752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFinley, John W.10aAntioxidants in Foods: State of the Science Important to the Food Industry  ap. 6837–6846.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aAntioxidant foods and ingredients are an important component of the food industry. In the past, antioxidants were used primarily to control oxidation and retard spoilage, but today many are used because of putative health benefits. However, the traditional message that oxidative stress, which involves the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is the basis for chronic diseases and aging is being reexamined. Accumulating evidence suggests that ROS exert essential metabolic functions and that removal of too many ROS can upset cell signaling pathways and actually increase the risk of chronic disease. It is imperative that the food industry be aware of progress in this field to present the science relative to foods in a forthright and clear manner. This may mean reexamining the health implications of adding large amounts of antioxidants to foods. 3arisk 3afoods 3aspoilage 3areactive oxygen species 3afood industry 3asignal transduction 3achronic diseases 3aingredients 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxadministration & dosagextoxicity. 2aChronic Disease 2aDietary Supplementsxtoxicity 2aFood 2aFood Industryxtrends 2aGene Expression 2aHealth Promotion 2aHumans 2aModels, Biological 2aOxidants 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aOxidative Stress 2aReactive Oxygen Species 2aSignal Transduction 2aSulfhydryl Compounds 0aantioxidants1 aKong, Ah-Ng1 aHintze, Korry J.1 aJeffery, Elizabeth H.1 aJi, Li-Li.1 aLei, Xin Gen0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 July 13, v. 59, no. 13 p.6837–6846-6837–6846x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf20138753Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03817naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002700165245019500192300001800387500002400405520153000429650001601959650002201975650001301997650002402010650001702034650001102051650001902062650001202081650002602093650001102119650002402130650001602154650002102170650001002191650001002201650004802211650004802259650003902307650001802346650004002364650003302404650001102437650001702448650001802465650004202483650001102525650001102536650001602547650001602563650004702579650002002626650000902646650003402655650003602689650003402725650002202759650002102781651001402802651001402816700001702830700002202847700001902869773013702888852000903025856004903034655001203083IND4443104420221119203612.0101001e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444310442DNAL7 a208694872pmid7 a10.1016/j.jada.2010.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKavanagh, Katherine F.10aCaregiver- vs Infant-Oriented Feeding: A Model of Infant-Feeding Strategies among Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children Participants in Rural East Tennessee  ap. 1485-1491.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of this project was to collect data from focus-group participants to inform the future development of region-specific educational strategies to modify infant-feeding practices that may predispose children to obesity. Infant-feeding perceptions and practices were collected from participants of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, through recorded focus groups, in two East Tennessee counties. Focus groups replaced the participants' required, prescheduled nutrition-education classes for participants with infants younger than 6 months of age. Twenty-nine focus groups were convened and recorded, reaching a total of 109 participants. Results of this series of focus groups indicate that the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children population in rural East Tennessee was similar to populations elsewhere in terms of early solid-food introduction, frequent switching of formula, and sources of and valuation of infant-feeding advice. However, this population seemed to be different in the magnitude at which they introduce infant cereal early (primarily as an addition to the bottle). For this reason, interventions designed to reduce inappropriate infant-feeding behaviors in this population should focus on early introduction of solid food (especially infant cereal) first. In addition to these findings, a model of infant-feeding strategy development based on caregiver-orientation (framed within parenting styles) is presented and discussed. 3aWIC Program 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3acomplementary foods 3afocus groups 3agrains 3ainfant feeding 3ainfants 3alow income households 3amodels 3anutrition education 3arural areas 3arural population 3awomen 2aAdult 2aBottle Feedingxstatistics & numerical data 2aBreast Feedingxstatistics & numerical data 2aCaregiversxeducationxpsychology. 2aEdible Grain. 2aChild Nutrition Sciencesxeducation 2aFeeding Behaviorxpsychology 2aFemale 2aFocus Groups 2aFood Services 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant Care 2aInfant Food 2aInfant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aInfant, Newborn 2aMale 2aMaternal Behaviorxpsychology 2aMothersxeducationxpsychology. 2aObesityxprevention & control 2aPublic Assistance 2aRural Population 3aTennessee 0aTennessee1 aHabibi, Mona1 aAnderson, Kirsten1 aSpence, Marsha0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2010 Oct., v. 110, no. 10 p.1485-1491dAmerican Dietetic Associationx0002-82237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jada.2010.07.009 7aarticle04130naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010300126300001600229500015500245520257000400650001102970650001202981650002302993650001403016650001303030650001103043650002103054650002503075650001103100650001003111650001103121650001603132650001403148650001503162650001503177650001703192650001803209650001003227650001703237650001703254650001003271700001803281700001703299700001703316700001803333700001603351700002803367773014503395856005103540852000903591655001203600IND4491208020221119203811.0141110e20140620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449120802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoranid, B.10aHow irrigation level affects the daily growth pattern of young pear fruit of the CV. 'Abbé Fetel'  ap. 163-169.  aPaper presented at the Seventh International Symposium on Irrigation of Horticultural Crops - Greensys 2012, held July 16-20, 2012, Geisenheim Germany  aFruit growth is a key factor to be considered when evaluating overall plant performance, as it represents the economically relevant, integrated result of all physiological processes underway at tree level. Water availability is known to affect important plant functions related to fruit growth such as carbon assimilation, phloem translocation and xylem flows. This work investigates the effect of water restrictions on pear fruit growth in the early stages of fruit development. Four irrigation regimes, corresponding to 100%, 50%, 25% and 0% of the calculated daily evapotranspiration, were applied to several trees of the cv. 'Abbé Fetel', starting from 40 days after full bloom (DAFB) until harvest. At about 50 DAFB, diameter changes of 4 fruit per treatment were continuously monitored over 24 hours, using automatic fruit gauges. On the same trees, leaf and stem water potentials were measured at 10:00, 12:00, 15:00 and 24:00 hours, while the daily patterns of phloem, xylem and transpiration flows to/from the fruit were estimated only on the 100% and 25% irrigated trees. For each treatment, soil water status was also monitored using tensiometers at different soil depths. In the morning, both stem and leaf water potentials were reduced in the 0% treatment, while from midday on only stem water status was negatively affected by drought conditions and showed differences between the stressed (50% 25% and 0% treatments) and the 100% treatment. Fruit growth patterns over the 24 hours were characterized by the typical daily fluctuation in fruit diameter, alternating periods of shrinkage and swelling and no significant differences were detected among 100%, 50% and 25% treatments. Only fruit on the 0% irrigated trees showed reduced growth rates during the night and longer and deeper fruit shrinkages during the central hours of the day, which were followed by faster rehydration rates during the late afternoon. This change in the growth pattern resulted in a decreased total fruit daily growth, which however, was detected also on the 25% fruit. According to these results, a water supply of 50% of the tree evapo-transpiration may not be limiting for pear fruit growth at this time of the season and in these experimental conditions. Reduced xylem inflows were detected on 25% irrigated fruit at midday and in the early afternoon, the times when the same trees showed a significant reduction in their stem water potential. Stem water status may thus represent a good indicator for upcoming limitations in fruit water inflows due to drought stress. 3acarbon 3adrought 3aevapotranspiration 3aflowering 3afruiting 3agauges 3airrigation rates 3aleaf water potential 3aleaves 3apears 3aphloem 3arehydration 3ashrinkage 3asoil depth 3asoil water 3atensiometers 3atranspiration 3atrees 3awater stress 3awater supply 3axylem1 aAnconelli, S.1 aLosciale, P.1 aManfrini, L.1 aPierpaoli, E.1 aZibordi, M.1 aCorelli Grappadelli, L.0 tActa horticulturae.g2014 June 20, , no. 1038 p.163-169dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1038/1038_18.htm  aDNAL 7aarticle02011naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005300126300001600179520108900195650001901284650001001303650001301313650001601326650001801342650001301360650002401373650001401397650001301411650001501424650001301439700001701452700001701469773008501486852000901571930003301580945001301613946001101626655001201637IND2199168720221119203805.0990607e199802  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219916872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBroyart, B.10aPredicting colour kinetics during cracker baking  ap. 351-368.  aThe topic of this investigation covers the study of the kinetics of colour formation during the baking of crackers in a static electrically heated oven. Methods for measuring the kinetics of variation of product temperature, water content and surface colour (assessed in CIE 1976 (L*, a*,b*) system) are described. An appropriate experimental set-up was developed and experiments with increasing baking times were realised in order to reconstitute the whole baking profiles. The validity of this method was proved using continuous temperature recordings. Experimental recordings of cracker surface lightness during baking show first an enlightenment and subsequently a darkening phase. The darkening phase is initiated when the product temperature reaches a critical value in the range of 105-115 degrees C. A kinetic model was developed in order to predict the lightness variation of the cracker surface using the product temperature and moisture content variations during baking. The evolution of lightness appears to follow a first-order kinetic influenced by these two parameters. 3abaking quality 3acolor 3akinetics 3atemperature 3awater content 3asurfaces 3amathematical models 3aequations 3avalidity 3aprediction 3acrackers1 aTrystram, G.1 aDuquenoy, A.0 tJournal of food engineering.g1998 Feb., v. 35, no. 3 p.351-368x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02018naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245013500134300001600269520097100285650003001256650001201286650000901298650001301307650001001320650001601330650002401346650001401370650001501384650001301399650001301412653001701425700002101442700001801463773008501481852000901566930003301575945001301608946001101621655001201632IND2199396420221119203647.0990621e199802  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219939642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinheiro Torres, A.10aResidence time distribution of liquids in a continuous tubular thermal processing system. I. Relating RTD to processing conditions  ap. 147-163.  aA systematic experimental study on residence time distribution (RTD) in tubular flow was performed, covering a wide range of processing conditions. The flow of water in various sections of a tubular continuous thermal processing system was analysed using the classical Danckwerts approach. Methylene blue was used as tracer and different constant temperatures (25-80 degrees C) and flow rates (80-380 l/h) were tested These conditions yielded mean residence times up to 6 min and Reynolds numbers between 1350 and 9700. Various models were fitted to the experimental data, and the dispersion model showed to yield the best fit. Peak analysis led to both accurate and precise as well as conservative parameters, when compared to other methods of parameter estimation. Results revealed that fluid dispersion in tubular flow (Peclet number) can be related to processing conditions (Reynolds number) by a power law model. Results were compared to published correlations. 3afood processing equipment 3aliquids 3aflow 3avelocity 3atubes 3atemperature 3amathematical models 3aequations 3aprediction 3aaccuracy 3aduration 0adistribution1 aOliveira, F.A.R.1 aFortuna, S.P.0 tJournal of food engineering.g1998 Feb., v. 35, no. 2 p.147-163x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a19990802b19990812c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02651naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001400146245018800160300001800348500002400366500001500390520109500405650001901500650001901519650002001538650001601558650002201574650002301596650001701619650002401636650002101660650001901681653001701700653001601717653003401733653002201767653005601789700001601845773016301861852000902024856007702033930003302110945002502143946001302168655001202181IND4392707320221119203821.0070628e20070627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439270732DNAL7 a10.1021/jf063694p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5041 aKim, H.S.10aSimple Purification (Desalting) Procedure To Facilitate Structural Analysis of an Alkali-Solubilized/Neutralized Starch Solution by Intermediate-Pressure Size-Exclusion Chromatography  ap. 4944-4948.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA technique was established to remove impurities (e.g., salts) from starch dissolved in strong alkali and neutralized with acid to accommodate starch structural analysis via intermediate-pressure size-exclusion chromatography (IPSEC). Starch (corn and wheat) subjected to an alkaline-microwave dissolution scheme (35 s microwave heating in a mixture of 6 M urea and 1 M KOH) was either treated with ion-exchange resin or passed through a desalting column to remove salt/urea contaminants. Control (untreated) starch solution analyzed by IPSEC displayed a significant interfering peak (attributable to salt/urea), which coeluted with the starch amylose peak. The interfering peak was most efficiently eliminated by first passing the starch solution through a desalting column, which process effectively removed impurities (e.g., salts/urea) without appearing to adversely impact the starch structural analysis. This simple technique coupled with the rapid alkaline-microwave starch dissolution procedure greatly expedites structural investigation of starch by facilitating analysis by IPSEC. 3aneutralization 3asolubilization 3astarch granules 3acorn starch 3aaqueous solutions 3agel chromatography 3awheat starch 3amicrowave treatment 3aalkali treatment 3aacid treatment 0apurification 0adissolution 0asize exclusion chromatography 0awaxy wheat starch 0aintermediate-pressure size exclusion chromatography1 aHuber, K.C.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 June 27, v. 55, no. 13 p.4944-4948dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf063694p3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/04/21  aOther US 7aarticle02524naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001800155245009100173300001800264500002400282520107800306650001901384650001101403650001101414650001401425650001701439650001701456650001701473650002301490650002601513650003001539650002401569650001701593653001601610700001701626700001601643700001401659700001901673700001801692773016301710852000901873856007701882930003301959945002501992946001302017655001202030IND4392706520221119204028.0070628e20070627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439270652DNAL7 a10.1021/jf070348e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF8311 aPoutaraud, A.10aFast and Local Assessment of Stilbene Content in Grapevine Leaf by in Vivo Fluorometry  ap. 4913-4920.  aIncludes references  aStilbenes are grapevine phytoalexins. These highly fluorescent molecules are generally analyzed by HPLC. This technique allows accurate assay of different stilbenes, but it is destructive, time-consuming, and neglects their spatial distribution. This is why we have tested a new method based on in vivo fluorescence using commercial spectrofluorometers that allowed fast and local assessment of stilbene content in grapevine leaves. Stilbene synthesis in grapevine Vitis vinifera var. Muscat Ottonel leaves was induced by Plasmopara viticola inoculation or UV-C irradiation. Fluorescence was measured both from the abaxial and adaxial sides of leaves, then stilbene content was analyzed by HPLC. It varied from 0 in control leaves to 15 mg g-1 dry weight in UV-treated leaves. Highly significant regressions were found between HPLC stilbene content and the corresponding leaf UV-induced blue fluorescence. Thus, in vivo fluorescence is a good tool for a rapid study of stilbenes synthesis in grapevine leaves that can potentially be extended to other fluorescent molecules. 3aVitis vinifera 3agrapes 3aleaves 3astilbenes 3aphytoalexins 3abiosynthesis 3afluorescence 3aanalytical methods 3aultraviolet radiation 3afungal diseases of plants 3aPlasmopara viticola 3adowny mildew 0afluorometry1 aLatouche, G.1 aMartins, S.1 aMeyer, S.1 aMerdinoglu, D.1 aCerovic, Z.G.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 June 27, v. 55, no. 13 p.4913-4920dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf070348e3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/04/21  aOther US 7aarticle02122naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001600168245005900184300001600243500002400259520115100283650002001434650002501454650001501479651001201494651001001506773010001516852000901616856009001625930003301715945002501748946001101773655001201784IND4392707220221119203831.0070628e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439270722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jrurstud.2007.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aE500 0aE5501 aHoggart, K.14aThe diluted working classes of rural England and Wales  ap. 305-317.  aIncludes references  aThis paper asks, what are the attributes of the rural working class population in England and Wales? Drawing on the Office for National Statistics' (ONS) Longitudinal Study (LS), household and personal attributes at both the 1991 and 2001 Censuses are examined, with a view to exploring how far the rural working classes can be conceptualised as a cohesive occupational group; in other words, is the traditional vision of the rural working classes, as comprising a cohesive occupational community, still accurate? The results show this understanding is inaccurate. Social dynamism turns out to be high in rural areas, with little uniformity in the rural population with working class occupations, not simply due to occupational change but also as a result of cohabitation with those of other occupational grades and as a consequence of population turnover through migration. The paper indicates that caution is needed over messages in the rural studies literature concerning the magnitude of disadvantages that the rural working classes face, in good part because the composition of rural households with working class constituents is so dynamic. 3arural sociology 3asocioeconomic status 3aemployment 3aEngland 3aWales0 tJournal of rural studies.g2007 July, v. 23, no. 3 p.305-317dElsevier Sciencex0743-01677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2007.01.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070706b20070802c00000000  aINDdRLGe2007/07/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02773naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002400156245015400180300001800334500002400352520123900376650004101615650002001656650002001676650001701696650001301713650001601726650001001742650001601752650001501768650001701783650001501800650001301815650003901828650001201867650002501879650002501904650002301929650002101952650003001973650002402003700003002027700003002057773010602087852000902193856007702202655001202279IND4462722620221119203905.0120210s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446272262DNAL7 a215989482pmid7 a10.1021/jf200944y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos-Zea, Liliana10aComparative Analyses of Total Phenols, Antioxidant Activity, and Flavonol Glycoside Profile of Cladode Flours from Different Varieties of Opuntia spp  ap. 7054-7061.  aIncludes references  aThe phenolic, flavonoid, and antioxidant contents of methanol extracts of nine samples of Mexican cactus (Opuntia spp.) cladodes processed into flours were studied. Opuntia undulata contained the highest amount of phenols [905.08 ± 64.51 μg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g]. The oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) of the cladode flour extracts indicated that Opuntia robusta var. Gavia [738.8 ± 89.9 μmol of Trolox equivalents (TE)/g] contained the highest antioxidant capacity. ORAC values significantly correlated to total phenols but not to flavonoid contents and were comparable to cranberries and blackberries. Glycosidic forms of isorhamnetin and kaempferol were identified via high-performance liquid chromatography–photodiode array (HPLC–PDA) and HPLC–mass spectrometry (MS), with isorhamnetin being the most abundant flavonol in all samples, except for Opuntia lindheimeri. The effectiveness of acid hydrolysis varied among species because of the different flavonol profiles. For some varieties, the triglycosidic forms were partially acid-hydrolyzed, giving an increase in the content of diglycosides. Optimization of hydrolysis for each species is required to estimate the total amount of each flavonol. 3aOpuntia engelmannii var. lindheimeri 3aOpuntia robusta 3aacid hydrolysis 3ablackberries 3acladodes 3acranberries 3aflour 3agallic acid 3aglycosides 3aisorhamnetin 3akaempferol 3amethanol 3aoxygen radical absorbance capacity 3aphenols 2aFlavonoidsxanalysis 2aGlycosidesxanalysis 2aOpuntiaxchemistry 2aPhenolxanalysis 2aPlant Extractsxchemistry 2aSpecies Specificity1 aGutierrez-Uribe, Janet A.1 aSerna-Saldivar, Sergio O.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 July 13, v. 59, no. 13 p.7054-7061x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf200944y3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02343naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007800126300001600204520144600220650001901666650001901685650002401704650002401728650001501752650001601767650002001783700001801803700001701821700001801838773008301856852000901939930003301948945001301981946001101994655001202005IND2062239820221119203738.0980304e199610  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206223982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurfoot, D.10aModelling the pasteurisation of prepared meals with microwaves at 896 MHz  ap. 117-133.  aMicrowave heating of prepared meals in sealed retail containers can be used to extend their shelf life. A numerical model to predict food temperatures after heating was developed and tested for use in the design of microwave cavities and foods. The model uses a finite difference scheme to predict temperatures by solving Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic fields and the heat conduction equation. Complex-shaped trays containing mashed potato were heated in a microwave tunnel operating at 2.3 kW for 60 s. The temperature distribution in the food was then measured over a 120 s period, during which the food partially cooled. The heat capacity and dielectric properties of the potato, and the power dissipated in the food during heating, were measured. Intricate temperature profiles, with large temperature gradients, were measured and predicted. The model predicted the positions of regions of highest and lowest temperature but large differences of up to 30 degrees C were found between measurements and predictions. The differences were largest near to regions where the finite difference mesh, which consisted of 4 mm cubes, was least able to simulate accurately the shape of the tray. Predictions carried out on a high performance workstation required 43 h of cpu. Further studies using a finer mesh on a more powerful computer, along with experiments using simple regular shapes of food, are required to test the model further. 3apasteurization 3aprepared foods 3amicrowave treatment 3amathematical models 3aprediction 3atemperature 3afood processing1 aRailton, C.J.1 aFoster, A.M.1 aReavell, S.R.0 tJournal of food engineering.g1996 , v. 30, no. 1/2 p.117-133x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a19980401b19980408c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03858naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245015600187300001600343500002400359520216200383650001502545650002202560650001002582650004102592650004302633650001502676650002302691650002002714650000902734650001502743650002802758650002102786650004202807650004102849650001002890650003202900650004202932650003802974650004703012650002703059700001403086700002203100700001603122700001703138773012103155852000903276856005503285655001203340IND4402256420221119203825.0080302e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440225642DNAL7 a187134422pmid7 a10.1111/j.1744-7909.2007.00610.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Su-Qin10aRelationships between Phosphatidylglycerol Molecular Species of Thylakoid Membrane Lipids and Sensitivities to Chilling-induced Photoinhibition in Rice  ap. 194-202.  aIncludes references  aIn an attempt to explore the relationships between phosphatidylglycerol (PG) molecular species of thylakoid membrane lipids and sensitivities to chilling-induced photoinhibition, PG molecular species, D1 protein, electron transport activities of thylakoid membrane and the potential quantum yield (Fv/Fm) in rice treated under middle and low photon flux density (PFD) at 11°C were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography, enzyme hydrolysis, gas phase chromatography (GC) and so on. Results showed that the major molecular species of PGs in rice thylakoid membrane were 18:3/16:0, 18:3/16:1(3t), 18:2/16:0, 18:2/16:1(3t), 18:1/16:0, 18:1/16:1(3t), 16:0/16:0, 16:0/16:1(3t). There were large differences in the contents of unsaturated PG molecular species such as 18:1~3/16:0~16:1(3t) and saturated PG molecular species like 16:0/16:0~16:1(3t) among japonica cv 9516 (j-9516), japonica-indica hybrid F1 j-9516/i-SY63 (ji-95SY) and indica cv Shanyou 63 (i-SY63). J-9516 containing higher contents of unsaturated PG molecular species was manifest in stable D1 protein contents under chill and tolerant to chill-induced photoinhibition. In contrast to j-9516, i-SY63 with lower contents of unsaturated PG molecular species, exhibited unstable D1 protein contents under chill and was sensitive to chill-induced photoinhibition. ji-95SY containing middle contents of unsaturated PG molecular species between those of j-9516 and i-SY63, exhibited mid extent of sensitivity to chill-induced photoinhibition. The losses in D1 protein also account for the inhibition in electron transport activity of thylakoid membrane and the observed decline in Fv/Fm. The PG molecular species that is efficient in raising chilling-resistant capacity were those containing unsaturated fatty acids, namely, unsaturated PG molecular species. These results implied that the substrate selectivity of the glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase in chloroplasts towards 16:0 or 18:1 displayed greatly the difference between japonica and indica rice.It was possible to enhance the capacity of resistance to chilling-induced photoinhibition by improving or modifying the GPAT gene. 3aD1 protein 3aelectron transfer 3agenes 3aglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrolysis 3amembrane potential 3aphotoinhibition 3arice 3athylakoids 3aunsaturated fatty acids 2aCold Temperature 2aElectron Transportxradiation effects 2aFatty Acids, Unsaturatedxmetabolism 2aLight 2aMembrane Lipidsxmetabolism 2aOryzaxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aPhosphatidylglycerolsxmetabolism 2aPhotosystem II Protein Complexxmetabolism 2aThylakoidsxmetabolism1 aZhao, Hua1 aLiang, Jian-Sheng1 aJi, Ben-Hua1 aJiao, De-Mao0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2008 Feb., v. 50, no. 2 p.194-202dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1672-90727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7909.2007.00610.x 7aarticle02735naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001800156245008500174300001800259500002400277520109000301650002101391650002501412650002901437650001501466650001901481650001101500650001901511650001401530650003201544650001001576650001101586650002401597650001201621650004401633650004701677650001901724650002301743650005201766650002501818650002301843650003701866650001101903700002401914700001901938700001901957700002501976773010602001852000902107856007702116655001202193IND4462722220221119203848.0120210s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446272222DNAL7 a216306612pmid7 a10.1021/jf200867r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMbatia, Betty10aEnzymatic Synthesis of Lipophilic Rutin and Vanillyl Esters from Fish Byproducts  ap. 7021-7027.  aIncludes references  aLipase-catalyzed synthesis of lipophilic phenolic antioxidants was carried out with a concentrate of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), recovered from oil extracted from salmon (Salmon salar) byproduct. Vanillyl alcohol and rutin were selected for the esterification reaction, and obtained esters yields were 60 and 30%, respectively. The antioxidant activities of the esters were compared with those of commercial butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and α-tocopherol using DPPH radical scavenging and thiobarbituric acid assays. In the DPPH assay, rutin esters showed better activity than vanillyl esters, and on the contrary in lipophilic medium, vanillyl esters were found to be superior to rutin esters. In bulk oil system, the antioxidant activities of rutin and vanillyl derivatives were lower than that of BHT and α-tocopherol, but in emulsion, they showed better activity than α-tocopherol. By attaching to natural phenolics, the PUFAs are protected against oxidation, and PUFA improves the hydrophobicity of the phenolic, which could enhance its function in lipid systems. 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidant activity 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3abyproducts 3aesterification 3aesters 3ahydrophobicity 3aoxidation 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3arutin 3asalmon 3athiobarbituric acid 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aBenzyl Alcoholsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aEsterification 2aEstersxmetabolism 2aFatty Acids, Omega-3xmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aFish Oilsxchemistry 2aLipasexmetabolism 2aRutinxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aSalmon1 aKaki, Shiva Shanker1 aMattiasson, Bo1 aMulaa, Francis1 aAdlercreutz, Patrick0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 July 13, v. 59, no. 13 p.7021-7027x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf200867r3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02449naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002100136245006000157300001800217500002400235520158900259650002701848650002401875650002001899650001901919650001201938650001901950700001801969773011201987852000902099856003902108655001202147IND4425414420221119203733.0090829e20090830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442541442DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.73452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScordo, Elisa B.10aTransient storage processes in a steep headwater stream  ap. 2671-2685.  aIncludes references  aThis study examined hyporheic exchange flow and transient storage processes within a steep headwater stream, using both hydrometric and tracer approaches. Vertical hydraulic gradients varied systematically with location within step-pool units, with upwelling located in a relatively narrow zone immediately below the step. Downward hydraulic gradients were greatest immediately above channel steps, and in that zone, gradients were also correlated with step height. Hydraulic conductivity tended to be lower in downwelling zones than in upwelling and neutral locations. Transient storage areas determined from reach-scale tracer tests tended to increase with discharge, whereas transient exchange coefficients were not correlated with discharge. Transient storage exchange fluxes estimated from the reach-scale tracer tests were an order of magnitude greater than hyporheic exchange fluxes estimated by scaling up local estimates based on Darcy's Law and piezometer measurements. This difference could be explained by the presence of lateral hyporheic flow paths and/or the influences of transient storage in pools. Tracer injections into infiltrometers using Rhodamine WT and sodium chloride allowed visual determination of hyporheic discharge zones and calculation of residence times for hyporheic flow through the step (pool inflow) and transport through the downstream pool (pool outflow). These tests indicated that residence time in pools can be comparable to hyporheic residence times, although the lack of replication in time and space limits the drawing of strong inferences. 3ahydraulic conductivity 3alabeling techniques 3asodium chloride 3aspace and time 3astreams 3atransient flow1 aMoore, R.

H.E. Moore and Stearn] fruit over time as affected by ripening temperature. The model assumed that, as fruit ripened, SSC increased at a linear rate reaching a maximum (30% SSC) at the ripe stage after which SSC changed little. The rate of fruit ripening and the time to reach the ripe stage were calculated from the model. The rate of ripening increased steadily with increases in storage temperature. Fruit kept at 28, 25, 20, 15 and 10 °C ripened 3.5, 5, 7, 15 and 30 days after harvest, respectively. Temperature quotients (Q10) for fruit ripening decreased with increasing storage temperature. The model shows that shelf life of sapote mamey can be significantly extended by cool storage. The model can be used to estimate the time for fruit to reach the ripe stage, as long as the initial SSC and storage temperatures are known. 3ashelf life 3afruits 3atotal soluble solids 3amodels 3astorage temperature 3aPouteria sapota 3aripening 0asoluble solids1 aBautista, Silvia1 aVillanueva, Ramon1 aLopez-Gomez, Rodolfo0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2003 Apr., v. 28, no. 1 p.199-202dElsevierx0925-52147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0925-5214(02)00123-0 7aarticle01739naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009500126300001600221500001500237520081300252650002401065650001101089650001801100650002301118650001401141650002001155650002001175653001501195700001501210700001501225773008301240852000901323930003301332945001301365946001101378655001201389IND2062240420221119203751.0980304e199610  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206224042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChong, L.V.10aExothermic reactivities of skin and whole milk powders as measured using a novel procedure  ap. 185-196.  a2019-12-05  aThe activation energies of a whole and a skim milk powder were determined sing an experimental technique devised from the transient model of self-heating proposed in a recent paper.

The second mechanism in the temperature range of 145-165 degrees C had an activation energy of 74.7 kJ/mol which was within the literature values for oxidation. The activation energy of skim milk powder was found to be 97.1 kJ/mol. Comparison of results from the current study was made with literature.

The consistency coefficient of wheat starch and wheat meal decreased with increase in moisture content from 21% to 28% (wet weight basis) and barrel temperature from 100 degrees C to 125 degrees C and with the addition of WGO to 8%. The flow behaviour index of wheat starch and wheat meal generally increased with this increase in extrusion moisture content and temperature and with the addition of WGO. Wheat starch showed the highest consistency coefficient and oat flour showed the lowest under identical set extrusion conditions of these temperatures and moistures. Both power law indices for oat flour showed a less well defined change for the same range of moisture and temperature. The effect of WGO addition to wheat starch or meal to the 8% level was to reduce their viscosities towards the value observed for oat flour. The power law indices varied with die diameter indicating possible wall slip. 3afood processing quality 3adiameter 3awheat meal 3aoats 3aviscosity 3astarch 3awheat 3aflow 3aflour 3awater content 3aextrusion 3atemperature 3aextruded foods 3awheat germ oil 0aconsistency 0adies 0ashear1 aSmith, A.C.0 tJournal of food engineering.g1999 Feb., v. 39, no. 2 p.203-209x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a19991003b19991007c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02937naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001900180245012100199300001800320500001500338520079800353650003301151650001501184650001501199650001401214650001901228650002301247650002201270650002501292650001701317650001101334650002601345650007401371650002601445650002301471650007701494650004001571650003101611650008001642650004401722650002401766650004501790650003901835650004501874650002801919653003201947653003501979653002302014653001302037700002602050700001802076700001302094700001702107773007302124852000902197930003302206945002502239946001102264655001202275IND4363256020221119203805.0040707e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436325602DNAL7 a151840142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The excretory duct is entirely lined with microvilli, which are separated from the lumen by a modified layer of thin cuticle. 3aanimal glands 3aCrustacea 3aultrastructure 3aantennae 3aexcretion 2aAnimals 2aCrustaceaxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 0aanimal anatomy 0aantennal glands 0aanimal organs 0aDerocheilocaris typica1 aElofsson, R.0 tArthropod structure & development.g2007 June, v. 36, no. 2 p.171-181dElsevier Science Ltd.x1467-80397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.asd.2007.01.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20070628b20070702c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/06/28  aNon-US 7aarticle01994naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002000139245009600159300001800255520093000273650002101203650001601224650002301240650000901263650002601272650001101298650001001309650001501319650001501334650001201349650001301361650001801374650001701392700002301409700002001432773010501452856004201557852000901599655001201608IND4529749820221119204001.0141110e200209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND452974982DNAL7 a10.13031/2013.110732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTarboton, K.

Output was found insensitive to reductions in minimum soil water suction head (h(d)) and distal boundaries located 1000 m away from the domain of interest, and was found to be sensitive to values of sorption coefficient (Kd), plant water uptake parameters, irrigation schedules, and soil type. Finally, application of a method to separate evapotranspiration into evaporation and transpiration by deriving the ground shading parameters from crop coefficients was demonstrated. The results suggest that the modified SWMS_2D model can be used for irrigation and drainage management. 3acrop coefficient 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3ahead 3airrigation scheduling 3amodels 3ashade 3asoil types 3asoil water 3asolutes 3asorption 3atranspiration 3awater uptake1 aRaghuwanshi, N.

Here, the pattern of spread of Pseudacteon tricuspis Borgmeier (Diptera: Phoridae), a parasitoid of the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta Buren; Hymenoptera: Formicidae), was monitored at two widely separated release sites in Louisiana, USA. At both sites, P. tricuspis range expansion (measured as the mean radius of the range from four cardinal directions) was accelerating during the first four years post-release. This pattern contrasts with a linear pattern expected with simple diffusion. This suggests that population spread involved both a neighborhood diffusion and long-distance dispersal component. This is known as stratified or jump dispersal. Annual rates of spread were low in the first two years post-release (possibly owing to an Allee effect), increased rapidly in years 3-4, and slowed down or leveled off by years 5-6. Annual spread rates reached a peak of 15-25 km/yr, with the northward spread being about 40% greater than the spread in the other cardinal directions. High rates of spread in the latter years and directional bias in the spread of P. tricuspis may have been driven by prevailing winds and two northward-moving hurricanes. Spread of introduced species offers insight into factors affecting spread that is more difficult to evaluate for native species. 3aPseudacteon tricuspis 3aSolenopsis invicta 3afire ants 3aparasitoids 3abiological control agents 3aintroduced species 3apopulation distribution 3ageographical distribution 3adispersal behavior 3amathematical models 3aLouisiana 0along-distance dispersal 0astratified dispersal 0arange expansion1 aJohnson, S.J.1 aCronin, J.T.0 tBiological control.g2007 July, v. 42, no. 1 p.97-104dAcademic Pressx1049-96447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2007.03.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20070702b20070802c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/07/02  aOther US 7aarticle03318naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002000139245012500159300001800284520220400302650001202506650000902518650001202527650001102539650001402550650001902564650000902583650001102592650001902603650000902622650002002631650002002651650001202671650001502683650001802698700001802716700001802734773010502752856004202857852000902899655001202908IND4529749620221119204023.0141110e200209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND452974962DNAL7 a10.13031/2013.110712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlanagan, D.

Natural Rainfall Conditions  ap. 1339-1351.  aSoil loss from embankments at highway construction sites, sanitary landfills, and elsewhere can be extremely large due to the loosened state of the soil and very steep slope gradients (typically 2:1 to 3:1). Soil amendments have the potential to protect the soil during critical periods of vegetation establishment, thus reducing onâsite damages and costs as well as reducing offâsite impacts on water quality. In Part I of this study, results from a rainfall simulator experiment showed that use of an anionic polyacrylamide (PAM) could significantly reduce runoff and soil loss under the extreme condition of a large rainfall event occurring immediately after PAM application. In this part of the study, the same soil amendment treatments were tested in field situations on steep slopes under natural rainfall, to determine PAM effectiveness for typical constructed embankment conditions. One experiment was conducted on a highway cutslope on a clay loam subsoil placed at a 35% slope. The second experiment was in a surface sanitary landfill on a filled silt loam topsoil placed at a 45% slope, typical of a landfill cap. The soil amendment treatments used were an untreated control, an application of 80 kg haâ1 anionic polyacrylamide (PAM) as a liquid spray, and 80 kg haâ1 PAM applied as a liquid spray combined with a dry granular application of 5 Mg haâ1 of gypsum. A barrel collection system was used to measure total runoff volume and sediment loss. Total soil loss over all events at the two experiment sites for plots treated with PAM was reduced in the range of 40% to 54%, compared to the control. The addition of gypsum had a significant effect on runoff volume only on the silt loam soil, possibly due to higher rainfall at that site and/or to the presence of substantial amounts of calcium in the clay loam subsoil at the other location. PAM and PAM with gypsum increased grass establishment and growth on treated plots compared to the control. These results indicate that the use of anionic polyacrylamide (with or without gypsum) can provide substantial benefits in reducing runoff and soil loss, and enhancing vegetation growth on very steep embankments. 3acalcium 3aclay 3agrasses 3agypsum 3alandfills 3apolyacrylamide 3arain 3arunoff 3asediment yield 3asilt 3asilt loam soils 3asoil amendments 3atopsoil 3avegetation 3awater quality1 aChaudhari, K.1 aNorton, L.

A wetland was constructed at the outlet of a subsurfaceâdrained agricultural field in a cornâsoybean rotation. Hydrology data from the wetland inlet and outlet, including precipitation and evapotranspiration data, were used to develop a water budget for the system. Water quality data were collected from the wetland inlet, outlet, and the pond section of the wetland and analyzed for nitrateânitrogen (NO 3âN), orthophosphate (PO 4âP), and nine common Midwestern herbicides: trifluralin, atrazine, alachlor, metolachlor, ethalfluralin, butylate, clomazone, cyanazine, and pendimethalin. Constituent mass loads were calculated at the inlet and outlet, and both concentration and mass load data sets were statistically analyzed. Results indicated variable performance based primarily on seasonal processes and individual chemical constituent. Overall, NO 3âN mass load assimilation was approximately 174 kg (32.9%) over the course of the study, although assimilation rates were seasonally dependent. PO 4âP and herbicide concentration and mass load assimilation were not significant. 3aatrazine 3acyanazine 3apendimethalin 3aevapotranspiration 3asubsurface drainage 3atrifluralin 3awater quality 3aorthophosphates 3adata collection 3aclomazone 3abutylate 3aethalfluralin 3anitrate nitrogen 3ametolachlor 3aconstructed wetlands 3aalachlor 3adrainage water 3aIllinois 0awater balance1 aMitchell, J.

M.10aPeak Flow Estimates for Coastal Plain Watersheds  ap. 1319-1326.  aAn empirical equation based on storm data from the midwestern U.S. has been used in a number of water resource and water quality models for estimating peak flows for storm events on ungaged watersheds. Limited testing of the equation has shown a tendency to overpredict storm peaks in regions of low topographic relief. The objective of this study was to test the Smith and Williams equation and develop improved methods for estimating peak flows from ungaged watersheds in the southeastern U.S. Coastal Plain, a region characterized by lowâgradient drainage networks and extensive riparian storage. The equation was evaluated on 58 storm events from seven experimental watersheds. Results indicate that the Smith and Williams equation significantly overpredicts peak flows in the Coastal Plain region, with an average error in peak estimation of over 250%. Regional peak flow equations were developed using stepwise linear regression analyses of logâtransformed storm peak flows and watershed and storm event characteristics. These equations, which relate storm peaks to drainage area, runoff amount, and a drainage network parameter, explained up to 94% of the variability in measured peaks from Coastal Plain watersheds. The Coastal Plain peak flow equations provide improved algorithms for estimating storm peaks from ungaged watersheds in the region. 3aalgorithms 3acoastal plains 3adrainage 3aequations 3ahydrologic models 3alinear models 3aregression analysis 3arunoff 3astorms 3awatersheds 3aMidwestern United States 3aSoutheastern United States0 tTRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE ONLINE.g2002 , v. 45, no. 5 p.1319-1326wJournal:jnl44720x0001-23517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13031/2013.11069  aDNAL 7aarticle02273naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245010500181300001600286500002400302520096800326650002201294650001701316650001301333650000901346650001901355650000701374650001201381650002301393650002501416650001601441650000901457650002501466700001401491700002401505700002601529700001901555700002001574700002901594773011001623852000901733856008501742655001201827IND4459667320221119204209.0110706s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445966732DNAL7 a214110302pmid7 a10.1017/S00220299110000702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZisu, Bogdan10aEffect of ultrasound on the physical and functional properties of reconstituted whey protein powders  ap. 226-232.  aIncludes references  aAqueous solutions of reconstituted whey protein- concentrate (WPC) & isolate (WPI) powders were sonicated at 20 kHz in a batch process for 1–60 min. Sonication at 20 kHz increased the clarity of WPC solutions largely due to the reduction in the size of the suspended insoluble aggregates. The gel strength of these solutions when heated at 80°C for 20 min also increased with sonication, while gelation time and gel syneresis were reduced. These improvements in gel strength were observed across a range of initial pH values, suggesting that the mechanism for gel promotion is different from the well known effects of pH. Examining the microstructure of the whey protein gels indicated a compact network of densely packed whey protein aggregates arising from ultrasound treatment. Comparable changes were not observed with whey protein isolate solutions, which may reflect the absence of larger aggregates in the initial solution or differences in composition. 3aaqueous solutions 3agel strength 3agelation 3agels 3amicrostructure 3apH 3apowders 3aprotein aggregates 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 3awhey 3awhey protein isolate1 aLee, Judy1 aChandrapala, Jayani1 aBhaskaracharya, Raman1 aPalmer, Martin1 aKentish, Sandra1 aAshokkumar, Muthupandian0 tJournal of dairy research.g2011 May, v. 78, no. 2 p.226-232dCambridge University Pressx0022-02997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299110000703Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01453naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245013200132300001800264500002800282520064800310650002600958650001500984650001300999650001601012650002601028700001701054773008401071852000901155946001101164655001201175IND4413695020221119204127.0081212s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441369502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUenaka, Hidetoshi10aPhototropin-Dependent Weak and Strong Light Responses in the Determination of Branch Position in the Moss Physcomitrella patens  ap. 1907-1910.  aPublisher supplied data  aBranch position in the moss Physcomitrella patens is regulated by blue light. In this study, fluence rate dependency of branch position determination was investigated by partial cell irradiation with a microbeam. With a 30 Wm⁻² or lower fluence rate, branches formed at the microbeam area, but formed outside the microbeam when the fluence rate was raised to greater-than-or-equal200 Wm⁻². Thus, both weak and strong light responses influence the determination of branch position. Further, light sensitivity of both responses was reduced in phototropin knock-out lines, revealing an involvement of phototropin as the blue light receptor. 3aPhyscomitrella patens 3ablue light 3abranches 3airradiation 3amosses and liverworts1 aKadota, Akeo0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2008 Dec., v. 49, no. 12 p.1907-1910x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  aNon-US 7aarticle02372naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001800169245017900187300001800366500002400384520090600408650001801314650001501332650001201347650002201359650001801381650003001399650001501429650002301444650004601467650004501513650002601558650003101584650001301615650003501628650002101663650001401684650001601698650001701714650002301731773009801754852000901852856005301861655001201914IND4430937620221119202452.0100108e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443093762DNAL7 a199694512pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2009.11.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shengfang10aRemoval of crystal violet from aqueous solution by sorption into semi-interpenetrated networks hydrogels constituted of poly(acrylic acid-acrylamide-methacrylate) and amylose  ap. 2197-2202.  aIncludes references  aThe dynamic remove of Crystal Violet (CV) by Semi-IPN hydrogels constituted of poly(acrylic acid-acrylamide-methacrylate) and amylose was studied. Adsorption capacity, kinetic and isotherm studies of CV onto hydrogels have been evaluated. It was found that the sorption process agreed very well with the Langmuir model and the adsorption of CV depended on the length of the side chain, amylose content and pH of the solution. For three types of hydrogels, n1-1, n2-1 and n4-1, the equilibrated amounts of CV adsorbed on the hydrogels decreased in the following order: n4-1 (28.6mg/g)> n2-1 (25.0mg/g)> n1-1 (20.0mg/g). Increasing the amylose content led to decrease the equilibrated amounts of CV adsorbed on the hydrogels. Moreover, adsorption kinetic studies showed that the adsorption followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, indicating that the chemical adsorption was the rate-limiting step. 3aViola odorata 3aadsorption 3aamylose 3aaqueous solutions 3ahydrocolloids 2aAcrylic Resinsxchemistry 2aAdsorption 2aAmylosexchemistry 2aColoring Agentsxisolation & purification 2aGentian Violetxisolation & purification 2aHydrogelsxchemistry. 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aModels, Chemical 2aSolutions 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 2aWater Purification0 tBioresource technology.g2010 Apr., v. 101, no. 7 p.2197-2202dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.11.044 7aarticle02116naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002400181245019200205300001800397500002400415506007600439520062100515506003701136650002701173650001601200650001901216650004401235650001801279700001801297700001801315700001701333700001901350700001401369700001701383700001901400700001701419700002001436773013701456852000901593856008001602655001201682IND4407769020221207093914.0080712e20080715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440776902DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02041-072doi7 aPMC24931652pmcid7 a185029232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMastronicolis, S.K.10aCoordinated Regulation of Cold-Induced Changes in Fatty Acids with Cardiolipin and Phosphatidylglycerol Composition among Phospholipid Species for the Food Pathogen Listeria monocytogenes  ap. 4543-4549.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe present here the structural identification of four phospholipid (Phl) classes in Listeria monocytogenes, the fatty acid (FA) composition for each individual Phl species, and a description of cold-induced FA changes.

  1 aSchroder, G.10aFlavonoid methylation: a novel 4'-O-methyltransferase from Catharanthus roseus, and evidence that partially methylated flavanones are substrates of four different flavonoid dioxygenases  ap. 1085-1094.  a2019-12-05  aCatharanthus roseus (Madagascar periwinkle) flavonoids have a simple methylation pattern. Characteristic are B-ring 5' and 3' methylations and a methylation in the position 7 of the A-ring. The first two can be explained by a previously identified unusual O-methyltransferase (CrOMT2) that performs two sequential methylations. We used a homology based RT-PCR strategy to search for cDNAs encoding the enzyme for the A-ring 7 position. Full-length cDNAs for three proteins were characterized (CrOMT5, CrOMT6, CrOMT7). The deduced polypeptides shared 59-66% identity among each other, with CrOMT2, and with CrOMT4 (a previously characterized protein of unknown function). The five proteins formed a cluster separate from all other OMTs in a relationship tree. Analysis of the genes showed that all C. roseus OMTs had a single intron in a conserved position, and a survey of OMT genes in other plants revealed that this intron was highly conserved in evolution. The three cDNAs were cloned for expression of His-tagged recombinant proteins. CrOMT5 was insoluble, but CrOMT6 and CrOMT7 could be purified by affinity chromatography. CrOMT7 was inactive with all compounds tested. The only substrates found for CrOMT6 were 3'-O-methyl-eriodictyol (homoeriodictyol) and the corresponding flavones and flavonols. The mass spectrometric analysis showed that the enzyme was not the expected 7OMT, but a B-ring 4'OMT. OMTs with this specificity had not been described before, and 3',4'-dimethylated flavonoids had not been found so far in C. roseus, but they are well-known from other plants. The identification of this enzyme activity raised the question whether methylation could be a part of the mechanisms channeling flavonoid biosynthesis. We investigated four purified recombinant 2-oxoglutarate-dependent flavonoid dioxygenases: flavanone 3beta-hydroxylase, flavone synthase, flavonol synthase, and anthocyanidin synthase. 3'-O-Methyl-eriodictyol was a substrate for all four enzymes. The activities were only slightly lower than with the standard substrate naringenin, and in some cases much higher than with eriodictyol. Methylation in the A-ring, however, strongly reduced or abolished the activities with all four enzymes. The results suggested that B-ring 3' methylation is no hindrance for flavonoid dioxygenases. These results characterized a new type of flavonoid O-methyltransferase, and also provided new insights into the catalytic capacities of key dioxygenases in flavonoid biosynthesis. 3asequence analysis 3aCatharanthus roseus 3acomplementary DNA 3amethylation 3aoxygenases 3arecombinant proteins 3aconserved sequences 3aenzyme substrates 3aintrons 3amethyltransferases 3achemical structure 3aflavanones 3aplant proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCatharanthusxenzymology 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aFlavanonesxmetabolism 2aFlavonoidsxmetabolism 2aIntronsxgenetics 2aIsoenzymes 2aKetoglutaric Acidsxmetabolism 2aMethylation 2aMethyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxygenasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSubstrate Specificity 0aflavonoid dioxygenases 0aflavonoids1 aWehinger, E.1 aLukacin, R.1 aWellmann, F.1 aSeefelder, W.1 aSchwab, W.1 aSchröder, J.0 tPhytochemistry.g2004 Apr., v. 65, no. 8 p.1085-1094x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a20040525b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2004/05/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02850naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001600156245009700172300002000269500002400289520102300313650001301336650001401349650002001363650001401383650001901397650002101416650001701437650001001454650001001464650001101474650001801485650001701503650001401520650002201534650001501556650002001571650002601591650001201617650002801629650004101657650002701698650001101725650001601736650002201752650004801774650003501822650004701857700001801904700001901922700002001941700001901961700002201980700001702002773011902019852000902138856007702147655001202224IND4459681120221119202512.0110707s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445968112DNAL7 a214172592pmid7 a10.1021/jf200767q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yanshen10aT-2 Toxin, a Trichothecene Mycotoxin: Review of Toxicity, Metabolism, and Analytical Methods  ap. 3441–3453.  aIncludes references  aThis review focuses on the toxicity and metabolism of T-2 toxin and analytical methods used for the determination of T-2 toxin. Among the naturally occurring trichothecenes in food and feed, T-2 toxin is a cytotoxic fungal secondary metabolite produced by various species of Fusarium. Following ingestion, T-2 toxin causes acute and chronic toxicity and induces apoptosis in the immune system and fetal tissues. T-2 toxin is usually metabolized and eliminated after ingestion, yielding more than 20 metabolites. Consequently, there is a possibility of human consumption of animal products contaminated with T-2 toxin and its metabolites. Several methods for the determination of T-2 toxin based on traditional chromatographic, immunoassay, or mass spectroscopy techniques are described. This review will contribute to a better understanding of T-2 toxin exposure in animals and humans and T-2 toxin metabolism, toxicity, and analytical methods, which may be useful in risk assessment and control of T-2 toxin exposure. 3aFusarium 3aT-2 toxin 3aanimal products 3aapoptosis 3achromatography 3achronic toxicity 3acytotoxicity 3afoods 3afungi 3ahumans 3aimmune system 3aimmunoassays 3aingestion 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolism 3arisk assessment 3asecondary metabolites 2aAnimals 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aEnvironmental Exposure 2aHumans 2aImmunoassay 2aMass Spectrometry 2aMycotoxinsxanalysisxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aSpectrophotometry, Ultraviolet 2aT-2 Toxinxanalysisxmetabolismxtoxicity.1 aWang, Zhanhui1 aBeier, Ross C.1 aShen, Jianzhong1 aSmet, David de1 aDe Saeger, Sarah.1 aZhang, Suxia0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Apr. 27, v. 59, no. 8 p.3441–3453-3441–3453x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf200767q3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02977naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003400147245013300181300001800314520179000332650002102122650002002143650001202163650002502175650001002200650002002210650001302230650002402243650001402267650001702281650001302298700001702311700001802328700002602346773017402372856004802546852000902594655001202603IND60585724120221119202443.0171114e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058572412DNAL7 a10.2460/javma.251.10.11882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhitehouse-Tedd, Katherine M.10aSuspected adverse reactions to oral administration of a praziquantel-pyrantel combination in captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus)  ap. 1188-1195.  aOBJECTIVE To characterize adverse reactions to oral administration of a combination of praziquantel and pyrantel embonate or pyrantel pamoate, with or without oxantel embonate, in captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). DESIGN Retrospective case series and case-control study. ANIMALS 16 captive cheetahs with signs of adverse reaction to oral administration of praziquantel and pyrantel, with or without oxantel embonate (affected group), and 27 cheetahs without such reactions (unaffected group), all from 3 independent facilities. PROCEDURES Medical records and postmortem findings for affected cheetahs were reviewed and compared with those of unaffected animals. Anthelmintic doses administered, age, and sex of cheetahs were compared between groups. RESULTS 3 reactions in affected cheetahs were fatal, whereas the remainder ranged from mild to severe. Postmortem examination failed to reveal any disease processes or conditions to explain the deaths. No differences in anthelmintic dose were identified between affected and unaffected cheetahs for all facilities combined, and no correlation existed between dose and reaction severity. No association with sex was detected, but affected cheetahs were significantly younger than unaffected cheetahs. This difference was not significant after controlling for facility. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Cheetahs were concluded to have had an adverse reaction to the praziquantel-pyrantel combination because of temporal proximity of onset of clinical signs to dose administration, similarity of signs to those reported for toxicosis in other species for these drugs, and a lack of other disease process or environmental explanatory factors. A highly cautious approach to the use of this drug combination is recommended for cheetahs. 3aAcinonyx jubatus 3aadverse effects 3aanimals 3acase-control studies 3adrugs 3amedical records 3anecropsy 3aoral administration 3apoisoning 3apraziquantel 3apyrantel1 aSmith, Liesl1 aBudd, Jane A.1 aLloyd, Christopher G.0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 251, no. 10 p.1188-1195dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1913x0003-14887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/javma.251.10.1188  aDNAL 7aarticle03666naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001400146245024400160300001800404500002400422520201700446650001402463650001602477650002102493650002402514650002202538650003402560650003702594650002402631650002002655650002102675650002102696650003102717650001802748653003502766653002002801700001402821700001402835700001502849773016302864852000903027856007703036930003303113945002503146946001303171655001203184IND4392711920221119202544.0070628e20070627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439271192DNAL7 a10.1021/jf070316r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT3001 aPan, M.H.10aTea Polyphenol (-)-Epigallocatechin 3-Gallate Suppresses Heregulin-1-Induced Fatty Acid Synthase Expression in Human Breast Cancer Cells by Inhibiting Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/Akt and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Cascade Signaling  ap. 5030-5037.  aIncludes references  aTumor-associated fatty acid synthase (FAS) is implicated in tumorigenesis and connected to HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) by systemic analyses. Suppression of FAS in cancer cells may lead to growth inhibition and cell apoptosis. Our previous study demonstrated that (-)-epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG), the green tea catechin, could down-regulate FAS expression by suppressing EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) signaling and downstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt activation in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Herein, we examined the effects of EGCG on FAS expression modulated by another member of the erbB family, that is, HER2 or HER3. We identified that heregulin-β1 (HRG-β1), a HER3 ligand, stimulated dose-dependent FAS expression in breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and AU565, but not MDA-MB-453. The time-dependent increase in FAS expression after HRG-β1 stimulation was also observed in MCF-7 cells, and this up-regulation was de novo RNA synthesis dependent. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with EGCG markedly inhibited HRG-β1-dependent induction of mRNA and protein of FAS. EGCG also decreased the phosphorylation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 that were demonstrated as selected downstream HRG-β1-responsive kinases required for FAS expression using dominant-negative Akt, PI3K inhibitors (LY294002 and wortmannin), or MEK inhibitor (PD98059). FAS induction by HRG-β1 was also blocked by AG825, a selective HER2 inhibitor, and by genistein, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, indicating the formation of a heterodimer between HER2 and HER3, and their tyrosine kinase activities are essential for HRG-β1-mediated elevation of FAS. Additionally, growth inhibition of HRG-β1-treated cells was parallel to suppression of FAS by EGCG. Taken together, these findings extend our previous study to indicate that EGCG may be useful in the chemoprevention of breast carcinoma in which FAS overexpression results from HER2 or/and HER3 signaling. 3agreen tea 3apolyphenols 3aepigallocatechin 3asignal transduction 3aenzyme inhibition 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3afatty-acid synthase 3aenzyme activity 3abreast neoplasms 3ahuman cell lines 3agene expression regulation 3amessenger RNA 0a(-)-epigallocatechin 3-gallate 0aheregulin-beta11 aLin, C.C.1 aLin, J.K.1 aChen, W.J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 June 27, v. 55, no. 13 p.5030-5037dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf070316r3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/04/21  aOther US 7aarticle02866naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001300180245006700193300001800260500001500278520071600293650002301009650002201032650001801054650001901072650002101091650001901112650001601131650001901147650003701166650000901203650001501212650001201227650002701239650001101266650006701277650002401344650003401368650002401402650003701426650006601463650007401529650003301603650000901636650002501645650002301670650003801693650002501731651001701756653001201773653002101785653001401806653002301820700001601843700002001859700001801879700001601897700001601913700002201929700001701951773007401968852000902042930003302051945002502084946001102109655001202120IND4362632720221119202348.0040521e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436263272DNAL7 a151106922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The major constituent was identified as Z-venusol, a phenylpropanoid glucoside. Its structure was verified by X-ray diffraction. Tests on isolated uterine smooth muscle from rats showed that the whole extract stimulated a direct contractile response and induced a state of continuous contractility of the uterus once all additives had been removed from the organ bath. By contrast, venusol did not trigger the direct contractile response but induced the state of continuous contractility once the organ bath was flushed. 3amuscle contraction 3aX-ray diffraction 3asmooth muscle 3aphytochemicals 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3aGunneraceae 3apropionic acid 3astructure-activity relationships 3arats 3aglycosides 2aAnimals 2aCrystallography, X-Ray 2aFemale 2aGlycosidesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aIleumxdrug effects 2aMedicine, African Traditional 2aMolecular Structure 2aMuscle Contractionxdrug effects 2aOxytocicsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aPhenylpropionatesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aPlants, Medicinalxchemistry 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aRhizomexchemistry 2aUterine Contractionxdrug effects 2aUterusxdrug effects 3aSouth Africa 0avenusol 0aGunnera perpensa 0aisolation 0achemical structure1 aPeter, X.K.1 aMackenzie, R.M.1 aKatsoulis, L.1 aGehring, R.1 aMunro, O.Q.1 aVan Heerden, F.R.1 aDrewes, S.E.0 tPhytochemistry.g2004 Apr., v. 65, no. 8 p.1117-1121x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a20040525b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2004/05/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03463naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100002300182245006100205300001300266500002400279506007600303520144300379506003701822650001601859650002301875650001001898650001501908650001801923650002001941650002201961650003501983650001302018650003202031650003302063650001702096650002702113650002202140650001502162650004502177650004602222650003102268650002702299650002302326700002402349700001702373700002002390700002302410700002302433700002002456700001702476700002202493700002002515700002202535700003302557700002202590773011102612852000902723856008102732655001202813IND4442022520221207082806.0100903e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444202252DNAL7 a206568992pmid7 aPMC29381622pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.110.1589492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeverin, Andrew J.13aAn Integrative Approach to Genomic Introgression Mapping  ap. 3-12.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNear-isogenic lines (NILs) are valuable genetic resources for many crop species, including soybean (Glycine max). The development of new molecular platforms promises to accelerate the mapping of genetic introgressions in these materials. Here, we compare some existing and emerging methodologies for genetic introgression mapping: single-feature polymorphism analysis, Illumina GoldenGate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, and de novo SNP discovery via RNA-Seq analysis of next-generation sequence data. We used these methods to map the introgressed regions in an iron-inefficient soybean NIL and found that the three mapping approaches are complementary when utilized in combination. The comparative RNA-Seq approach offers several additional advantages, including the greatest mapping resolution, marker depth, and de novo marker utility for downstream fine-mapping analysis. We applied the comparative RNA-Seq method to map genetic introgressions in an additional pair of NILs exhibiting differential seed protein content. Furthermore, we attempted to optimize the comparative RNA-Seq approach by assessing the impact of sequence depth, SNP identification methodology, and post hoc analyses on SNP discovery rates. We conclude that the comparative RNA-Seq approach can be optimized with sufficient sampling and by utilizing a post hoc correction accounting for gene density variation that controls for false discoveries.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGlycine max 3achromosome mapping 3agenes 3agenotyping 3aintrogression 3aprotein content 3asequence analysis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asoybeans 2aChromosome Mappingxmethods 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aGene Library 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aGenomicsxmethods 2aInbreeding 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis. 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotidexgenetics 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSequence Analysis, RNA 2aSoybeansxgenetics1 aPeiffer, Gregory A.1 aXu, Wayne W.1 aHyten, David L.1 aBucciarelli, Bruna1 aO'Rourke, Jamie A.1 aBolon, Yung-Tsi1 aGrant, David1 aFarmer, Andrew D.1 aMay, Gregory D.1 aVance, Carroll P.1 aShoemaker, R.

Their structures and constituents were identified by means of HR-MS, NMR and GC/MS analyses, respectively. Bioassays showed that both the flavone and cyclohexenone significantly inhibited the growth of weeds Echinochloa crus-galli, Cyperus difformis and Cyperus iris, and the spore germination of fungal pathogens Pyricularia oryzae and Rhizoctonia solani at all tested concentrations. Moreover, the combination of the inactive mixture of low polarity and the active flavone or cyclohexenone significantly enhanced the inhibitory activities on weed growth. In addition, the two compounds and the mixture of low polarity from the leaves of PI312777 did not inhibit the rice growth at the same concentrations. It was also established that both compounds could be released into the soil, and was especially induced by E. crus-galli. The results suggest that 5,7,4'-trihydroxy-3',5'-dimethoxyflavone and 3-isopropyl-5-acetoxycyclohexene-2-one-1 may act as allelochemicals participating in the defense of rice against weeds and pathogens. 3aCyperus difformis 3arice 3aweed control 3agrain crops 3aCyperus iria 3aallelochemicals 3aOryza sativa 3aflavones 3aEchinochloa crus-galli 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3aallelopathy 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aweeds 3aspectral analysis 3aMagnaporthe grisea 3acyclohexenes 3achemical structure 3aantifungal properties 2aAgriculture 2aCyclohexanonesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aFlavonoidsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aFungicides, Industrialxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aHerbicidesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aMagnaporthexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMolecular Structure 2aOryzaxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aPest Control, Biological 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aRhizoctoniaxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSpores, Fungalxdrug effectsxphysiology. 0ahydrocarbons1 aXu, X.1 aZhou, B.1 aHu, F.1 aZhang, C.1 aZhang, M.0 tPhytochemistry.g2004 Apr., v. 65, no. 8 p.1123-1128x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a20040525b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2004/05/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02679naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001400156245009100170300002000261500002400281500001500305520100800320650001301328650002001341650001201361650000801373650003001381650001301411650001401424650001001438650001801448650000901466650001001475650000901485650001101494650001601505650001901521650001501540650003501555650003501590650001801625650002501643650002701668650003801695650003001733653001601763653001601779700001701795700001401812700001401826700001501840700001601855773012001871852000901991856007702000655001202077IND4462717320221119202534.0120210s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446271732DNAL7 a216151182pmid7 a10.1021/jf200933b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wei10aSimultaneous Detection of Eight Food Allergens Using Optical Thin-Film Biosensor Chips  ap. 6889–6894.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aFood allergies are important food safety issues nowadays. To maintain the safety of people who experience allergic reactions, labeling is required in many countries and efficient and reliable detection methods are necessary. This paper reports a novel method for the rapid identification of food allergens through the use of a silicon-based optical thin-film biosensor chip with which color change results can be perceived by the naked eye without any extra equipment. The whole system can detect eight food allergens including soybean, wheat, peanut, cashew, shrimp, fish, beef, and chicken simultaneously. Sensitive and specific detection of the absolute detection limit of this method was 0.5 pg of cashew DNA, and the practical detection limit of 0.001%. The biosensor chip detection time was about 30 min after PCR amplification. The assay is proposed as a sensitive, specific, high-throughput, and ready-to-use analytical tool to detect the presence or confirm the absence of eight food allergens. 3achickens 3adetection limit 3apeanuts 3aDNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asoybeans 3aallergens 3awheat 3arapid methods 3abeef 3acolor 3afish 3ashrimp 3afood safety 3afood allergies 3abiosensors 2aAllergensxanalysisxgenetics. 2aBiosensing Techniquesxmethods 2aDNAxanalysis 2aDNA, Plantxanalysis 2aFood Analysisxmethods 2aFood Hypersensitivityximmunology 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aHan, Jianxun1 aWu, Yajun1 aYuan, Fei1 aChen, Ying1 aGe, Yiqiang0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 July 13, v. 59, no. 13 p.6889–6894-6889–6894x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf200933b3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02590naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100003200137245010900169300001600278500002400294520137200318650001401690650001401704650001301718650001701731650000901748650001801757650001101775650002301786650001101809650002301820650001601843650001901859700002301878700001901901700002101920700002301941773013001964852000902094856007702103655001202180IND4419670720221119202225.0090425s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441967072DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.21062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarmona Rodríguez, Manuel.10aPurification of glycerol/water solutions from biodiesel synthesis by ion exchange: sodium removal Part I  ap. 738-744.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: In this study, equilibrium and kinetic data of the ion exchange of sodium from glycerol-water mixtures on the strong acid resin Amberlite-252 were obtained. Basic parameters for the design of ion exchange units for the purification of the crude glycerol phase from biodiesel production have been determined.RESULTS: Equilibrium uptake of sodium ions with the strong acid ion exchanger Amberlite-252 was studied at three temperatures. The Langmuir equation and the mass action law model were used to fit the experimental equilibrium data. Equilibrium constants and thermodynamic parameters were obtained at each temperature. Kinetic experiments were carried out to evaluate the effective diffusion coefficients of sodium on the resin Amberlite-252 in glycerine-water media.CONCLUSIONS: Equilibrium results indicate that this process is favourable and also that its selectivity decreases with temperature increase from 303 to 333 K. Both models were able to fit the experimental equilibrium data. Kinetic experiments showed that the rate of mass transfer in this binary system is high. An Arrhenius type equation allowed the correlation of effective diffusion coefficients and temperature. The results indicate that the macroporous resin Amberlite-252 could be useful for removal of sodium ions from glycerine/water solutions with a high salt concentration. 3abiodiesel 3aequations 3aglycerol 3aion exchange 3aions 3amass transfer 3amodels 3asalt concentration 3asodium 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3athermodynamics1 aValverde, José L.1 aPérez, Angel.1 aWarchol, Jolanta1 aRodriguez, Juan F.0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2009 May, v. 84, no. 5 p.738-744dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0268-25757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.21063Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02620naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001600155245011900171300001800290500002400308500001500332520112000347650001601467650004401483650003701527650001201564650001901576650001101595650002201606650002201628650002401650650002601674653001701700653003101717653001101748700002201759700001701781700002001798773016301818852000901981856007701990930003302067945002502100946001302125655001202138IND4392708320221119202155.0070628e20070627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439270832DNAL7 a10.1021/jf070357n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ500 0aS2001 aYoung, J.C.10aIdentification of Synthetic Regioisomeric Lutein Esters and Their Quantification in a Commercial Lutein Supplement  ap. 4965-4972.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSynthetic mixtures of 24 mono- and diesters of the asymmetric hydroxylated carotenoid lutein with lauric, myristic, palmitic, and stearic acids were analyzed by liquid chromatography-ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy (LC-UV-vis) and characterized by LC-mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). These compounds were then used for identifying the composition of a commercial lutein supplement. This is the first report of chromatographic separation of mixed fatty acid lutein diesters. Preferential MS loss of fatty acids or water occurred initially at the 3'-hydroxy position in the epsilon-ionone ring and subsequently at the 3-hydroxy position in the β-ionone ring. This selective fragmentation leads to facile assignment of the specific fatty acids to the appropriate regioisomeric ionone ring. A commercial lutein supplement contained low levels of two pairs of regioisomeric monoesters and nearly equal levels of three homogeneous diesters and five pairs of mixed diesters. Palmitic acid was the predominant fatty acid, with lower amounts of myristic, stearic, and lauric acids. 3afatty acids 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3aisomers 3aTagetes erecta 3alutein 3afatty acid esters 3amass spectrometry 3adietary supplements 3aliquid chromatography 0aregioisomers 0afatty acid lutein diesters 0aesters1 aAbdel-Aal, E.S.M.1 aRabalski, I.1 aBlackwell, B.A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 June 27, v. 55, no. 13 p.4965-4972dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf070357n3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/04/21  aOther US 7aarticle02069naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245013600125300001400261500001500275520112700290650001701417650001301434650001701447650002901464650002301493650001101516650001501527653001901542653002601561773007801587852000901665930003301674945001301707946001101720655001201731IND2062773720221119202050.0980327s1996    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206277372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoukas, T.10aEthanol production from non-sterilized beet molasses by free and immobilized Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells using fed-batch culture  ap. 87-96.  a2019-12-05  aThe production of ethanol from non-sterilized beet molasses by free and immobilized S. cerevisiae cells in batch and fed-batch culture was investigated. Fed-batch culture proved to be a better fermentation system for the production of ethanol than batch culture. In fed-batch culture, both free and immobilized S. cerevisiae cells gave the same maximum ethanol concentration (53 g/liter at an initial sugar concentration of 250 g/liter and F=250 ml/h. In the free cells system, the maximum ethanol productivity (3.8 g/liter h) was obtained at a substrate concentration of 250 g/liter and F=500 ml/h with 30.6% ethanol yield and 81% sugars utilization. In the immobilized cells system, a maximum ethanol productivity of 3.5 g/liter h was achieved at an initial sugar concentration of 250 g/liter and F=500 ml/h with 31.2% ethanol yield and 73.3% sugars utilization. In repeated fed-batch culture, immobilized S. cerevisiae cells gave higher overall ethanol concentration compared to the free cells. In this case, the immobilized S. cerevisiae cells in Ca-alginate beads retained their ability to produce ethanol for 8 days. 3afermentation 3amolasses 3acell culture 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aethanol production 3ayields 3abeet sugar 0aimmobilization 0abiological production0 tJournal of food engineering.g1996, v. 27, no. 1 p.87-96x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03133naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001400155245022600169300001800395500002400413520156900437650001602006650002902022650001802051650004302069650002202112650002702134650001102161650001002172650001002182650002302192653001602215653001502231653001202246653003502258700001402293700001202307700001202319773016302331852000902494856007702503930003302580945002502613946001302638655001202651IND4392707620140724000000.0070628e20070627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439270762DNAL7 a10.1021/jf070144y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL810 0aQ2021 aZhang, Y.10aDevelopment of an Analytical Method for the Determination of β2-Agonist Residues in Animal Tissues by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography with On-line Electrogenerated [Cu(HIO6)2]5--Luminol Chemiluminescence Detection  ap. 4949-4956.  aIncludes references  aA novel method was developed for the simultaneous determination of β2-agonist residues such as terbutaline, salbutamol, and clenbuterol by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with chemiluminescence (CL) detection. The procedure was based on the enhancement effect of β2-agonists on the CL reaction between luminol and the complex of trivalent copper and periodate ([Cu(HIO6)2]5-), which was on-line electrogenerated by constant current electrolysis. The HPLC separation used a Nucleosil RP-C18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm i.d., 5 m; pore size, 100 Å) with a mobile phase consisting of 90% acetonitrile and 10% aqueous ammonium acetate (20 mmol L-1, pH 4.0) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min-1. The effects of several parameters on the HPLC resolution and CL emission were studied systematically. Liver samples were hydrolyzed with β-glucuronidase followed by a solid-phase extraction procedure using Waters OasisMCX cartridges. Under optimum conditions, the limits of detection at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 ranged from 0.007 to 0.01 ng g-1 and the limits of quantification at a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 ranged from 0.023 to 0.033 ng g-1 for three β2-agonists. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of intra- and interday precision were below 4.5%. The average recoveries for β2-agonists (spiked at the levels of 0.05-5.0 ng g-1) in pig liver ranged from 84 to 110%, and the RSDs of the quantitative results were from 1.6 to 7.2%. The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of β2-agonist residues in pig liver samples. 3aclenbuterol 3abeta-adrenergic agonists 3adrug residues 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3achemiluminescence 3asolid phase extraction 3acopper 3aliver 3aswine 3afood contamination 0aterbutaline 0asalbutamol 0aluminol 0atrivalent copper and periodate1 aZhang, Z.1 aSun, Y.1 aWei, Y.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 June 27, v. 55, no. 13 p.4949-4956dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf070144y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/04/21  aOther US 7aarticle01594naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245008100123300001600204520077500220650001000995650001901005650002501024650001901049650002201068650001401090650001001104700001501114773008501129852000901214930003301223945001301256946001101269655001201280IND2197290320221119202329.0990301e199806  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219729032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUtku, H.10aUse of statistical filters in the classification of wheats by image analysis  ap. 385-394.  aAn image processing software package was developed to classify wheat varieties. In processing digitized wheat, image spots and dust particles may significantly decrease the performance of an edge detection algorithm. The software employs the median filtering technique to remove such impurities and to smooth out the surface of wheat grains. It also employs the range-order filtering technique to detect grain boundaries. The extracted boundary is fitted to an ellipse and the feature parameters are determined. The features determined by the fitting procedure, as well as those determined from direct extraction, are used in the classification. The results showed that an overall 69% classification was achieved on a total of 31 bread wheat varieties used in this work. 3awheat 3aclassification 3astatistical analysis 3aimage analysis 3acomputer software 3acultivars 3aseeds1 aKoksel, H.0 tJournal of food engineering.g1998 June, v. 36, no. 4 p.385-394x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01683naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245004300127300001600170500001500186520074000201650001100941650001700952650001300969650001600982650002400998650001201022653001701034653001401051653001301065653002501078653001501103700001401118700001401132773008501146852000901231930003301240945001301273946001101286655001201297IND2197290820221119202339.0990301e199806  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219729082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaymundo, A.10aMethod to evaluate foaming performance  ap. 445-452.  a2019-12-05  aIn this work, a methodology to evaluate foaming capacity and stability is proposed.

The present study evaluated three methods for radio-tagging the cryptic, eel-like fish Gadopsis bispinosus, a species that inhabits interstitial spaces among cobbles and boulders in streams. The three methods were an externally attached radio-tag with a whip antenna, an internally implanted coil radio-tag (internal coil) and an internally implanted radio-tag with an externally exited whip antenna (internal-external). Successful radio-tagging was determined in aquaria trials based on a combination of four indicators: (1) survival; (2) retention of the radio-tag; (3) healing of the surgical incision; and (4) rapid resumption of feeding. Externally attached radio-tags were shed and proved to be unsuitable (100%). Three of nine individuals with internal-external tagging completed the study with regular feeding, healed incisions and retained radio-tags. Conversely, five of nine individuals with internal coils were successful. This included two of three individuals held in either a simple environment for 3 days or for the duration of the trial and one of three individuals held in a complex environment. Temporary confinement following implantation with coil radio-tags offers a viable means of radio-tagging G. bispinosus. Temporary confinement following radio-tagging may also be useful for reducing radio-tag rejection and mortality for other fish species with similar body morphs and habitat use (e.g. eel species and sculpin). 3aCottidae 3aaquariums 3aeel 3ahabitats 3amorphs 3amortality 3aradio frequency identification 3astreams 0ainterstices 0aradiotelemetry1 aEbner, Brendan C.1 aClear, Rhian C.0 tMarine & freshwater research.g2009, v. 60, no. 4 p.356-360dCSIRO Publishingx1323-16507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF081413Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02087naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001400146245005500160300001800215500001500233520056600248650001300814650002100827650001900848650002200867650001500889650001000904650002300914650002400937650005300961650002401014650004501038650002701083650003301110650004801143650003501191650002001226650002401246653001901270653002801289700001701317700001301334700001601347700001401363700001601377773007401393852000901467930003301476945002501509946001101534655001201545IND4363438420221119202214.0040716e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436343842DNAL7 a146300042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

However, the dissolution mechanism of a kaempferol nanoparticle formulation (KAEN) has not yet been elucidated. The aim of the present study was therefore to use a nanoparticle engineering process to resolve the dissolution problem. Our data indicated that KAEN effectively increased the dissolution percentage by particle size reduction, high encapsulation efficiency, amorphous transformation, and hydrogen-bond formation with excipients. In addition, we used several different antioxidant activity assays to evaluate KAE and KAEN. The data indicated that KAEN retained potent antioxidant activity after the nanoparticle engineering process and showed better antioxidant activity than KAE dissolved in water (P < 0.05). According to these findings, we concluded that KAEN could be a low-dose alternative to KAE in health food and future clinical research. 3aantioxidant activity 3aencapsulation 3aengineering 3ahealth foods 3ahydrogen bonding 3akaempferol 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 2aAntioxidantsxchemistry 2aChemistry, Pharmaceuticalxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aKaempferolsxchemistry 2aNanoparticlesxchemistry 2aNanotechnologyxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aParticle Size1 aYen, Feng-Lin1 aWu, Tzu-Hui1 aKo, Horng-Huey1 aLee, Chiang-Wen1 aTzeng, Wen-Sheng1 aLin, Chun-Ching0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 May 11, v. 59, no. 9 p.5073–5080-5073–5080x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf200354y3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01846naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245009400200300001800294500002400312506007600336520056600412506003700978650002301015650001001038650001301048650003001061650002201091650001101113651001801124700002201142700001701164700002001181700002301201773013501224852000901359856008001368655001201448IND4449855920221207093415.0110225e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444985592DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.01176-102doi7 aPMC30672952pmcid7 a211936712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTran, Quynh T.10aPlasmid-Mediated Quinolone Resistance in Pseudomonas putida Isolates from Imported Shrimp  ap. 1885-1887.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFourteen quinolone-resistant Pseudomonas putida isolates were recovered from imported frozen shrimp sold in the United States.

The date cultivars used were Khudary, Sufri, and Serri, and the date-water concentrates were 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 degrees Brix. The 20 and 30 degrees Brix concentrates exhibited Newtonian flow in the temperature range 25-85 degrees C while the other concentrates (40, 50, 60 and 70 degrees Brix) were well described by the simple power law model in the temperature range 25-95 degrees C and their flow was non-Newtonian exhibiting pseudoplastic behaviour. Temperature had a pronounced effect on consistency coefficient of samples at 40 degrees Brix concentrations from the three cultivars. The magnitude of the consistency coefficient decreased with increase in temperature. The Arrhenius model described the effect of temperature on the apparent viscosity with activation energies from 1.9 X 10(4) to 3.1 X 10(4) kJ kg-1 mol-1 at 50 s-1, from 1.9 X 10(4) to 3.2 X 10(4) kJ kg-1 mol-1 at 100 s-1, and from 1.9 X 10(4) to 3.3 X 10(4) kJ kg-1 mol-1 at 200 s-1.

Two expanded clay aggregates (Filtralite®MR3-8-FMR and Filtralite®NR3-8-FNR) and a fine gravel-FG were used as substrate for the constructed wetland units plus one unit with FMR was left as an unvegetated control. The systems were subject to three hydraulic loadings, 18, 8 and 6cmd⁻¹, and to periods of interruption in the feed. The relationship between the substrate, plant development and removal efficiency, especially of organic matter, was investigated. Organic loadings up to 1800kg BOD₅ ha⁻¹ d⁻¹ and 3849kg COD ha⁻¹ d⁻¹ were applied leading to mass removals of up to 652kg BOD₅ ha⁻¹ d⁻¹ and 1869kg COD ha⁻¹ d⁻¹, respectively. The three different substrates were adequate for the establishment of T. latifolia, although the clay aggregates allowed for higher plant propagation levels. The units with FNR and FMR achieved significantly higher COD and BOD₅ removal when compared to the FG and to the unplanted units. The systems proved to be tolerant to high organic loadings and to interruptions in feed suggesting this technology as a viable option for the biological treatment of tannery wastewater. 3aTypha latifolia 3abiological treatment 3achemical oxygen demand 3aclay 3aconstructed wetlands 3aorganic matter 3aplant development 3aplant propagation 3asubsurface flow 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awetland plants 2aAdsorption 2aIndustrial Waste 2aTanning 2aTyphaceaexgrowth & development 2aWater Pollutants1 aRangel, António O.S.S.1 aCastro, Paula M.L.0 tBioresource technology.g2008 Oct., v. 99, no. 15 p.6866-6877dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2008.01.043 7aarticle03568naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245010600193300001800299500002400317500001500341520154200356650004401898650002201942650001201964650001101976650001401987650001802001650001902019650001402038650001102052650001202063650001002075650001802085650002202103650003902125650001802164650001702182650001202199650002902211650001402240650004902254650002802303650002002331650004302351650001402394650003402408650003902442651001802481651001802499651001802517653001602535653001602551700002502567700002202592700001802614700002202632700001902654700003202673773011302705852000902818856005502827655001202882IND4425545720221119202251.0090905e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442554572DNAL7 a196247122pmid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01976.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoussel, Erwan G.10aArchaeal communities associated with shallow to deep subseafloor sediments of the New Caledonia Basin  ap. 2446-2462.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe distribution of the archaeal communities in deep subseafloor sediments [0-36 m below the seafloor (mbsf)] from the New Caledonia and Fairway Basins was investigated using DNA- and RNA-derived 16S rRNA clone libraries, functional genes and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). A new method, Co-Migration DGGE (CM-DGGE), was developed to access selectively the active archaeal diversity. Prokaryotic cell abundances at the open-ocean sites were on average ~3.5 times lower than at a site under terrestrial influence. The sediment surface archaeal community (0-1.5 mbsf) was characterized by active Marine Group 1 (MG-1) Archaea that co-occurred with ammonia monooxygenase gene (amoA) sequences affiliated to a group of uncultured sedimentary Crenarchaeota. However, the anoxic subsurface methane-poor sediments (below 1.5 mbsf) were dominated by less active archaeal communities, such as the Thermoplasmatales, Marine Benthic Group D and other lineages probably involved in the methane cycle (Methanosarcinales, ANME-2 and DSAG/MBG-B). Moreover, the archaeal diversity of some sediment layers was restricted to only one lineage (Uncultured Euryarchaeota, DHVE6, MBG-B, MG-1 and SAGMEG). Sequences forming two clusters within the Thermococcales order were also present in these cold subseafloor sediments, suggesting that these uncultured putative thermophilic archaeal communities might have originated from a different environment. This study shows a transition between surface and subsurface sediment archaeal communities. 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aprokaryotic cells 3aammonia 3abasins 3asediments 3aribosomal RNA 3aThermococcales 3alibraries 3aclones 3amethane 3agenes 3aCrenarchaeota 3aMethanosarcinales 2aArchaeaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aBase Sequence 2aBiodiversity 2aBiomass 2aElectrophoresisxmethods 2aGeography 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOceans and Seas 2aOxidoreductasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxanalysis 2aSeawaterxchemistryxmicrobiology. 3aNew Caledonia 0aNew Caledonia 0aPacific Ocean 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aSauvadet, Anne-Laure1 aChaduteau, Carine1 aFouquet, Yves1 aCharlou, Jean-Luc1 aPrieur, Daniel1 aCambon Bonavita, Marie-Anne0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2009 Sept., v. 11, no. 9 p.2446-2462dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01976.x 7aarticle02823naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001300161245011100174300001600285520146500301650002001766650001301786650001501799650001301814650001401827650001301841650001301854650001401867650002101881650002201902650002301924650001301947650002301960650001701983650002802000650002702028650001702055653001902072700002002091700001402111700001902125700001502144773006602159852000902225930003302234945002502267946001302292655001202305IND4380189820221119202234.0060512e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438018982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPare, K.10aNitrogen uptake and leaching under annual bluegrass ecotypes and bentgrass species: a lysimeter experiment  ap. 847-853.  aNitrate (NO3(-)) can leach from golf greens, potentially causing the degradation of surface and ground water quality. A greenhouse experiment was conducted with 11 annual bluegrass (Poa annua var. reptans Hausskn.) ecotypes from eastern Canada (Quebec and Ontario) and the USA, and three bentgrass (Agrostis spp.) species to compare N uptake and potential for N leaching. Two-month-old grasses were established for a 6-wk period in lysimeter columns simulating a golf-green profile. An unplanted root zone control was included. Water-soluble fertilizer was applied at 25 kg N ha(-1) (NH4NO3) every 14 d for 57 d. Leachate samples were collected every second day and analyzed for NO3-N and ammonium N (NH4-N) content. Dry weight and N concentration were determined on clippings, shoots, and roots. Ammonium N leaching was negligible for all grasses. Less NO3-N leaching losses occurred under bentgrasses (6-11% of applied N) than under annual bluegrasses (28-71% of applied N). Differences in NO3-N leaching were also found within annual bluegrasses; Quebec P. annua > Ontario P. annua > USA P. annua. Grasses with a greater aboveground biomass developed a larger and deeper root system and were associated with a greater N uptake (r = 0.94) and, therefore, a lower NO3-N leaching (r = -0.94). Breeding programs and management practices to improve turfgrass root development appear to be critical to reduce fertilizer N leaching under sand-based putting greens. 3anutrient uptake 3anitrogen 3alysimeters 3aecotypes 3aPoa annua 3aAgrostis 3aleaching 3aleachates 3alosses from soil 3agolf course soils 3adry matter content 3anitrates 3aammonium compounds 3aroot systems 3asoil-plant interactions 3asoil nutrient dynamics 3agolf courses 0aputting greens1 aChantigny, M.H.1 aCarey, K.1 aJohnston, W.J.1 aDionne, J.0 tCrop science.g2006 , v. 46, no. 2 p.847-853x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL  a20060726b20060804c00000000  aINDd1CTe2006/07/13  aOther US 7aarticle02733naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002600161245010900187300001600296520151000312650001301822650001901835650001201854650002801866650002401894650001701918650002201935650001201957650001901969650002801988650001102016650001202027650002202039650002102061651001202082700002002094700001502114773006602129852000902195930003302204945002502237946001302262655001202275IND4380189320221119202344.0060512e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438018932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Drought tolerance of several Aegilops species was evaluated, and the structure and extent of variation in quantitative attributes of those species when subjected to different degrees of water stress was evaluated. Twenty-one populations belonging to six species were collected: Ae. biuncialis Vis., Ae. cylindrica Host, Ae. geniculata Roth, Ae. markgrafii (Greuter) Hammer, Ae. triuncialis L., and Ae. vavilovii (Zhuk.) Chennav. Quantitative attributes, namely above-ground dry weight, plant height, tillers per plant, days to maturity, productive tillering, spike length, kernels per spike, seed number, seed weight, and yield, were evaluated at three levels of moisture stress. On the basis of changes in measured quantitative attributes under different levels of drought stress, Ae. geniculata and Ae. markgrafii were found to be the most drought tolerant species. Attributes accounting for most of the variation under different levels of water stress were total seed number, seed weight per spike, total number of tillers, and productive tillering capacity, although the extent of each attribute's variation depended on water stress level. Under severe water stress, the ability of plants to produce many fertile tillers with few large seeds seems to be an important adaptive mechanism which should be considered in evaluating plants for drought tolerance. 3aAegilops 3awild relatives 3agrasses 3aplant genetic resources 3aquantitative traits 3awater stress 3adrought tolerance 3adrought 3asemiarid zones 3adry matter accumulation 3aheight 3atillers 3aseed productivity 3aplant adaptation 3aLebanon1 aHajj-Hassan, N.1 aZurayk, R.0 tCrop science.g2006 , v. 46, no. 2 p.799-806x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL  a20060725b20060804c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/07/12  aOther US 7aarticle02839naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163072001700180100001600197245010400213300001800317500001500335520088500350650002501235650002601260650001401286650002301300650001901323650002101342650001901363650001401382650001801396650001201414650002601426650004401452650002401496650003201520650007101552650003301623650005101656650005101707651001301758651001301771653001501784653001201799653002501811653002701836653002301863653002801886700001601914700001801930700001401948700001901962700001201981700002001993773007402013852000902087930003302096945002502129946001102154655001202165IND4363368020221119202404.0040714e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436336802DNAL7 a145995252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The oils were obtained from the plants with 0.12, 0.13, 0.18, 0.6 and 0.1% yields (relatively to dried material weight) respectively. Analysis by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry identified mainly terpenoids, among which alpha-copaene, gamma-cadinene, delta-cadinene, alpha-cadinol, spathulenol and caryophyllene oxide were most commonly found. The five oils were active against Plasmodium falciparum in culture. The most effective was the oil of Hexalobus crispiflorus, with an IC50 of 2 microgram/ml. 3achemical composition 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aAntidesma 3aXylopia aethiopica 3aessential oils 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3aHexalobus 3aantimalarials 2aAnimals 2aAnnonaceaexchemistry 2aAntimalarialsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aChromatography, Gas 2aInhibitory Concentration 50 2aOils, Volatilexchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aPlants, Medicinalxchemistry 2aPlasmodium falciparumxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aTerpenesxchemistryxisolation & purification. 3aCameroon 0aCameroon 0aAnnonaceae 0aXylopia 0aAntidesma laciniatum 0aHexalobus crispiflorus 0aXylopia phloiodora 0aPachypodanthium confine1 aNgouana, V.1 aZollo, P.H.A.1 aMenut, C.1 aBessiere, J.M.1 aGut, J.1 aRosenthal, P.J.0 tPhytochemistry.g2003 Dec., v. 64, no. 7 p.1269-1275x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a20050705b20050802c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/04/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02612naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001500144245010300159300001600262520137500278650001701653650000901670650002801679650002201707650002001729650001101749650001101760650002501771650001601796650002201812650002101834650001401855650001001869650001701879650002101896651001001917700001401927700001401941700001601955700001301971773006601984852000902050930003302059945002502092946001302117655001202130IND4380188920221119202213.0060512e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438018892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLaza, M.R.10aIdentification of quantitative trait loci for delta 13C and productivity in irrigated lowland rice  ap. 763-773.  aStable carbon isotope ratio (delta13C) in plants has been suggested as a useful indicator for cumulative Ci/Ca signature in a leaf, water use efficiency, and crop productivity, and is known to have genotypic variation in rice (Oryza sativa L.). We conducted a field study to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for delta13C and other related leaf traits, such as leaf N, specific leaf area, and SPAD value, using recombinant inbred lines derived from an indica x japonica cross grown under flooded conditions. We also examined the genetic associations of delta13C with yield, yield components, and biomass productivity. Putative QTLs for delta13C were identified on chromosomes 2, 4, 8, 9, 11, and 12 across plant parts, stages, and years. Differential expression of QTL for delta13C among stages suggests that each QTL had different functions by stages. The QTLs for delta13C were associated with a few colocated QTLs for leaf traits indicating that their physiological and genetic associations with leaf traits may be complex. Values of delta13C at maturity were negatively correlated with harvest index and grain yield. However, genetic association of these traits could not be clarified due to the absence of co-located QTLs. Further examination would be useful to elucidate the physiological and morphological functions of QTLs for delta13C found in this study. 3aOryza sativa 3arice 3aquantitative trait loci 3airrigated farming 3astable isotopes 3acarbon 3aleaves 3awater use efficiency 3agrain yield 3agenetic variation 3anitrogen content 3aleaf area 3acolor 3ainbred lines 3ayield components 3aJapan1 aKondo, M.1 aIdeta, O.1 aBarlaan, E.1 aImbe, T.0 tCrop science.g2006 , v. 46, no. 2 p.763-773x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL  a20060726b20060804c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/07/12  aOther US 7aarticle02236naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002000148245016400168300001800332500002400350520111100374650002001485650002001505650001301525650004301538650001801581650003301599650000701632650002501639700001901664700001801683773010001701852000901801856008801810655001201898IND4419842420221119202303.0090501s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441984242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2009.03.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Qingxiang10aUltrasound-assisted ionic liquid dispersive liquid-phase micro-extraction: A novel approach for the sensitive determination of aromatic amines in water samples  ap. 4361-4365.  aIncludes references  aUltrasound-assisted ionic liquid dispersive liquid-phase micro-extraction was developed for the determination of four aromatic amines such as 2,4-dichloroaniline, 1-naphthylamine, 6-chloroanline and N,N-dimethylaniline. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with UV detector was used for the determination of aromatic amines. In the novel procedure, 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate [C₆MIM] [PF₆] was dispersed into the aqueous sample solution as fine droplets by ultrasonication, and which promoted the analytes more easily migrate into the ionic liquid phase. Variable affecting such as the volume of [C₆MIM] [PF₆], sample pH, ultrasonication time, extraction time, centrifuging time have been investigated in detail. The proposed method has been found to have excellent detection sensitivity with limits of detection (LOD, S/N=3) in the range of 0.17-0.49μgL⁻¹ and precisions in the range of 2.0-6.1% (RSDs, n =6). This method has been also successfully applied to analyze the real water samples and good spiked recoveries over the range of 92.2-119.3% were obtained. 3aaromatic amines 3adetection limit 3adroplets 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aionic liquids 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3apH 3aultrasonic treatment1 aZhang, Xiaoguo1 aXiao, Junping0 tJournal of chromatography.g2009 May 15, v. 1216, no. 20 p.4361-4365dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2009.03.0463Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02512naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001900148245021200167300001800379500002400397520127200421650001201693650001301705650001501718650004301733650001901776650001901795650001001814650000701824650001901831650001201850650001301862700001801875700001901893700001701912773010001929852000902029856008802038655001202126IND4419842320221119202408.0090501s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441984232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2009.03.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xiaojia10aSensitive determination of strongly polar aromatic amines in water samples by stir bar sorptive extraction based on poly(vinylimidazole-divinylbenzene) monolithic material and liquid chromatographic analysis  ap. 4354-4360.  aIncludes references  aA simple and sensitive method for the determination of polar aromatic amines (PAAs) was developed using stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) coupling to high-performance liquid chromatography. A hydrophilic poly(vinylimidazole-divinylbenzene) (VIDB) monolithic material was prepared and acted as SBSE coating. The influences of polymerization conditions for VIDB on the extraction efficiency were investigated using aniline and 2,4-dinitroaniline as detected solutes. To achieve optimum extraction performance for PAAs, several parameters including extraction and desorption time, desorption solvent, ionic strength and pH value of sample matrix were investigated. The results showed that under the optimized experimental conditions, the method showed good sensitivity and excellent recoveries, as well as advantages such as linearity, simplicity, low cost and high feasibility. The extraction performance of present method to the target compounds also compared with commercial SBSE which using polydimethylsiloxane as coating and other SBSE which based on monolithic materials. Finally, the proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of PAAs in lake and sea waters, and excellent recoveries of spiked target compounds in real samples were obtained. 3aaniline 3acoatings 3adesorption 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrophilicity 3aionic strength 3alakes 3apH 3apolymerization 3asolutes 3asolvents1 aQiu, Ningning1 aYuan, Dongxing1 aLin, Qingmei0 tJournal of chromatography.g2009 May 15, v. 1216, no. 20 p.4354-4360dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2009.03.0433Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03406naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245008900172300001600261500012700277520178700404650002502191650002502216650001802241650001302259650002002272650001002292650001402302650001302316650001102329650001002340650001402350650001502364650001302379650002002392650002302412650000702435650001402442650001202456650001002468650001602478650002302494650002502517651001002542700002702552700001302579700002102592700001402613700001602627773014502643856005502788852000902843655001202852IND60585302920180323000000.0171109e20170630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058530292DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1164.672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia, M.

In recent years, research in organic agriculture has given priority to issues such as increasing fruit production, resistance to pathogens and adverse temperatures, etc., achieving significant improvements in these points. However, now they are beginning to consider priority aspects as the organoleptic and nutritional quality. These values have been preserved in traditional cultivars, for this reason, the research takes a new approach to improving organoleptic and nutritional fruit. In this work, physico-chemical and nutritional quality of eight traditional cherry tomato landraces grown under protected organic conditions were analyzed in order to find cultivars with better characteristics. Statistically significant differences were obtained between the parameters studied for each of the varieties (yield, weight, size, color, firmness, titratable acidity, pH, total soluble solids, ascorbic acid, lycopene, total phenol content and antioxidant activity). It can be concluded that the cherry cultivars presented good taste characteristics, and a high content in some of the studied compounds, covering largely the nutritional recommendation. This study has allowed us to extend the limited supply of quality products and identify cultivars that can serve as a source of genes for the development of new tomato cultivars with higher organoleptic and nutritional qualities. According the results obtained in this work the Ch8 landrace was considered the best in basis to traits such as yield, fruit weight, firmness, compounds responsible to the flavor, lycopene content and ascorbic acid contents. 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3acherries 3acherry tomatoes 3acolor 3acultivars 3afirmness 3aflavor 3agenes 3alandraces 3alivelihood 3alycopene 3anutritive value 3aorganic production 3apH 3apathogens 3aphenols 3ataste 3atemperature 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 3aSpain1 aPiqueras-Aljarilla, E.1 aFont, A.1 aPascual-Asso, F.1 aGomez, P.1 aDel Rio, M.0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 June 30, , no. 1164 p.513-518dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1164.67  aDNAL 7aarticle01791naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245007300169300001600242500012700258520067700385650002501062650002201087650001701109650002301126650001201149650001901161650001901180650001701199651001001216700001801226773014501244856005501389852000901444655001201453IND60585302720221119202426.0171109e20170630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058530272DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1164.652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSayadi, S.10aShort food supply chains (SFSCs) in horticulture products from Spain  ap. 501-506.  aPaper presented at the III International Symposium on Organic Greenhouse Horticulture held April 11-14 2016, Izmir, Turkey  aA short marketing channel (SMS) is a supply chain consisting of a limited number of operators, committed to co-operation, local economic development and socio-economic relations between producers and consumers in the neighboring region.

PA-HC-FASI uses an appropriate positive pressure to counterbalance the electroosmotic flow in the capillary column during electrokinetic injection, while taking advantage of the field amplification in the sample matrix and the water of the “head column”. Accordingly, the analytes were stacked at the stationary boundary between water and background electrolyte. After 600s PA-HC-FASI, 4-fluoro-7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole as derivatization reagent was injected, followed by an electrokinetic step (5kV, 45s) to enhance the mixing efficiency of analytes and reagent plugs. Standing a specified time of 10min for derivatization reaction under 35°C, then the capillary temperature was cooled to 25°C and the derivatives were immediately separated and determined under 25°C. By investigating the variables of the presented approach in detail, on-line preconcentration, derivatization and separation could be automatically operated in one run and required no modification of current CE commercial instrument. Moreover, the sensitivity enhancement factor of 520 and 800 together with the detection limits of 16.32 and 6.34pg/mL was achieved for model compounds: glufosinate and aminomethylphosphonic acid, demonstrating the high detection sensitivity of the presented method. 3acapillary electrophoresis 3achromatography 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3aelectrolytes 3aglufosinate 3amixing 3atemperature1 aZhou, Lei1 aZhu, Zaifang1 aZhang, Huige1 aZhou, Ximin1 aChen, Xingguo0 tJournal of chromatography.g2009 May 15, v. 1216, no. 20 p.4517-4523dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2009.03.0423Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03695naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002100186245014500207300001600352500002400368500001500392506007600407520173000483506003702213650002802250650002502278650001202303650001602315650003202331650001802363650001002381650002002391650002302411650001302434650002502447650003102472650001802503650002602521650002602547650001302573650004802586650003102634650002802665650003302693650003802726650002702764650005802791653002002849700001702869700001802886700002402904773010802928852000903036856004803045655001203093IND4416339720221207093535.0090213e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441633972DNAL7 a190825762pmid7 aPMC31940642pmcid7 a10.1007/s00122-008-0935-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteiner, Barbara10aDifferential gene expression of related wheat lines with contrasting levels of head blight resistance after Fusarium graminearum inoculation  ap. 753-764.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFusarium head blight (FHB) is a devastating disease of wheat. Molecular mapping led to the identification of two major FHB resistance QTL, Fhb1 and Qfhs.ifa-5A. The actual function of these resistance genes is still unknown. The resistant line CM82036, the susceptible line Remus and two sister lines from the cross CM82036/Remus were analysed for gene expression. The sister lines show contrasting levels of FHB resistance due to the presence or absence of resistance alleles at Fhb1 and Qfhs.ifa-5A. At anthesis plants were challenged by Fusarium graminearum or water under controlled conditions. At six-time points after inoculation (0-72 h) gene expression of specific wheat floral tissue was analysed by cDNA-AFLPs in two biological replications. Altered expression patterns after F. graminearum inoculation were observed for 164 transcript-derived fragments (TDFs), corresponding to 3.4% of the analysed fragments. Fourteen TDFs, 0.28% of the total analysed fragments, displayed differential expression after fungal attack depending on the genotype; five of these TDFs were differentially expressed between the sister lines and are possibly associated with the possession of Fhb1 and Qfhs-ifa-5A and the FHB resistance level of the genotypes. Sequencing and annotation of these gene tags revealed homologies to a UDP-glucosyltransferase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, Dna-J like protein, pathogenesis-related family protein and to one gene with unknown function providing initial clues for guiding further functional studies on the resistance reaction of wheat against FHB. This work is the first report on differential gene expression between related, resistant and susceptible, wheat lines after F. graminearum attack.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aquantitative trait loci 3aFusarium graminearum 3aalleles 3ahead blight 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3agenetic lines 3awheat 3agene expression 3achromosome mapping 3agenotype 3aFusarium head blight 3agene expression regulation 2aBase Sequence 2aComputational Biology 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aFusarium 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxgenetics 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aQuantitative Trait Locixgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTriticumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 0aGibberella zeae1 aKurz, Harald1 aLemmens, Marc1 aBuerstmayr, Hermann0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2009 Feb., v. 118, no. 4 p.753-764dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-008-0935-8 7aarticle02275naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001600137245009000153300001600243500002400259520128900283650002701572650001501599650001301614650002501627650001101652650002101663700001701684700001701701700001501718773013001733852000901863856007701872655001201949IND4419671520221119202207.0090425s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441967152DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.21142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Peng10aEvaluation of applied cathode potential to enhance biocathode in microbial fuel cells  ap. 794-799.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: The biocathode is proving to be a promising feature for development of the microbial fuel cell (MFC), although much work remains to be done to increase its power generation. This study aimed to enhance the performance of a biocathode by applying selected cathode potential.RESULTS: When five two-chambered MFCs were operated at selected cathode potentials of 142, 242, 342, 442, or 542 mV (vs standard hydrogen electrode), those MFCs with selected potentials lower than 342 mV could start up, and the highest power density of 0.11 W m⁻³ was obtained at a selected potential of 242 mV. An inner-biocathode MFC was then constructed and operated at a start-up cathode potential of 242 mV for 30 days. The open circuit cathode potential increased from 477 ± 9 mV to 572 ± 8 mV compared with the potential of the initially abiotic cathode, resulting in an increase in the maximum power density (4.25 ± 0.16 W m⁻³) of 106%. In addition, tests of continuous operation showed that a loading rate of 135 mg COD L⁻¹ d⁻¹ was optimal for obtaining maximum power generation in the system developed for this study.CONCLUSION: The results indicated that an optimal cathode potential of 242 mV enhanced the performance of a biocathode using oxygen as the electron acceptor. 3achemical oxygen demand 3aelectrodes 3ahydrogen 3amicrobial fuel cells 3aoxygen 3apower generation1 aFan, Mingzhi1 aCao, Xiaoxin1 aHuang, Xia0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2009 May, v. 84, no. 5 p.794-799dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0268-25757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.21143Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03127naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002100156245011600177300002000293500002400313520132900337650002201666650001401688650002501702650001301727650001301740650001101753650001401764650002101778650002001799650001001819650001401829650001901843650000901862650001101871650001401882650001301896650001901909650002101928650003201949650001101981650002901992650000902021650001802030650002302048650001602071650003802087650001702125650001302142650002302155650002702178700001602205700002102221700003102242700001102273773011902284852000902403856007702412655001202489IND4459687620221119202218.0110707s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445968762DNAL7 a214172752pmid7 a10.1021/jf104731f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamos, Silvio J.10aEvaluation of Genotypic Variation of Broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italic) in Response to Selenium Treatment  ap. 3657–3665.  aIncludes references  aBroccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italic) fortified with selenium (Se) has been promoted as a functional food. Here, we evaluated 38 broccoli accessions for their capacity to accumulate Se and for their responses to selenate treatment in terms of nutritional qualities and sulfur gene expresion. We found that the total Se content varied with over 2-fold difference among the leaf tissues of broccoli accessions when the plants were treated with 20 μM Na2SeO4. Approximately half of total Se accumulated in leaves was Se-methylselenocysteine and selenomethionine. Transcriptional regulation of adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate sulfurylase and selenocysteine Se-methyltransferase gene expression might contribute to the different levels of Se accumulation in broccoli. Total glucosinolate contents were not affected by the concentration of selenate application for the majority of broccoli accessions. Essential micronutrients (i.e., Fe, Zn, Cu, and Mn) remained unchanged among half of the germplasm. Moreover, the total antioxidant capacity was greatly stimulated by selenate in over half of the accessions. The diverse genotypic variation in Se, glucosinolate, and antioxidant contents among accessions provides the opportunity to breed broccoli cultivars that simultaneously accumulate Se and other health benefit compounds. 3aBrassica oleracea 3aadenosine 3aantioxidant activity 3abreeding 3abroccoli 3acopper 3acultivars 3afunctional foods 3agene expression 3agenes 3agermplasm 3aglucosinolates 3airon 3aleaves 3amanganese 3aselenium 3aselenocysteine 3aselenomethionine 3asulfate adenylyltransferase 3asulfur 3atranscription (genetics) 3azinc 2aBase Sequence 2aBrassicaxgenetics 2aDNA Primers 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenotype 2aSeleniumxtoxicity 2aTranscription, Genetic1 aYuan, Youxi1 aFaquin, Valdemar1 aGuilherme, Luiz Roberto G.1 aLi, Li0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Apr. 27, v. 59, no. 8 p.3657–3665-3657–3665x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf104731f3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02664naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001900156245014700175300002000322500002400342520100200366650001001368650003101378650001401409650001701423650002401440650001901464650002301483650001201506650001601518650001401534650004601548650004901594650001101643650003401654650003601688650004801724650003101772650002101803651001101824700002001835700002001855700002101875700002201896700002301918773011901941852000902060856007702069655001202146IND4459687420221119202025.0110707s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445968742DNAL7 a213916052pmid7 a10.1021/jf104718g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Kun-Teng10aAnti-Inflammatory Effects of Resveratrol and Oligostilbenes from Vitis thunbergii var. taiwaniana against Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Arthritis  ap. 3649–3656.  aIncludes references  aVitis thunbergii Sieb. and Zucc. var. taiwaniana Lu is an endemic plant in Taiwan used as a dietary supplement for bone health. In this study, human chondrocytes were induced to produce COX-2, MMP-3, -13, and PGE2 by LPS. An 18F-FDG microPET imaging system was used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory arthritic effects in vivo. Six stilbenes, resveratrol (1), (+)-epsilon-viniferin (2), ampelopsin C (3), ampelopsin A (4), (−)-vitisin B (5), and (+)-vitisin A (6), were isolated from the stem part of V. thunbergii, which displayed the strongest PGE2 inhibition. Among these compounds, 1 significantly decreased COX-2 activity, PGE2, MMP-3, and -13 production in vitro, and 18F-FDG uptake and serum PGE2 in rabbits in vivo. Anti-inflammatory effects were enhanced through the combined usage of 1 and other oligostilbenes. Taken together, the synergistic effects of 1 and oligostilbenes resulted in stem part extracts with lower 1 content displaying the better anti-inflammatory arthritis effects. 3aVitis 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aarthritis 3achondrocytes 3adietary supplements 3aimage analysis 3aindigenous species 3arabbits 3aresveratrol 3asynergism 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aArthritisxchemically inducedxdrug therapy. 2aHumans 2aLipopolysaccharidesxtoxicity 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization 2aStilbenesxtherapeutic use 2aVitisxchemistry 3aTaiwan1 aChen, Lih-Geeng1 aTseng, Sung-Hui1 aHuang, Jung-Shan1 aHsieh, Ming-Shium1 aWang, Ching-Chiung0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Apr. 27, v. 59, no. 8 p.3649–3656-3649–3656x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf104718g3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04087naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001900156245013600175300002000311500002400331520202200355650002702377650003102404650001702435650001902452650002102471650004302492650003202535650001102567650002302578650002402601650001602625650000902641650001702650650002602667650002302693650001302716650003502729650003202764650001402796650004302810650003002853650004102883650002902924650003302953650002802986650002603014650002903040700001603069700002103085700002103106700002103127700001903148700002203167700001803189700002503207773011903232852000903351856007703360655001203437IND4459688120221119202009.0110707s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445968812DNAL7 a213753252pmid7 a10.1021/jf104837w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuo, Chia-Feng10aAnti-Inflammatory Effects of Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Extract and Its Isolated Carnosic Acid from Rosmarinus officinalis Leaves  ap. 3674–3685.  aIncludes references  aRosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) leaves possess a variety of bioactivities. Previous studies have shown that the extract of rosemary leaves from supercritical fluid extraction inhibits the expression of inflammatory mediators with apparent dose-dependent responses. In this study, three different extraction conditions (5000 psi at 40, 60, and 80 °C) of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) toward the extraction of antioxidants from rosemary were investigated. Furthermore, simultaneous comparison of the anti-inflammatory properties between rosemary extract prepared from SC-CO2 under optimal conditions (5,000 psi and 80 °C) and its purified carnosic acid (CA) using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated murine RAW 264.7 macrophage cells was also presented. Results showed that the yield of 3.92% and total phenolics of 213.5 mg/g extract obtained from the most effective extraction conditions showed a high inhibitory effect on lipid peroxidation (IC50 33.4 μg/mL). Both the SC-CO2 extract and CA markedly suppressed the LPS-induced production of nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), as well as the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), phosphorylated inhibitor-kappaB (P-IκB), and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB)/p65 in a dose-dependent manner. The five major compounds of verbenone, cirsimaritin, salvigenin, carnosol, and CA existing in the SC-CO2 extract were isolated by semipreparative HPLC and identified by HPLC-MS/MS analysis. CA was the most abundant recorded compound and the most important photochemical with an anti-inflammatory effect with an IC50 of 22.5 μM or 7.47 μg/mL presented to the best inhibitory activity on NO production better than that of the 14.50 μg/mL dosage prepared from the SC-CO2 extract. Nevertheless, the effective inhibition of LPS-induced NF-κB signaling in RAW 264.7 cells from the SC-CO2 extract extends the potential application of nutraceutical formulation for the prevention of inflammatory diseases. 3aRosmarinus officinalis 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3acarbon dioxide 3afunctional foods 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3amice 3anitric oxide 3anitric oxide synthase 3aphenolic compounds 3arosemary 3asupercritical fluid extraction 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3averbenone 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agentsxpharmacology 2aCarbon Dioxidexchemistry 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aAbietanesxpharmacology. 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aRosmarinusxchemistry 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry1 aSu, Jeng-De1 aChiu, Chun-hung.1 aPeng, Chiung-Chi1 aChang, Chi-Huang1 aSung, Tzu-Ying1 aHuang, Shiau-Huei1 aLee, Wen-Chin1 aChyau, Charng-Cherng0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Apr. 27, v. 59, no. 8 p.3674–3685-3674–3685x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf104837w3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03529naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002100156245014400177300002000321500002400341520165100365650002102016650002402037650002302061650002802084650001002112650001502122650001202137650001502149650002602164650001902190650001802209650001602227650001702243650004002260650003102300650003102331650001302362650003002375650003502405650001502440650004902455650002602504650001602530650004702546700002302593700002602616700002802642700002502670700001702695700002202712773011902734852000902853856007702862655001202939IND4459692520221119202012.0110707s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445969252DNAL7 a214050142pmid7 a10.1021/jf103832q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIqbal, Sanaullah10aCharacterization of a Heterodimeric GH2 β-Galactosidase from Lactobacillus sakei Lb790 and Formation of Prebiotic Galacto-oligosaccharides  ap. 3803–3811.  aIncludes references  aThe lacLM genes from Lactobacillus sakei Lb790, encoding a heterodimeric β-galactosidase that belongs to glycoside hydrolase family GH2, were cloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. Subsequently, the recombinant β-galactosidase LacLM was purified to apparent homogeneity and characterized. The enzyme is a β-galactosidase with narrow substrate specificity because o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (oNPG) was efficiently hydrolyzed, whereas various structurally related oNP analogues were not. The K(m) and k(cat) values for oNPG and lactose were 0.6 mM and 180 s−1 and 20 mM and 43 s−1, respectively. The enzyme is inhibited competitively by its two end-products d-galactose and d-glucose (K(i) values of 180 and 475 mM, respectively). As judged by the ratio of the inhibition constant to the Michaelis constant, K(i)/K(m), this inhibition is only very moderate and much less pronounced than for other microbial β-galactosidases. β-Galactosidase from L. sakei possesses high transgalactosylation activity and was used for the synthesis of galacto-oligosaccharides (GalOS), employing lactose at a concentration of 215 g/L. The maximum GalOS yield was 41% (w/w) of total sugars at 77% lactose conversion and contained mainly non-lactose disaccharides, trisaccharides, and tetrasaccharides with approximately 38, 57, and 5% of total GalOS formed, respectively. The enzyme showed a strong preference for the formation of β-(1 leads to 6)-linked transgalactosylation products, whereas β-(1 leads to 3)-linked compounds were formed to a lesser extent and β-(1 leads to 4)-linked reaction products could not be detected. 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactobacillus sakei 3abeta-galactosidase 3agalactooligosaccharides 3agenes 3aglycosides 3alactose 3aprebiotics 3asubstrate specificity 3atrisaccharides 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aDimerization 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aLactobacillusxenzymology 2aOligosaccharidesxbiosynthesis 2aPrebiotics 2aRecombinant Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTemperature 2abeta-Galactosidasexchemistryxmetabolism.1 aNguyễn, Thu Hà.1 aNguyễn, Hoàng Anh.1 aNguyễn, Tiến Thanh.1 aMaischberger, Thomas1 aKittl, Roman1 aHaltrich, Dietmar0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Apr. 27, v. 59, no. 8 p.3803–3811-3803–3811x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf103832q3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01672naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002700154245015500181300001600336500002400352520081000376650001401186650001001200650001001210773013201220852000901352856005701361655001201418IND4461396820221119202235.0110812e199110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446139682DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.1991.tb00223.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaffer-Fehre, Monika.14aThe endotegmen tuberculae: an account of little-known structures from the seed coat of the Hydrocharitoideae (Hydrocharitaceae) and Najas (Najadaceae)  ap. 169-188.  aIncludes references  aSHAFFER-FEHRE, M., 1991. The endotegmen tuberculae: an account of little-known structures from the seed coat of the Hydrocharitoideae (Hydrocharitaceae) and of Najas (Najadaceae). The sub-cellular protuberances from the inner tegmen layer have been given various names in earlier literature. Here named ‘endotegmen tuberculae', they vary in shape, size and density of distribution in the endotegmen of different taxa. These characteristics make them useful for taxonomic research at both genus and species level. Their shape is a major consideration in transferring Hydrocharis dubia to the genus Limnobium. A further structure, ‘exotegmen tuberculae', has been observed for the first time. This paper gives a survey of these structures and illustrates their taxonomic importance and its implications. 3aLimnobium 3aNajas 3atesta0 tBotanical journal of the Linnean Society.g1991 Oct., v. 107, no. 2 p.169-188dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw50697x0024-40747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.1991.tb00223.x 7aarticle02772naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001800163245011900181300001600300500001500316520089900331650002701230650001701257650001501274650001501289650002201304650002301326650001701349650002001366650002301386650002201409650002001431650001201451650002101463650002501484650005001509650002701559650002701586650002001613650005701633650003401690650003301724650005301757650006801810653001301878653002301891653001801914653001801932700001501950700001501965700001601980773007201996852000902068930003302077945002502110946001102135655001202146IND4362629020221119202404.0040521e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436262902DNAL7 a151106792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

However there are issues with the delivery and administration of vaccines. A particular problem is that the majority of vaccines currently used are injected, which can be unsafe if needles are reused in areas where blood-borne diseases are prevalent. Vaccines targeting the mucosal immune system avoid many of the problems associated with injections. One potential form of mucosal vaccine is based on the expression of vaccine antigens in plants. Current research in this area has focused on the expression of immunogens from the plant's nuclear genome but low expression levels generally achieved using this system have limited progress. In recent work we have used the model antigen, TetC, which confers resistance to Tetanus infection, to demonstrate the feasibility of expressing vaccine antigens at high levels in the plant chloroplast. 3agenetic transformation 3achloroplasts 3afood crops 3atransgenes 3atransgenic plants 3aClostridium tetani 3ahuman health 3agene expression 3abacterial antigens 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aedible vaccines 3atobacco 3abacterial toxins 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAntigensxbiosynthesisxgeneticsximmunology. 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aChloroplastsxgenetics 2aGene Expression 2aPeptide Fragmentsxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aPlantsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aTetanus Toxinxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aTetanus Toxoidxbiosynthesisxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 0avaccines 0aliterature reviews 0atetanospasmin 0atetanus toxin1 aMaliga, P.1 aDougan, G.1 aNixon, P.J.0 tPhytochemistry.g2004 Apr., v. 65, no. 8 p.989-994x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a20040525b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2004/05/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02102naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001500163245008400178300001600262500001500278520038100293650002100674650002200695650001900717650001900736650001200755650001600767650002200783650002300805650002000828650001600848650005100864650002600915650002700941650002400968650005500992650004501047650003001092650002801122650005701150651001201207653002501219653001901244653002601263653001501289700002001304700001401324700001401338700001601352700001501368773007201383852000901455945002501464946001101489655001201500IND4362606120221119202423.0040520e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436260612DNAL7 a150812912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

As standards the parasitoid wasp E. formosa was included as well as a chemical routine treatment. Efficacy of all beneficials to control T. vaporariorum was comparable to the chemical regime, and all treatments provided good pest control without significant differences. Shortly after release, individuals of both predatory mite species were found on nearly each plant but numbers decreased after three to four weeks. Hence, releases had to be repeated regularly. Control of B. tabaci was slightly less efficient. Efficacy of E. formosa and T. montdorensis was similar followed by A. limonicus with 20, 26 and 56 B. tabaci larvae remaining per plant, respectively. Although numbers of beneficials had been increased for control of B. tabaci numbers were still not high enough. However, results indicate that successful control is possible. 3aBemisia tabaci 3aEncarsia formosa 3aEuphorbia pulcherrima 3aPhytoseiidae 3aTrialeurodes vaporariorum 3alarvae 3aparasitic wasps 3apest control 3apredatory mites0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 June 30, , no. 1164 p.413-418dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1164.53  aDNAL 7aarticle01974naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148245008900166300001800255500002400273520106700297650001201364650001601376650004301392650001301435700001701448700002201465773010001487852000901587856008801596655001201684IND4419842720221119202022.0090501s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441984272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2009.02.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyabe, Kanji10aPeak parking method for measurement of molecular diffusivity in liquid phase systems  ap. 4377-4382.  aIncludes references  aThe combination of series of measurements of band broadening made with the peak parking (PP) method, using successively an open capillary tube and a HPLC column, gives a convenient procedure for the measurement of the molecular diffusivity (D m) of compounds in solutions, of their axial dispersion coefficient (D ax,m) in chromatographic columns, and of the tortuosity or obstructive factor of the column bed.

The values of D m in other solutions were obtained from the D ax,m values measured by the PP method, by correcting the D ax,m values with the γ m value. The D m values determined by this method were in good agreement with those previously reported or estimated using literature correlations. These results showed that the PP method is effective for the experimental measurement of D m. 3abenzene 3adiffusivity 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amethanol1 aAndo, Nobuho1 aGuiochon, Georges0 tJournal of chromatography.g2009 May 15, v. 1216, no. 20 p.4377-4382dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2009.02.0583Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03412naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006600150245013200216500001900348520159500367592002801962650001501990650001602005650001602021650001502037650001902052650001502071650002602086650001602112650001302128650001702141650001402158650002902172650001002201650001602211651001102227653001502238653002402253653002402277700002302301700002502324700002602349700001802375700002302393700002302416700002802439700005902467700006302526700006502589773011002654856008502764852000902849655001202858IND60731418920221120153801.0210428e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073141892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1169382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoppa, Carolina F.S.C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6462-515510aMycotoxin occurrence in breast milk and exposure estimation of lactating mothers using urinary biomarkers in São Paulo, Brazil  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, the occurrence of aflatoxins (AFs), fumonisins (FBs), ochratoxin A (OTA), deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEN) and some of their metabolites were assessed in breast milk and urine of lactating women (N = 74) from Pirassununga, São Paulo, Brazil. Exposure estimations through urinary mycotoxin biomarkers was also performed. Samples were collected in four sampling times (May and August 2018, February and July 2019) and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Aflatoxin M₁ (AFM₁) was not detected in breast milk. However, two samples (3%) presented FB₁ at 2200 and 3400 ng/L, while 4 samples (5%) had OTA at the median level of 360 ng/L. In urine, AFM₁ and aflatoxin P₁ (AFP₁) were found in 51 and 11% of samples, respectively (median levels: 0.16 and 0.07 ng/mg creatinine, respectively). Urinary DON (median level: 38.59 ng/mg creatinine), OTA (median level: 2.38 ng/mg creatinine) and ZEN (median level: 0.02 ng/mg of creatinine) were quantified in 18, 8 and 10% of the samples, respectively. Mean probable daily intake (PDI) values based on urinary biomarkers were 1.58, 1.09, 5.07, and 0.05 μg/kg body weight/day for AFM₁, DON, OTA, and ZEN, respectively. Although a low mycotoxin occurrence was detected in breast milk, the PDI for the genotoxic AFs was much higher than those reported previously in Brazil, while PDI values obtained for OTA and DON were higher than recommended tolerable daily intakes. These outcomes warrant concern on the exposure of lactating women to these mycotoxins in the studied area.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3abody weight 3abreast milk 3acreatinine 3adeoxynivalenol 3afumonisins 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3amutagens 3aochratoxin A 3apollution 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aurine 3azearalenone 3aBrazil 0aHuman milk 0aHuman biomonitoring 0aExposure assessment1 aCirelli, Amanda C.1 aGonçalves, Bruna L.1 aBarnabé, Eliana M.B.1 aPetta, Tânia1 aFranco, Larissa T.1 aJavanmardi, Fardin1 aKhaneghah, Amin Mousavi1 aLee, Sarah H.I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5368-44131 aCorassin, Carlos H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9826-92241 aOliveira, Carlos A.F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5779-52870 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 June 15, v. 279 p.116938-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1169383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245016300158300001800321520163700339592002801976650001302004650001402017650001102031650002202042650001302064650001402077650001302091650000902104650001802113650001802131650001802149650001402167650001602181700001802197773012202215856007402337852000902411655001202420IND60640063920221122060900.0190504e20160121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064006392DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra20105e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYilmaz, Ceren10aMorphology and crystal structure control of α-Fe₂O₃ films by hydrothermal-electrochemical deposition in the presence of Ce³⁺ and/or acetate, F⁻ ions  ap. 8517-8527.  aHydrothermal-electrochemical growth of Hematite (α-Fe₂O₃) thin films in the presence of Ce³⁺ and/or CH₃COO⁻ and F⁻ ions is reported. Primary attention is paid to understanding the synergistic effect of temperature and additive ions on the growth of Hematite particles. The literature describes the shape-controlled electrodeposition of iron oxide films, but these reports involve low-temperature depositions (<100 °C) that require a post-annealing step to obtain the Hematite phase. We studied size and shape control of Hematite crystals by introducing capping agents during hydrothermal-electrochemical deposition (HED) at 130 °C under autonomous pressure. When HED is used together with growth-modifying species such as CH₃COO⁻ and/or Ce³⁺, Hematite thin films with various structures including spherical, rhombohedral and platelet-like particles were obtained which were crystallized directly in the α-Fe₂O₃ phase without thermal annealing. In contrast, either Lepidocrocite or an amorphous phase forms with low-temperature electrodeposition under otherwise identical conditions. Addition of F⁻ into the deposition solution induces formation of bundles that are composed of square planar Akaganeite particles even during HED. The aspect ratio of the Akaganeite particles is controlled with co-addition of Ce³⁺ ions. This variety of nanostructures gives us the opportunity to evaluate the photoelectrochemical performance of the α-Fe₂O₃ films based on particle size and shape. It was demonstrated that porous, square planar α-Fe₂O₃ with a high aspect ratio shows the highest performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aannealing 3acerium 3acrystal structure 3acrystals 3afluorides 3ahematite 3aions 3alepidocrocite 3ananomaterials 3aparticle size 3asynergism 3atemperature1 aÜnal, Uğur,0 tRSC advances.g2016 Jan. 21, v. 6, no. 10 p.8517-8527dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra20105e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245010400174500002200278520127900300592002801579650001401607650002801621650001901649650001701668650001701685650001601702650001701718650001501735650001401750650001701764650001401781650001101795653001501806653001501821653001901836700001901855700001701874700001601891700005801907700005701965773007802022856009002100852000902190655001202199IND60656963520221123015754.0190815e20190809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065696352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1245652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Fengbang10aLength and diameter-dependent phagocytosis and cytotoxicity of long silver nanowires in macrophages  aPre-press version  aLong silver nanowires (AgNWs, >5 μm) have shown promising applications in next generation biomaterials. However, the toxicity of long AgNWs is not well characterized in terms of their size. In this study, five AgNWs types, including SAgNW30 (length: 5–10 μm; diameter: 30 nm), MAgNW30 (length: 20–30 μm; diameter: 30 nm), LAgNW30 ((length: ∼100 μm; diameter: 30 nm), LAgNW50 (length: ∼100 μm; diameter: 50 nm), and LAgNW100 (length: ∼100 μm; diameter: 100 nm), were used to investigate the size-dependent phagocytosis and cytotoxicity in macrophage. It showed that SAgNW30, MAgNW30, LAgNW30 can be fully phagocytosed by macrophages, but LAgNW50 and LAgNW100 frustrated the phagocytosis. It demonstrated that LAgNW30 can be internalized in macrophage in a curly manner. The size-dependent cytotoxicity was observed in cell viability, apoptosis, mitochondrial damage, phenotypic transition, and inflammatory response in AgNWs-treated macrophage. The AgNWs-induced cytotoxicity was depended on their length and diameter, increased gradually in the order of SAgNW30 > MAgNW30 > LAgNW30 > LAgNW50 > LAgNW100. The findings presented here will assist in the evaluation of the size-dependent cytotoxicity mediated by long AgNWs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abiocompatible materials 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3ainflammation 3amacrophages 3amitochondria 3ananosilver 3ananowires 3aphagocytosis 3aphenotype 3asilver 0aLong AgNWs 0aMacrophage 0aSize-dependent1 aWang, Yuanyuan1 aYao, Xinglei1 aMa, Chunyan1 aYin, Yongguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9392-62561 aSong, Maoyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6776-47050 tChemosphere.g2019 Aug. 09, dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1245653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005100139245013000190300001600320500002000336520151800356592002801874596005901902650002001961650003401981650002202015650002302037650001302060650001402073650001702087650001502104650002702119650001002146700001202156700001202168700001302180700001202193700001302205700001102218700001302229700001402242700001402256773011502270856007302385852000902458655001202467IND60749858120221121233958.0210908e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074985812DNAL7 a10.1111/age.131212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5751-753210aAccurate prediction and genome‐wide association analysis of digital intramuscular fat content in longissimus muscle of pigs  ap. 633-644.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIntramuscular fat (IMF) content is a critical indicator of pork quality that affects directly the purchasing desire of consumers. However, to measure IMF content is both laborious and costly, preventing our understanding of its genetic determinants and improvement. In the present study, we constructed an accurate and fast image acquisition and analysis system, to extract and calculate the digital IMF content, the proportion of fat areas in the image (PFAI) of the longissimus muscle of 1709 animals from multiple pig populations. PFAI was highly significantly correlated with marbling scores (MS; 0.95, r² = 0.90), and also with IMF contents chemically defined for 80 samples (0.79, r² = 0.63; more accurate than direct analysis between IMF contents and MS). The processing time for one image is only 2.31 s. Genome‐wide association analysis on PFAI for all 1709 animals identified 14 suggestive significant SNPs and 1 genome‐wide significant SNP. On MS, we identified nine suggestive significant SNPs, and seven of them were also identified in PFAI. Furthermore, the significance (−log P) values of the seven common SNPs are higher in PFAI than in MS. Novel candidate genes of biological importance for IMF content were also discovered. Our imaging systems developed for prediction of digital IMF content is closer to IMF measured by Soxhlet extraction and slightly more accurate than MS. It can achieve fast and high‐throughput IMF phenotype, which can be used in improvement of pork quality.  aPublisher supplied data  a31760656cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aanimal genetics 3agenome-wide association study 3aintramuscular fat 3alongissimus muscle 3amarbling 3aphenotype 3apork quality 3aprediction 3asolid phase extraction 3aswine1 aQin, J.1 aRao, L.1 aTang, X.1 aCui, D.1 aChen, L.1 aXu, W.1 aXiao, S.1 aZhang, Z.1 aHuang, L.0 tAnimal genetics.g2021 Oct., v. 52, no. 5 p.633-644dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl38565x0268-91467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/age.131213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02325naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011100171300001800282520084600300592002801146650002601174650004001200650002001240650002801260650001901288650003201307650002001339650001001359650001101369650001801380650001601398650001301414650001201427650001001439650002701449650000901476650001101485651001101496700002401507700002701531700002301558700002001581773015201601856008101753852000901834655001201843IND60669562220221119174854.0190920e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066956222DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-006-9151-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorelli, Beatriz M.10aYeast populations associated with the artisanal cheese produced in the region of Serra da Canastra, Brazil  ap. 1115-1119.  aThe aim of this work was to describe the yeast populations present during the manufacturing of Minas cheese of the region of Serra da Canastra, Minas Gerais state, Brazil.

The aim of this study was to investigate the bio-insecticidal effect of chemical extracts of three plants, Mentha pulegium L. (Lamiales: Lamiaceae), Lavandula stoechas L. (Lamiales: Lamiaceae) and Ruta chalepensis L. (Sapindales: Rutaceae) collected from Tunisia, on the lesser grain borer Rhyzopertha dominica (Fabricius, 1792) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae), which is a primary pest of stored wheat. To reach this goal, we firstly did bio-assays to test the toxicity of these plant extracts on R. dominica adults using different concentrations of plant extracts on wheat seeds. Secondly, we analysed the chemical compounds of these plant extracts using GC-MS and GC-FID. Our results demonstrated that R. dominica mortality was significantly higher with increasing plant essential oils concentrations (CL₉₅ values 45.68, 113.12 and 170.52 µl/l₍ₐᵢᵣ₎) for M. pulegium, R. chalepensis and L. stoechas, respectively. The main chemical compounds identified of M. pulegium oils were: pulegone (76.9 %), isomenthone (12.0 %) and limonene (1.73 %), whereas those from L. stoechas were: camphor (23.8 %), 1,8-cineole (17.8 %) and camphene (7.69 %). Ruta chalepensis oil revealed high contents of undecanone (51.2 %), 2-nonanone (39.16 %) and 2-decanone (2.32 %).

A key event in de novo methylation of DNA by RdDM is the production of long non‐coding RNA (lncRNA) by RNA polymerase V (Pol V). Little is known about the events that connect Pol V transcription to the establishment of repressive chromatin modifications. Using RNA immunoprecipitation, we elucidated the order of events downstream of lncRNA production and discovered interdependency between lncRNA‐associated proteins. We found that the effector protein ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) binds lncRNA independent of the RNA‐binding protein INVOLVED IN DE NOVO2 (IDN2). In contrast, IDN2 binds lncRNA in an AGO4‐dependent manner. We further found that the de novo DNA methyltransferase DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE2 (DRM2) also associates with lncRNA produced by Pol V and that this event depends on AGO4 and IDN2. We propose a model where the silencing proteins AGO4, IDN2 and DRM2 bind to lncRNA in a stepwise manner, resulting in DNA methylation of RdDM target loci.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aRNA 3achromatin 3agene expression 3agene silencing 3ahistones 3aloci 3amodels 3aprecipitin tests 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransposons 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA Methylationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Silencing 2aRNA, Long Noncodingxmetabolism1 aRowley, M.

While FPD processes are directly affected by key macroscopic properties of fractured rocks, such as fracture density and fracture connectivity, there is, as of yet, a lack of comprehension of the associated characteristics when multiple immiscible phases saturate the probed fractured medium. In this work, we analyze the variations experienced by P and S wave attenuation and phase velocity dispersion when CO₂ percolates into an initially brine‐saturated fractured porous rock. We study such variations considering a simple model of a porous rock containing intersecting orthogonal fractures as well as a more complex model comprising a fracture network. In the latter, we simulate the flow of a CO₂ plume into the medium using an invasion percolation procedure. Representative samples are subjected to numerical upscaling experiments, consisting of compression and shear tests, prior to and after the CO₂ invasion process. Results show that fracture‐to‐background FPD is only sensitive to the presence of CO₂, which decreases its effects. However, fracture‐to‐fracture FPD depends on both the overall CO₂ saturation and the fluid distribution within the fracture network. While the former modulates the magnitude of the dissipation, the latter can give rise to a novel FPD process occurring between CO₂‐saturated and brine‐saturated regions of the fracture network.  aPublisher supplied data  aPICT 2017‐2976cAgencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnolgica of Argentina  aPZ00P2_180112cSwiss National Science Foundation 3acarbon dioxide 3ageophysics 3amodels 3aresearch1 aHunziker, Jürg1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5915-43521 aCaspari, Eva1 aRubino, J.

Source separation is an important step towards simplification of domestic sewage treatment, enabling the treatment and reuse of blackwater (BW) in more compact and decentralized systems. The Evapotranspiration tank (TEvap) is a natural, soil and plants-based hybrid system, being a combination of an in-built septic tank with a constructed wetland, used for BW recovery aiming at zero liquid discharge. The objective of this work was to describe the system dynamics and to evaluate criteria for design and operation, based on the evapotranspiration rate and performance. The study was based on a 1490 days-continuous run of a real scale TEvap. A design equation for sizing based on local climate conditions was proposed. The specific methanogenic activity was determined (0.047 kgCOD·kgTVS−1·d−1) and the applied biological loading rate was calculated. The results indicated that the TEvap could receive 740 L·d−1 providing a COD removal of about 90%. However, the volumetric capacity of the TEvap combined with the routine in the household showed to be 87 L·d−1 if zero liquid discharge was aimed. Understanding the routine of householders helps to decide whether to design the tank to cope with peak flows or to consider an infiltration trench for occasional overflow. When exposed to a peak flow, average COD removal was 75%. The slight accumulation of salts in the top soil did not affect the development of the plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations 3achemical oxygen demand 3aclimatic factors 3aconstructed wetlands 3aequations 3aevapotranspiration 3aliquids 3amethane production 3asalts 3asanitation 3aseptic systems 3asewage treatment 3asustainable development 3atopsoil 0aDesign criteria 0aEcotechnology 0aNatural system 0aReuse 0aSewage 0aZero liquid discharge1 aGalbiati, Adriana Farina1 aMagalhães Filho, Fernando Jorge Correa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5447-01371 aBernardes, Fernando Silva1 aCarvalho, Glauber Altrão1 aBoncz, Marc Árpád0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2019 Aug., v. 147 p.61-66dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.04.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245009500161300001800256500002000274520167800294592002801972650001202000650002202012650002202034650001202056650002002068650001302088650002202101650001502123650001402138650001102152650001302163650000902176650002702185650001702212650001202229650001402241650003002255650001202285700003202297700001802329700003402347773010502381856007302486852000902559655001202568IND60577623820221121092748.0170809e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057762382DNAL7 a10.1111/are.132932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelghandi, Madjid10aParentage analysis of tropical spiny lobster (Panulirus homarus) by microsatellite markers  ap. 4718-4724.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aParentage analysis is of vital importance for hatchery production and breeding programmes. Two multiplex PCR protocols including seven tropical spiny lobster (Panulirus homarus) microsatellites (Pho‐G06, Pho‐G25, Pho‐G53, Pho‐G62, Pho‐G74, Pho‐G89 and Pho‐G100) were introduced for parentage assignment. All loci were polymorphic with allele sizes from 113 to 337 base pairs (bp), observed alleles (k) from two to seven and polymorphic information content (PIC) of 0.25 to 0.73. Twenty‐four stage‐3 phyllosoma larvae (39 days posthatching) were collected for paternity exclusion study using selected microsatellites. Exclusion‐based parentage analysis unambiguously assigned 83% of fry (20 of 24) to a single female parent. Of ten putative female parents, five have contributed to the 20 allocated offspring, with one being true parent of 11. Four others were assigned to two or more potential female parents, probably due to genotyping error or the presence of null allele. The exclusion power (EP) for the seven loci varied between 13% and 54% with known genotypes of one parent (P1) and 19% and 71% for given the genotypes of both parents (P2). The theoretical combined parentage exclusion (cEP) power for all seven microsatellites was P1 = 95% and P2 = 99%. The power of discrimination for each locus varied between 0.18 and 0.86. This report presents the first study to utilize microsatellite markers for successful parentage assignment of P. homarus. The selected microsatellites provide a practical tool for parentage analysis in hatchery production of juveniles as well as in future commercial breeding programme of tropical spiny lobsters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHomarus 3aPanulirus homarus 3abreeding programs 3afemales 3agenetic markers 3agenotype 3agenotyping errors 3ahatcheries 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3alobsters 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3anull alleles 3aparents 3apaternity 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprogeny1 aSaif Nasser Al Hinai, Manal1 aAfzal, Hasifa1 aKhalfan Al‐Wahaibi, Mohamed0 tAquaculture research.g2017 Sept., v. 48, no. 9 p.4718-4724dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.132933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014000162300001800302520148200320592002801802650002101830650002201851650001501873650002001888650002101908650002401929650001301953650001101966650002101977650002201998650001302020650002102033650002002054650002202074650001202096650001902108700001602127700001902143700001502162773015202177856008102329852000902410655001202419IND60669562420221119174919.0190920e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066956242DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-006-9158-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Da C.10aOptimization of Recombinant Cytochrome P450 2C9 Protein Production in Escherichia coli DH5α by Statistically-Based Experimental Design  ap. 1169-1176.  aCytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 is of major importance in drug metabolism. However, the low yield of recombinant CYP2C9 protein in E. coli strains prevents its extensive use in the study of in vitro drug metabolism. In the present study, Taguchi design and desirability function were first used to investigate the effect of medium components (glycerol, δ-ALA, IPTG, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, inoculum density, peptone, thiamine, trace elements, NH₄Cl, and MgSO₄) on recombinant human CYP2C9 production by E. coli DH5α. An L₁₂ (2¹¹) orthogonal array was used to design the experiments to screen out the most influential factors. The CYP concentration and the specific content of CYP were considered as two product quality variables. A desirability function was applied to combine these two qualities as a single objective function. Optimization via central composite design (CCD) was then undertaken to yield the best performance. The confirmation experiments indicated that the expression performance under the optimized conditions was better than those obtained under other conditions. A compromise between conflicting goals, such as achievement of good yield of recombinant CYP2C9 and facility of the following purification, was found by means of the desirability function D. This is the first report that combined Taguchi design and CCD, and performed experiments in a multiresponse framework to optimize the production of human CYP in a recombinant E. coli strain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aammonium chloride 3aampicillin 3achloramphenicol 3acytochrome P-450 3aexperimental design 3aglycerol 3ahumans 3ainoculum density 3amagnesium sulfate 3apeptones 3apharmacokinetics 3aproduct quality 3aprotein synthesis 3athiamin 3atrace elements1 aZhu, Pan H.1 aYang, Sheng L.1 aYang, Ling0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2006 Nov., v. 22, no. 11 p.1169-1176dKluwer Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl44995x0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-006-9158-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010100174520145800275592002801733650001601761650001501777650001701792650001601809650001301825650003301838650001801871650002201889653001601911653001801927653001801945653002101963700001801984700002502002700002502027700002002052700003002072700002002102700002402122773012502146856008502271852000902356655001202365IND60710735720221121230128.0201111e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071073572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2020.1057592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkotadis, Evangelos12aA sensing approach for automated and real-time pesticide detection in the scope of smart-farming  aThe increased use of pesticides across the globe has a major impact on public health. Advanced sensing methods are considered of significant importance to ensure that pesticide use on agricultural products remains within safety limits. This study presents the experimental testing of a hybrid, nanomaterial based gas-sensing array, for the detection of a commercial organophosphate pesticide, towards its integration in a holistic smart-farming tool such as the “gaiasense” system. The sensing array utilizes nanoparticles (NPs) as the conductive layer of the device while four distinctive polymeric layers (superimposed on top of the NP layer) act as the gas-sensitive layer. The sensing array is ultimately called to discern between two gas-analytes: Chloract 48 EC (a chlorpyrifos based insecticide) and Relative Humidity (R.H.) which acts as a reference analyte since is anticipated to be present in real-field conditions. The unique response patterns generated after the exposure of the sensing-array to the two gas-analytes were analysed using a common statistical analysis tool, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA has validated the ability of the array to detect, quantify as well as to differentiate between R.H. and Chloract. The sensing array being compact, low-cost and highly sensitive (LOD in the order of ppb for chlorpyrifos) can be effectively integrated with pre-existing crop-monitoring solutions such as the gaiasense.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aautomation 3achlorpyrifos 3aelectronics 3apolymers 3aprincipal component analysis 3apublic health 3arelative humidity 0aGas sensors 0aSmart farming 0aNanoparticles 0aOrganophosphates1 aKanaris, Aris1 aAslanidis, Evangelos1 aMichalis, Panagiotis1 aKalatzis, Nikos1 aChatzipapadopoulos, Fotis1 aMarianos, Nikos1 aTsoukalas, Dimitris0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2020 Nov., v. 178 p.105759-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2020.1057593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013600166300001400302500001900316520153300335592002801868596007301896650001001969650001201979650002601991650002402017650002302041650003002064650001502094650002202109650001502131650001402146650001102160650002302171650001102194650001902205650000902224651002102233700002002254700006002274773011902334856008202453852000902535655001202544IND60727887320221119225624.0210213e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072788732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-020-01319-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajeed, Aasim10aTranscribing molecular and climatic data into conservation management for the Himalayan endangered species, Taxus contorta (Griff.)  ap. 53-66.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOwing to the changing climatic scenario globally, and human overexploitation, the risk of extinction of Himalayan endangered species has increased many folds. Taxus contorta, an endangered gymnosperm has reached a decisive state in the Western Himalayas, thus, demands immediate attention to rescue it. This study aims to elucidate population and landscape genetics of T. contorta to plan a successful conservation strategy. We used SSR genotyping to identify genetic diversity hotspots, and ecological niche modeling to reveal climatic hotspots of T. contorta in the Indian Western Himalayas. We observed a substantial genetic diversity, and a negligible level of inbreeding among T. contorta populations. A genetic bottleneck was observed in several populations. We propose that changing climate can cause a failure of an entire conservation management plan if the shift produces a degraded environment in the future, at the sites of conservation. Further, the conservation management is futile if it fails to enhance or conserve the genetic diversity. We propound that use of germplasm from genetic diversity hotspots for propagation in climatic hotspots, and prioritization of these hotspot patches for conservation would ensure greater genetic variability under a safe environment. This integrative approach of translating molecular and climatic data into conservation planning would save our efforts, time, and capital investment, and ensure greater success in managing the revival of T. contorta in the Western Himalayas.  aPublisher supplied data  aNMHS/SG-2016/011cMinistry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change 3aTaxus 3aclimate 3aconservation genetics 3aeconomic investment 3aendangered species 3aenvironmental degradation 3aextinction 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3agermplasm 3ahumans 3alandscape genetics 3aniches 3aprioritization 3arisk 3aHimalayan region1 aSingh, Amandeep1 aBhardwaj, Pankaj1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9201-16090 tConservation genetics.g2021 Feb., v. 22, no. 1 p.53-66dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870040x1566-06217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-020-01319-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03328naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011400167500001900281520143300300592002801733650001901761650001701780650001901797650001901816650001501835650001101850650001001861650002301871650002001894650001701914650001101931650001701942650003001959650002101989650001402010650003702024650001602061650001702077650001402094650001702108650001302125650002002138650001602158653001902174653002202193700001602215700001702231700001602248700001802264700001602282700006402298700001902362700005902381700005802440773011002498856008502608852000902693655001202702IND60731419320221120194112.0210428e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073141932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1169422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Yufeng10aMolecular mechanisms of zooplanktonic toxicity in the okadaic acid-producing dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aProrocentrum lima is a dinoflagellate that forms hazardous blooms and produces okadaic acid (OA), leading to adverse environmental consequences associated with the declines of zooplankton populations. However, little is known about the toxic effects and molecular mechanisms of P. lima or OA on zooplankton. Here, their toxic effects were investigated using the brine shrimp Artemia salina. Acute exposure of A. salina to P. lima resulted in lethality at concentrations 100-fold lower than densities observed during blooms. The first comprehensive results from global transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses in A. salina showed up-regulated mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes and reduced non-enzyme antioxidants, indicating general detoxification responses to oxidative stress after exposure to P. lima. The significantly up-regulated mRNA expression of proteasome, spliceosome, and ribosome, as well as the increased fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation suggested the proteolysis of damaged proteins and induction of energy expenditure. Exposure to OA increased catabolism of chitin, which may further disrupt the molting and reproduction activities of A. salina. Our data shed new insights on the molecular responses and toxicity mechanisms of A. salina to P. lima or OA. The simple zooplankton model integrated with omic methods provides a sensitive assessment approach for studying hazardous algae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemia salina 3aProrocentrum 3aacute exposure 3abeta oxidation 3acatabolism 3achitin 3adeath 3aenergy expenditure 3agene expression 3ametabolomics 3amodels 3aokadaic acid 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aoxidative stress 3apollution 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aproteolysis 3areproduction 3aribosomes 3aspliceosomes 3atoxicity 3atranscriptomics 3azooplankton 0aTranscriptomic 0aToxic algal bloom1 aZhang, Keke1 aGeng, Ningbo1 aWu, Minghuo1 aYi, Xianliang1 aLiu, Renyan1 aChallis, Jonathan K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3514-06471 aCodling, Garry1 aXu, Elvis Genbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4414-19781 aGiesy, John P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1931-99620 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 June 15, v. 279 p.116942-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1169423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003600140245014000176300001800316500001500334520130100349592002801650650001701678650001301695650001301708650002301721650002801744650001901772650002101791650001101812650001901823650001401842650001301856650002201869650001501891650001801906653001801924700002201942700001501964700002201979700002602001773012102027856007402148852000902222655001202231IND60640064420221122060943.0190504e20160111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064006442DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra20124a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRao Vusa, Chiranjeevi Srinivasa10aTailored interfacial architecture of chitosan modified glassy carbon electrodes facilitating selective, nanomolar detection of dopamine  ap. 4818-4825.  a2019-12-06  aHerein, it is demonstrated that the sulfonation of chitosan (CS) on a glassy carbon surface (GCE) facilitates the making of a new sensing platform for the selective, nanomolar detection of dopamine. The surface functionalisation of CS was carried out using sulphamic acid (SA) by simple glutaraldehyde (GA) cross-linking to yield the sulfonated derivative (GCE–CS–GA–SA). The sulfonated chitosan possesses sulfonic acid functionalities which provide an electrostatic barrier, thereby discriminating dopamine from ascorbic acid. Electrochemical techniques, branded for their accuracy and fast response, are employed to determine dopamine concentrations down to few nanomoles in the presence of high concentrations of AA. In addition to nanomolar detection, the reported sensing methodology exhibits a low dopamine oxidation potential of 210 mV vs. normal calomel electrode (NCE) and wide linear ranges of 50 nM to 10 μM and 10–400 μM in chronoamperometry and differential pulse voltammetry, respectively. These results reveal that an inexpensive, simple and facile functionalization of chitosan like polymers on carbon surfaces can open up new avenues in the creation of perm-selective membranes that can find application in novel biosensors fabrication, especially in electrophysiology.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3adopamine 3achitosan 3amercurous chloride 3aglassy carbon electrode 3aglutaraldehyde 3aelectrochemistry 3acarbon 3asulfonic acids 3aoxidation 3apolymers 3aelectrophysiology 3abiosensors 3aascorbic acid 0asulfonic acid1 aManju, Venkatesan1 aAneesh, K.1 aBerchmans, Sheela1 aPalaniappan, Arumugam0 tRSC advances.g2016 Jan. 11, v. 6, no. 6 p.4818-4825dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra20124a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03710naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005700142245016000199300001600359500001400375520174300389592002802132650001302160650002302173650001802196650003402214650002702248650001002275650001102285650002302296650003002319650001602349650001502365650002702380650003102407650001102438650001702449650003102466650001402497650002302511650001502534650001302549650001902562650001502581650001402596650001302610650001802623650001602641650001402657651001702671653001502688653002002703653002602723700005502749700005502804773014002859856007602999852000903075655001203084IND60713612420221118001845.0201023e20200928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071361242DNAL7 a10.4001/003.028.03742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDlamini, B.E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5289-743310aEntomopathogens from Agricultural Soil and Their Potential to Control the Banded Fruit Weevil, Phlyctinus callosus (Schönherr) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae)  ap. 374-384.  aNAL-light  aThe banded fruit weevil (BFW), Phlyctinus callosus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is a major indigenous pest of deciduous fruits and grapevine in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Entomopathogens are effective in controlling soil-borne and above-ground stages of insect pests. Soil samples were collected from deciduous fruit orchards and vineyards in the Western Cape, baited with mealworms to isolate entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) and entomopathogenic fungi (EPF), which were identified using molecular techniques and assessed for their potential as biocontrol agents of BFW adults. A correlation analysis was performed to determine the effect of soil parameters on the presence of the entomopathogens. EPNs were trapped in 12 (17 %) samples, while Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and Heterorhabditis safricana were the only two species isolated. EPF were isolated from 26 (37 %) samples baited, with 14 fungal isolates identified as Beauveria bassiana (Cordycipitaceae) and 12 identified as Metarhizium anisopliae (Clavicipitaceae) complex. Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (53 %) gave significantly higher (P < 0.05) control of adult BFW than H. safricana (37 %). Metarhizium anisopliae (79 %) gave significantly higher (P < 0.05) control of BFW adults than B. bassiana (63 %). Organic matter, magnesium and phosphorus had a negative relationship with the occurrence of EPNs. A negative relationship was also reported between the occurrence of EPF, and organic matter and potassium. The results indicated that soils from the deciduous fruit orchards and vineyards from the Western Cape contain both EPNs and EPF with potential to be used in an integrated pest management system against soil-borne and above-ground stages of BFW.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBassiana 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aCurculionidae 3aHeterorhabditis bacteriophora 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3aVitis 3aadults 3aagricultural soils 3abiological control agents 3acorrelation 3aentomology 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3afruits 3ainsect pests 3aintegrated pest management 3amagnesium 3amanagement systems 3aoccurrence 3aorchards 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asampling 3asoil sampling 3atree fruits 3avineyards 3aSouth Africa 0abiocontrol 0adeciduous fruit 0asoil-dwelling insects1 aMalan, A.P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9257-03121 aAddison, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8227-339X0 tAfrican entomology.g2020 Sept. 28, v. 28, no. 2 p.374-384dEntomological Society of Southern AfricawJournal:jnl50015x1021-35897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4001/003.028.03743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009200164300001800256520136900274592002801643650001301671650001501684650002001699650001401719650001801733650002601751650002301777650002201800650003101822650001201853650001301865650001501878650004701893650001401940651001301954700002301967700002001990700001802010700001702028773015202045856008102197852000902278655001202287IND60669562620221119174813.0190920e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066956262DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-006-9157-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIqbal, Zafar10aRAPD analysis of Fusarium Isolates Causing “Mango Malformation” Disease in Pakistan  ap. 1161-1167.  aMango Malformation (MM) disease is a major constraint to mango production. A total of 20 Fusarium isolates from MM-affected mango plants were collected from 14 locations in Pakistan and assessed for genetic diversity using the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique. A total of 393 fragments were amplified after screening with 50 random primers. The amplifications with 45 primers identified scoreable polymorphisms among the isolates. A genetic similarity matrix based on Nei and Li’s index determined coefficients ranging from 46.46% to 92.51%. These coefficients were used to construct a dendrogram using the UPGMA algorithm. The isolates grouped into two main clusters, comprising 13 and 7 isolates respectively, at a genetic relatedness of 52%. Within the clusters, Fusarium isolates were not necessarily related either by geographic origin or by the mango cultivar from which they were isolated. RAPD proved a reproducible and tractable means of differentiating Fusarium isolates. These findings also suggest that some infections originate not from adjacent plants within an orchard but from geographically distant areas; indicating that most probably infection occurs in nurseries prior to plants being transported around the country for subsequent cultivation, and that improved plant hygiene could significantly curb MM infection and spread.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium 3aalgorithms 3acrop production 3acultivars 3afruit growing 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic similarity 3agenetic variation 3amango malformation disease 3amangoes 3aorchards 3aprovenance 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3ascreening 3aPakistan1 aMehboob-ur-Rahman,1 aDasti, Altaf A.1 aSaleem, Ahmad1 aZafar, Yusuf0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2006 Nov., v. 22, no. 11 p.1161-1167dKluwer Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl44995x0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-006-9157-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03487naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245011600182300001600298520166200314592002801976650001102004650001502015650001502030650002402045650002502069650001002094650001202104650001602116650001202132650000902144650001202153650001302165650001702178650002402195650001402219650001302233650002202246650001202268650003602280650003702316650002702353650001102380650004302391650003302434650006302467650003802530650000902568650002302577650005402600650005602654700001802710773010002728856004802828852000902876655001202885IND4484520520221121153935.0120815e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448452052DNAL7 a225845082pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-012-1421-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorita, Shoko10aDifferent vascular permeability between the sensory and secretory circumventricular organs of adult mouse brain  ap. 589-603.  aThe blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevents free access of circulating molecules to the brain and maintains a specialized brain environment to protect the brain from blood-derived bioactive and toxic molecules; however, the circumventricular organs (CVOs) have fenestrated vasculature.

The present study showed that vascular permeability of low-molecular-mass tracers such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and Evans Blue was higher in the secretory CVOs and kidney as compared with that in the sensory CVOs. On the other hand, vascular permeability of high-molecular-mass tracers such as FITC-labeled bovine serum albumin and Dextran 70,000 was lower in the CVOs as compared with that in the kidney. Prominent vascular permeability of low- and high-molecular-mass tracers was also observed in the arcuate nucleus. These data demonstrate that vascular permeability for low-molecular-mass molecules is higher in the secretory CVOs as compared with that in the sensory CVOs, possibly for large secretion of peptides to the blood stream. Moreover, vascular permeability for high-molecular-mass tracers in the CVOs is smaller than that of the kidney, indicating that the CVOs are not totally without a BBB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aastrocytes 3ablood flow 3ablood-brain barrier 3abovine serum albumin 3abrain 3adextran 3afluorescein 3akidneys 3amice 3aneurons 3apeptides 3apermeability 3aposterior pituitary 3asecretion 3atoxicity 3atracer techniques 2aAnimals 2aBlood-Brain Barrierxmetabolism 2aBrainxblood supplyxmetabolism. 2aCapillary Permeability 2aCattle 2aDextransxchemistryxpharmacokinetics. 2aEvans Bluexpharmacokinetics 2aFluorescein-5-isothiocyanatexchemistryxpharmacokinetics. 2aKidneyxblood supplyxmetabolism. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aNeurosecretory Systemsxblood supplyxmetabolism. 2aSerum Albumin, Bovinexchemistryxpharmacokinetics.1 aMiyata, Seiji0 tCell and tissue research.g2012 Aug., v. 349, no. 2 p.589-603dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-012-1421-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02518naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005700142245014600199300001600345500001400361520109800375592002801473650001901501650002501520650001501545650002201560650001601582650001501598650001701613650001501630650002201645650001401667650002101681651001001702653003401712653002601746653001401772653002301786700001401809700002401823773014001847856007601987852000902063655001202072IND60713612520221118002051.0201023e20200928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071361252DNAL7 a10.4001/003.028.03852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhalifa, M.H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8713-349210aHeavy Metal Accumulation and The Possible Correlation with Acetylcholinesterase Levels in Honey Bees from Polluted Areas of Alexandria, Egypt  ap. 385-393.  aNAL-light  aThis study aimed to use honey bees, Apis mellifera L., as bioindicator for a regional survey of heavy metal pollution in Alexandria city, Egypt. Honeybees were obtained from four different sites namely Abu Qir (AQ), Agricultural Road (AR), Khorshid (KR) and El-Sabahia (SB). Correlation between heavy metals and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as a biomarker was also examined. The mean concentration of measured elements (µg/g) ranged from 2.20–5.78, 1.53–0.83, 3.95–11.40, 19.10–44.43 and ND–4.25 (ND = not detected) for Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd, respectively. The highest mean value of metal quantities over a period of 5 months was Zn and the highest concentration mean for Zn and metals as a total occurred at the KR site. The highest mean values of AChE activity were noted in honey bees sampled from SB and KR followed by AQ and AR. However, AChE was found to positively correlate significantly with Zn. Our results suggest that AChE could be useful as a biomarker in honey bees exposed to Zn and may constitute a valuable biomonitor to assess environmental pollution by metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aacetylcholinesterase 3abiomarkers 3achemical elements 3acorrelation 3aentomology 3aheavy metals 3ahoney bees 3aindicator species 3apollution 3aregional surveys 3aEgypt 0aacetylcholinesterase activity 0abiological monitoring 0abiomarker 0ametal accumulation1 aAly, G.F.1 aAbdelhameed, K.M.A.0 tAfrican entomology.g2020 Sept. 28, v. 28, no. 2 p.385-393dEntomological Society of Southern AfricawJournal:jnl50015x1021-35897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4001/003.028.03853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03363naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245014300207500001900350520163700369592002802006650001802034650001902052650001802071650001602089650001902105650002602124650003202150650002102182650001102203650001702214650001702231650002002248650002602268650001502294650001502309650001402324650001602338650000902354650001302363650000902376651001002385653002402395653003202419653003402451700001702485700001202502700001602514700001602530700001702546700001802563773011002581856008502691852000902776655001202785IND60731419520221120183906.0210527e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073141952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1169472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Xiawei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4128-491410aCharacterizations of heavy metal contamination, microbial community, and resistance genes in a tailing of the largest copper mine in China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCopper mine tailings are causing great environmental concern nowadays due to their high contents of heavy metals. These hazards may release to air, water, and soil, posing great threat to the living organisms in the surroundings. In the present work, we profiled the heavy metal contents, microbiome and resistome of a mine tailing in Dexing Copper Mine, which is the largest open-pit copper mine in China. A total of 39.75 Gb clean data was generated by metagenomics sequencing and taxonomy analysis revealed Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Euryarchaeota, and Nitrospirae as the most abundant phylum in this tailing. In general, 76 heavy metal resistance genes (HMRGs) and 194 antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) were identified with merA and rpoB2 as the most abundant HMRG and ARG, respectively. We also compared the differences of heavy metal concentrations among the six sampling sites in the same tailing and found that significant differences exited in copper and zinc. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed that the samples from the six sampling sites were clustering in two groups based on heavy metal concentrations. Accordingly, clustering based on microbial composition and relative abundances of resistance genes exhibited the same clustering pattern, indicating a possible shaping influence of heavy metals on the microbiome and resistome in this tailing. Our work presented heavy metal contents, microbial composition and resistance genes in a copper mine tailing of the largest copper mine in China, and these data will of great use in the surveillance, maintenance, and remediation of this tailing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidobacteria 3aActinobacteria 3aEuryarchaeota 3aNitrospirae 3aProteobacteria 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotic resistance genes 3acluster analysis 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3ametagenomics 3ametal tolerance 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3amonitoring 3apollution 3aremediation 3asoil 3ataxonomy 3azinc 3aChina 0aCopper mine tailing 0aHeavy metal resistance gene 0aAntimicrobial resistance gene1 aLiu, Wenhong1 aXu, Hao1 aCui, Xinjie1 aLi, Junfeng1 aChen, Jurong1 aZheng, Beiwen0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 July 01, v. 280 p.116947-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1169473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011800156300001600274500002000290520130600310592002801616596008601644650001501730650002001745650000901765650001001774650001101784650001001795650002401805650002201829650002101851650002301872650001301895650001301908650002301921650004301944650002001987650002002007700001402027700001602041700001502057700001602072700001302088700005402101773011502155856007302270852000902343655001202352IND60749858820221122010721.0210908e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074985882DNAL7 a10.1111/age.131262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, J.

However, it is difficult to genetically improve intramuscular fat deposition via trait‐based cattle breeding. The main objectives of this study were to analyze the factors about beef flavor, and to detect functional microRNA (miRNA, miR) associated with intramuscular fat deposition in Yanbian cattle. Longissimus dorsi samples from six steers were separated into high‐ and low‐fat groups (n = 3 each) based on the marbling score, and transcriptomic analysis was performed using miRNA sequencing. A total of 33 miRNAs and 38 genes were found to be differentially expressed in the high‐ and low‐fat groups. Quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction was performed to validate the sequencing results. Integrated miRNA–mRNA analysis revealed that miRNA‐associated target genes were primarily associated with skeletal muscle development. However, some of the miRNAs (miR‐424 etc.) and genes (ATF3 etc.) were also associated with fat metabolism. A targeted relationship between miR‐22‐3p and the WFIKKN2 gene and its involvement in adipocyte differentiation were confirmed experimentally. The study findings may provide potential candidate molecular targets for the selection of cattle with improved meat quality.  aPublisher supplied data  a20160204017NYcScience and Technology Development Plan of Jilin Province of China 3aadipocytes 3aanimal genetics 3abeef 3afarms 3aflavor 3agenes 3agenetic improvement 3aintramuscular fat 3alipid metabolism 3alongissimus muscle 3amarbling 3amicroRNA 3amuscle development 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3askeletal muscle 3atranscriptomics1 aXu, H.

This increasing food demand places growing pressure on agricultural production at a time where there is little scope to expand agricultural lands. In addition, other constraining factors, such as climatic and soil constraints negatively impact agricultural productivity at global scale. To help ensure future food security, we must improve soil-crop management practices to achieve optimum productivity. One major area where productivity could be improved is for crops grown on dispersive sodic soils, which currently affect over 581 million ha worldwide. One strategy is to identify crops and/or cultivars that are more stress tolerant and productive on sodic soil and can improve agricultural productivity. However, limited work has been done to identify tolerant varieties and there is a pressing need for innovative and improved solutions to identify stress tolerance.In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based thermal imaging has been widely used in precision agriculture for detecting crop diseases and stress, and this technique has significant potential to also assess crop performance on sodic soils. In this review, we present the current understanding of how thermal imaging techniques can provide a viable technological solution to monitor crop temperature and quantify abiotic stress, which is one of the major causes for yield loss of the major rain-fed field crops, particularly wheat. To the best of our knowledge, no such detailed review has been published. Being able to identify plant stress is a primary requirement to identify more or less tolerant species or cultivars grown on sodic soil under rain-fed conditions. The aim of this review is to provide a clear and concise summary of the impacts of abiotic stress on crops and the use of UAV-thermal imaging, including sensors and calibration, data processing, advantages, and limitations in crop phenotyping, and particularly quantifying abiotic stress to help sustain productivity in sodic soil environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabiotic stress 3aagricultural productivity 3acultivars 3afood security 3aphenotype 3aplant stress 3aprecision agriculture 3asodic soils 3atemperature 3awheat 0aUAV-Thermal imaging 0aPhenotyping 0aSodic soil 0aYield loss1 aChapman, Scott1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4732-84521 aChristopher, Jack1 aChoudhury, Malini Roy1 aMenzies, Neal W.1 aApan, Armando1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5412-88811 aDang, Yash P.0 tRemote sensing applications.g2021 Aug., v. 23 p.100583-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23329x2352-93857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2021.1005833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245014000177500002200317520111100339592002801450650001301478650002101491650001201512650001101524650001001535650003101545650002701576650003001603650001501633650002101648650001601669650001301685650001501698653002201713653005701735653005601792653003601848653001901884700001801903700002601921700009601947773007802043856009002121852000902211655001202220IND60656964220221123020015.0190815e20190810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065696422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1245732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlimoradi, Sirwan10aEffect of temperature on toxicity and biodegradability of dissolved organic nitrogen formed during hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass  aPre-press version  aThis study investigated the nutrient content and reuse potential of wastewater generated during hydrothermal liquefaction of microalgal biomass. The hydrothermal liquefaction reaction was tested at 270, 300, 330, and 345 °C to determine the effect of temperature on the formation of non-biodegradable dissolved organic nitrogen (nbDON). Total nitrogen, ammonium, color, and toxicity were selected as key characteristics for the reuse of hydrothermal liquefaction wastewater. Results indicated that a higher concentration of nbDON5 (nbDON defined with a 5 day growth assay) and more diverse heterocyclic N-containing organic compounds were associated with greater toxicity as measured by a growth rate assay. For the tested temperature ranges, the total nitrogen content of the hydrothermal liquefaction wastewater slightly decreased from 5020 ± 690 mg L−1 to 4160 ± 120 mg L−1, but the % nbDON5 fraction increased from 57 ± 3 %DON to 96 ± 5 %DON. The temperature of hydrothermal liquefaction reactions can be optimized to maximize carbon conversion and nitrogen recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3abiodegradability 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acolor 3adissolved organic nitrogen 3aheterocyclic compounds 3ahydrothermal liquefaction 3amicroalgae 3anutrient content 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3awastewater 0aNitrogen recovery 0aNon-biodegradable dissolved organic nitrogen (nbDON) 0aHeterocyclic N-Containing organic compounds (HNOCs) 0aHydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) 0aHTL wastewater1 aStohr, Hannah1 aStagg-Williams, Susan1 aSturm, Belinda1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5010-2078 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5010-20780 tChemosphere.g2019 Aug. 10, dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1245733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245014500164300001600309500001400325520141000339592002801749650001601777650002101793650003501814650001601849650001601865650001201881650001001893650001401903650001501917650001001932650001701942650001301959650001801972650001201990650001102002650001402013650001502027650000702042650001302049650001602062650001402078650000902092650001302101650001002114650001502124651001302139653001502152653001502167653002002182700001602202700001502218700001502233773014002248856007602388852000902464655001202473IND60713612720221118001924.0201023e20200928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071361272DNAL7 a10.4001/003.028.04062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aS.

This wastewater is used to irrigate different crops and trees. This study was planned to observe the entry of Cd from inorganic to organic source and its effects on the lifecycle of Bombyx mori (L.). Mulberry plants were irrigated with Cd-containing synthetic effluents of different concentrations (25 to 200 mg/l) at pH 5, and different levels of pH (3 to 5) at 100 mg/l, to check against different instars of silkworm. The amount of Cd in the samples of soil, mulberry leaves, silkworm larvae, silkworm faeces and silk glands were determined by using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). The results showed that B. mori can be used as an indicator of Cd pollutants because its body weight, body length and mortality rate was directly related to Cd concentration. Greater toxicity to silkworms was observed at higher accumulation of Cd in mulberry leaves. Maximum accumulation of Cd in soil, mulberry plants, silkworm larvae, silk glands and silkworm faeces was observed at 200 mg/l Cd and pH 5. The maximum accumulations observed were 99.89 mg/kg, 95.67 mg/kg, 61.32 mg/kg, 58.97 mg/kg and 6.59 mg/kg, respectively. Silkworms can be successfully used as an indicator of heavy metal pollutants and their role can further be marked with changes in the development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombyx mori 3aMorus (Moraceae) 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abody length 3abody weight 3acadmium 3acrops 3aeffluents 3aentomology 3afeces 3aheavy metals 3aindustry 3ainsect larvae 3ainstars 3aleaves 3amortality 3amulberries 3apH 3asampling 3asilk glands 3asilkworms 3asoil 3atoxicity 3atrees 3awastewater 3aPakistan 0aMorus alba 0afood chain 0abioaccumulation1 aHasan, M.U.1 aSageer, M.1 aSahi, S.T.0 tAfrican entomology.g2020 Sept. 28, v. 28, no. 2 p.406-414dEntomological Society of Southern AfricawJournal:jnl50015x1021-35897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4001/003.028.04063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005500142245012000197500002000317520166700337592002802004596007802032650002502110650001502135650001102150650001302161650001602174650001602190650001502206651001602221700005802237700005402295773013602349856007702485852000902562655001202571IND60790236820221120124524.0220824e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079023682DNAL7 a10.1029/2020JB0195242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Chunyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5500-820810aSeismic Velocity Changes Caused by Water Table Fluctuation in the New Madrid Seismic Zone and Mississippi Embayment  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe use cross correlation of the ambient seismic field to estimate seasonal variations of seismic velocity in the Mississippi Embayment and to determine the underlying physical mechanisms. Our main observation is that the δt/t variations correlate primarily with the water table fluctuation, with the largest positive value from May to July and the largest negative value in September/October relative to the annual mean. The δv/v residuals after water level fluctuation correction correlate with air pressure in the short term and follow the trend of temperature in the long term. The δv/v residuals after water level fluctuation and air pressure correction correlate inversely with the wind speed. The correlation coefficients between water table fluctuation and δt/t are independent of the interstation distance and frequency, but high coefficients are observed more often between 0.3 and 1 Hz than between 1 and 2 Hz because high‐frequency coherent signals attenuate faster than low‐frequency ones. The δt/t variations lag behind the water table fluctuation by about 20 days, which suggests that the velocity changes can be attributed to the pore pressure diffusion effect. The seasonal variations of δt/t are azimuthally independent, and a large increase of noise amplitude only introduces a small increase to the δt/t variation. At close distances, the maximum δt/t holds a wide range of values, which is likely related to local structure. At larger distances, velocity variations sample a larger region so that it stabilizes to a more uniform value. We find that the observed changes in wave speed can be explained by a poroelastic model.  aPublisher supplied data  a89233218CNA000001cDOE Office of Basic Energy Science, Geoscience Program 3aatmospheric pressure 3ageophysics 3amodels 3aresearch 3atemperature 3awater table 3awind speed 3aMississippi1 aAslam, Khurram1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1840-76371 aDaub, Eric1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8499-07200 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 Aug., v. 125, no. 8 p.e2020JB019524-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JB0195243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245019000156300001800346500002000364520154000384592002801924650002501952650002201977650002601999650002002025650000902045650002302054650001802077650001402095650001302109650001402122650001502136650001502151650002202166650001602188700002002204700002402224700001802248700002502266700002202291773010502313856007302418852000902491655001202500IND60577624220221122083345.0170809e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057762422DNAL7 a10.1111/are.133002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAddo, Samuel10aEffects of Bacillus subtilis strains and the prebiotic Previda® on growth, immune parameters and susceptibility to Aeromonas hydrophila infection in Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus  ap. 4798-4810.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study was conducted to evaluate the individual and combined effects of long‐term feeding of diets containing two probiotic Bacillus subtilis group strains (Aqua NZ and AP193) and the prebiotic Previda®, a commercial hemicellulose extract, on growth performance, immune parameters and Aeromonas hydrophila susceptibility of juvenile Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. Nile tilapia of average weight 7.47 ± 0.11 g were fed diets formulated with the probiotics and/or the prebiotic, or a control diet for 8 weeks and, subsequently, challenged with A. hydrophila by intragastric gavage at a dosage of 3.9 × 10⁷ CFU per fish. Fish attained a mean weight of 59.5 ± 0.99 g at the end of the growth period. Under the conditions of the present trial, none of the diets significantly improved mean per cent weight gain (P = 0.70), thermal growth coefficient (P = 0.88) or feed conversion ratio (P = 0.87) of Nile tilapia. Except for the diet containing the prebiotic Previda® only (P = 0.17), all other diets resulted in significantly higher fish survival compared to the control (P < 0.05). The combined effect of the prebiotic and probiotic strains emerged as the most important diet with respect to mortality reduction. The mean lysozyme and respiratory burst activities did not show any significant differences between treatments and control (P = 0.14 and 0.32, respectively). Thus, these probiotic strains used in this study have the potential to prevent disease due to A. hydrophila in O. niloticus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aBacillus subtilis 3aOreochromis niloticus 3afeed conversion 3afish 3agrowth performance 3ahemicellulose 3ajuveniles 3alysozyme 3amortality 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3arespiratory burst 3aweight gain1 aCarrias, Abel A1 aWilliams, Malachi A1 aLiles, Mark R1 aTerhune, Jeffery S.,1 aDavis, Donald A.,0 tAquaculture research.g2017 Sept., v. 48, no. 9 p.4798-4810dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.133003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02123naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008100158300001800239520097200257592002801229650003701257650001101294650002401305650001001329650002101339650001601360650001901376650002201395650001401417700001901431700002701450700001901477700002001496700001701516773012101533856007401654852000901728655001201737IND60640064820221122045939.0190504e20160106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064006482DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra20156j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoefoed, Line10aOne-step preparation of bifunctionalized surfaces by bipolar electrografting  ap. 3882-3887.  aBipolar electrochemistry (BPE) is widely used to trigger electrochemical reactions on conducting objects without direct electrical wiring. In this study a novel methodology is reported, which for the first time allows simultaneous deposition of two different organic films at each end of a glassy carbon substrate (1 × 1 cm²). The approach is based on the use of an organic bifunctional molecule, which may be oxidatively and reductively electrografted at the same time. The reduction process goes through the diazonium group, while the oxidation proceeds via the primary amine. The double functionalized plates are investigated by ellipsometry, cyclic voltammetry, condensation imaging, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. Post-modification of one of the anchoring layers illustrates the versatility of the system, pointing to its potential use in fields going from molecular electronics to targeted drug delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acarbon 3adiazonium compounds 3adrugs 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectronics 3aimage analysis 3amass spectrometry 3aoxidation1 aShimizu, Kyoko1 aPedersen, Steen Uttrup1 aDaasbjerg, Kim1 aKuhn, Alexander1 aZigah, Dodzi0 tRSC advances.g2016 Jan. 06, v. 6, no. 5 p.3882-3887dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra20156j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02362naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010000174520100800274592002801282650001801310650001901328650001301347650001201360650002501372650001301397650000901410650001301419650000901432650001501441650001701456650001101473650001701484650000901501650001801510650001601528650001701544650002301561650001901584700002601603700002001629700002401649773012601673856008401799852000901883655001201892IND60682716120221120165810.0200131e20191002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068271612DNAL7 a10.3390/horticulturae50400692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlejar, Kenneth  J.12aA Horticultural Medium Established from the Rapid Removal of Phytotoxins from Winery Grape Marc  aGrape (Vitis vinifera L.) marc has long been utilized as a compost feedstock. However, this process takes an extended period of time due to the phytotoxic chemical composition of the marc. Removal of these compounds presents an opportunity to utilize the grape marc as a growing medium. Following a water-based extraction procedure to remove polyphenolic compounds of interest, analysis of the depleted marc showed a decrease in the content of these compounds, and in nutrient and trace element levels. Carrot (Daucus carota L.) and corn (Zea mays L.) seedling emergence in the depleted marc and blends with compost were not adversely affected, demonstrating its effectiveness for growing plants at all ratios. A 50:50 blend of compost and depleted grape marc resulted in plant growth equivalent to the compost alone. This combined with the observed water holding capacity suggests that depleted grape marc, when blended with compost, can be a suitable alternative to peat or coconut coir for seedlings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaucus carota 3aVitis vinifera 3aZea mays 3acarrots 3achemical composition 3acoconuts 3acoir 3acomposts 3acorn 3afeedstocks 3agrape pomace 3agrapes 3ahorticulture 3apeat 3aphytotoxicity 3aphytotoxins 3aplant growth 3aseedling emergence 3atrace elements1 aVandermeer, Charlotte1 aFedrizzi, Bruno1 aKilmartin, Paul  A.0 tHorticulturae.g2019 Oct. 02, v. 5, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27142x2311-75247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae50400693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01450naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010700161300001800268520038200286592002800668650002300696650001300719650001700732650002400749650001800773650000700791650001100798650002100809700001700830700001700847700001900864773013400883856007401017852000901091655001201100IND60638660820221121121346.0190430e20160216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063866082DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc09743f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHellstern, H.

Responding to Exploitative Business Systems in Person and Online  ap. 1-19.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAustralian consumer protection law contains broad and flexible prohibitions on misleading and unconscionable conduct in trade or commerce. Yet concerns have been raised that these prohibitions are unsuitable for responding to predatory business systems. These are businesses that, by design or operation, target consumers experiencing vulnerability to offer costly products ill-suited to their needs. This concern has arisen in response to prominent instances of products of dubious efficacy offered to marginalized communities. It has also arisen from concerns over the increasing potential for data-driven digital marketing to manipulate consumer choice by targeting with fine-grained accuracy consumer vulnerabilities. In response to these concerns, it has been suggested that the Australian Consumer Law should be reformed, by introducing a prohibition on “unfair trading” inspired by the general prohibitions on such conduct in the EU and USA. This paper explores the key considerations relevant in assessing the merits of this proposed statutory “transplant.” Ultimately, the paper is supportive of the proposed reform, while also recognizing its limits.  aPublisher supplied data  aDP180100932cAustralian Research Council 3aconsumer preferences 3aconsumer protection 3aissues and policy 3atrade 3aAustralia1 aBant, E.0 tJournal of consumer policy.g2021 Mar., v. 44, no. 1 p.1-19dSpringer USwJournal:jnl39366x0168-70347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10603-020-09467-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03641naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005200139245008600191300001600277500002000293520177800313592002802091596006602119650001902185650004102204650002002245650002502265650002802290650002302318650002002341650001002361650003402371650001302405650001502418650001002433650001502443650001202458650001902470650001102489650002402500650000902524650002502533650001702558650002202575700001802597700006502615700001902680700001402699700001802713700002802731700001302759700001602772700005402788773011502842856007302957852000903030655001203039IND60749859220221122010710.0210908e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074985922DNAL7 a10.1111/age.131132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8800-315810aDetecting the footprint of selection on the genomes of Murciano‐Granadina goats  ap. 683-693.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aArtificial selection is one of the major forces modifying the genetic composition of livestock populations. Identifying genes under selection could be useful to elucidate their impact on phenotypic variation. We aimed to identify genomic regions targeted by selection for dairy and pigmentation traits in Murciano‐Granadina goats. Performance of a selection scan based on the integrated haplotype score test in a population of 1183 Murciano‐Granadina goats resulted in the identification of 77 candidate genomic regions/SNPs. The most significant selective sweeps mapped to chromosomes 1 (69.86 Mb), 4 (41.80–49.95 Mb), 11 (65.74 Mb), 12 (31.24 and 52.51 Mb), 17 (34.76–37.67 Mb), 22 (31.75 Mb), and 26 (26.69–31.05 Mb). By using previously generated RNA‐Seq data, we built a catalogue of 6414 genes that are differentially expressed across goat lactation (i.e. 78 days post‐partum, early lactation; 216 days post‐partum, late lactation; 285 days post‐partum, dry period). Interestingly, 183 of these genes mapped to selective sweeps and several of them display functions related with lipid, protein, and carbohydrate metabolism, insulin signaling, cell proliferation, as well as mammary development and involution. Of particular interest are the CSN3 and CSN1S2 genes, which encode two major milk proteins. Additionally, we found three pigmentation genes (GLI3, MC1R, and MITF) co‐localizing with selective sweeps. Performance of a genome‐wide association study and Sanger sequencing and TaqMan genotyping experiments revealed that the c.801C>G (p.Cys267Trp) polymorphism in the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene is the main determinant of the black (GG or GC genotypes) and brown (CC genotypes) colorations of Murciano‐Granadina goats.  aPublisher supplied data  aPID2019‐105805RB‐I00cMinisterio de Ciencia e Innovación 3aMurcia-Granada 3aalpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone 3aanimal genetics 3aartificial selection 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acell proliferation 3aearly lactation 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3agoats 3ahaplotypes 3ainsulin 3alate lactation 3alipids 3amammary development 3amilk 3aphenotypic variation 3apigmentation 3asequence analysis1 aMartinez, A.,1 aLuigi‐Sierra, M.

The aim of irrigation scheduling is to supply the correct amount of water to the crops and define appropriate irrigation times. The rational behavior of intelligent agents added to internet of things technologies could be a strategy for improving the performance of automatic irrigation systems. This paper presents the design and implementation of a cyber-physical crop irrigation system, based on the intelligent agent concept. The system allows the acquisition of field information through sensors, the application of water according to a decision system and the activation of solenoid valves. Communication capabilities and the performance measurement, the environment, the actuation and sensing systems (PEAS) are explained. Monitoring in the farm or remotely from other locations is achieved with a central station and its internet connectivity. The performance evaluation of the system was made using crop modelling software and an experimental crop in a field located in the large-scale irrigation and drainage district of Chicamocha and Firavitoba (Usochicamocha) in Boyacá – Colombia. The developed system allowed maintaining soil moisture close to field capacity with several irrigation strategies, and avoiding losses and excesses in the use of water resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aagriculture 3acomputer software 3acrop management 3aelectronics 3afarms 3afield capacity 3ahorticulture 3asoil water 3aColombia 0aArtificial intelligence 0aCyber-physical system 0aIntelligent agent 0aIrrigation 0aPrecision agriculture1 aCardenas, Pedro-F1 aJimenez, Fabian1 aRuiz-Canales, Antonio1 aLópez, Angel,0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2020 Nov., v. 178 p.105777-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2020.1057773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100002500158245010600183300001300289520168200302592002801984650001102012650001302023650001002036650000902046650001202055650002202067650001002089650000802099650002802107650001402135650002002149650001002169650001002179650001302189650001402202650002902216650001202245650001002257650001702267653001702284653002202301653001202323653001302335653001302348653001102361700003802372700003402410700002102444700003902465700001702504773009502521856009302616852000902709655001202718IND60581007220221118001318.0190318e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058100722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2017.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Bizri, Hani Rocha10aEmbryonic and fetal morphology in the lowland paca (Cuniculus paca): A precocial hystricomorph rodent  ap. 7-17.  aIn mammals, the embryonic and fetal development of a species has evolved to maximize neonatal survival. In this study, we use a sample of 132 embryos/fetuses of wild lowland paca (Cuniculus paca), obtained over a period of 15 years through collaborative methods with local hunters in the Amazon to describe the intrauterine development of external and internal morphology of this Neotropical rodent. We also compare the newborn survival strategy in this species with other rodents. The crown-rump length (CRL) ranged between 0.6 and 24.6 cm. External features appeared in the following chronological order: limbs, eyelid buds, fusioned eyelids, genitalia, outer ear, tactile pelage, claws, skin, skin spots, covering pelage, teeth and open eyelids. Fetuses with CRL >19.5 cm presented all external features fully developed. The growth formula of fetal age was calculated as ∛W = 0.082 (t - 37.25), and age was accurately associated with CRL. We described the relationship between CRL and external and internal biometry. The liver declined in proportion within the internal cavity, while the relative volume of tubular gastrointestinal organs increased significantly along the embryo/fetal development. All organs, except the heart and the thymus, had similar relative volumes in advanced fetuses and adults. Our comparison of the intrauterine development in several rodent species indicates that the paca's reproductive strategy is comparable to species that are subject to low natural predation. Given that C. paca is perhaps the most hunted animal in Latin America, sustainable hunting throughout its range must take into account its relative reproductive performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abiometry 3aclaws 3aears 3aeyelids 3afetal development 3afetus 3afur 3agastrointestinal system 3agenitalia 3agestational age 3aheart 3aliver 3aneonates 3apredation 3areproductive performance 3arodents 3ateeth 3athymus gland 0aReproduction 0aFetal development 0aMammals 0aSurvival 0aRodentia 0aAmazon1 aMonteiro, Frederico Ozanan Barros1 ade Andrade, Rafael dos Santos1 aValsecchi, João1 aGuimarães, Diva Anelie de Araújo1 aMayor, Pedro0 tTheriogenology.g2017 Dec., v. 104 p.7-17dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2017.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02090naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010000172520107500272592002801347650001701375650002001392650001101412650001301423650002001436650001401456700003401470700003101504700002201535773012601557856008401683852000901767655001201776IND60682716320221120174824.0200131e20191009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068271632DNAL7 a10.3390/horticulturae50400712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCervantes, Emilio13aAn Angiosperm Species Dataset Reveals Relationships between Seed Size and Two-Dimensional Shape  aDatasets containing information on seed size have been published and are currently available. Nevertheless, there is a lack in the literature of a dataset dedicated to seed shape. We present a preliminary version for a dataset on seed morphology based on a comparison of seed shape with geometric figures. Similarity of the outline of seed images with geometric models is considered as a basis to classify seeds according to the geometric figures they resemble (e.g., ellipse, oval, cardioid). This allows, first, the classification of plant species according to their geometric type of seed, and second, seed shape quantification. For each seed image, the percent of similarity of their outline with a geometric figure can be calculated as a J index. Similarity in absolute terms is considered only when the J index >90. This criterion is important to avoid ambiguity and increase discrimination. The dataset opens the possibility of studying the relationship between seed shape and other variables such as seed size, genome complexity, life form or adaptive responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngiospermae 3adata collection 3agenome 3ageometry 3aseed morphology 3aseed size1 aMartín Gómez, José  Javier1 aGutiérrez del Pozo, Diego1 aSilva Dias, Luís0 tHorticulturae.g2019 Oct. 09, v. 5, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27142x2311-75247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae50400713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01994naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012700154300001800281520092200299592002801221650001501249650001901264650001501283650001401298650003001312650001501342700001401357700001601371700001801387700001801405700001701423773012101440856007401561852000901635655001201644IND60640065020221122050110.0190504e20160111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064006502DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra20161f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xin10aPerformance enhancement in ZnO nanowire based double Schottky-barrier photodetector by applying optimized Ag nanoparticles  ap. 4634-4639.  aIn this work, a UV photodetector made of a ZnO nanowire with double Schottky Barrier (SB) contacts was fabricated by an electric field guided assembly process. Then the Ag-nanowire composite in the device was achieved through an RF metal sputtering method. Under 5 V bias, the values of responsivity and photoconduction gain of the final device could reach up to 4.91 × 10⁶ A W⁻¹ and 1.67 × 10⁷, respectively. Surprisingly, the device covered with optimized Ag nanoparticles still presented its spectrum selectivity in the visible-blind band. The nonlinear behavior at small bias was governed by the reversely biased SB contacts. After introducing Ag nanoparticles, the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) induced absorption could account for the enhanced performance. In addition, the increased dark current was attributed to the involuntary introduction of localized gating effect near the contacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aelectric field 3ananosilver 3ananowires 3asurface plasmon resonance 3azinc oxide1 aWang, Fei1 aShi, Linlin1 aWang, Yunpeng1 aZhao, Haifeng1 aZhao, Dongxu0 tRSC advances.g2016 Jan. 11, v. 6, no. 6 p.4634-4639dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra20161f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001800158245009700176300001600273520155500289592002801844650001801872650002101890650001401911650001101925650001201936650001101948650002101959650002601980650002202006650001202028650002502040650002502065650002202090650002802112650002802140700002402168700002102192700002302213700002302236700002102259700002002280773019202300856007302492852000902565655001202574IND60080465920221122053118.0150206e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008046592DNAL7 a248623402pmid7 a10.1111/tpj.125652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeitkam, Tony10aProfiling of extensively diversified plant LINEs reveals distinct plant‐specific subclades  ap. 385-397.  aA large fraction of eukaryotic genomes is made up of long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs). Due to their capability to create novel copies via error‐prone reverse transcription, they generate multiple families and reach high copy numbers. Although mammalian LINEs have been well described, plant LINEs have been only poorly investigated. Here, we present a systematic cross‐species survey of LINEs in higher plant genomes shedding light on plant LINE evolution as well as diversity, and facilitating their annotation in genome projects. Applying a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)‐based analysis, 59 390 intact LINE reverse transcriptases (RTs) were extracted from 23 plant genomes. These fall in only two out of 28 LINE clades (L1 and RTE) known in eukaryotes. While plant RTE LINEs are highly homogenous and mostly constitute only a single family per genome, plant L1 LINEs are extremely diverse and form numerous families. Despite their heterogeneity, all members across the 23 species fall into only seven L1 subclades, some of them defined here. Exemplarily focusing on the L1 LINEs of a basal reference plant genome (Beta vulgaris), we show that the subclade classification level does not only reflect RT sequence similarity, but also mirrors structural aspects of complete LINE retrotransposons, like element size, position and type of encoded enzymatic domains. Our comprehensive catalogue of plant LINE RTs serves the classification of highly diverse plant LINEs, while the provided subclade‐specific HMMs facilitate their annotation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeta vulgaris 3aeukaryotic cells 3aevolution 3agenome 3amammals 3amodels 3aretrotransposons 3areverse transcription 3asequence homology 3asurveys 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenome, Plantxgenetics 2aRetroelementsxgenetics1 aHoltgräwe, Daniela1 aDohm, Juliane C.1 aMinoche, André E.1 aHimmelbauer, Heinz1 aWeisshaar, Bernd1 aSchmidt, Thomas0 tplant journal.g2014 Aug., v. 79, no. 3 p.385-397dBlackwell Scientific Publishers and BIOS Scientific Publishers in association with the Society for Experimental Biologyx0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.125653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005600142245012900198500002000327520162000347592002801967596005501995596006602050596004702116596004702163596008002210650001702290650002102307650001302328650000902341650002002350650001702370650001502387650001302402650001402415650001602429651001302445700005902458700005702517773013702574856007702711852000902788655001202797IND60790237320221120124353.0220824e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079023732DNAL7 a10.1029/2019JB0192902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Youqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2115-505510aTopography of the 410 and 660 km Discontinuities Beneath the Cenozoic Okavango Rift Zone and Adjacent Precambrian Provinces  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBy taking advantage of the recent availability of a broadband seismic data set from Networks NR and BX covering the entire country of Botswana, we conduct a systematic receiver function investigation of the topography of the 410 and 660 km discontinuities beneath the incipient Okavango rift zone (ORZ) in northern Botswana and its adjacent Archean‐Proterozoic tectonic provinces in southern Africa. Similar to a previous mantle transition zone (MTZ) discontinuity study using data from a 1‐D profile traversing the ORZ, a normal MTZ thickness is observed in most parts of the study area. This is inconsistent with the existence of widespread positive thermal anomalies in the MTZ and further implies that active thermal upwelling from the lower mantle plays an insignificant role in the initiation of continental rifting. The results also suggest that cold temperature presumably associated with thick cratonic keels has indiscernible influence on the thermal structure of the MTZ. The expanded data set reveals several isolated areas of slight (~10 km or smaller) MTZ thinning. The largest of such areas has a NE‐SW elongated shape and is mostly caused by relative deepening of the 410 km discontinuity rather than shallowing of the 660 km discontinuity. These characteristics are different from those expected for a typical mantle plume. We speculate that the thinner‐than‐normal MTZ may be induced by minor thermal upwelling associated with late Mesozoic‐early Cenozoic lithospheric delamination, a recently proposed mechanism that might be responsible for the high elevation of southern Africa.  aPublisher supplied data  aPRF‐60281‐ND8cAmerican Chemical Society (ACS)  a41606043cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)  a1009946cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  a1919789cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  aGASIGEOGE‐05cNational Program on Global Change and Air‐Sea Interaction 3aCenozoic era 3aPrecambrian time 3aaltitude 3acold 3adata collection 3adelamination 3ageophysics 3aresearch 3atectonics 3atemperature 3aBotswana1 aGao, Stephen S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7530-71281 aLiu, Kelly H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7691-95560 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 Sept., v. 125, no. 9 p.e2019JB019290-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JB0192903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03530naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245017300177300001600350520200300366592002802369596007502397650001702472650002902489650001402518650001002532650001402542650003302556650001502589650001602604650001902620650001102639650001002650650003702660650001902697700003302716700002702749700003002776700002502806700003402831773012802865856008202993852000903075655001203084IND60479651320221120183427.0210924e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047965132DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-015-4797-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSampieri, Bruno Rodrigues10aComparative analysis of spermatids of Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (Ixodidae) and Ornithodoros rostratus ticks (Argasidae): morphophysiology aimed at systematics  ap. 735-743.  aThe phylogenetic relationships among tick species (Acari: Ixodida) have been revisited by several researchers over the last decades. Two subfamilies, Rhipicephalinae (Ixodidae) and Ornithodorinae (Argasidae), deserve special attention. The male reproductive system morphology, as well as the ultrastructure of the germ cells, may provide important information for phylogeny and systematics of metazoan groups, with spermatozoa exhibiting characters that can be used for this purpose. With that information in mind, this study aimed at evaluating, through a comparative analysis, the morphology of the male reproductive systems and germ cells of ticks species Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Ornithodoros rostratus. In order to do that, histology and scanning electron microscopy techniques were used. The results have shown that despite the similarities in the general morphology of the male reproductive system among studied Ixodida so far, there are morphological differences among the species studied herein, mainly the U-shaped testis (ancestral character) in O. rostratus and the pair testes (derived character) in R. sanguineus, and the general morphology of germ cells (spermatids V). Besides that, the morphological changes observed during the spermiogenesis appear to be different between the species studied here, probably characterizing the two families considered. The data generated in this study showed the importance of comparative internal morphology studies, mainly in regard to spermatology, despite the morphological data obtained herein not being enough to product a cladogram (sperm cladistics), it was already possible to observe clear differences among families Argasidae and Ixodidae in regard to the organization of their male reproductive systems and concerning the external morphology of spermatids. Data yet to be obtained through transmission electron microscopy techniques will allow the application of spermiocladistics and spermiotaxonomy as tools for tick systematics.  aPublisher supplied data  a2012/02384-8cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo 3aOrnithodoros 3aRhipicephalus sanguineus 3ahistology 3amales 3aphylogeny 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspermatids 3aspermatozoa 3aspermiogenesis 3atestes 3aticks 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrastructure1 aCalligaris, Izabela Bragião1 ada Silva Matos, Renata1 aPáez, Fredy Arvey Rivera1 aBueno, Odair Corrêa1 aCamargo-Mathias, Maria Izabel0 tParasitology research.g2016 Feb., v. 115, no. 2 p.735-743dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-015-4797-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03495naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245018300175300001600358500001400374520188400388592002802272650003002300650001802330650001502348650001902363650001702382650001702399650003402416650002202450650001702472650001902489650001102508650002002519650001002539650001502549650002402564650001902588650001602607653003002623653002202653653001702675653001502692653001502707700001802722700003002740773011302770856008502883852000902968655001202977IND60718605720221120033856.0201125e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071860572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.07.3152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShamshirband, Mehdi10aDecentralized trading of plug-in electric vehicle aggregation agents for optimal energy management of smart renewable penetrated microgrids with the aim of CO2 emission reduction  ap. 622-640.  aNAL-light  aWith a significant increase in concerns about global warming and lack of fossil fuels reserves as well as the requirements for clean energy production, the electrification of transportation in smart microgrids (SMG) has become an undeniable solution to respond to existing challenges. The distribution network operator (DNO), as responsible utility for optimal management of SMG, tries to optimize the procurement costs of network in such a way that all technical constraints of network are thoroughly met considering environmental obligations. In so doing, this paper proposes a novel eco-friendly scheme for optimal charging/discharging scheduling of plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) aggregators in SMG to minimize the procurement costs of system as well as reducing CO₂ emission with taking into account various types of PEV (i.e., BEV and PHEV). The Vehicle to Grid (V2G) capability as well as the actual patterns of drivers are taken into account in the proposed model. The impact of PEVs aggregation agents on the operation costs, purchasing power from upstream network, air pollution as well as technical specifications of system such as power losses and voltage profile has been investigated under practical constraints of PEVs, heterogeneous DERs and distribution network. In addition, the uncertainties subject to renewable generations are handled by stochastic programming to mitigate their minus effects on the profit of system. The weighted sum approach is employed to convert the multi-objective problem into a single-objective MINLP model and subsequently is minimized by collaborative grey wolf optimizer and Taguchi test method to acquire a satisfactory solution. Finally, an illustrative case study is provided to acknowledge the sufficiency of the proposed framework by performing it on the modified IEEE 69-bus system with integration of renewable resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aair pollution 3aalgorithms 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3aclean energy 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectric vehicles 3afossil fuels 3aglobal warming 3amodels 3aoperating costs 3apaper 3apurchasing 3arenewable resources 3atransportation 3auncertainty 0aPlug-in electric vehicles 0aEnergy management 0aCO2 emission 0aSmart grid 0aRenewables1 aSalehi, Javad1 aGazijahani, Farhad Samadi0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 200 p.622-640dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.07.3153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03068naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001500137245014800152300001800300500001500318520158600333592002801919650002001947650002601967650001101993650002302004650001402027650001602041650001202057650001402069650002402083650001102107650001302118650003702131650001902168650001202187653001602199653003102215653001002246653001102256700002102267700002002288700001802308700001702326700002302343773011602366856007102482852000902553655001202562IND60626352320221121204928.0181220s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062635232DNAL7 a10.1071/FP172832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBresta, P.10aHow does long-term drought acclimation modify structure-function relationships? A quantitative approach to leaf phenotypic plasticity of barley  ap. 1181-1194.  a2019-12-06  aUnder drought conditions the growth and survival of a plant depend on its adaptive characteristics and acclimation ability. Adaptation refers to inherent morpho-physiological characters providing protection against water losses. Acclimation, however, is a special case of phenotypic plasticity: environment-dependent phenotypic expression resulting to a ‘new’ phenotype through drought-induced modulations in leaf morphology, anatomy and physiology. Given that phenotypic plasticity influences environmental tolerance, a multi-trait plasticity index could be of great importance. Therefore, we examined the acclimation processes of three different barley genotypes using a multi-trait plasticity assessment with emphasis on the leaf water economy-related traits. Our results showed that (i) the structure–function co-ordination during long-term drought acclimation follows the trade-off between carbon gain and water saving as well as the competition between investments in photosynthesis vs synthesis of protective compounds; (ii) the genotypes with smaller leaf area, narrower and denser veins, as well as smaller and denser stomata i.e. traits providing tolerance, exhibited less drastic adjustments under stress conditions, suggesting a trade-off between acclimation and tolerance-adaptation; and (iii) the slope values of a multi-trait ‘reaction norm’ based on regression analysis of PCA scores were indicative of the degree of plasticity for each genotype, providing an accurate representation of a complex set of data with single numeric results easily comparable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aleaf morphology 3aphenotypic plasticity 3abarley 3awater conservation 3aphenotype 3aacclimation 3adrought 3aleaf area 3aregression analysis 3acarbon 3agenotype 3astructure-activity relationships 3aphotosynthesis 3astomata 0aHordeum spp 0aadaptation; drought stress 0axylem 0aleaves1 aNikolopoulos, D.1 aStavroulaki, V.1 aVahamidis, P.1 aEconomou, G.1 aKarabourniotis, G.0 tFunctional plant biology.g2018, v. 45, no. 12 p.1181-1194dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl70735x1445-44087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP172833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245006100174300001400235520102300249592002801272650002401300650002101324650003601345650001701381650004601398650001701444650002301461650001401484650001901498650002301517650002201540650002301562650001401585650001301599650001601612650002501628650001201653650001501665700002301680700002001703700002001723700002301743700002101766700002001787773011301807856008101920852000902001655001202010IND60083163320221119130537.0141101e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008316332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2011.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBystranowska, Dominika10aIntramolecular cross-linking in the native JHBP molecule  ap. 12-19.  aJuvenile hormone binding protein (JHBP) acts as a shuttle, carrying one of the most crucial hormones for insect development to target tissues. We have found that although the JHBP molecule does not contain tryptophan residues, it exhibits a weak fluorescence maximum near 420nm upon excitation at 315nm. Gel filtration experiments performed in denaturing conditions and ESI-MS analyses excluded the possibility that some low molecular ligand was bound to the protein molecules. Further UV and CD spectroscopy studies, as well as immunoblotting, showed that the unusual JHBP optical properties were due to dityrosine intramolecular cross-linking. These bridges were detected both in native and recombinant protein molecules. We believe that in Galleria mellonella hemolymph the DT generation occurs via ROS-mediated oxidation leading to the formation of cross-linked JHBP monomers. MS analyses of peptides generated after JHBP proteolysis indicated, that the dityrosine bridge occurs between the Y128 and Y130 residues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGalleria mellonella 3abinding proteins 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acrosslinking 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3afluorescence 3agel chromatography 3ahemolymph 3aimmunoblotting 3ainsect development 3ajuvenile hormones 3aoptical properties 3aoxidation 3apeptides 3aproteolysis 3arecombinant proteins 3atissues 3atryptophan1 aSzewczuk, Zbigniew1 aLisowski, Marek1 aSitkiewicz, Ewa1 aDobryszycki, Piotr1 aOżyhar, Andrzej1 aKochman, Marian0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 517, no. 1 p.12-19dElsevier Inc.x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2011.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02424naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011400175300001800289520113100307592002801438650001901466650001801485650002001503650001001523650003101533650002101564650001001585650001701595650002301612650001901635650001201654650002101666650001301687651000901700653002701709653002401736700001701760773013101777856008501908852000901993655001202002IND60667718320221118070430.0190919e20191003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066771832DNAL7 a10.1080/10807039.2018.14752172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhaedrahmati, Safar10aHealth risk assessment of relationship between air pollutants' density and population density in Tehran, Iran  ap. 1853-1869.  aHigh levels of air pollutants in the Tehran city are a serious threat to the citizens' health, which are also occupying the city authorities' minds in the recent years. In this research, our attempt is to identify the highly polluted districts among the 22, which are exposed to widespread toxic gases, and to evaluate their distributive effects on the population density in the same districts. The studied pollutants were CO, O₃, NO₂, SO₂, and PM₂.₅. The pollutant content data was collected from pollution-measuring stations. The main pollutant is CO, changing into suspended particles of PM₂.₅. Comparisons made between the maps produced on the pollution density levels and population densities in the five districts of 2, 6, 10, 11, and 12 at the center of Tehran indicated higher pollution. District 10, due to its worn-out texture and with a high population density of 37,504 p/hectare was the the most critical one. Districts 2 and 6, with lower population densities, were placed in second and third rank. In general, the central districts were more polluted, corresponding to higher population densities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3acarbon monoxide 3agases 3ahealth effects assessments 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3aparticulates 3apopulation density 3asulfur dioxide 3atexture 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 3aIran 0ahealth risk assessment 0aurban air pollution1 aAlian, Mahdi0 tHuman and ecological risk assessment.g2019 Oct. 3, v. 25, no. 7 p.1853-1869dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12198x1549-78607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2018.14752173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011900164300001600283520120400299592002801503650002901531650001301560650001101573650000901584650001301593650000901606650002801615650001001643650001101653650001501664650001201679650001401691650003001705650001301735650000901748651001001757700001501767700001901782700001701801700001301818700001101831700001901842773012801861856008201989852000902071655001202080IND60479651420221120205252.0210924e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047965142DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-015-4773-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wenzhao,10aPentatrichomonas hominis: prevalence and molecular characterization in humans, dogs, and monkeys in Northern China  ap. 569-574.  aPentatrichomonas hominis is an anaerobic amitochondrial flagellated protist that primarily colonizes the large intestines of a number of species, including cats, dogs, nonhuman primates, and humans. The prevalence of this parasite in dogs, monkeys, and humans is, however, poorly understood. In this study, a total of 362 fecal samples including 252 dogs, 60 monkeys, and 50 humans from northern China were collected for an epidemiological survey of P. hominis infection.The average prevalence of P. hominis infection determined by nested PCR was 27.38 % (69/252), 4.00 % (2/50), and 46.67 %(28/60) in dogs, humans, and monkeys, respectively. The prevalence was significantly higher in 6-month-old dogs (41.53 %) and children (7.69 %) than in older dogs (14.39 %) and adults (0 %) (P < 0.05). Sequencing of amplicons revealed that four variable positions separated sequences into three types, called CC1-3. CC1 was the most prevalent in the study population. This study determined that P. hominis infection is common in dogs, monkeys, and humans, especially in children and young dogs. Given the infection prevalence, P. hominis may pose a risk of zoonotic and anthroponotic transmission.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPentatrichomonas hominis 3aPrimates 3aadults 3acats 3achildren 3adogs 3aepidemiological studies 3afeces 3ahumans 3aintestines 3amonkeys 3aparasites 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprotists 3arisk 3aChina1 aYing, Meng1 aGong, Peng-Tao1 aLi, Jian-Hua1 aYang, Ju1 aLi, He1 aZhang, Xi-Chen0 tParasitology research.g2016 Feb., v. 115, no. 2 p.569-574dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-015-4773-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002100176245007800197300001500275520122200290592002801512650001801540650002201558650002601580650002101606650001401627650001701641650001301658700002101671700002401692773015201716856006901868856008501937990002302022852000902045655001202054IND60644051220221121041502.0190514e20190107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064405122DNAL7 a10.3791/581942doi7 aPMC69458232pmcid7 a306636562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKesarwani, Meenu10aMethods for evaluating the role of c-fos and dusp1 in oncogene dependence  ap. e58194.  aThe demonstration of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in treating chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has heralded a new era in cancer therapeutics. However, a small population of cells does not respond to TKI treatment, resulting in minimal residual disease (MRD); even the most potent TKIs fail to eradicate these cells. These MRD cells serve as a reservoir to develop resistance to therapy. Why TKI treatment is ineffective against MRD cells is not known. Growth factor signaling is implicated in supporting the survival of MRD cells during TKI treatment, but a mechanistic understanding is lacking. Recent studies demonstrated that an elevated c-Fos and Dusp1 expression as a result of convergent oncogenic and growth factor signaling in MRD cells mediate TKI resistance. The genetic and chemical inhibition of c-Fos and Dusp1 renders CML exquisitely sensitive to TKIs and cures CML in both genetic and humanized mouse models. We identified these target genes using multiple microarrays from TKI-sensitive and -resistant cells. Here, we provide methods for target validation using in vitro and in vivo mouse models. These methods can easily be applied to any target for genetic validation and therapeutic development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aenzyme inhibitors 3amicroarray technology 3amyeloid leukemia 3aoncogenes 3atherapeutics 3atyrosine1 aKincaid, Zachary1 aĀjama, Mohāmmada,0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2019 Jan. 07, , no. 143 p.e58194-e58194dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/581943Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/58194/methods-for-evaluating-role-c-fos-dusp1-oncogene  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002400137245016400161300001600325520110300341592002801444650001301472650001501485650002001500650002401520650001801544650001701562650001401579650000901593650001501602650002401617650001801641651001101659653001701670653002201687653001701709653001301726700002201739700001801761700002101779700002201800700001801822773011401840856007101954852000902025655001202034IND60626875820221120204059.0190102s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062687582DNAL7 a10.1071/AN168352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPadilha, A.

A dataset with 190389 records of test-day milk and of test-day SCS from 21824 cows was used. Two-trait random regression model with a fourth order Legendre polynomial was used. Persistency (PS) was defined as the difference between estimated breeding values (EBV) along different days in milk using two formulae: and PS2=(EBV290–EBV90). Larger values for PS2 or lower ones for PS1 indicate higher persistency. Heritability was 0.24 for 305-day milk yield, 0.14 for SCS up to 305 days, 0.15 for PS1 and 0.14 for PS2. Genetic correlation between 305-day milk yield and SCS up to 305 days was –0.47. Genetic correlation of 305-day milk yield with PS1 and PS2 was –0.32 and 0.30, respectively. Genetic correlation of SCS up to 305 days was 0.25 with PS1 and –0.20 with PS2. The additive genetic correlations between milk yield, SCS and persistency showed that selection for higher persistency or for low somatic cell score will increase 305-day milk yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3adairy cows 3adata collection 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic trend 3aheritability 3alactation 3amilk 3amilk yield 3aregression analysis 3asomatic cells 3aBrazil 0adairy cattle 0agenetic selection 0aheritability 0amastitis1 aAlfonzo, E.

Generation of electricity through cogeneration is a huge opportunity in countries where the sugarcane industry is in decline. This article draws on the findings of a case-study on electricity generation through cogeneration in Jamaica to provide some key messages that may be useful for policy-makers and the private sector to make electricity generation by cogeneration a more competitive option the for investors.To this end, this article analyses two scenarios: the first is a Baseline Scenario that assesses the impact of cogeneration technology already installed in a Jamaican sugarcane company where the cogeneration stage produces 2,2 MW; the second one considers that the cogeneration technology is changed to a new biomass based power plant upgrading the cogeneration stage in order to produce 5 MW of power from bagasse. The assessment was carried out by using a complete Life Cycle Assessment, Life Cycle Costing and Social Life Cycle Assessment. The results revealed that generation of electricity from cogeneration derived from bagasse is a suitable alternative adding economic, environmental and social value.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3adecline 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3aemissions 3afossil fuels 3alife cycle assessment 3alife cycle costing 3apower plants 3aprivate sector 3asocial benefit 3asugar industry 3asugarcane 3asugarcane bagasse 3atechnology 3aJamaica 0aLife cycle assessment (LCA) 0aLife cycle costing (LCC) 0aSocial life cycle assessment (SLCA) 0aCogeneration 0aGreen electricity1 aBatuecas, E.1 aMayo, C.1 aDíaz, R.1 aPérez, F.J.1 aSpringer, C.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 200 p.390-401dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.07.3223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245014400167300001600311520150000327592002801827653001301855653002301868653002701891653001101918653001101929653002101940653001601961653001201977653000801989700005901997700001702056700002202073773015202095856008202247852000902329655001202338IND60566649420221120210712.0170410e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056664942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dmpk.2016.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshida, Takuya10aRelationship between the plasma fentanyl and serum 4β-hydroxycholesterol based on CYP3A5 genotype and gender in patients with cancer pain  ap. 242-248.  aThis study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the concentrations of plasma fentanyl and serum 4β-hydroxycholesterol based on CYP3A5 genotype and gender in cancer patients. Thirty-three Japanese cancer patients treated with transdermal fentanyl were enrolled. The concentrations of plasma fentanyl and norfentanyl, and serum 4β-hydroxycholesterol and total cholesterol were determined at day 8 or later after starting the medication. The plasma fentanyl concentration was significantly higher in the CYP3A5*3/*3 group than in the *1 allele carrier group. The *3/*3 group had a lower metabolic ratio of fentanyl. The serum 4β-hydroxycholesterol concentration and its ratio to total cholesterol were significantly lower in the CYP3A5*3/*3 group than in the *1 allele carrier group. The concentrations of plasma fentanyl and serum 4β-hydroxycholesterol were significantly higher in women than in men. Gender did not affect the metabolic ratio of fentanyl or the concentration ratio of 4β-hydroxycholesterol. The plasma fentanyl concentration was not correlated with the serum 4β-hydroxycholesterol concentration, while the metabolic ratio of fentanyl was slightly correlated with the serum concentration ratio of 4β-hydroxycholesterol. In conclusion, CYP3A5*3 and gender affected the plasma fentanyl and serum 4β-hydroxycholesterol concentrations in cancer patients. However, the plasma disposition of fentanyl was not determined using the serum 4β-hydroxycholesterol concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 0aFentanyl 0aTransdermal system 0a4β-Hydroxycholesterol 0aCYP3A5 0aGender 0aPharmacokinetics 0aCancer pain 0a4β-OHC 0aCYP1 aNaito, Takafumi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7447-37891 aSato, Hikaru1 aKawakami, Junichi0 tDrug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics.g2016 June, v. 31 p.242-248dElsevier LtdaThe Japanese Society for the Study of Xenobioticsx1347-43677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dmpk.2016.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01892naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245018300164520070200347592002801049650001701077650001601094650001901110653003201129653002001161653003701181653002201218700001101240700001901251700001601270700001501286700005601301773009401357856008201451852000901533655001201542IND60725258620221120050203.0210329e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072525862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2020.1059372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yongchao10aDifferential temperature control in heat-integrated pressure-swing distillation for separating azeotropes to deal with operating pressure fluctuations: Basic and explanatory data  aThis data article contains basic and explanatory data of “Differential temperature control in heat-integrated pressure-swing distillation for separating azeotropes to deal with operating pressure fluctuations” [1], including thermodynamic models, vapor-liquid equilibrium diagrams, steady-state flowsheets, temperature profiles of columns, description and setpoint units of the abbreviation of inventory control loops, description of control loops of control flowsheet with DTC, control flowsheets of PCTC and DTC, temperature and composition tuning constants, faceplates and flowsheet equations, dynamic performances and integral absolute errors.

In this study, the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of POMC gene exons were detected by direct sequencing in 317 Zhenning yellow chickens. The sequencing results indicated there were seven mutation sites (g.1140C > T, g.1185 T > C, g.2085 T > C, g.3566A > C, g.3572 G > A, g.3594 G > A and g.3628 G > A) and all of these were synonymous. Furthermore, seven haplotypes were formed and sixteen diplotypes were obtained. The associations between the POMC gene polymorphisms or diplotypes and reproduction traits were also analyzed. The association analysis results indicated that the SNP of g.1140C > T was associated with egg production at 300 d of age (E300), fertilization rate (FR), hatching rate of hatching eggs (HEHR) and hatching rate of fertilized eggs (FEHR; P < 0.05). The SNP of g.3566A>C was associated with FR (P < 0.05), SNP of g.3594G>A was associated with egg weight at 300d of age (EW300; P < 0.05), and SNP of g.3628G>A was associated with HEHR and FEHR (P < 0.01), respectively. Furthermore, chickens with H2H3 diplotype had greater EW300 and FR than those with H1H7 and H3H4 diplotypes (P < 0.05). These results indicate the expression of the POMC gene had significant genotype effects on the reproduction traits of Zhenning yellow chickens, and that the H2H3 diplotype could be used as a potential genetic marker to improve the reproduction traits in chicken breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding 3achickens 3aegg production 3aegg weight 3aeggs 3aexons 3agenetic markers 3ahaplotypes 3ahatching 3apigmentation 3apro-opiomelanocortin 3areproductive traits 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3astress response 3athermoregulation 0aPOMC 0aPolymorphism 0aAssociation 0aReproduction trait 0aChicken1 aCao, Haiyue1 aDong, Xinyang1 aLiu, Honghua1 aWen, Yaya1 aMao, Haiguang1 aLü, Lei,1 aYin, Zhaozheng0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2019 Sept. 24, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2019.1061963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03595naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245008400166300001600250500001400266520217100280592002802451650001302479650001202492650001402504650002502518650002202543650003002565650001802595650002602613650002402639650001002663650001402673650001502687650002702702650002502729651001002754653002302764653002402787653002502811653002602836653002902862700001502891773011302906856008503019852000903104655001203113IND60718606220221120033922.0201125e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071860622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.07.3282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Xiyan12aA trade-related pollution trap for economies in transition? Evidence from China  ap. 781-790.  aNAL-light  aThis study argues that economic growth does not necessarily reverse the pollution haven behavior, even if one economy shifts from the low-income group to the high-income one (i.e., the economy in transition). The economy in transition can become a convergence of trade-related pollution, then getting stuck in a “pollution trap”. Through investigating the case of China during 2003–2009, this study examines the features and causes of trade-related pollution trap. Supported by the World Input-Output database and the product-specific statistics from China Customs, this study applies the input-output analysis to trace the distribution of pollution embodied in China’s foreign trade. Then it constructs a “sector-country-year” panel and applies the fixed effect model to examine causes of the pollution trap. The results show that China’s pollution terms of trade (PTT) with developing economies increases and exceeds one, while the PTT with developed economies keeps larger than one. It supports the feature of “pollution trap”. The results also demonstrate that “pollution trap” is determined by the synergy of environmental regulation, inter-industry trade, and intra-industry trade: (1) Environmental regulations keep China from becoming pollution haven of developed economies rather than relocating pollution-intensive production to other developing economies. (2) The current intra-industry trade of low value-added products worsens China’s environmental performance. (3) The diluting advantage on labor and the accumulating advantage on capital keep China specializing in pollution-intensive production. Overall, the “pollution trap” may alert economies that applies the outward-oriented growth model to prepare for sustainability transition. Our findings imply that “going green” rather than “moving away” is essential in response to trade-environment effects. More stringent regulation should improve the environmental performance of production and encourage the utilization of clean technology. The increasing role of intra-industry trade requires to upgrade the commodity structure towards one with higher added-value.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior 3acapital 3adatabases 3aeconomic development 3aenvironmental law 3aenvironmental performance 3agrowth models 3ainput output analysis 3ainternational trade 3alabor 3apollution 3astatistics 3asustainable technology 3avalue-added products 3aChina 0aEmbodied pollution 0aEconomic transition 0aIntra-industry trade 0aComparative advantage 0aEnvironmental regulation1 aHe, Canfei0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 200 p.781-790dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.07.3283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001300145245015700158300001800315500001900333520152800352592002801880650001801908650001901926650002501945650001201970650001301982650003101995650002602026650002202052650002102074650001802095650001902113650002302132651001002155700005702165700001502222700001202237700001302249700001302262700001402275700001402289700001602303773013902319856007902458852000902537655001202546IND60682897020221121062155.0200204e20200113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068289702DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b045892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Hang10aMolecular Characteristics of Dissolved Organic Nitrogen and Its Interaction with Microbial Communities in a Prechlorinated Raw Water Distribution System  ap. 1484-1492.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDissolved organic nitrogen (DON) represents a unique challenge in prechlorinated raw water distribution systems (PRWDSs) because of its contribution to the formation of harmful nitrogen-disinfection byproducts, influence upon biogeochemical processes, and unclear molecular characteristics. Here, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry in combination with high-throughput sequencing was applied to elucidate the molecular changes of DON and biofilm microbial communities in a PRWDS in Yixing, China. Our study revealed that dynamic characteristics of DON are significantly correlated with the biofilm. The accumulation of refractory lignin-like compounds and CₙHₘOₚN₁ contributes to the higher recalcitrance molecular characteristics of DON in the effluent associated with Alphaproteobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Bacteroidetes. Additionally, with the help of prechlorination, the biofilm may change the DON characteristics and lead to higher oxygenation, higher m/z, and lower saturation during transportation. Despite the promotion of CₙHₘOₚN₁ and CₙHₘOₚN₃ at the early stage, we suggest that appropriate concentration of chlorine can add to the front end of raw water distribution pipes.

Here, processing pipelines for seven automated tools that can be used to segment grey matter within the brain are presented. The protocol provides an initial step for researchers aiming to find the most accurate method for generating grey matter volumes from T1-weighted MRI scans. Steps to undertake detailed visual quality control are also included in the manuscript. This protocol covers a range of potential segmentation tools and encourages users to compare the performance of these tools within a subset of their data before selecting one to apply to a full cohort. Furthermore, the protocol may be further generalized to the segmentation of other brain regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3abrain 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3aquality control1 aScahill, Rachael I.1 aTabrizi, Sarah J.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2019 Jan. 07, , no. 143 p.e58198-e58198dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/581983Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/58198/automated-segmentation-cortical-grey-matter-from-t1-weighted-mri  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245009900159520139200258592002801650650001201678650002801690650001101718650002001729650002101749650001401770650001501784650001801799650002201817650001801839650001501857651001101872700003001883700002501913700002601938700002101964700002201985773012002007856007402127852000902201655001202210IND60653448620221116161243.0190714e20181106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065344862DNAL7 a10.3390/w101115892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKargas, George 10aSoil Salinity Assessment Using Saturated Paste and Mass Soil:Water 1:1 and 1:5 Ratios Extracts  aSoil salinization is directly related to the quantity and quality of food production, and often, to increased energy demands for high-quality irrigation water. Reliable monitoring of soil salinity based on a less laborious method than the soil saturated paste (SP) extract methodology is required. In the present study, an attempt is made to relate the electrical conductivity (EC) of the soil saturated paste (SP) extract (EC<inf>e</inf>) with the EC determined in the 1:1 and 1:5 soil over water mass ratios, (soil:water) extracts (EC<inf>1:1</inf> and EC<inf>1:5</inf>). EC<inf>e</inf>, EC<inf>1:1</inf>, and EC<inf>1:5</inf> values were obtained for 198 soil samples from five different locations in Greece. The results have shown that strong linear relationships exist between the EC<inf>e</inf> and the EC<inf>1:1</inf> and EC<inf>1:5</inf> values (R2 > 0.93), and that the slopes of these linear relationships decreased from coarse to fine soil types. For 123 soil samples, the concentrations of &Kappa;+, &Nu;a+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Cl&minus; were also determined in the extracts of the three applied methodologies. Ion concentrations in the 1:1 and 1:5 extracts were highly correlated with the respective ion concentrations in the SP extracts. These findings strongly suggest that EC<inf>1:1</inf> and EC<inf>1:5</inf> values can be safely used for the estimation of EC<inf>e</inf>.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenergy 3afood production 3airrigation water 3amagnesium 3amonitoring 3asoil salinity 3asoil salinization 3asoil sampling 3asoil types 3aGreece1 aChatzigiakoumis, Iakovos 1 aKollias, Athanasios 1 aSpiliotis, Dimitrios 1 aMassas, Ioannis 1 aKerkides, Petros 0 tWater.g2018 Nov. 06, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w101115893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014100168520183800309592002802147650002402175650001602199650001202215650001602227650001002243650001102253650001702264650001502281650001502296650001402311653002202325653003202347653001602379653001502395700001702410700002002427700002902447773009402476856008202570852000902652655001202661IND60725259120221121221741.0210329e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072525912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2020.1059422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIrannejad, Hamid10aData on molecular docking of tautomers and enantiomers of ATTAF-1 and ATTAF-2 selectivty to the human/fungal lanosterol-14α-demethylase  aThe data have been obtained for tautomers and enantiomers of ATTAF-1 and ATTAF-2 that were developed based on antifungal standard drugs with triazole scaffold. These compounds were docked into the human and fungal lanosterol-14α-demethylase. In order to validate the data, 8 standard triazole antifungal drugs (Fluconazole, Itraconazole, Posaconazole, Ravuconazole, Albaconazole, Voriconazole, Isavuconazole and Efinaconazole) were also docked into the human and fungal lanosterol-14α-demethylase. The binding conformations of these molecules and their interactions with lanosterol-14α-demethylase may inform the development of further small molecule lanosterol-14α-demethylase inhibitors with significant selectivity toward this enzyme. The analysis has done on the basis of type of interactions (bond type and distance). The length of the Fe-N coordination bond for (R)-N2-ATTAF-1 and (S)-N1-ATTAF-2 complexes is obtained 6.36 and 4.19 Å, respectively and about 2 Å in the other tautomer and enantiomer complexes, reflecting the lower basicity of the N-4 atom in the 1,2,4-triazole ring of (R)-N2-ATTAF-1 and (S)-N1-ATTAF-2 in comparison with the N-4 atom in the 1,2,4-triazole ring in other tautomers and enantiomers and supporting higher selectivity of (R)-N2-ATTAF-1 and (S)-N1-ATTAF-2 towards the target CYP51 enzymes vs. human. Interestingly, we have investigated unfavorable interactions (donor-donor) with TRP239 and MET378 for (R)-N2-ATTAF-1 and (S)-N1-ATTAF-2, respectively. These unfavorable interactions also have been seen in case of posaconazole and isavuconazole.

The first experiment was conducted using the rumen simulation technique (Rusitec), as a completely randomised block design with four replications and the following four doses of GA: 0, 5, 10 and 20 mg GA/g dry matter (DM). Ethanol was used in all treatments to increase the solubilisation of GA in rumen fluid. The experimental period lasted 16 days, of which the first 7 days were for adaptation and the subsequent 9 days were for sampling. The second experiment was a 48-h batch-culture incubation conducted as a completely randomised design with a 4 (GA dose; 0, 10, 20, and 40 mg GA/g DM) × 2 (with or without ethanol) arrangement of treatments. In the Rusitec experiment, addition of GA up to 20 mg/g DM did not affect DM disappearance (DMD), organic matter (OM) disappearance, neutral detergent-fibre disappearance (NDFD), acid detergent-fibre disappearance (ADFD) or starch disappearance (P > 0.05), but crude protein disappearance was linearly decreased (P = 0.04) from 78.3% to 72.0%. Daily gas production and CH4 production expressed as mL/g DM and mL/g DMD were not affected by addition of GA (P > 0.05). Addition of GA up to 20 mg/g DM increased butyrate and isovalerate production (P < 0.05) and tended to increase isobutyrate (P = 0.09) and decrease heptanoate production (P = 0.07). In the batch-culture experiment, adding GA up to 40 mg/g DM linearly increased 48-h DMD, NDFD and ADFD (P < 0.05) and decreased (P < 0.05) CH4 expressed as mL/g DMD, mL/g NDFD and mL/g ADFD. Methane production was decreased after 24 h and 48 h only when GA was added at 10 mg/g DM without ethanol. Fermentation liquid pH and concentration of ammonia-nitrogen (ammonia-N) were also reduced (P < 0.05) with an increasing concentration of GA. Treatments with ethanol notably enhanced 48-h DMD, NDFD, ADFD, gas production (mL/g DM, mL/g OM or mL/g DMD), CH4 production (mL/g DM, mL/g DMD or mL/g NDFD), total volatile fatty acid concentration, the acetate:propionate ratio, acetate, valerate, isovalerate and caproate molar proportions (P < 0.01) and decreased propionate, butyrate and isobutyrate molar proportions (P < 0.01). Significant dose of GA × ethanol interaction was observed only for acetate molar proportion (P = 0.03). In conclusion, our study suggests that the beneficial effects of GA on feed digestion and CH4 production may be short term, while improvements in N metabolism may be sustained over the long term. It may be useful to conduct long-term in vivo studies using a range of diets and doses to verify whether GA can be used as a feed additive to mitigate enteric CH4 production and improve N metabolism of ruminants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aammonium nitrogen 3abutyrates 3acrude protein 3adiet 3aethanol 3afatty acid composition 3afeed additives 3afermentation 3agallic acid 3ahexanoic acid 3ain vivo studies 3amethane 3amethane production 3aorganic matter 3apH 3apropionic acid 3arumen fermentation 3arumen fluids 3aruminants 3asolubilization 3astarch 3avolatile fatty acids 0acattle 0aethanol 0anitrogen metabolism 0aphenolic compound 0asecondary plant compounds 0atannin1 aGuyader, J.1 aCollazos, L.1 aBeauchemin, K.

Major and minor populations of trans and cis isomers at the Xaa-Pro imide bonds are detected in two-dimensional ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. One- and two-dimensional ¹³C NMR and isotope-edited Fourier transform infrared experiments are also used to identify the prolines’ folded and unfolded states, type II β-turn and random coil, respectively, at physiological temperatures. This study provides new details about elastin’s conformational ensemble. In addition, the cis–trans isomerization of its abundant prolines provides an additional mechanism of fiber elongation in tissue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acis-trans isomerism 3acis-trans isomers 3adetection 3aelastin 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apopulation 3asampling 3atemperature1 aOhgo, Kosuke1 aKumashiro, Kristin K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5208-11190 tBiochemistry.g2019 Aug. 21, v. 58, no. 37 p.3848-3860dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.9b004143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005100145245008900196300001800285500001900303520137900322592002801701650001501729650001101744650002201755650001701777650001701794650002601811650001901837650001101856650001301867650001601880650002401896700005701920700001501977700001701992700005402009700005302063700001702116700006002133773013902193856007902332852000902411655001202420IND60682897620221120223601.0200204e20191230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068289762DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b047492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Bei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6472-777310aPerformance Recovery in Degraded Carbon-Based Electrodes for Capacitive Deionization  ap. 1848-1856.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLimitations of capacitive deionization (CDI) and future commercialization efforts are intrinsically bound to electrode stability. In this work, thermal treatments are explored to understand their ability to regenerate aged CDI electrodes. We demonstrate that a relatively low thermal treatment temperature of ∼500 °C can sufficiently recover the lost salt adsorption capacity of degraded electrodes. Furthermore, a systematic study of electrode replacement clarifies that the desalination ability loss and regeneration for a CDI cell are isolated to the aged anode, as expected. Characterizations of surface functionalities support that the acidic oxygen-containing functional groups formed in situ during cycling undergo thermal decomposition during treatment. The modified Donnan model quantitatively confirms that the surface charges originate from the formation/decomposition of functional groups. Accordingly, the lost pore volume and the increased resistance are recovered during thermal treatments, while the surface morphologies and pore structure of the electrodes are well-preserved. Therefore, thermal treatment can be applied practically to extend the lifetime of aged electrodes. This study also offers insights into strategies for minimizing electrode degradation or in situ regeneration such that the technology gains momentum for future commercialization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanodes 3acommercialization 3adeionization 3adesalination 3aenvironmental science 3aheat treatment 3amodels 3amomentum 3atemperature 3athermal degradation1 aZheng, Tianye1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2281-95061 aRan, Sijia1 aSun, Mingzhe1 aShang, Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5165-04661 aHu, Haibo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7494-14691 aLee, Po-Heng1 aBoles, Steven T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1422-55290 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 Dec. 30, v. 54, no. 3 p.1848-1856dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b047493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003500147245011900182300001600301520160500317592002801922650001701950650001601967650001401983650001201997650001302009650001702022650001002039650001702049650001902066650003202085650001402117650000902131650001402140650001302154650001202167650001702179650001702196700001902213700002702232700002802259700002802287700004402315700002702359700003102386700003502417700003002452773012802482856008202610852000902692655001202701IND60479652320221120183250.0210924e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047965232DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-015-4769-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Israel Gomes de Amorim10aAmebicidal activity of the essential oils of Lippia spp. (Verbenaceae) against Acanthamoeba polyphaga trophozoites  ap. 535-540.  aAmoebic keratitis and granulomatous amoebic encephalitis are caused by some strains of free-living amoebae of the genus Acanthamoeba. In the case of keratitis, one of the greatest problems is the disease recurrence due to the resistance of parasites, especially the cystic forms, to the drugs that are currently used. Some essential oils of plants have been used as potential active agents against this protist. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the amebicidal activity of essential oils from plants of the genus Lippia against Acanthamoeba polyphaga trophozoites. To that end, 8 × 10⁴ trophozoites were exposed for 24 h to increasing concentrations of essential oils from Lippia sidoides, Lippia gracilis, Lippia alba, and Lippia pedunculosa and to their major compounds rotundifolone, carvone, and carvacrol. Nearly all concentrations of oils and compounds showed amebicidal activity. The IC₅₀ values for L. sidoides, L. gracilis L. alba, and L. pedunculosa were found to be 18.19, 10.08, 31.79, and 71.47 μg/mL, respectively. Rotundifolone, carvacrol, and carvone were determined as the major compounds showing IC₅₀ of 18.98, 24.74, and 43.62 μg/mL, respectively. With the exception of oil from L. alba, the other oils evaluated showed low cytotoxicity in the NCI-H292 cell line. Given these results, the oils investigated here are promising sources of compounds for the development of complementary therapy against amoebic keratitis and granulomatous amoebic encephalitis and can also be incorporated into cleaning solutions to increase their amebicidal efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthamoeba 3aLippia alba 3acarvacrol 3acarvone 3acleaning 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3aencephalitis 3aessential oils 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3akeratitis 3aoils 3aparasites 3aprotists 3arelapse 3atherapeutics 3atrophozoites1 aScher, Ricardo1 aRott, Marilise Brittes1 aMenezes, Leociley Rocha1 aCosta, Emmanoel Vilaça1 aCavalcanti, Sócrates Cabral de Holanda1 aBlank, Arie Fitzgerald1 aAguiar, Jaciana dos Santos1 ada Silva, Teresinha Gonçalves1 aDolabella, Silvio Santana0 tParasitology research.g2016 Feb., v. 115, no. 2 p.535-540dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-015-4769-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008600170300001600256520158600272592002801858650001901886650001201905650001601917650001901933650001201952650002501964650003101989650004402020650000902064700001602073700002002089700001702109700002102126700002102147700002302168700002802191700002002219700002102239700001802260700002602278700002002304773013102324856008102455852000902536655001202545IND60083164420221119130449.0141101e20120115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008316442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2011.11.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalaisse, Willy J.10a¹⁹F-heptuloses as tools for the non-invasive imaging of GLUT2-expressing cells  ap. 138-143.  aSuitable analogs of d-mannoheptulose are currently considered as possible tools for the non-invasive imaging of pancreatic islet insulin-producing cells. Here, we examined whether ¹⁹F-heptuloses could be used for non-invasive imaging of GLUT2-expressing cells. After 20min incubation, the uptake of ¹⁹F-heptuloses (25mM) by rat hepatocytes, as assessed by ¹⁹F NMR spectroscopy, ranged from 0.50 (1-deoxy-1-fluoro-d-mannoheptulose and 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-d-mannoheptulose) to 0.25 (1,3-dideoxy-1,3-difluoro-d-mannoheptulose) and 0.13 (1-deoxy-1-fluoro-d-glucoheptulose, 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-d-glucoheptulose and 1,3-dideoxy-1,3-difluoro-d-glucoheptulose) μmol per 3×10⁶cells. ¹⁹F MRI experiments also allowed the detection of 1-deoxy-1-fluoro-d-mannoheptulose in rat hepatocytes. All three ¹⁹F-mannoheptuloses cited above, as well as 7-deoxy-7-fluoro-d-mannoheptulose and 1-deoxy-1-fluoro-d-glucoheptulose inhibited insulin release evoked in rat isolated pancreatic islets by 10mM d-glucose to the same extent as that observed with an equivalent concentration (10mM) of d-mannoheptulose, while 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-d-glucoheptulose and 1,3-dideoxy-1,3-difluoro-d-glucoheptulose (also 10mM) were less potent than d-mannoheptulose in inhibiting insulin release. The 1-deoxy-1-fluoro-d-mannoheptulose and 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-d-mannoheptulose only marginally affected INS-1 cell viability. These findings are compatible with the view that selected ¹⁹F-heptuloses may represent suitable tools for the non-invasive imaging of hepatocytes and insulin-producing cells by ¹⁹F MRI.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell viability 3aglucose 3ahepatocytes 3aimage analysis 3ainsulin 3aislets of Langerhans 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3arats1 aZhang, Ying1 aLouchami, Karim1 aSharma, Sonu1 aDresselaers, Tom1 aHimmelreich, Uwe1 aNovotny, Guy Wayne1 aMandrup-Poulsen, Thomas1 aWaschke, Daniel1 aLeshch, Yevgeniy1 aThimm, Julian1 aThiem, J.q(Joachim),1 aSener, Abdullah0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2012 Jan. 15, v. 517, no. 2 p.138-143dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2011.11.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03490naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245015000202300001800352506007600370520176900446592002802215506003702243650002502280650002602305650002102331650001502352650003302367650001302400650001702413650002102430650002402451650002902475650001802504650001402522650001402536650001102550650001502561650002102576650001402597650001202611650001402623650001202637650002102649650001102670700001702681700002102698773013102719856007702850852000902927655001202936IND60132437420221207132727.0150505e20141231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013243742DNAL7 a10.1128/mBio.02141-142doi7 aPMC42519982pmcid7 a254252362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Zhihui10aEhrlichia chaffeensis Proliferation Begins with NtrY/NtrX and PutA/GlnA Upregulation and CtrA Degradation Induced by Proline and Glutamine Uptake  ap. e02141-14.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHow the obligatory intracellular bacterium Ehrlichia chaffeensis begins to replicate upon entry into human monocytes is poorly understood. Here, we examined the potential role of amino acids in initiating intracellular replication. PutA converts proline to glutamate, and GlnA converts glutamate to glutamine. E. chaffeensis PutA and GlnA complemented Escherichia coli putA and glnA mutants. Methionine sulfoximine, a glutamine synthetase inhibitor, inhibited E. chaffeensis GlnA activity and E. chaffeensis infection of human cells. Incubation of E. chaffeensis with human cells rapidly induced putA and glnA expression that peaked at 24 h postincubation. E. chaffeensis took up proline and glutamine but not glutamate. Pretreatment of E. chaffeensis with a proline transporter inhibitor (protamine), a glutamine transporter inhibitor (histidine), or proline analogs inhibited E. chaffeensis infection, whereas pretreatment with proline or glutamine enhanced infection and upregulated putA and glnA faster than no treatment or glutamate pretreatment. The temporal response of putA and glnA expression was similar to that of NtrY and NtrX, a two-component system, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed specific binding of recombinant E. chaffeensis NtrX (rNtrX) to the promoter regions of E. chaffeensis putA and glnA . Furthermore, rNtrX transactivated E. chaffeensis putA and glnA promoter- lacZ fusions in E. coli . Growth-promoting activities of proline and glutamine were also accompanied by rapid degradation of the DNA-binding protein CtrA. Our results suggest that proline and glutamine uptake regulates putA and glnA expression through NtrY/NtrX and facilitates degradation of CtrA to initiate a new cycle of E. chaffeensis growth.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aEhrlichia chaffeensis 3aEscherichia coli 3aRickettsia 3aRocky Mountain spotted fever 3abacteria 3aehrlichiosis 3aeukaryotic cells 3agel electrophoresis 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3aglutamic acid 3aglutamine 3ahistidine 3ahumans 3ametabolism 3amicrobial growth 3amonocytes 3amutants 3apathogens 3aproline 3apromoter regions 3atyphus1 aLin, Mingqun1 aRikihisa, Yasuko0 tmBio.g2014 Dec. 31, v. 5, no. 6 p.e02141-14-e02141-14dAmerican Society for MicrobiologywJournal:J000001381x2150-75117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mBio.02141-143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03909naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001700191245018300208300001600391500001500407506007600422520174200498592002802240506003702268650002502305650001802330650001502348650004402363650001502407650001302422650003002435650002502465650002202490650001802512650003102530650001402561650002402575650001002599650002702609650001402636650001702650650001502667650001602682653001002698653000802708653001302716653001202729653001702741653001002758653000802768653000902776653002202785653001502807653001002822653001302832653001502845653000902860653001202869653001702881700002402898700002102922700001902943773011902962856008503081852000903166655001203175IND60566650420221207085534.0180904e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056665042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2017.03.0112doi7 aPMC54811612pmcid7 a283637902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeder, Tarvi12aA fungal catalase reacts selectively with the 13S fatty acid hydroperoxide products of the adjacent lipoxygenase gene and exhibits 13S-hydroperoxide-dependent peroxidase activity  ap. 706-715.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe genome of the fungal plant pathogen Fusarium graminearum harbors six catalases, one of which has the sequence characteristics of a fatty acid peroxide-metabolizing catalase. We cloned and expressed this hemoprotein (designated as Fg-cat) along with its immediate neighbor, a 13S-lipoxygenase (cf. Brodhun et al., PloS One, e64919, 2013) that we considered might supply a fatty acid hydroperoxide substrate. Indeed, Fg-cat reacts abruptly with the 13S-hydroperoxide of linoleic acid (13S-HPODE) with an initial rate of 700–1300s⁻¹. By comparison there was no reaction with 9R- or 9S-HPODEs and extremely weak reaction with 13R-HPODE (~0.5% of the rate with 13S-HPODE). Although we considered Fg-cat as a candidate for the allene oxide synthase of the jasmonate pathway in fungi, the main product formed from 13S-HPODE was identified by UV, MS, and NMR as 9-oxo-10E-12,13-cis-epoxy-octadecenoic acid (with no traces of AOS activity). The corresponding analog is formed from the 13S-hydroperoxide of α-linolenic acid along with novel diepoxy-ketones and two C13 aldehyde derivatives, the reaction mechanisms of which are proposed. In a peroxidase assay monitoring the oxidation of ABTS, Fg-cat exhibited robust activity (kcat 550s⁻¹) using the 13S-hydroperoxy-C18 fatty acids as the oxidizing co-substrate. There was no detectable peroxidase activity using the corresponding 9S-hydroperoxides, nor with t-butyl hydroperoxide, and very weak activity with H2O2 or cumene hydroperoxide at micromolar concentrations of Fg-cat. Fg-cat and the associated lipoxygenase gene are present together in fungal genera Fusarium, Metarhizium and Fonsecaea and appear to constitute a partnership for oxidations in fungal metabolism or defense.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFusarium graminearum 3alinoleic acid 3ametabolism 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3amonitoring 3acatalase 3ahydroperoxide dehydratase 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ajasmonic acid 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3aaldehydes 3areaction mechanisms 3agenes 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aoxidation 3acell biology 3aperoxidase 3aMetarhizium 0aHPODE 0aNMR 0aCatalase 0aSP-HPLC 0aLipoxygenase 0aHPETE 0aLOX 0acAOS 0aFg-cat and Fg-LOX 0aABTS assay 0aHPOTE 0aFusarium 0aPeroxidase 0aABTS 0aRP-HPLC 0alipoxygenase1 aBoeglin, William E.1 aSchneider, Claus1 aBrash, Alan R.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2017 July, v. 1862, no. 7 p.706-715dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2017.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03274naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006700145245013400212300001800346500001900364520187300383592002802256650002302284650001202307650001202319650002902331650002602360650001002386650001902396650000702415650002402422650001502446650001302461650001502474650001602489700001302505700005202518700005502570773013902625856007902764852000902843655001202852IND60682897820210804000000.0200204e20200110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068289782DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b049892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMejia-Avendaño, Sandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4302-551810aSorption of Polyfluoroalkyl Surfactants on Surface Soils: Effect of Molecular Structures, Soil Properties, and Solution Chemistry  ap. 1513-1521.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aZwitterionic, cationic, and anionic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are identified in aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) concentrates and AFFF-impacted sites. However, the mobility potential of zwitterionic and cationic PFASs is poorly understood, preventing reliable site assessment. The study aimed to elucidate the mobility behaviors of PFASs of various charge states in saturated soil–water systems and assess critical influencing factors. Five anionic, three zwitterionic, and one cationic PFASs were investigated in five soils through batch sorption experiments. Pairwise comparison revealed that the quaternary ammonium group imparted a strong affinity of cationic perfluorooctaneamide ammonium compound (PFOAAmS) for soils. The influence of the quaternary ammonium group is mitigated in polyfluoroalkyl betaines, yet perfluorooctane sulfonamidoalkyl betaine (PFOSB) showed strong sorption in selected soils. Two soil bulk properties showed some correlations with the soil–water distribution coefficient (Kd). A positive correlation with the fraction of soil organic carbon was found only for anionic PFASs, whereas cation exchange capacity had an approximate positive correlation with Kd only for PFOAAmS. Water chemistry (Ca²⁺ and pH) influences the sorption of nonanionic PFASs in very distinct fashions or even in opposite trends to what was known for anionic PFASs. Sorption was insensitive to pH changes except for PFOSB; PFOSB underwent profound sorption reduction because its speciation occurs around neutral pH, while the two other betaines and PFOAAmS have pKₐ values that are outside of the environmentally relevant range. The lack of correlations suggests that the transport potential of PFASs is probably highly site-specific. It remains a challenge in deciphering PFAS sorption mechanisms and predicting how AFFF plumes migrate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium compounds 3abetaine 3acalcium 3acation exchange capacity 3aenvironmental science 3afoams 3ahydrochemistry 3apH 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil water 3asorption 3atechnology 3azwitterions1 aZhi, Yue1 aYan, Bei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3541-222X1 aLiu, Jinxia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2505-96420 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2020 Jan. 10, v. 54, no. 3 p.1513-1521dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b049893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03597naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245024700176300001600423520149600439592002801935650002101963650001301984650001601997650002902013650002202042650001902064650001602083650001702099650002002116650001102136650001202147650001102159650001802170650002802188650001502216650002002231650001402251650001002265650001802275650003302293650001702326650001902343700002402362700002402386700002402410700002402434700003002458700002202488700002002510700002402530700002702554700002802581700001302609700002502622700002302647700002402670700002202694773012802716856008202844852000902926655001202935IND60479652520221120162737.0210924e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047965252DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-015-4799-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Palanisamy Mahesh10aBiosynthesis, characterization, and acute toxicity of Berberis tinctoria-fabricated silver nanoparticles against the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, and the mosquito predators Toxorhynchites splendens and Mesocyclops thermocyclopoides  ap. 751-759.  aAedes albopictus is an important arbovirus vector, including dengue. Currently, there is no specific treatment for dengue. Its prevention solely depends on effective vector control measures. In this study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were biosynthesized using a cheap leaf extract of Berberis tinctoria as reducing and stabilizing agent and tested against Ae. albopictus and two mosquito natural enemies. AgNPs were characterized by using UV–vis spectrophotometry, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. In laboratory conditions, the toxicity of AgNPs was evaluated on larvae and pupae of Ae. albopictus. Suitability Index/Predator Safety Factor was assessed on Toxorhynchites splendens and Mesocyclops thermocyclopoides. The leaf extract of B. tinctoria was toxic against larval instars (I–IV) and pupae of Ae. albopictus; LC₅₀ was 182.72 ppm (I instar), 230.99 ppm (II), 269.65 ppm (III), 321.75 ppm (IV), and 359.71 ppm (pupa). B. tinctoria-synthesized AgNPs were highly effective, with LC₅₀ of 4.97 ppm (I instar), 5.97 ppm (II), 7.60 ppm (III), 9.65 ppm (IV), and 14.87 ppm (pupa). Both the leaf extract and AgNPs showed reduced toxicity against the mosquito natural enemies M. thermocyclopoides and T. splendens. Overall, this study firstly shed light on effectiveness of B. tinctoria-synthesized AgNPs as an eco-friendly nanopesticide, highlighting the concrete possibility to employ this newer and safer tool in arbovirus vector control programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes albopictus 3aBerberis 3aMesocyclops 3aToxorhynchites splendens 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacute toxicity 3aarboviruses 3abiosynthesis 3acontrol methods 3adengue 3ainstars 3alarvae 3aleaf extracts 3alethal concentration 50 3ananosilver 3anatural enemies 3apredators 3apupae 3asafety factor 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspectroscopy 3avector control1 aMurugan, Kadarkarai1 aMadhiyazhagan, Pari1 aKovendan, Kalimuthu1 aAmerasan, Duraisamy1 aChandramohan, Balamurugan1 aDinesh, Devakumar1 aSuresh, Udaiyan1 aNicoletti, Marcello1 aAlsalhi, Mohamad Saleh1 aDevanesan, Sandhanasamy1 aWei, Hui1 aKalimuthu, Kandasamy1 aHwang, Jiang-Shiou1 aLo Iacono, Annalisa1 aBenelli, Giovanni0 tParasitology research.g2016 Feb., v. 115, no. 2 p.751-759dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-015-4799-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03361naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245007200173300001600245520184500261592002802106650002202134650000902156650002602165650001502191650001202206650001002218650000902228650001202237650001702249650001102266650001402277650001502291650001102306650001202317651001102329651001502340651001202355653001202367653001702379653001202396653001102408653001202419653003302431700001902464700002002483700001902503700002202522700002202544700001702566773011902583856008402702852000902786655001202795IND60531459120221121031537.0160723e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053145912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2016.04.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalonen, J. Sakari14aThe northernmost discovery of a Miocene proboscidean bone in Europe  ap. 202-211.  aWe discuss a proboscidean bone fragment discovered in southern Finland, including the morphological analysis of the bone, as well as pollen and diatom analyses from sediment contained in the marrow cavity. Preliminary analysis of the bone suggested petrification and thus an apparently old age, while the microfossil assemblages include numerous unequivocally pre-Quaternary pollen, spore, and diatom types. A Miocene age for the bone is determined based on the presence of the diatom genus Alveolophora, indicating a minimum age of 5Ma, and based on the earliest appearance of proboscideans outside Africa, setting a maximum age of 19Ma. Based on morphology, the bone is determined as a partial humerus of the left foreleg of a large proboscidean. The bone is tentatively assigned to cf. Deinotherium sp., which is consistent with the diatom-based minimum age. The pollen assemblage is rich in spores of shoreline pteridophytes, while the diatom assemblage is also consistent with a shoreline freshwater environment, suggesting that the bone was deposited post-mortem near the shore of a lake or a stream. Miocene sediments do not currently exist in southern Finland or in the near vicinity. This implies that the bone has been transported over a considerable distance. Due to the discovery of the bone in early-Holocene Baltic Sea clay, the final transport phase and deposition must have taken place via iceberg rafting. This was likely preceded by one or more phases of glacial and/or glacio-fluvial transport. While we are unable to conclusive ascertain the region of origin, the alkaline composition of the contained sediment and diatoms point towards the Russian Plain region in the east. This specimen represents the oldest mammalian bone discovered in Finland and the northernmost discovery of a Miocene proboscidean bone in Europe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aclay 3aferns and fern allies 3afreshwater 3ahumerus 3alakes 3alegs 3amammals 3amicrofossils 3apollen 3asediments 3ashorelines 3aspores 3astreams 3aAfrica 3aBaltic Sea 3aFinland 0aFinland 0aDeinotherium 0aNeogene 0aPollen 0aDiatoms 0aEnvironmental reconstruction1 aSaarinen, Juha1 aMiettinen, Arto1 aHirvas, Heikki1 aUsoltseva, Marina1 aFortelius, Mikael1 aSorsa, Marja0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2016 July 15, v. 454 p.202-211dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2016.04.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04619naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245008900161300001500250506002800265520280100293592002803094506003703122650001003159650001203169650001903181650001303200650002403213650001003237650001403247650002103261650001803282650002603300650001603326650001303342650001503355650001903370650001203389650001103401650001303412650001203425650000903437650001503446650001103461650001303472650001003485650001803495650001703513651001503530653002003545653002303565653004203588653003403630653002403664653002003688653002803708653003903736773010603775856007903881852000903960655001203969IND60566650620221207074348.0180620e20170201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056665062DNAL7 a10.1515/opag-2017-00102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchubert, D.10aGreenhouse production analysis of early mission scenarios for Moon and Mars habitats  ap. 91-115.  aResource is Open Access  aThe establishment of planetary outposts and habitats on the Moon and Mars will help foster further exploration of the solar system. The crews that operate, live, and work in these artificial constructions will rely on bio-regenerative closed-loop systems and principles, such as algae reactors and higher plant chambers, in order to minimize resupply needs and improve system resiliency. Greenhouse modules will play a major role in closing not only the oxygen, carbon-dioxide, and water supply loops, but also by providing fresh food for the crew. In early mission scenarios, when the habitat is still in its build-up phase, only small greenhouse systems will be deployed, providing a supplemental food strategy. Small quantities of high water content crops (e.g. lettuce, cucumber, tomato) will be cultivated, improving the crew’s diet plan with an add-on option to the pre-packed meals. The research results of a 400-day biomass and crew time simulation of an adapted EDEN ISS Future Exploration Greenhouse are presented. This greenhouse is an experimental cultivation system that will be used in an analogue test mission to Antarctica (2018-2019) to test plant cultivation technologies for space. The Future Exploration Greenhouse is a high-level analogue for cultivation systems of early mission scenarios on Moon/ Mars. Applying a net cultivation area of 11.9 m², 11 crops have been simulated. Biomass output values were tailored to a tray cultivation (batch) strategy, where 34 trays (0.4x0.6 m) have been integrated into the overall production plan. Detailed work procedures were established for each crop according to its production lifecycle requirements. Seven basic crew time requiring work procedures (e.g. seeding, pruning and training, harvesting, cleaning, post-harvesting) were simulated. Two cultivation principles were the focus of the analysis: The In-Phase Cultivation approach where all trays start at the same time, and the Shifted Cultivation approach, where trays start in a specific sequential manner. Depending on the approach, different biomass output patterns emerged and were analysed with respect to crew consumption, crop shelf-life, and the risk of food spoilage. Crew time estimates were performed with respect to the overall production process, which resulted into 208.9 min per day for the planned cultivation area. When applying normal terrestrial work-times, this equates to approximately 50% of a crew member day for system operation. Biomass and crew time results were analysed in relation to each other, creating specific productivity factors for each crop type. This way, future mission planning, crop selection, and greenhouse design studies can better tailor the implementation challenges of small greenhouse modules into the habitat infrastructure.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalgae 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acleaning 3aclosed loop systems 3acrops 3acucumbers 3acultivation area 3afood spoilage 3agreenhouse production 3agreenhouses 3ahabitats 3aharvesting 3ainfrastructure 3alettuce 3aoxygen 3aplanning 3apruning 3arisk 3ashelf life 3asowing 3atomatoes 3atrays 3awater content 3awater supply 3aAntarctica 0afood production 0agreenhouse modules 0abio-regenerative life support systems 0aproduction lifecycle analysis 0acrew time estimates 0acrop shelf life 0ahabitat demand function 0abiomass over- and under production0 tOpen Agriculture.g2017 Feb. 1, v. 2, no. 1 p.91-115dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:23162x2391-95317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/opag-2017-00103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147024002200166024001900188040001800207100001800225245007600243300001800319506007600337520086500413592002801278506003701306650002901343650002201372650001101394650002301405650001201428650001001440650002301450650001001473650001201483650001501495650001601510650003901526650002201565650001101587773011101598856007701709852000901786655001201795IND60132437720221207122437.0150505e20141231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013243772DNAL7 a10.1128/mBio.02153-142doi7 aPMC42221102pmcid7 a253704982pmid7 aPMC42221102pmcid7 a253704982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNielsen, Jens10aSynthetic Biology for Engineering Acetyl Coenzyme A Metabolism in Yeast  ap. e02153-14.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a widely used cell factory for the production of fuels, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. The use of this cell factory for cost-efficient production of novel fuels and chemicals requires high yields and low by-product production. Many industrially interesting chemicals are biosynthesized from acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which serves as a central precursor metabolite in yeast. To ensure high yields in production of these chemicals, it is necessary to engineer the central carbon metabolism so that ethanol production is minimized (or eliminated) and acetyl-CoA can be formed from glucose in high yield. Here the perspective of generating yeast platform strains that have such properties is discussed in the context of a major breakthrough with expression of a functional pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in the cytosol.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3acarbon 3acost effectiveness 3acytosol 3adrugs 3aethanol production 3afuels 3aglucose 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3apyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide) 3asynthetic biology 3ayeasts0 tmBio.g2014 Dec. 31, v. 5, no. 6 p.e02153-14-e02153-14dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx2150-75117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mBio.02153-143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006100149245011700210300001800327500001400345520184300359592002802202650003102230650001702261650001302278650001902291650001802310650001202328650002902340650003802369700002102407700005902428700002502487700002202512700002402534700002302558700001602581700006102597773011802658856008302776852000902859655001202868IND60667719920221118070619.0190919e20190828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066771992DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.9b006172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatagopan, Sriram1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4867-531X10aStructural Perturbations of Rhodopseudomonas palustris Form II RuBisCO Mutant Enzymes That Affect CO₂ Fixation  ap. 3880-3892.  aNAL-light  aThe enzyme ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) and its central role in capturing atmospheric CO₂ via the Calvin–Benson–Bassham (CBB) cycle have been well-studied. Previously, a form II RuBisCO from Rhodopseudomonas palustris, a facultative anaerobic bacterium, was shown to assemble into a hexameric holoenzyme. Unlike previous studies with form II RuBisCO, the R. palustris enzyme could be crystallized in the presence of the transition state analogue 2-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate (CABP), greatly facilitating the structure–function studies reported here. Structural analysis of mutant enzymes with substitutions in form II-specific residues (Ile165 and Met331) and other conserved and semiconserved residues near the enzyme’s active site identified subtle structural interactions that may account for functional differences between divergent RuBisCO enzymes. In addition, using a distantly related aerobic bacterial host, further selection of a suppressor mutant enzyme that overcomes negative enzymatic functions was accomplished. Structure–function analyses with negative and suppressor mutant RuBisCOs highlighted the importance of interactions involving different parts of the enzyme’s quaternary structure that influenced partial reactions that constitute RuBisCO’s carboxylation mechanism. In particular, structural perturbations in an intersubunit interface appear to affect CO₂ addition but not the previous step in the enzymatic mechanism, i.e., the enolization of substrate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP). This was further substantiated by the ability of a subset of carboxylation negative mutants to support a previously described sulfur-salvage function, one that appears to rely solely on the enzyme’s ability to catalyze the enolization of a substrate analogous to RuBP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodopseudomonas palustris 3aactive sites 3abacteria 3acarbon dioxide 3acarboxylation 3amutants 3aribulose 1,5-diphosphate 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase1 aNorth, Justin A.1 aArbing, Mark A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6684-14301 aVaraljay, Vanessa A.1 aHaines, Sidney N.1 aWildenthal, John A.1 aByerly, Kathryn M.1 aShin, Annie1 aTabita, F.

This study proposed an integrated model of Grid-based Sediment Production and Transport Model (GSPTM) at watershed scale to evaluate the dynamic of sediment production and transport in the Shihmen Reservoir watershed in Taiwan. The GSPTM integrates several models, revealing landslide susceptibility and processes of rainfall&ndash;runoff, sediment production from landslide and soil erosion, debris flow and mass movement, and sediment transport. For modeling rainfall&ndash;runoff process, the tanks model gives surface runoff volume and soil water index as a hydrological parameter for a logistic regression-based landslide susceptibility model. Then, applying landslide model with a scaling relation of volume and area predicts landslide occurrence. The Universal Soil Loss Equation is then used for calculating soil erosion volume. Finally, incorporating runoff-routing algorithm and the Hunt&rsquo;s model achieves the dynamical modeling of sediment transport. The landslide module was calibrated using a well-documented inventory during 10 heavy rainfall or typhoon events since 2004. A simulation of Typhoon Morakot event was performed to evaluate model&rsquo;s performance. The results show the simulation agrees with the tendency of runoff and sediment discharge evolution with an acceptable overestimation of peak runoff, and predicts more precise sediment discharge than rating methods do. In addition, with clear distribution of sediment mass trapped in the mountainous area, the GSPTM also showed a sediment delivery ratio of 30% to quantify how much mass produced by landslide and soil erosion is still trapped in mountainous area. The GSPTM is verified to be useful and capable of modeling the dynamic of sediment production and transport at watershed level, and can provide useful information for sustainable development of Shihmen Reservoir watershed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUniversal Soil Loss Equation 3aalgorithms 3adynamic models 3alandslides 3amountains 3arain 3arunoff 3asediment transport 3asediment yield 3asediments 3asoil erosion 3asoil water 3asustainable development 3atanks 3atyphoons 3awater management 3awatersheds 3aTaiwan1 aWu, Ying-Hsin 1 aShen, Che-Wei 1 aChiu, Yu-Jia 0 tWater.g2018 Dec. 08, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w101218083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03319naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008400167500002200251520153800273592002801811650002301839650003101862650001301893650001901906650001701925650002301942650003601965650001802001650001602019650002402035650000902059650003702068650001902105650001402124650001702138650002102155650002702176650002802203650001502231650002402246650002502270650003602295651002202331653001802353653002402371653002202395700001802417700002302435700002302458700002602481700003002507773010102537856008202638852000902720655001202729IND60670340020221118022654.0191002e20190924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067034002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2019.1122522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasarri, Marzia10aAnti-inflammatory properties of the marine plant Posidonia oceanica (L.)

Delile is an endemic seagrass of the Mediterranean Sea whose use has been documented as a traditional herbal remedy for diabetes and hypertension. Our recently described Posidonia oceanica leaves extract is a phytocomplex endowed with interesting bioactivities, including the inibitory property on human cancer cell migration.The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of P. oceanica extract underlying its mechanism of action.We explored the anti-inflammatory effects of P. oceanica extract on RAW264.7 murine macrophages activated by LPS. We investigated the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) production and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Then, we examined P. oceanica extract role on the regulation of NF-κB signaling pathway.P. oceanica phytocomplex exhibited a strong ability to inhibit oxidative stress by affecting the production of both ROS and NO and to reduce iNOS and COX-2 levels. In addition, it was evidenced its anti-inflammatory role via inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway through modulation of ERK1/2 and Akt intracellular cascades.Our results recognize an anti-inflammatory role of P. oceanica phytocomplex particularly emphasizing its cell safe mechanism of action. In conclusion, the marine plant P. oceanica may be of great interest for scientific research as a source of promising molecules for designing alternative strategies to the conventional treatment of inflammatory diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPosidonia oceanica 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3adiabetes 3ahuman diseases 3ahypertension 3aindigenous species 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3aleaf extracts 3amacrophages 3amechanism of action 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3anitric oxide 3aoxidative stress 3aprostaglandin synthase 3areactive oxygen species 3aseagrasses 3asignal transduction 3atraditional medicine 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3aMediterranean Sea 0aPlant extract 0aBioactive compounds 0aAnti-Inflammatory1 aLeri, Manuela1 aBarletta, Emanuela1 aRamazzotti, Matteo1 aMarzocchini, Riccardo1 aDegl'Innocenti, Donatella0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2019 Sept. 24, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.1122523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02970naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005100147245009900198300001400297520142500311592002801736650002601764650002301790650001801813650002201831650001201853650001601865650001101881650001801892650002501910650001801935650000901953650001201962650004301974650002502017650001002042653002802052653001602080653002302096653001302119653002502132653002502157700002002182700002202202700002102224700002502245773009102270856008202361852000902443655001202452IND60639414620221116163330.0190822e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063941462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2019.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3101-650X10aIntermittent fasting increases energy expenditure and promotes adipose tissue browning in mice  ap. 38-43.  aIntermittent fasting (IF) may limit metabolic adaptations that reduce energy expenditure, potentially by stimulating white adipose tissue (WAT) browning. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of 8 wk of IF on energy metabolism and markers of WAT browning in lean and diet-induced obese mice and in women who were overweight or obese.Male C57 BL/6 J mice were fed chow or a high-fat diet (HFD; 43%) for 8 wk before undergoing IF (3 non-consecutive d/wk) for an additional 8 wk. Food intake, energy expenditure, and inguinal and gonadal fat pads were collected in fed or fasted conditions (22 h, IF mice only). Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) was also collected at baseline, and after 8 wk of IF (in the fed state, and after a 24-h fast), in women with overweight or obesity. Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (mice and humans) and immunohistochemistry (mice).IF reduced body weight and energy intake in HFD fed mice and reduced gonadal and inguinal fat pad weights in both diet groups. IF increased energy expenditure, meal number, Ucp1 mRNA levels in inguinal and gonadal fat depots, and UCP1 protein in inguinal fat in both diet groups on fed days. In women, IF reduced body weight and fat mass, but did not alter UCP1mRNA levels.IF increased energy expenditure and promoted WAT browning in mice but did not alter UCP1 mRNA levels in SAT in women.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal disease models 3aenergy expenditure 3aenergy intake 3aenergy metabolism 3afasting 3afood intake 3agonads 3ahigh fat diet 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aobesity 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3awhite adipose tissue 3awomen 0aAdipose tissue browning 0aBody weight 0aEnergy expenditure 0aFat mass 0aIntermittent fasting 0aUncoupling protein 11 aPage, Amanda J.1 aHutchison, Amy T.1 aWittert, Gary A.1 aHeilbronn, Leonie K.0 tNutrition.g2019 Oct., v. 66 p.38-43dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2019.03.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03420naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245010400211520205100315592002802366650001102394650002402405650001502429650001502444650002002459650003002479650002302509650002102532650001902553650001502572650002202587651001402609651001102623653001902634653002202653653002702675653002502702700006302727773011602790856008302906852000902989655001202998IND60744786620221122225102.0211030e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074478662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2021.1019322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguilar-Medrano, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2294-343510aIchthyological sections of the coastal-wetland ecosystem of the Yucatan Peninsula and Campeche Bank  aThe Campeche Bank and Yucatan Peninsula coastal-wetland ecosystem (CYCWE) comprises marine, brackish, and freshwater communities. Two biogeographic regions converge on its coast, the subtropical and the Caribbean. Coastal environments are experiencing degradation by local and global factors, a first approach for their protection is to know their inhabitants and define their distribution. In this study, the CYCWE ichthyofauna was analyzed (1) to determine if the defined biogeographic regions influence its distribution, (2) to establish ichthyological sections, and (3) to analyze the ecological and conservation status of the ichthyofauna in each section. The CYCWE presents a dynamic and connected community of 703 species segregated into 11 ichthyological sections (S). The biogeographic regions affect the distribution of coastal and oceanic ichthyofauna, where three coastal sections, S2, S8, and S3 in Campeche and Yucatan belong to the subtropical region, and S1 located mainly on the coast of Quintana Roo, but it extends following the reef formations, including the three states, belongs to the Caribbean region. A similar pattern was not observed for the brackish and freshwater fish communities. The paleogeographic development of the Yucatan Peninsula and the dispersal of the species along the Gulf slope shaped the current brackish and freshwater diversity, producing a differentiated ichthyofauna to the north (S7, S9, and S10) in Yucatan, south (S11) in Campeche and (S4) Quintana Roo, and northeast (S5 and S6) in Quintana Roo. Local threats to the CYCWE are urban developments, lack of ecological information of the species populations, a significant number of species in the IUCN vulnerable, endangered, and critically endangered categories, and introduced and invasive species. Collaborations between researchers and institutions are needed to jointly focus on least studied, endangered, and non-native species, as well as urban development plans made from a holistic perspective to reduce the stress over the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3aconservation status 3aecosystems 3afreshwater 3afreshwater fish 3ageographical distribution 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3amarine science 3asubtropics 3aurban development 3aCaribbean 3aMexico 0aGulf of Mexico 0aYucatan Peninsula 0aIchthyological section 0aSpecies conservation1 aVega-Cendejas, M.E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5462-069X0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2021 Sept., v. 47 p.101932-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2021.1019323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03148naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245011800171520157500289592002801864650001501892650001201907650001201919650001601931650002201947650002201969650002201991650001902013650000902032650001802041650001602059650001402075650002702089650001602116650002102132650001702153653001202170653000902182653002702191653001402218653001702232700001402249700001502263700001402278700001902292700001602311700001302327700001902340700001702359700001602376773009102392856009002483852000902573655001202582IND60687293820221119011052.0210212e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068729382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1265182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShang, Xiao10aEnhanced removal of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene by modified biochar supported nanoscale zero-valent iron and palladium  aBiochar pyrolysed at 300 °C, 500 °C, 700 °C was modified by hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrofluoric acid (HF), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), nitric acid (HNO₃) and potassium permanganate (KMnO₄), and subsequently evaluated for removal efficiency of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (1,2,4-TCB) by biochar supported nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) and palladium (Pd) composites. Under the initial 1,2,4-TCB concentration of 10 mg L⁻¹ and the solid-liquid ratio of 0.16 g L⁻¹, the synthesized composites of nZVI-Pd with BC700 modified by HF (FBC700-nZVI-Pd) and nZVI-Pd with BC300 modified by NaOH (SBC300-nZVI-Pd) demonstrated significantly enhanced removal efficiencies for 1,2,4-TCB achieving 98.8% and 94.7% after 48 h, respectively. The physicochemical properties of biochar including specific surface area, aromaticity and hydrophobicity after the modification by HF and NaOH were improved. Increased the supporting sites for Fe/Pd nanoparticles and the contact between composites and 1,2,4-TCB were mainly responsible for enhanced removal efficiency for 1,2,4-TCB. Both the adsorption by biochar and reduction by Fe/Pd nanoparticles effectively contributed to the removal of 1,2,4-TCB. It is estimated that the proportion of reduction was about twice that of adsorption in the first 12 h, which produced 1,2-DCB, benzene and other degradation products. Therefore, biochar treated with HF and NaOH and supported Fe/Pd nanoparticles could be effective functional materials for remediation of groundwater contaminated by 1,2,4-TCB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abenzene 3abiochar 3agroundwater 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrofluoric acid 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrophobicity 3airon 3ananocatalysts 3anitric acid 3apalladium 3apotassium permanganate 3aremediation 3asodium hydroxide 3asurface area 0aBiochar 0anZVI 0a1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene 0aPalladium 0aModification1 aYang, Lei1 aOuyang, Da1 aZhang, Bo1 aZhang, Wenying1 aGu, Mingyue1 aLi, Jing1 aChen, Mengfang1 aHuang, Lihui1 aQian, Linbo0 tChemosphere.g2020 June, v. 249 p.126518-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1265183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01205naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245007700171300001600248520031500264592002800579650002200607650002100629650002100650650002300671700002200694700003400716773007400750856008200824852000900906655001200915IND60581004720221118001106.0171005e20170810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058100472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2017.07.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHatanaka, Fumiyuki10aKeeping the Rhythm while Changing the Lyrics: Circadian Biology in Aging  ap. 599-600.  aAging and circadian rhythms have been linked for decades, but their molecular interplay has remained obscure.

However, the typhoon-induced maximum wind speed and maximum wave height are not coincident in time. Hence, it is a critical issue to include the time lag in the hazard model of wind and wave conditions for bridges. This paper adopts the concept of the pair-copula decomposed model to develop a trivariate joint probability model of typhoon-induced maximum wind speed, maximum wave height and their time lag. Pingtan Strait, where a sea-crossing bridge is being built, is taken as the example site. Considering the long-term measured wind and wave conditions under typhoons are not available, 58 tropical cyclones from 1990 to 2018 that influenced the example site are selected. The typhoon-induced maximum wind speed, wave height and their time lag at the example site are simulated using the validated SWAN + ADCIRC coupled numerical model. The trivariate joint probability modeling of wind, wave and time lag was carried out based on the simulated data. The trivariate environmental surfaces with the 50-year and 100-year return periods were finally obtained by the inverse first-order reliability method. The results show that more than 50% of typhoons have the maximum wind lagged behind the maximum wave at the example site. The higher typhoon-induced maximum wind speed and wave height tend to occur simultaneously. Two-parameter Weibull distribution is suitable to fit the distribution of the maximum wind speed and wave height, and the GEV distribution is ideal for the distribution of time lag. According to the trivariate environmental surface, neglecting the time lag might slightly overestimate the demand of the wind and wave loads. This study is of particular interest to the researchers and engineers in developing the metocean conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  a51978578cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a51708455cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aWeibull statistics 3amathematical models 3aprobability 3aresearch 3arisk assessment 3awind speed1 aShen, Zhonghui1 aTi, Zilong1 aQin, Shunquan0 tStochastic environmental research and risk assessment.g2021 Feb., v. 35, no. 2 p.325-344dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4308428x1436-32407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-020-01922-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03351naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245006500165300001800230500001900248520178500267592002802052650001702080650004402097650001302141650000902154650001902163650001502182650001502197650001402212650002202226650001202248650001202260650001602272650001602288650001402304650002302318650003702341650001202378650002002390650001702410650000702427650001402434650001302448650001302461650002302474650001602497650001302513650001102526700002502537700001902562773013502581856004802716852000902764655001202773IND50062574020221119050207.0130324e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006257402DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-012-0966-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNigam, Shubha10aBiosorption of arsenic from aqueous solution using dye waste  ap. 1161-1172.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe purpose of this study is to examine on removal of arsenic from water by biosorption through potential application of herbal dye wastes. Four different flower dye residues (after extraction of natural dye) viz. Hibiscus rosasinensis, Rosa rosa, Tagetes erecta, and Canna indica were utilized successfully for the removal of arsenic from aqueous solution. Batch studies were carried out for various parameters viz. pH, sorbent dose, contact time, initial metal ion concentration, and temperature. Data were utilized for isothermal, kinetic, and thermodynamic studies. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDAX), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analyses of biomass were performed. The results showed that 1 g/100 ml for 5.0–5.5 h contact time at pH 6.0–7.5 with agitation rate 150 rpm provided 98, 96, 92, and 85 % maximum absorption of arsenic by R. rosa, H. rosasinensis, T. erecta, and C. indica, respectively, at initial concentration of 500 ppb. Data followed Langmuir isotherm showing sorption to be monolayer on heterogeneous surface of biosorbent. Negative values of ΔG° indicated spontaneous nature, whereas ΔH° indicates exothermic nature of system followed by pseudo-first-order adsorption kinetics. FTIR results showed apparent changes in functional group regions after metal chelation. SEM and EDAX analyses showed the changes in surface morphology of all test biosorbents. Herbal dye wastes, used as biosorbent, exhibited significant (85–98 %) removal of arsenic from aqueous solution. Hence, these biosorbents are cost-effective, easily available, eco-friendly, and comparatively more effective than other biosorbents already in use. These may be used to remove arsenic and other toxic metals from water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanna indica 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aHibiscus 3aRosa 3aTagetes erecta 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3aagitation 3aaqueous solutions 3aarsenic 3abiomass 3abiosorbents 3abiosorption 3achelation 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aflowers 3aheat production 3anatural dyes 3apH 3apollution 3aresearch 3asorbents 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3awastes1 aVankar, Padma Shree,1 aGopal Krishna,0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2013 Feb., v. 20, no. 2 p.1161-1172dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-012-0966-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02385naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245011400171506002800285520122800313592002801541506003701569650001301606650004101619650001501660650001401675650002401689650002601713650001501739700002201754700002001776700002101796700001801817773009601835856008301931852000902014655001202023IND60739348520221207094858.0200302s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073934852DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202017002012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasiliy, Galushka10aInformation system for satellite monitoring of agricultural machinery using Wialon IPS communication protocol  aResource is Open Access  aThe article is devoted to the urgent problem of developing an information system for monitoring the location and condition of agricultural machinery as part of the introduction of precision agriculture technologies in the activities of agricultural companies. It discusses the general principles of organizing the interaction of system components, such as GPS trackers, a web server and a client computer, defines the main stages of interaction and describes the communication protocols used at each stage. Special attention is paid to the consideration of the packet structure of the Wialon IPS protocol, which is used to transmit data on coordinates and other technical parameters. For this protocol, several methods have been proposed for parsing the contents of packets to extract useful information from them, both using standard functions of programming languages and using regular expressions. To protect the transmitted data, a two-way authorization algorithm is developed, its scheme is given and the main stages are described. The article also presents the approaches to the implementation of parallel processing of connections from a large number of GPS trackers to increase the overall efficiency of the system.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInternet 3aagricultural machinery and equipment 3aalgorithms 3acomputers 3ainformation systems 3aprecision agriculture 3asatellites1 aDaniil, Marshakov1 aAndrey, Gazizov1 aVladimir, Fatkhi1 aDenis, Fatkhi0 tBIO web of conferences.g2020, v. 17 p.00201-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/202017002013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005200142245013100194500002000325520147300345592002801818596007101846596007101917596006601988596006502054650001502119650001202134650001302146650001602159650001402175650001802189700005402207773013602261856007702397852000902474655001202483IND60790233520221120113149.0220824e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079023352DNAL7 a10.1029/2020JB0194162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYabe, K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7244-564810aGrain‐Boundary Diffusion Creep of Olivine: 2. Solidus Effects and Consequences for the Viscosity of the Oceanic Upper Mantle  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn Part 1 of this study (Yabe et al., 2020, https://doi.org/10.1029/2020JB019415), we established an olivine grain‐boundary diffusion creep law that incorporates the chemically induced enhancement of creep rates, which becomes significant with increasing temperature. The effect was attributed to grain‐boundary disordering that starts at ~0.92 × solidus (bulk eutectic temperature). In this study, we estimated solidus temperatures of the samples used in the previous diffusion creep experiments. These temperatures were used to compare previously reported diffusion creep rates for olivine with our established diffusion creep law. We found that the law explains a difference of up to 2 orders of magnitude in olivine creep rates at the same temperatures, stresses, grain sizes, and water contents in the previous studies. The geotherm normalized by the mantle solidus was calculated for the upper mantle with water contents ranging from 0 to 300 μg/g, which predicts depths where grain‐boundary diffusion creep is enhanced due to grain‐boundary disordering. Constructed viscosity‐depth profiles reveal a very thin mantle lithosphere beneath mid‐ocean ridges, with development of the lithosphere away from the ridge, leaving a low‐viscosity region below. Given a grain size of 1 mm and depending on the water content, a viscosity of 2–5 × 10¹⁹ Pa·s is predicted for the low‐viscosity mantle beneath 50‐million‐year‐old seafloor.  aPublisher supplied data  a15H05827cMEXT | Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)  a18H03734cMEXT | Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)  cJSPS through a Grant‐in‐Aid for youth Scientific Research  cEarthquake Research Institute's cooperative research program 3ageophysics 3aolivine 3aresearch 3atemperature 3aviscosity 3awater content1 aHiraga, T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1051-58470 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 Aug., v. 125, no. 8 p.e2020JB019416-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JB0194163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03096naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002800141245007000169520195100239592002802190650001202218650001202230650001302242650001502255650001002270650001702280650001202297650002502309650001202334650001502346650003302361650001502394650001102409650001302420650001502433650001702448700002002465773011702485856007502602852000902677655001202686IND60682713520221120195540.0200131e20191115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068271352DNAL7 a10.3390/fire20400552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchaefer, Alexander  J.10aLand-Cover Dependent Relationships between Fire and Soil Moisture  aFor this study, we characterized the dependence of fire counts (FCs) on soil moisture (SM) at global and sub-global scales using 15 years of remote sensing data. We argue that this mathematical relationship serves as an effective way to predict fire because it is a proxy for the semi-quantitative fire–productivity relationship that describes the tradeoff between fuel availability and climate as constraints on fire activity. We partitioned the globe into land-use and land-cover (LULC) categories of forest, grass, cropland, and pasture to investigate how the fire–soil moisture (fire–SM) behavior varies as a function of LULC. We also partitioned the globe into four broadly defined biomes (Boreal, Grassland-Savanna, Temperate, and Tropical) to study the dependence of fire–SM behavior on LULC across those biomes. The forest and grass LULC fire–SM curves are qualitatively similar to the fire–productivity relationship with a peak in fire activity at intermediate SM, a steep decline in fire activity at low SM (productivity constraint), and gradual decline as SM increases (climate constraint), but our analysis highlights how forests and grasses differ across biomes as well. Pasture and cropland LULC are a distinctly human use of the landscape, and fires detected on those LULC types include intentional fires. Cropland fire–SM curves are similar to those for grass LULC, but pasture fires are evident at higher SM values than other LULC. This suggests a departure from the expected climate constraint when burning is happening at non-optimal flammability conditions. Using over a decade of remote sensing data, our results show that quantifying fires relative to a single physical climate variable (soil moisture) is possible on both cultivated and uncultivated landscapes.

Even though being preliminary, our results point to the necessity of conservation and protection of recent fungal diversity but, in our opinion, not by making a so-called 'Red list of endangered species', which, due to the lack of information and very poor evidence on this group of organisms in our country, are extremely unreliable and therefore disputable, but rather through the very short list of a few not endangered species, conditionally called 'White list of not endangered fungal species', if such species recently exist et all.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiodiversity 3aconservation areas 3aendangered species 3afungi 3aSerbia 0aMacrofungi 0aZasavica Special Nature Reserve 0aSerbia1 aStanković, Mihajlo N.1 aMatavulj, Milan N.1 aLolić, Svjetlana B.1 aPjanić, Branko M.0 tZbornik Matice srpske za prirodne nauke.g2009, v. 2009, no. 116 p.235-243dMatica srpskawJournal:27734x0352-49067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2298/ZMSPN0916235C3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03542naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245018100164520171500345592002802060650002502088650001902113650002502132650002202157650002202179650001502201650002602216650002002242650002102262650001402283650002302297650001902320650002002339650001802359650001502377650002002392650002002412650001502432650002902447650001502476650002502491650002402516650001102540650001902551650001802570650001602588653001702604653001502621700001502636700001402651700002502665700001202690700001702702700001602719773010002735856008402835852000902919655001202928IND60744786920221122063909.0211218e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074478692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.1007852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Renlei10aEffects of DL-methionyl-DL-methionine supplementation on growth performance, immune and antioxidative responses of white leg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) fed low fishmeal diet  aThe study was conducted to investigate the effects of DL-Methionyl-DL-Methionine (Met-Met) (a dipeptide of two DL-methionine molecules) on growth performance, immune and antioxidative responses for Litopenaeus vannamei fed low fishmeal diet. Tested treatments consisted of positive control diet (PC) with 20 % fishmeal or 7 % fishmeal (basal diet) diets supplemented with different levels of Met-Met (0.00 %, 0.1 %, 0.15 %, 0.20 %, 0.25 % and 0.3 %). A total of 1680 shrimp (0.071 ± 0.001 g) were randomly distributed into 42 tanks (6 repetitions / each diet, 40 shrimp / tank) and fed for 91 days. Results showed that reduction of fishmeal from 20 % down to 7 % did not affect the survival rate of shrimp. Weight gain rate and feed efficiency were significantly decreased in the basal group compared to the PC group, while these were significantly increased with the increasing of Met-Met into the diets up to 0.15 % compared to the basal group. Malondialdehyde in 0.15 % Met-Met and PC groups were significantly lower than the basal group. Shrimp fed the diet with 0.15 % Met-Met had the highest phenol oxidase content and peroxidase and total antioxidant capacity. The highest values of intestinal wall thickness were observed in 0.15 % Met-Met and PC groups. The similar morphology of the hepatopancreas was observed between 0.15 % and PC groups. Overall, the present study indicated that Met-Met could improve adverse effects of Met deficiency on growth caused by low fishmeal. Low fishmeal diet with 0.15 % Met-Met (0.65 %–0.66 % Met and 1.14 % Met + Cys) is beneficial to the health of intestine and hepatopancreas, improves immunity and antioxidative capacity and promotes the growth of L.

Such faults cannot be modeled as simple frictional interfaces because they may be thicker and made of several slip surfaces embedded in a material that can contain both grains and broken blocks. Two main aspects are considered here. One, which is the main innovation in the paper, deals with the derivation for the specific rigid‐plastic interface constitutive law which was developed to account for the hardening/softening behavior of highly stressed rocks like in geological faults. The other one deals with the theoretical and numerical study of the response of the structural model in which this constitutive law was implemented. This first structural model was chosen to represent the behavior of faults surrounded by elastic rock masses. The results obtained from this model already illustrate the high potentiality of the proposed interface constitutive law in the context of seismology. When far‐field displacement boundary conditions evolving time are used, different modes of evolution emerge, and transitions happen, from quasi‐static to dynamic or vice versa with timescales extending from tens of years to seconds. The instability domain and the dynamic solution are detailed together with the related energy considerations. An extensive analysis of specific case studies is available in Maury et al., companion paper, in particular as regards the possibility for slow slip events to transition into seismic slip (or vice versa). The implementation of the interface model into more realistic and advanced numerical fault models should offer many perspectives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aevolution 3ageophysics 3amodels 3aresearch 3athermodynamics1 aMaury, V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3206-87581 aFitzenz, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1921-30090 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 Aug., v. 125, no. 8 p.e2019JB018183-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JB0181833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245009400156300001800250500002000268520147400288592002801762650001101790650001201801650003001813650002801843650001801871650002201889650001701911650001001928650001901938650001101957650001301968650001401981700001401995700002102009773011502030856007302145852000902218655001202227IND60577622120221120085816.0170809e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057762212DNAL7 a10.1111/jeb.131262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMyhre, A.

This has important implications for the rate of random genetic drift. Mating systems also greatly affect effective population sizes, but knowledge of how mating system and density regulation interact to affect random genetic drift is poor. Using theoretical models and simulations, we compare Nₑ in short‐lived, density‐dependent animal populations with different mating systems. We study the impact of a fluctuating, density‐dependent sex ratio and consider both a stable and a fluctuating environment. We find a negative relationship between annual Nₑ/N and adult population size N due to density dependence, suggesting that loss of genetic variation is reduced at small densities. The magnitude of this decrease was affected by mating system and life history. A male‐biased, density‐dependent sex ratio reduces the rate of genetic drift compared to an equal, density‐independent sex ratio, but a stochastic change towards male bias reduces the Nₑ/N ratio. Environmental stochasticity amplifies temporal fluctuations in population size and is thus vital to consider in estimation of effective population sizes over longer time periods. Our results on the reduced loss of genetic variation at small densities, particularly in polygamous populations, indicate that density regulation may facilitate adaptive evolution at small population sizes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanimals 3aeffective population size 3aevolutionary adaptation 3agenetic drift 3agenetic variation 3alife history 3amales 3amating systems 3amodels 3apolygamy 3asex ratio1 aEngen, S.1 aSÆther, B.‐E.0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2017 Aug., v. 30, no. 8 p.1561-1575dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1010-061X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jeb.131263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01489naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245016400168300001800332520045600350592002800806650002300834650001100857650001200868700002600880700001900906700002700925700001900952773013300971856007401104852000901178655001201187IND60638658520221119035543.0190430e20160120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063865852DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc09673a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHadlington, Terrance J.10aStabilization of a two-coordinate, acyclic diaminosilylene (ADASi): completion of the series of isolable diaminotetrylenes, :E(NR₂)₂ (E = group 14 element)  ap. 1717-1720.  aAn extremely bulky boryl-amide ligand, [N(SiMe₃){B(DAB)}]⁻ (TBoN; DAB = (DipNCH)₂, Dip = C₆H₃Prⁱ₂-2,6), has been utilised in the preparation of the first isolable, two-coordinate acyclic diaminosilylene (ADASi), viz. :Si(TBoN)₂.

The origin and spatial distribution of organic matter were then investigated using these proxies, and the control factors responsible for the spatial distribution patterns and paleolimnological significance were discussed. The results indicated that the origin of organic matter in surface sediment of Nam Co is consistent with the sources of n-alkanes, which were primarily submerged plants, followed by terrestrial plants, and then aquatic algae and bacteria. The organic matter in surface sediments of the lake showed typical spatial variability. Because of the great influence of underwater topography, river inputs and water quality, the spatial distribution of organic matter is enriched from the source to the deposit center. This spatial variability of organic matter in the lake indicates that the sediments in different areas have different sensitivities to environmental changes, which is important to reconstruction of paleoenvironments and paleoclimate using lake sediment cores.  aPublisher supplied data 3asediments 3atopography 3arivers 3anitrogen content 3awater quality 3alakes 3aorganic matter 3acarbon 3asubmerged aquatic plants 3aalkanes 3abacteria 3aChina 0aAlgae1 aZhu, Liping,1 aWang, Junbo,1 aJu, JianTing1 aLin, Xiao0 tChinese science bulletin.g2012 Dec., v. 57, no. 36 p.4753-4764dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-012-5500-9  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001900189245011700208300002000325506007600345520112100421592002801542506003701570650002201607650002001629650002701649650001401676650002001690650001001710650002201720650001301742650001001755650001601765650003001781650002201811650001701833650001401850650001801864650002001882650002901902650001401931653004001945653001201985653002001997653002402017653001202041653002002053653001702073653001302090653002102103653002602124700002002150700002802170700001702198700001902215700002102234700002402255700002202279700001902301773007802320856008202398852000902480655001202489IND60581005120221207115207.0171005e20170810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058100512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2017.07.0442doi7 aPMC56302292pmcid7 a288020462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLang, Kevin S.10aReplication-Transcription Conflicts Generate R-Loops that Orchestrate Bacterial Stress Survival and Pathogenesis  ap. 787-799.e18.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aReplication-transcription collisions shape genomes, influence evolution, and promote genetic diseases. Although unclear why, head-on transcription (lagging strand genes) is especially disruptive to replication and promotes genomic instability. Here, we find that head-on collisions promote R-loop formation in Bacillus subtilis. We show that pervasive R-loop formation at head-on collision regions completely blocks replication, elevates mutagenesis, and inhibits gene expression. Accordingly, the activity of the R-loop processing enzyme RNase HIII at collision regions is crucial for stress survival in B. subtilis, as many stress response genes are head-on to replication. Remarkably, without RNase HIII, the ability of the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes to infect and replicate in hosts is weakened significantly, most likely because many virulence genes are head-on to replication. We conclude that the detrimental effects of head-on collisions stem primarily from excessive R-loop formation and that the resolution of these structures is critical for bacterial stress survival and pathogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus subtilis 3aDNA replication 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aevolution 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetic disorders 3agenomics 3ahosts 3amutagenesis 3anucleic acid conformation 3apathogen survival 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3aribonucleases 3astress response 3atranscription (genetics) 3avirulence 0areplication-transcription conflicts 0aR-loops 0aDNA replication 0areplication restart 0aRNase H 0astress response 0apathogenesis 0aListeria 0agene orientation 0aaccelerated evolution1 aHall, Ashley N.1 aMerrikh, Christopher N.1 aRagheb, Mark1 aTabakh, Hannah1 aPollock, Alex J.1 aWoodward, Joshua J.1 aDreifus, Julia E.1 aMerrikh, Houra0 tCell.g2017 Aug. 10, v. 170 p.787-799.e18dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2017.07.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03255naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010900168300001800277520209000295592002802385650001102413650002102424650002102445650001602466650001702482653002902499653002002528653002002548653001702568653001602585653002802601700002302629700001802652773012002670856008202790852000902872655001202881IND60744787120221122192215.0220207e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074478712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.spc.2021.06.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShekarian, Ehsan10aDual-channel remanufacturing closed-loop supply chains under carbon footprint and collection competition  ap. 1050-1075.  aDue to economic and environmental advantages, transferring from linear systems into circular economies has been accelerated, especially in developed countries, which affects companies’ relations. Among different tools and methodologies, the closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) model as an established approach has shown its efficiency in reflecting these relations regarding the consumers’ behavior. Because of the complexity, limited studies have considered the effects of different factors simultaneously on different CLSC network designs. This is the first attempt to study the effects of carbon emission and remanufacturing simultaneously on a dual-channel in both forward and reverse logistics, while there is competition on collection. Accordingly, a novel format for the demand function is suggested and employed. The decisions regarding the optimal pricing and collection strategies of CLSCs were investigated, within which the manufacturer is responsible for the remanufacturing process and selling the remanufactured products directly to the customer through the online channel. In contrast, new products are sold via the traditional retailer channel, imposing relevant costs. We explore the effect of different dual-collection settings when there is competition between collector parties under three possible options (i.e., Manufacturer-Retailer, Manufacturer-Third-party, and Retailer-Third-party). The considered demand for both new and remanufactured products addresses consumers who have different willingness to choose the remanufactured items and are sensitive to the produced products’ carbon footprint. The behavior of the formulated CLSC models is studied by game theory regarding decision variables, and each player's profit is discussed through systematic comparison. We analytically show that considering all the effects, third-party entry is not in the manufacturer's interest. The findings show that consumers’ willingness to choose remanufactured products is generally more influential on prices and profits than their sensitivity to the carbon footprint.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon footprint 3ademand functions 3agame theory 3asupply chain 0aClosed-loop supply chain 0aCarbon emission 0aRemanufacturing 0aDual-channel 0aCompetition 0aSustainable consumption1 aMarandi, Ahmadreza1 aMajava, Jukka0 tSustainable Production and Consumption.g2021 Oct., v. 28 p.1050-1075dElsevier LtdwJournal:23261x2352-55097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2021.06.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03381naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005700140245011500197500002000312520173400332592002802066650002602094650001702120650001302137650001502150650001702165650002702182650002102209650002402230650001502254650001102269650003702280650001202317650001202329650002002341650001702361700006002378700006002438700001802498700006302516700006002579700006102639773012802700856007402828852000902902655001202911IND60749856620221121233932.0210908e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074985662DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.138962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Won‐Ju1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3554-898410aChrysanthemum indicum suppresses adipogenesis by inhibiting mitotic clonal expansion in 3T3‐L1 preadipocytes  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHerbs have been of interest to treat diseases, including obesity, owing to their various bioactive constituents that exhibit therapeutic and prophylactic properties. The present study examined the anti‐adipogenic effects and mechanisms of Chrysanthemum indicum aqueous extract (CAE) in 3T3‐L1 preadipocytes. CAE comprises 1,3‐dicaffeoylquinic acid, chlorogenic acid, kaempferol‐3‐O‐glucoside, caffeic acid, and apigenin, which were corresponded with previous reports. CAE inhibited the accumulation of lipid droplets and significantly alleviated the expression of lipogenesis‐ and adipogenesis‐associated biomarkers. Treatment with CAE inhibited the mitotic clonal expansion (MCE), corroborated by cell cycle arrest at the G₀/G₁ phase, and mitigated the expression of cell cycle progression‐associated proteins and in addition to phosphorylation of MCE‐promoting transcription factors. Moreover, CAE downregulated the activation of Akt and extracellular signal‐regulated kinase 1/2 signaling pathways. In summary, CAE facilitates adipogenic inhibition during the early phase of differentiation, especially MCE, and its phenolic compounds can contribute to its anti‐obesogenic properties. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Chrysanthemum indicum has been mainly used as traditional herbal tea and drinks. Chrysanthemum indicum aqueous extract (CAE) inhibits adipogenesis by suppressing mitotic clonal expansion during the early phase of differentiation in 3T3‐L1 preadipocytes. 1,3‐Dicaffeoylquinic acid, chlorogenic acid, kaempferol‐3‐O‐glucoside, caffeic acid, and apigenin were detected in CAE. Based on these findings, CAE can be used as nutraceutical agents for prevention and treatment of obesity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysanthemum indicum 3aadipogenesis 3aapigenin 3abiomarkers 3acaffeic acid 3acell cycle checkpoints 3achlorogenic acid 3adietary supplements 3aherbal tea 3alipids 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amitosis 3aobesity 3aphosphorylation 3atherapeutics1 aYu, Hyung‐Seok1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7427-53041 aBae, Won‐Young1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6615-25471 aKo, Kyung Yuk1 aChang, Kyung‐Hoon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7994-12381 aLee, Na‐Kyoung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2395-550X1 aPaik, Hyun‐Dong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9891-77030 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2021 Sept., v. 45, no. 9 p.e13896-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.138963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04022naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002900155245013000184500001900314520199300333592002802326650002102354650002702375650001702402650002502419650001802444650001302462650001002475650002402485650001702509650001302526650002202539650001102561650001702572650001302589650001902602650000702621650001902628650001502647650001502662650001502677650001302692653000902705653000902714653000802723653000802731653000702739653000702746653000802753653000802761653000902769653000802778653000802786653000902794653000802803653000902811653000802820653001702828653001802845653001502863653001002878700002102888700002302909700001702932700002102949700002602970700002702996773013003023856009003153852000903243655001203252IND60710734020221122233007.0201104e20201216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071073402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2020.1088872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNicolau-Lapeña, Iolanda10aWater UV-C treatment alone or in combination with peracetic acid: A technology to maintain safety and quality of strawberries  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDisinfection of fruits is one of the most important steps since they are going to be eaten fresh-or minimally-processed. This step affects quality, safety, and shelf-life of the product. Despite being a common sanitizer in the fruit industry, chlorine may react with organic matter leading to the formation of toxic by-products. Alternative sustainable disinfection strategies to chlorine are under study to minimize environmental and human health impact. Water-assisted UV-C light (WUV-C) is proposed here as an alternative sanitizing method for strawberries. In this study, strawberries were washed for 1 or 5 min in a tank with 2 or 4 lamps on, each emitting UV-C light at 17.2 W/cm², or in a chlorine solution (200 ppm, pH 6.5). Moreover, trials with 4 lamps on, together with a washing solution consisting on peracetic acid at 40 or 80 ppm, were carried out. Overall, quality and nutritional parameters of strawberries after treatments were maintained. Changes in color were not noticeable and fruits did not lose firmness. No major changes were observed in antioxidant activity, organic acid, anthocyanin, vitamin C, and total phenolic content. Yeasts and molds were not affected by the WUV-C treatment, and 5 min were needed to significantly reduce total aerobic mesophylls population. However, reductions of artificially inoculated Listeria innocua and Salmonella Typhimurium after WUV-C treatments were comparable to those obtained with chlorine-wash, which were 3.0 log CFU / g. Moreover, WUV-C light was effective to minimize microorganisms remaining in washing water, avoiding cross-contamination and thus, allowing water recirculation. This effect was improved when combining the action of UV-C light with peracetic acid, showing the suitability of this combined treatment, understood as an alternative to chlorine sanitation, for sanitizing strawberries and keeping the populations of pathogenic bacteria in washing water lower than 0.6 ± 0.1 log CFU / mL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria innocua 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3achlorine 3acolor 3across contamination 3adisinfection 3afirmness 3afood microbiology 3afruits 3ahuman health 3aindustry 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aperacetic acid 3asanitation 3asanitizers 3ashelf life 3atoxicity 0aDPPH 0aFRAP 0aGAE 0aH° 0aPA 0aTA 0aTAA 0aTAM 0aTCEP 0aTCD 0aTPC 0aTPTZ 0aTSS 0aUV-C 0aY&M 0aSanitization 0aOrganic acids 0aUV-C light 0aFruit1 aAbadias, Maribel1 aViñas, Inmaculada1 aBobo, Gloria1 aLafarga, Tomás,1 aRibas-Agustí, Albert1 aAguiló-Aguayo, Ingrid0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2020 Dec. 16, v. 335 p.108887-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2020.1088873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245014300172520177300315592002802088650001902116650001902135650001702154650001402171650001002185650001802195650001602213650001402229650001702243650001702260650001702277650003302294650003102327650002402358650002602382650003602408650003202444653001402476653001002490653001702500653002202517653001402539700003202553700001802585700001702603700001302620700001802633700001602651773009102667856009002758852000902848655001202857IND60687294320221119013922.0200516e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068729432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1265262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Yanfeng10aIdentification and validation of metformin protects against PM2.5-induced macrophages cytotoxicity by targeting toll like receptor pathway  aFine particle matter (PM₂.₅) has been extensively reported to contribute to the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases. Recently, metformin has been reported to attenuate PM₂.₅ associated respiratory and cardiovascular injury, but the underling mechanism has not been discovered. Here, we performed comprehensively bioinformatics analysis and fully validation experiment to investigate the protection role of metformin and underling mechanism with RNAseq profile in GEO database. A combination of various bioinformatics tools including edgeR, principal component analysis (PCA), K-Means clustering, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), GO and KEGG enrichment were performed to identify the TLRs/MyD88/NF-κB axis functional as the key signaling transduction during PM₂.₅ associated toxicity. PM₂.₅ activated TLRs/MyD88/NF-κB pathway and resulted in significantly generation of IL-6, TNF-α, mitochondrial damage, decreasing of cell viability and increased LDH activity in RAW264.7 cells. Metformin significantly attenuated the production of IL-6, mitochondrial damage, cell viability and LDH activity by limiting TLRs/MyD88/NF-κB pathway. The siRNA against AMPKα2 or negative control were transfected to RAW264.7 cells to identify whether metformin protects PM₂.₅-induced cytotoxicity in an AMPKα2-dependent manner. Pretreatment with metformin significantly attenuated PM₂.₅ induced decreasing of cell viability and increased LDH activity, as well as inhibited the TLRs/MyD88/NF-κB pathway in both siControl or siAMPKα2 cells. Taken together, our results indicate that metformin protects against PM₂.₅-induced mitochondrial damage and cell cytotoxicity by inhibiting TLRs/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway in an AMPKα2 independent manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioinformatics 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3adatabases 3agenes 3ainterleukin-6 3amacrophages 3ametformin 3amitochondria 3aparticulates 3apathogenesis 3aprincipal component analysis 3arespiratory tract diseases 3asignal transduction 3asmall interfering RNA 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aMetformin 0aPM2.5 0aCytotoxicity 0aTLRs/MyD88/NF-κB 0aAMPKα2˙1 aBatibawa, Josevata Werelagi1 aMaiga, Modibo1 aSun, Baiyang1 aLi, Yang1 aDuan, Junchao1 aSun, Zhiwei0 tChemosphere.g2020 July, v. 251 p.126526-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1265263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005000142245010600192500002000298520144600318592002801764596006201792596006201854596007401916596004401990596002402034596008902058650002002147650001602167650001802183650001502201650001302216650001502229651001002244700005602254700005002310700005502360700001602415700005402431773013602485856007702621852000902698655001202707IND60790234220221120093554.0220824e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079023422DNAL7 a10.1029/2019JB0192442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOu, Q.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9827-404710aMagnitude of the 1920 Haiyuan Earthquake Reestimated Using Seismological and Geomorphological Methods  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aReported magnitudes ranging between 7.8 and 8.7 highlight a confusion about the true size of the 1920 Haiyuan earthquake, the largest earthquake recorded in the northeast Tibetan Plateau. We compiled a global data set of previously unlooked‐at historical seismograms and performed modern computational analyses on the digitized seismic records. We found the epicenter to be near Haiyuan town and obtained a moment magnitude of MW=7.9±0.2. Following traditional approaches, we obtained mB=7.9±0.3 with data from 21 stations and MS(20)=8.1±0.2 with data from three stations. Geomorphologically, we mapped the surface rupture and horizontal offsets on high‐resolution Pleiades satellite and drone imagery that covered the entire western and middle sections of the 1920 Haiyuan earthquake rupture and compiled offsets reported on the eastern section from field measurements in the 1980s. Careful discrimination between single‐event and cumulative offsets suggests average horizontal slips of 3.0±1.0 m on the western section, 4.5±1.5 m on the middle section, and 3.5±0.5 m on the eastern section, indicating a total moment magnitude of MW=7.8±0.1. Thus, the seismological and geomorphological results agree within the uncertainties, a weighted average giving a moment magnitude of MW=7.9±0.2 for the 1920 Haiyuan earthquake. It is likely that earthquake magnitudes based on the historical M were systematically overestimated.  aPublisher supplied data  aNE/K001006/1cNatural Environment Research Council (NERC)  aNE/N012313/1cNatural Environment Research Council (NERC)  cChina Scholarship Council‐Pacific Alliance Group Oxford Scholarship  cGreat Britain‐China Educational Trust  cBurdett Coutts Fund  a2017YFC1500401cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China 3adata collection 3aearthquakes 3ageomorphology 3ageophysics 3aresearch 3asatellites 3aChina1 aKulikova, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7698-35901 aYu, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1887-86181 aElliott, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5924-72681 aParsons, B.1 aWalker, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7551-41240 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 Aug., v. 125, no. 8 p.e2019JB019244-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JB0192443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01860naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001800187245008600205300001800291506007600309520031400385592002800699506003700727650002900764650002500793650001600818650001700834650001500851650001100866650002500877650001300902650001300915700002500928700002300953700002100976700001800997700002301015700002201038700002001060700002401080700002301104700002301127773012701150856008001277852000901357655001201366IND60117734820221207135442.0141126e20140626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011773482DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00550-142doi7 aPMC40474552pmcid7 a249038762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHung, John E.10aDraft Genome Sequence of Acetobacter aceti Strain 1023, a Vinegar Factory Isolate  ap. e00550-14.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe genome sequence of Acetobacter aceti 1023, an acetic acid bacterium adapted to traditional vinegar fermentation, comprises 3.0 Mb (chromosome plus plasmids).

Hence, there is a growing need to deliver methodological guidance to companies on assessing the sustainability of their innovative and claimed sustainable bio-based products. In this regards, the present article proposes a tool for assessing the sustainability of bio-based products, addressing the most relevant sustainability aspects (i.e. environmental, social, economic and circular) from a life cycle perspective. The proposed integrated assessment tool (IAT) is the result of a transdisciplinary process involving contributions from both industry and academia. To this end, the research involved numerous repeat interactions with practitioners and researchers to guide the selection of relevant areas of sustainability protection and related indicators and metrics, for ultimate inclusion in the tool. Multi-stakeholder workshops, webinars and expert interviews were also employed in the development of the tool´s functional elements (i.e. data collection, scoring, communication). The resulting tool consists of 48 sustainability indicators with proposed metrics based on existing standards, methodologies and best practices in sustainability assessment. The tool scoring system allows users to compare the performance of their bio-based product to an “ideal”. A key finding of the research is that, to produce a complete and reliable sustainability assessment, effective collaboration between economic operators along the bio-based value chain is needed. Furthermore, overall sustainability performance, particularly with respect to the life cycle assessment indicators, are heavily influenced by the type of biomass and related agricultural practices. It is therefore recommended to employ the tool on a case by case basis, maximizing the use of primary data.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiobased products 3abiomass 3adata collection 3aindustry 3alife cycle assessment 3amarkets 3asupply chain 0aBio-based products 0aSustainability Assessment 0aLCA 0asocial LCA 0aindicators 0aintegrated assessment tool (IAT)1 aMorone, Piegiuseppe0 tSustainable Production and Consumption.g2021 Oct., v. 28 p.911-924e6dElsevier LtdwJournal:23261x2352-55097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2021.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03600naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006400142245015700206500002000363520201600383592002802399596006202427596005702489596006202546596006202608650001102670650001402681650001502695650000902710650002002719650002402739650001302763700006102776700006202837700001802899700006302917773013602980856007703116852000903193655001203202IND60790234320221120093541.0220824e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079023432DNAL7 a10.1029/2020JB0198022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrappone, J.

Over a quarter of magnetic field strength estimates within the global paleointensity database from 0 to 5 Ma come from Hawaii. Two previous studies on the SOH1 drill core gave inconsistent, apparently method‐dependent paleointensity estimates, with an average difference of 30%. The paleointensity methods employed in the two studies differed both in demagnetization mechanism (thermal or microwave radiation) and Thellier‐style protocol (perpendicular and original Thellier protocols)—both variables that could cause the strong differences in the estimates obtained. Paleointensity experiments have therefore been conducted on 79 specimens using the previously untested combinations of thermal‐perpendicular and microwave‐original Thellier methods to analyze the effects of demagnetization mechanism and protocol in isolation. We find that, individually, neither demagnetization mechanism nor protocol entirely explains the differences in paleointensity estimates. Specifically, we found that non‐ideal multidomain‐like effects are enhanced using the original Thellier protocol (independent of demagnetization mechanism), often resulting in paleointensity overestimation. However, we also find evidence, supporting recent findings from the 1960 Kilauea lava flow, that microwave‐perpendicular experiments performed without partial thermal remanent magnetization checks can produce underestimates of the paleointensity due to unaccounted‐for sample alteration at higher microwave powers. Together, these findings support that the true paleointensities fall between the estimates previously published and emphasize the need for future studies (thermal or microwave) to use protocols with both partial thermal remanent magnetization checks and a means of detecting non‐ideal grain effects.  aPublisher supplied data  aNE/L002469/1cNatural Environment Research Council (NERC)  a1793213cNatural Environment Research Council (NERC)  aNE/P00170X/1cNatural Environment Research Council (NERC)  aNE/I013873/1cNatural Environment Research Council (NERC) 3aHawaii 3adatabases 3ageophysics 3alava 3amagnetic fields 3amicrowave radiation 3aresearch1 aBiggin, Andrew J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4164-59241 aBarrett, Thomas J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5351-457X1 aHill, Mimi J.1 aSprain, Courtney J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0498-21120 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 Aug., v. 125, no. 8 p.e2020JB019802-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JB0198023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01349naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009700160300001800257520035900275592002800634650002300662650001200685650001400697650002100711650001300732650000900745700001800754700001700772700001800789773013300807856007400940852000901014655001201023IND60638658820221119035551.0190430e20160308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063865882DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc09685e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrawford, D.

In a laboratory trial, 10 juveniles m⁻² (1.1 ± 0.1 g) were reared in 60‐L plastic containers using a recirculation system for 90 days. Three replicates were used to test each diet. A commercial diet serving as a reference and the diet with the highest content of essential amino acids (50% substitution, 6.46 ± 1.1 g) produced significantly higher shrimp final weight (7.12 ± 0.9 g, P < 0.05). There were not significant differences in specific growth rate and mean survival (85.9 ± 0.2%, P > 0.05). In a pond trial, 10 shrimp m⁻² (1.08 ± 0.3 g) were cultivated in 1.5 m⁻³ cages for 35 days, testing the diets in triplicate. Final weight was significantly higher (P < 0.05) when 100% substitution was used (10.89 ± 0.24 g), while survival did not differ significantly among diets (P > 0.05). The optimal level of substitution was estimated at 86.0%. Apparently, nutrients contained in the diets combined well with natural feed available in the pond, up to a point where 7.3% of fishmeal inclusion is recommended. An economic analysis showed that 100% substitution produced the best results. We conclude that mixtures of wheat, corn and soya meals are potential alternatives to replace fishmeal effectively in diets for L. vannamei.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3acages 3acontainers 3acorn 3adiet 3aeconomic performance 3aessential amino acids 3afish meal 3ajuveniles 3alaboratory experimentation 3anutrients 3arearing 3ashrimp 3asoybeans 3aspecific growth rate 3awheat1 aHernandez‐Llamas, Alfredo1 ade Jesús Armenta‐Soto, Styll1 aRodríguez‐González, Hervey0 tAquaculture research.g2017 Sept., v. 48, no. 9 p.4864-4873dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.133063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01754naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245010300163300001600266520073200282592002801014650001501042650001501057650002401072650000901096650003401105650000901139650001301148650001601161700001901177700001901196700002001215773011201235856004801347852000901395655001201404IND4482941520221119050652.0121003e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448294152DNAL7 a10.1134/S00036838110600322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aByzova, N.

The completion of the test system ensures control of exceeding the maximum permissible content of the antibiotic in milk and dairy products (10 ng/mL). The possibility of testing milk, raw milk, and dairy products for 10 minutes at room temperature without sample pretreatment has been demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aampicillin 3aantibodies 3aconjugated proteins 3agold 3aimmunoaffinity chromatography 3amilk 3araw milk 3atemperature1 aZvereva, E.

To this end, we propose a novel modeling framework to simulate nonplanar three‐dimensional fracture growth within poroelastic media, using an iteratively coupled approach based on time‐/scale‐dependent fracture stiffness. In this approach, the propagating fractures are explicitly tracked and fitted at each growth step using triangular elements that are independent of the matrix discretized by hexahedral grids. The finite volume/finite element method is employed to solve the hydromechanical system, based on the embedded discrete fracture model. The calculated pressure in fractures and the stress state of the host grid of the embedded fractures constitute the boundary conditions for the boundary element method. The boundary element method module, in turn, renders the evolving fracture stiffness and aperture for the finite volume/finite element method module. Finally, the total stresses and the fracture tip displacements are computed at the end of each time step to estimate the velocity and direction of newly created fractures ahead of the fracture tip. The proposed model is first validated against analytical solutions. Then, in three different examples, results are shown from the fracture's footprint under layered stress conditions, simultaneous propagation of two nonplanar three‐dimensional fractures, and the mechanical interaction of en échelon arrays. This work presents an efficient framework to simulate propagation of nonplanar fractures and establishes the foundation to build an integrated simulator for fracture propagation, proppant transport, and production forecasting in unconventional formations.  aPublisher supplied data 3afinite element analysis 3ageophysics 3amodels 3aresearch1 aFiroozabadi, Abbas1 aZhang, Dongxiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6930-59940 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 Aug., v. 125, no. 8 p.e2020JB020115-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JB0201153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03357naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140072001700158100001800175245016400193300001600357520155600373650001801929650002601947650002001973650001201993650003902005650002502044650001302069650003802082650001102120650002502131650002502156650003302181650004902214650005702263650003102320650003402351650003302385650003102418650002502449650002902474700001802503700002002521700001702541700001302558773007302571852000902644856007902653930003302732945002502765946001302790655001202803IND4372364520221118042225.0050718e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437236452DNAL7 a157829152pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.3.4622doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aReddish, J.M.10aMyosin heavy chain isoform expression is not altered in the pectoralis major muscle in selenium-deficient chickens recovering from exudative diathetic myopathy  ap. 462-466.  aThe recovery of broiler chickens experiencing skeletal muscle myopathy caused by a selenium deficiency was compared with control broiler chickens in an age matched study by ultrastructural analysis of the pectoralis major (PM) muscle and examination of the temporal expression of the developmental fast skeletal myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms. Selenium-deficient chicks showing signs of exudative diathesis (ED) were injected subcutaneously with sodium selenite in water and allowed to recover. At 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 d after selenium injection, a sample of the PM muscle was removed from selenium-deficient and control chicks for analysis. Ultrastructural analysis revealed vacuolization in the PM of selenium-deficient chicks with little or no visible damage to the sarcomere. Relative amounts of chicken ventricular, embryonic, neonatal, and adult fast skeletal MyHC isoforms were determined using chicken fast skeletal MyHC isoform specific monoclonal antibodies. The temporal expression of the developmental MyHC isoforms was similar in all chickens (P > 0.05). There was no expression of chicken ventricular MyHC observed in the PM of either group. These results indicate that chicken fast muscle recovering from exudative diathetic myopathy does not use the same pathways as chicken skeletal fast muscle regenerating from physical or toxic injury in which temporal expression of the MyHC isoforms is initially predominantly ventricular, then predominantly embryonic, neonatal, and finally predominantly adult developmental MyHC isoform. 3abreast muscle 3anutrient deficiencies 3agene expression 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalximmunology 2aAntibody Specificity 2aChickens 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFemale 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMuscle Cellsxultrastructure 2aMuscle, Skeletalxchemistryxultrastructure. 2aMuscular Diseasesxetiologyxmetabolismxveterinary. 2aMyofibrilsxultrastructure 2aMyosin Heavy Chainsxanalysis 2aPoultry Diseasesxmetabolism 2aProtein Isoformsxanalysis 2aSeleniumxdeficiency 2aVacuolesxultrastructure1 aLatshaw, J.D.1 aSt-Pierre, N.R.1 aPretzman, C.1 aWick, M.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Mar., v. 84, no. 3 p.462-466x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.3.4623Available from publisher's Web site  a20050913b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/08/05  aOther US 7aarticle03131naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140072001700158072001700175100002000192245007500212300001600287520153400303650002001837650002101857650002501878650002001903650001801923650001601941650001001957650002801967650001201995650001302007650002502020650000902045650002902054650001402083650002802097650002502125650002002150650006302170650002102233650001602254700001602270700001602286700001502302700001602317773007302333852000902406856007902415930003302494945002502527946001302552655001202565IND4372304320221118042052.0050714e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437230432DNAL7 a157829072pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.3.3952doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRodriguez, M.L.10aNutritive value of high-oleic acid sunflower seed for broiler chickens  ap. 395-402.  aTwo experiments were conducted to evaluate the use of high-oleic acid sunflower seed (HOASS) in broiler diets. In the first experiment, HOASS was included in a basal diet at 80, 160, 240, and 320 g/kg at the expense of the energy-yielding ingredients, and the AME(n) values of the experimental diets were determined. The linear regression equation of AME(n) values on rate of inclusion was calculated. Extrapolation value for the AME(n) of HOASS at 100% inclusion was 4,224 +/- 77 kcal/kg. In the second experiment, diets containing up to 200 g of HOASS/kg were given to broilers (Cobb) from 0 to 42 d, and performance parameters, nutrient digestibility, and AME(n) value were determined at 12 and 42 d of age. Birds fed the diets containing 100 and 200 g HOASS/kg gained less weight (P < 0.001) than those fed the diet containing no HOASS at both ages. Differences in feed-to-gain ratio were only significant for the diet with the highest concentration of HOASS. Apparent digestibility of nutrients and dietary AME(n) contents of diets increased with age; thus, the mean digestibility of diets for amino acid N and for total fatty acids increased from 82.1 and 68.0% at 12 d to 86.7 and 84.7% at 42 d, respectively, and AME(n) content was improved by 6.5%. Inclusion of HOASS in the diet decreased the digestibilities of fat, oleic acid, and total fatty acids. A decrease in the digestibility of aspartic acid, threonine, tyrosine, valine, isoleucine, and AME(n) with increasing inclusion level was also observed at 12 d of age. 3abroiler feeding 3afeed formulation 3ametabolizable energy 3afeed conversion 3adigestibility 3adietary fat 2aAging 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aChickensxphysiology 2aDiet 2aDietary Fatsxmetabolism 2aDigestion 2aFatty Acidsxmetabolism 2aHelianthusxgenetics 2aNutritive Value 2aOleic Acidxadministration & dosagexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aSeedsxchemistry 2aWeight Gain1 aOrtiz, L.T.1 aAlzueta, C.1 aRebole, A.1 aTrevino, J.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Mar., v. 84, no. 3 p.395-402x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.3.3953Available from publisher's Web site  a20050913b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/08/05  aOther US 7aarticle02696naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002100149245011000170300001600280500002400296520162800320650002601948650002801974650002102002650001502023650002302038650001802061650001702079650001502096650001202111650001802123700002002141700001902161773009302180852000902273856005202282655001202334IND4443877620221118041933.0101022e20101108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444387762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.08.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeao, Tairone P.10aNew semi-empirical formulae for predicting soil solution conductivity from dielectric properties at 50MHz  ap. 321-330.  aIncludes references  aPore solution electrical conductivity (σw ) is an important measurement for agricultural and environmental applications. Salt concentration can be predicted from σw and used to trace and monitor the transport of ionic solutes. Most models for predicting σw rely also on measurements of volumetric water content (θv ). However, θv dependent estimations of σw are difficult to obtain because θv measurements are not always available and because of the complex nature of physicochemical interactions between soil and water. Electromagnetic sensors offer an alternative approach because estimations of σw can be obtained without direct knowledge of θv . We developed two semi-empirical formulae for predicting σw that are mathematically independent of θv . The new models are dielectric equivalents of the Rhoades type two-pathway models that are based on linear and power law solutions for the transmission coefficient. The models were fitted by nonlinear regression to a data set collected from different soil textures, and disturbance treatments, to predict known electrical conductivities of ∼0, 1.23, 2.41, 2.02 and 3.96dSm⁻¹. Average σw predicted by the new models compared well to known saturating solution conductivities (average R ² =0.82 and average root mean square error of 0.80dSm⁻¹). The new models also compared well to models reported in the literature. The precision and accuracy of the estimates increased as σw increased, which might be related to a reduction of the influence of soil solid phase components on the estimates as σw becomes much higher than the solid phase conductivity. 3adielectric properties 3aelectrical conductivity 3anonlinear models 3aprediction 3asalt concentration 3asoil solution 3asoil texture 3asoil water 3asolutes 3awater content1 aPerfect, Edmund1 aTyner, John S.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2010 Nov. 8, v. 393, no. 3-4 p.321-330dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.08.027 7aarticle03023naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002900171245008000200300001600280500002400296520159200320650001401912650002201926650001301948650001401961650001101975650001101986650001501997650001002012650001102022650001202033650001602045650001102061650001302072650000902085650001302094650001602107650002302123650002102146650002402167651001802191700002402209700002502233700001902258700002302277700002002300773010902320852000902429856005502438655001202493IND4458900220221118042050.0110610e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445890022DNAL7 a213665622pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01815.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapastamatiou, Yannis P.10aScales of orientation, directed walks and movement path structure in sharks  ap. 864-874.  aIncludes references  a1. Animal search patterns reflect sensory perception ranges combined with memory and knowledge of the surrounding environment. 2. Random walks are used when the locations of resources are unknown, whereas directed walks should be optimal when the location of favourable habitats is known. However, directed walks have been quantified for very few species. 3. We re-analysed tracking data from three shark species to determine whether they were using directed walks, and if so, over which spatial scales. Fractal analysis was used to quantify how movement structure varied with spatial scale and determine whether the sharks were using patches. 4. Tiger sharks performed directed walks at large spatial scales (at least 6-8 km). Thresher sharks also showed directed movement (at scales of 400-1900 m), and adult threshers were able to orient at greater scales than juveniles, which may suggest that learning improves the ability to perform directed walks. Blacktip reef sharks had small home ranges, high site fidelity and showed no evidence of oriented movements at large scales. 5. There were inter- and intraspecific differences in path structure and patch size, although most individuals showed scale-dependent movements. Furthermore, some individuals of each species performed movements similar to a correlated random walk. 6. Sharks can perform directed walks over large spatial scales, with scales of movements reflecting site fidelity and home range size. Understanding when and where directed walks occur is crucial for developing more accurate population-level dispersal models. 3aAlopiidae 3aGaleocerdo cuvier 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3amemory 3amodels 3aphilopatry 3areefs 3asharks 2aAnimals 2aEnvironment 2aFemale 2aFractals 2aMale 2aMovement 2aOrientation 2aSharksxphysiology 2aSpace Perception 2aSpecies Specificity 0aPacific Ocean1 aCartamil, Daniel P.1 aLowe, Christopher G.1 aMeyer, Carl G.1 aWetherbee, Brad M.1 aHolland, Kim N.0 tjournal of animal ecology.g2011 July, v. 80, no. 4 p.864-874dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-87907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01815.x 7aarticle02951naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100001400194245009600208300001800304520146700322650002001789650002401809650002101833650002101854650002101875650003001896650001201926650002901938650003301967650002602000650003802026650001602064650001602080650002102096650001702117650002802134700001502162700001602177700001502193773007602208852000902284856008102293930003302374945002502407946001302432655001202445IND4366223520221118042323.0041223e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436622352DNAL7 a156150072pmid7 a10.1093/ps/83.12.19592doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Control embryos were incubated at 37.8°C and 56% RH, whereas the TM embryos were treated for 3 h at 39.5 (1) or 41.0°C (2) and 65% RH, during early embryogenesis (EE), E8 to E10, and late embryogenesis (LE) at E16 to E18. At hatch, after feather drying, BW and body temperature (T(b)) were measured, blood was drawn from the jugular vein to measure plasma concentrations of thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), and corticosterone. These parameters were also measured in 3-d-old chicks during exposure to TC at 41°C for 6 h. Hatchability was significantly higher in the LE1-treated group than in the other treatments. EE1- and LE1-treated embryos exhibited significantly lower T(b) at hatch than the LE2 chicks. Significant hyperthermia was noted in the control chicks during 6 h of TC; it coincided with a higher plasma T3 concentration (P = 0.074). During TC, the LE1-treated chicks exhibited the lowest T3 to T4 ratio and a significantly reduced plasma corticosterone concentration. It can be concluded that TM at 39.5°C for 3 h during E16 to E18 of incubation improved chick's thermotolerance acquisition and reduced the corticosterone level of chicks exposed to TC at the age of 3 d. 3aembryo (animal) 3aambient temperature 3athermoregulation 3abody temperature 3aegg hatchability 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAnimals 2aChick Embryoxphysiology 2aChickensxbloodxphysiology. 2aCorticosteronexblood 2aEmbryonic Developmentxphysiology 2aEnvironment 2aTemperature 2aThyroxinexblood 2aTime Factors 2aTriiodothyroninexblood1 aCollin, A.1 aShinder, D.1 aPicard, M.0 tPoultry science.g2004 Dec., v. 83, no. 12 p.1959-1963x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/83.12.19593Available from publisher's Web site  a20050119b20050130c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/01/19  aOther US 7aarticle03581naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159072001700176100001600193245016800209300001800377520184700395650001602242650001402258650002402272650001902296650002302315650002102338650002402359650001802383650001702401650001002418650001602428650001202444650004102456650005402497650003502551650004502586650002402631650003702655650001102692650001402703650000902717650001602726700001602742700002202758773007502780852000902855856008002864930003302944945002502977946001303002655001203015IND4373079520221118042248.0050806e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437307952DNAL7 a161562122pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.8.12772doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The study was conducted with 73-to-90-wk-old molted Ross broiler breeder hens in an environment excluding ultraviolet light. A basal vitamin D3 deficient diet supplemented with 4 levels of vitamin D3 (0, 3,125, 12,500, and 50,000 ng/kg of diet) and 2 levels of 25-OHD3 (3,125 and 12,500 ng/kg of diet) was fed. The relative biological values of 25-OHD3 in comparison to vitamin D3, using slope ratio techniques, were 138, 133, 128, and 111% for hen-day egg production, hatchability, late embryo mortality, and body ash of the progeny, , respectively (average = 128%). When comparing 25-OHD3 against D3 at the 3,125 ng/kg level, the relative biological values were 209, 167, 400, and 108% for the same criteria, respectively (average = 221%). However, at the 12,500 ng/kg level no statistical differences between 25-OHD3 and D3 were observed (average = 108%). Four trials were conducted to determine the effect of the maternal diet on the performance and leg abnormalities of the hens' progeny. In experiment 1, no vitamin D was added to the corn-soybean meal basal diet fed to the chicks, and in experiments 2, 3, and 4 the basal diet was supplemented with 27.5 microgram of D3/kg of diet. In the progeny study, the average relative biological value of 25-OHD3 at the 3,125 and 12,500 ng/kg levels were 115 and 101%, respectively. The potency of 25-OHD3 in relation to vitamin D3 depended on the level tested. When comparing vitamin D sources, 25-OHD3 had greater potency than D3 only at very low levels of supplementation. 3ahen feeding 3avitamin D 3avitamin supplements 3afeed additives 3alaying performance 3aegg hatchability 3aembryonic mortality 3adose response 3aleg weakness 2aAging 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCalcifediolxadministration & dosage 2aChick Embryoxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aChickensxgrowth & development 2aCholecalciferolxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Supplements 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aFertility 2aMale 2aWeight Gain1 aPesti, G.M.1 aEdwards, H.M.

  1 aVelleman, S.G.10aEffect of genetic increases in egg production, age, and sex on muscle development in turkeys  ap. 1347-1349.  aBreast muscle morphology was studied at 8 and 16 wk of age in a line (E) selected over 44 generations for increased egg production and its randombred control line (RBC1). A sample of 20 birds per sex-line-age subgroup was killed with restraint to prevent flapping of the wings. The skin was removed from the breast region, and a sample of breast muscle was obtained in a manner to prevent contraction. The muscle samples were dehydrated, cleared, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and incubated and rehydrated prior to staining with hematoxylin and eosin. Four sections from the same muscle from each bird were placed on a slide, and the slides were viewed for muscle morphological characteristics with a microscope and digitally recorded. Five fields of each section were viewed. Representative sections for each bird were given a score by 4 individuals based on breast muscle morphology. The scores ranged from 1 (little extracellular matrix and indistinct muscle fibers) to 5 (large extracellular space and distinct muscle fibers). Scores from 2 to 4 were intermediate to these extremes. Breast muscle morphology scores did not differ between lines or ages but there was a significant interaction between lines and ages. The scores increased in the RBC1 line from 8 to 16 wk of age, but the reverse was true for the E line. Scores were higher in males than females. The results of the present study suggest that selection for increased egg production in dam lines should not greatly influence breast muscle morphology in commercial turkeys. 3aselection criteria 3aselection response 3abreast muscle 3amuscle development 3aline differences 3aanimal age 3agender differences 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMuscle, Skeletalxgrowth & development 2aOvipositionxgenetics 2aOvumxgrowth & development 2aSex Characteristics 2aTurkeysxgeneticsxgrowth & development.1 aNestor, K.E.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Sept., v. 84, no. 9 p.1347-1349x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.9.13473Available from publisher's Web site  a20051025b20051102c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/09/12  aOther US 7aarticle04030naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159072001700176100001300193245018700206300001800393520241100411650002102822650002302843650002402866650000902890650001302899650001402912650001202926650003502938650005102973650003503024650003803059650003103097650002403128700001403152700001803166700001603184700001603200700001803216700002403234700001803258773007603276852000903352856008003361930003303441945002503474946001303499655001203512IND4373920720221118042356.0050901e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437392072DNAL7 a162065662pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.9.14392doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aTona, K.10aComparison of three lines of broiler breeders differing in ascites susceptibility or growth rate. 1. Relationship between acoustic resonance data and embryonic or hatching parameters  ap. 1439-1445.  aAscites is a prevalent cardiovascular disease among modern broilers with negative impacts on production and animal welfare. The peak of mortality due to ascites occurs at the end of the growing period, but the etiology of this problem may start during embryonic development. A few recent reports have demonstrated that the signs of ascites susceptibility are manifested during the late stages of incubation. In the current study, we used a nondestructive method based on egg acoustic resonance parameters [resonant frequency (RF) and damping] to establish a relationship between embryo physiological events during early development in broiler eggs and susceptibility to ascites. The hatching eggs of 3 broiler lines differing in ascites susceptibility were used for this study: ascites-resistant dam line (DAR), ascites-sensitive dam line (DAS), and ascites-sensitive sire line (SASL). These lines were selected on the basis of fast growth, high breast meat yield, and ascites induction at low temperatures such that the order of ascites susceptibility in terms of mortality was SASL >> DAS > DAR. Eggs were incubated under standard conditions in forced-draft incubators. We measured egg weights at setting, albumen pH, Haugh units (HU) at setting, and embryo weights at d 11 and 18, at internal pipping (IP), and at hatch. The durations of IP, external pipping (EP), and hatching were also determined. At 2 hourly periods during incubation, egg RF and damping were also measured. There were differences in egg weights between DAR and SASL vs. DAS, but albumen HU, albumen pH, and the ratio of yolk weight to egg weight were similar. There were differences in RF, damping, embryonic growth rates, and hatching events. Changes in resonant frequency and damping, which certainly suggest eggshell differences among lines, were not totally related to variations in physiological events during early and late embryonic development. A comparison between DAR and DAS, between DAS and SASL, or DAR and SASL indicates that sensitivity to ascites and selection for rapid growth rate in ascites-sensitive lines have different effects on embryonic parameters. We concluded that the sensitivity of broiler breeders to ascites does not influence egg internal quality, but the occurrence of ascites sensitivity in broilers could not be reliably predicted by early in ovo acoustic resonance parameters and hatching events. 3aline differences 3adisease resistance 3aacoustic properties 3aeggs 3ahatching 2aAcoustics 2aAnimals 2aAscitesxgeneticsxveterinary. 2aChick Embryoxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aChickensxgrowth & development 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aPoultry Diseasesxgenetics 2aSpecies Specificity1 aKemps, B.1 aBruggeman, V.1 aBamelis, F.1 aSmit, L. de1 aOnagbesan, O.1 aDe Baerdemaeker, J.1 aDecuypere, E.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Sept., v. 84, no. 9 p.1439-1445x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.9.14393Available from publisher's Web site  a20051025b20051102c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/09/12  aOther US 7aarticle03188naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159100001900176245012700195300001800322520166200340650003002002650001902032650002602051650001802077650001202095650002802107650001202135650002502147650000902172650004402181650002602225650004602251650001302297650006702310650001302377650001302390700001702403700002102420700001702441773007602458852000902534856008002543930003302623945002502656946001302681655001202694IND4373919820221118042151.0050901e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437391982DNAL7 a162065612pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.9.13972doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRichards, J.D.10aComparative in vitro and in vivo absorption of 2-hydroxy-4(methylthio) butanoic acid and methionine in the broiler chicken  ap. 1397-1405.  aPoultry diets are typically supplemented with DL-2-hydroxy-4(methylthio) butanoic acid (HMTBA, or the hydroxy analog of methionine) or DL-methionine (DLM). Although HMTBA and DLM provide methionine activity, they are structurally distinct molecules with different physiological characteristics until they are converted to L-methionine. The relative rates of intestinal HMTBA vs. DLM absorption have been controversial, and it has been claimed that HMTBA is not fully absorbed. We measured the uptake of HMTBA and DLM in an in vitro everted intestinal slice model. Sections of intestinal slices (jejunum and ileum) were incubated with 0.1 to 50 mM HMTBA that was radiolabeled or DLM that was radiolabeled, and absorption was measured by scintillation counting. The HMTBA uptake was equal to or greater than DLM absorption in each tissue and at every time point with one exception. Furthermore, the rates of HMTBA absorption were always equal to or significantly greater than DLM uptake. In a separate in vivo experiment, absorption of HMTBA and L-methionine was monitored along the entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Broilers were fed commercial-type corn-soy diets supplemented with 0.21 % HMTBA. Digesta was collected from crop, proventriculus, gizzard, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, large intestine, and cloaca and analyzed for the concentration of free HMTBA and free methionine in each compartment. These studies demonstrated that HMTBA is absorbed completely and along the entire GI tract, especially the upper GI tract. Furthermore, there was a higher concentration of free L-methionine than HMTBA in the digesta from every segment distal to the gizzard. 3amethionine hydroxy analog 3afeed additives 3aintestinal absorption 3aradiolabeling 3adigesta 3agastrointestinal system 2aAnimals 2aChickensxmetabolism 2aDiet 2aIleumxanatomy & histologyxmetabolism. 2aIntestinal Absorption 2aJejunumxanatomy & histologyxmetabolism. 2aKinetics 2aMethioninexanalogs & derivativesxanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 2aSoybeans 2aZea mays1 aAtwell, C.A.1 aVazquez-Anon, M.1 aDibner, J.J.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Sept., v. 84, no. 9 p.1397-1405x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.9.13973Available from publisher's Web site  a20051025b20051102c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/09/12  aOther US 7aarticle02251naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159072001700176100001500193245006400208300001800272520073700290650001501027650001201042650002001054650001801074650002001092650001201112650001901124650003901143650002201182650002701204650001301231650003401244650004501278650003501323650002301358650002001381650001701401650001201418700001701430700001801447700002101465773007501486852000901561856008001570930003301650945002501683946001301708655001201721IND4372924820221118042325.0050802e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437292482DNAL7 a160501292pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.7.11232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aObanor, F.10aEffect of processing on turkey meat quality and proteolysis  ap. 1123-1128.  aModern processing techniques for turkey involve rapid chilling to slow microbial growth and early deboning of the economically important breast meat. This paper shows that these 2 processes lead to significantly tougher meat with higher cooking losses. The toughening appears to be due to less extensive proteolysis and shortening of the sarcomeres. Calpains I and II and their inhibitor, calpastatin, were quantified in turkey breast. Calpain II was the more common isoform but showed no evidence of activation during aging. In contrast, calpain I and calpastatin activities declined rapidly and were no longer detected 24 h postslaughter. There was no evidence of an association between calpain activity and processing conditions. 3ahot boning 3acooling 3ameat tenderness 3abreast muscle 3aenzyme activity 2aAnimals 2aBone and Bones 2aCalcium-Binding Proteinsxanalysis 2aCalpainxanalysis 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFreezing 2aMeatxanalysisxmicrobiology. 2aMuscle, Skeletalxchemistryxenzymology. 2aPeptide Hydrolasesxmetabolism 2aPostmortem Changes 2aQuality Control 2aTime Factors 2aTurkeys1 aMorton, J.D.1 aGeesink, G.H.1 aBickerstaffe, R.0 tPoultry science.g2005 July, v. 84, no. 7 p.1123-1128x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.7.11233Available from publisher's Web site  a20060613b20060702c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/08/08  aOther US 7aarticle03241naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159072001700176100001400193245008700207300001800294520176000312650001502072650001702087650001802104650002002122650002002142650002002162650001602182650004702198650001202245650003102257650003102288650003502319650000902354650002402363650001802387650001302405650002102418650001702439700001802456700001402474773007502488852000902563856008002572930003302652945002502685946001302710655001202723IND4373078920221118042348.0050806e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437307892DNAL7 a161562062pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.8.12222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAngel, R.10aPerformance of broiler chickens fed diets supplemented with a direct-fed microbial  ap. 1222-1231.  aFrom hatch to 18 d of age broilers were fed starter diets with (0.9 kg/ton) or without direct fed microbial (DFM). At 18 d, birds were weighed and, within DFM treatment (trt), randomly assigned to battery pens. In Exp 1, a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of nutrient density [control (C, 19.3% protein (CP), 0.84%, Ca 0.37% nonphytin P (nPP); and 17.1% CP, 0.8% Ca, and 0.3% nPP in the grower (Gr) and finisher (Fn) diets, respectively) and moderate (M) (17% CP, 0.69% Ca, 0.30% nPP; 15% CP, 0.66% Ca, 0.25% nPP in the Gr and Fn diets, respectively)] and DFM concentration [0 or 0.9 kg/ton (++)] was used. Exp 2 was a 2 (DSM at 0 and 0.45 kg/ton) x 3 (nutrient densities) factorial. Exp 2 included a low (L) nutrient density that differed from diet M only in Ca and nPP concentrations and an added trt, diet M with 0.45 kg/ton DFM as in Exp 1. At the end of the Gr and Fn weight, feed efficiency, apparent nutrient retention were determined, and 4 birds per pen were sampled for tibia ash. In Exp 2, gains in the Gr phase were 1,122.0, 983.7, 1,121.5, 930.7, and 1,151.5 g in birds fed the C, M, M+, L, and L+ diets, respectively. Addition of DFM to the M diet overcame the negative effect of nutrient concentration on performance but not when the L diet was fed. Nutrient level and DFM affected apparent protein, Ca, and P retention at 32 or 42 d of age with retention increasing as nutrient level decreased and with DFM added to the diet. Ca and P retention at 28 d (Exp 1) was higher in birds fed M++ (45.8 and 46%, respectively) than in those fed the C diet (38.7 and 40.0%, respectively). Feeding the M and L diets resulted in lower tibia ash than that of birds fed the C diet, but the addition of DFM to low nutrient diets overcame this negative effect. 3aprobiotics 3abone density 3aLactobacillus 3afeed conversion 3aliveweight gain 3adietary protein 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBone and Bonesxphysiology 2aCalcification, Physiologic 2aChickensxgrowth & development 2aDiet 2aDietary Supplements 2aLactobacillus 2aMinerals 2aTibiaxchemistry 2aTime Factors1 aDalloul, R.A.1 aDoerr, J.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Aug., v. 84, no. 8 p.1222-1231x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.8.12223Available from publisher's Web site  a20050915b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/08/15  aOther US 7aarticle02891naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245004300126300001600169500001500185520206200200650001802262650001802280650001402298650001502312650001302327653002302340653003402363653002302397773007902420852000902499930003302508945001302541946001102554655001202565IND2200884520221118042149.0991001e199811  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220088452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGross, P.H.10aNew synthetic pathways to C-glycosides  ap. 215-217.  a2019-12-05  aC-glycopyranosyl compounds exhibit antimicrobial, antifungal, and antitumor activities, most probably based on enzyme inhibition or interference with cell surface recognition phenomena. Recent developments in glycobiology have shown the importance of the glycoside component of glycoproteins for cell recognition and differentiation processes. C-glycosidic analogues of that component would be metabolically stable, and thus offer enhanced therapeutic value. Synthesis of a configurational variety of e.g. amino (glycopyranosyl) methanes is thus an important synthetic goal. The amino group would allow linking the C-glycoside to a variety of scaffolds. Our first approach has been to C-link a C-N synthon (HCN or CH3NO2) to the anomeric carbon of a natural carbohydrate. We have realized this with cyanide on glycal, on per-O-acetyl sugars and on cyclic acetal protected glycosyl fluorides, prepared by a novel method. The catalytic hydrogenation of glycosyl cyanides presented challenges and new synthetic possibilities. With CH3NO2, and 4,6-0-alkylidene protected D-glucose or D-mannose derivatives, we obtained very good yields of cyclic Henry condensation products in THF with a novel catalytic procedure. The novel reduction of the resulting nitro (4,6-O-benzylidene-beta-D-glycopyranosyl) methane with Fe0/Ni0 in THF/H2O/CO2 readily supplied amino (4,6-O-benzylidene-beta-D-glucopyranosyl) methane, derivatives of which were diastereodiversified into D-allo, D-manno, and D-altro C-glycosides. These approaches fail, however, if prerequisite natural carbohydrate precursors are not available in a given case. Thus, a total synthesis scheme was also initiated. Phthalimido acetaldehyde diethylacetal and 4-penten-2-ol, with TiCl4, form 2-methyl-4-chloro-6-phthalimido-methyl tetrahydropyran, which was functionalized into phthalimido (6-deoxy-beta-D,L-hexopyranosyl) methanes. Chiral extensions of this method are possible. C-'disaccharides' became available from the Ferrier 'dimerisation' of glycals, and from the hydrogenation of glycosyl cyanides. 3aglycosylation 3ahydrogenation 3asynthesis 3aglycosides 3acyanides 0achemical reactions 0aglycosylcyanide hydrogenation 0ahenry condensation0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g1998 Nov., v. 37, no. 3 p.215-217x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a19991031b19991104c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02303naa a2200229 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245014700131300001400278500002400292520148500316651001601801700001501817773015801832852000901990939003301999946002902032655001202061IND8102305820221118042124.0810309e198101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND810230582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLugo-Lopez, M.A.10aHigh yields of non-fertilized protein-rich pigeon peas on tropical soils of low inherent fertility of Puerto Rico: an explanation of a paradox  ap. 21-28.  aSummary in Spanish.  aPigeon peas do not respond to the application of fertilizers on soils of low inherent fertility under conditions in Puerto Rico, although sizeable yields, sometimes over 7800 kg/ha of green pods and seeds, with over 20% protein, are obtained with high-yielding cultivars, sound crop protection practices and adequate soil and crop management techniques. It is estimated that in terms of kg/ha a pigeon pea crop of some 7800 kg/ha removes nutrients at approximately the rates of N, 60; P, 15; K, 20; Ca, 20; and Mg, 10. A plausible explanation for the lack of response to N can be based on the known fact that pigeon peas can fix atomospheric N through rhizobial action at a rate of at least 14.5 mg/day/plant to supplement the N provided from the reserves of soil organic matter and root residues. For a plant population of 17,284/ha this fixation would amount to some 45 to 50 kg for the pigeon pea growing period. Large P applications over the years coupled with P fixation on the soil and gradual release afterwards might explain the observed lack of response to fertilizer P. On the other hand, the relatively high K-supplying power of soils where pigeon peas are grown, together with the small demand of the crop, explains the lack of response to fertilizer K. Many acid soils of the tropics can supply enough Ca as a nutrient to meet the demands of pigeon pea crops. Pigeon peas use relatively small amounts of Mg, which appears to be available in many soils of Puerto Rico. 3aPuerto Rico1 aAbrams, R.0 tJournal of agriculture of the University of Puerto Rico - Puerto Rico, Agricultural Experiment Station.g1981 Jan., v. 65, no. 1 p.21-28x0041-994X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19810309c00000000  aState experiment station 7aarticle02653naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140072001700158100002300175245008700198300001600285520108000301650002601381650002501407650002801432650002101460650002401481650001201505650003901517650002501556650002601581650002301607650003901630650005301669650003301722650000901755650006501764650002901829700002301858700002001881700002601901773007301927852000902000856007902009930003302088945002502121946001302146655001202159IND4370927620221118042224.0050602e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437092762DNAL7 a159715352pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.6.9472doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In chickens, D-glucose and amino acid absorption occurs via carrier-mediated transport, but in wild birds a passive paracellular mechanism seems to be the predominant pathway. The purpose of this work was to determine the existence of carrier-mediated sodium cotransport of D-glucose and L-alanine in the small intestine of Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix), a granivorous bird. Intestinal transport was determined by changes in the short-circuit current (Isc), proportional to ion transmembrane flux, in the middle segment of the intestine of Japanese quail with a Ussing chamber. D-Glucose produced an increase of the Isc, and this effect was reverted by phloridzin, indicating the presence of a D-glucose transport mediated by the sodium/glucose cotranspoter 1. Addition of L-alanine also produced an increase of the Isc. We concluded that there is carrier-mediated cotransport of D-glucose and L-alanine with sodium in the small intestine of the Japanese quail. 3aintestinal absorption 3aglucose transporters 3aamino acid transporters 3ain vitro studies 2aAlaninexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBiological Transportxdrug effects 2aCoturnixxmetabolism 2aElectric Conductivity 2aElectric Impedance 2aGlucosexmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aIntestinal Absorptionxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aIntestine, Smallxphysiology 2aMale 2aMonosaccharide Transport Proteinsxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPhlorhizinxpharmacology1 aCastillo, J.R. del1 aEglee Perez, M.1 aDominguez-Bello, M.G.0 tPoultry science.g2005 June, v. 84, no. 6 p.947-950x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.6.9473Available from publisher's Web site  a20070831b20070902c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/06/18  aOther US 7aarticle02887naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140072001700158072001700175100001600192245008100208300001600289520142800305650002301733650001201756650002101768650001801789650001901807650001101826650001601837650004701853650001201900650001601912650002401928650000901952650003901961650006402000650003402064650002802098700001702126700001902143773007202162852000902234856007902243930003302322945002502355946001302380655001202393IND4372300420221118042143.0050714e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437230042DNAL7 a159131872pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.5.7482doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

An understanding of the interplay between nutrition and satellite cell mitotic activity will lead to more efficient meat production. The objective of this study was to test the influence of the leucine metabolite, beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), and feed deprivation on muscle development in the early posthatch poult. Male Nicholas poults were placed on 1 of 4 treatments: immediately fed a starter diet with 0.1% HMB (IF-HMB), immediately fed a starter diet containing 0.1% Solka-Floc for a control (IF-No HMB), feed and water withheld for 48 h immediately posthatch and then fed the HMB diet (WF-HMB), and feed and water withheld for 48 h immediately posthatch and then fed the control starter diet (WF-No HMB). 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected intra-abdominally into all poults to label mitotically active satellite cells. The pectoralis thoracicus was harvested 2 h after the BrdU injection. Immunohistochemistry for BrdU, Pax7, and laminin along with computer-based image analysis was used to study muscle development. IF-HMB poults had higher body weights (P < 0.01) at 48 h and 1 wk of age and had higher satellite cell mitotic activity at 48 h of age (P < 0.01) compared with the IF-No HMB and WF poults. Therefore, dietary supplementation of HMB may have an anabolic effect on early posthatch muscle. 3amuscle development 3amitosis 3afeed deprivation 3astarter diets 3afeed additives 3apoults 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aDietary Supplements 2aMale 2aMitosisxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aSatellite Cells, Skeletal Musclexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aTurkeysxgrowth & development 2aValeratesxpharmacology1 aFerket, P.R.1 aMozdziak, P.E.0 tPoultry science.g2005 May, v. 84, no. 5 p.748-756x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.5.7483Available from publisher's Web site  a20050921b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/08/05  aOther US 7aarticle02549naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140072001700158072001700175100002000192245011000212300001600322500001500338520111100353650002301464650002001487650002501507650002001532650001401552650001601566650004701582650001201629650001601641650004801657650001401705650002201719650002101741650000901762650002001771650001301791653002001804773007201824852000901896856007901905930003301984945002502017946001302042655001202055IND4372300120221118042055.0050714e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437230012DNAL7 a159131862pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.5.7422doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In the first experiment, 4 experimental diets were fed from 14 to 21 d of age with increasing quantities of DDC replacing corn as the sole source of energy and protein (93.4% of diet). The AME(n) was determined to be 3,267 and 3,364 kcal/kg for the corn grain and DDC, respectively. Apparent ileal amino acid digestibility was determined with birds at 21 d of age. Digestibility of threonine, lysine, arginine, and tryptophan was significantly less in birds fed the DDC versus a corn diet (P < 0.05). In the subsequent experiment, birds were fed diets from hatch to 42 d of age with corn or DDC as the primary grain source. By 42 d of age, BW and feed consumption between birds fed the corn or DDC diet were similar (P > 0.05). However, birds fed the DDC diet excreted 78.1 g less DM and 1.54 g less P by 42 d of age (P < 0.05). In conclusion, replacement of corn with DDC resulted in similar performance of broilers to 42 d of age with reduced excretion of DM and P. 3amineral metabolism 3afeed processing 3ametabolizable energy 3abroiler feeding 3aexcretion 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aChickensxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aDigestion 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFeeding Behavior 2aMale 2aNutritive Value 2aZea mays 0anutritive value0 tPoultry science.g2005 May, v. 84, no. 5 p.742-747x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.5.7423Available from publisher's Web site  a20050921b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/08/05  aOther US 7aarticle02745naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100001800194245016400212300001800376520121900394650002001613650002001633650002001653650001901673650001601692650001201708650003001720650003501750650000901785650003701794650002101831650000901852650003001861650006101891700001701952700001301969700001401982700001801996773007602014852000902090856008102099930003302180945002502213946001302238655001202251IND4366224120221118041934.0041223e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436622412DNAL7 a156150122pmid7 a10.1093/ps/83.12.19922doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aJackson, M.E.12aA dose-response study with the feed enzyme beta-mannanase in broilers provided with corn-soybean meal based diets in the absence of antibiotic growth promoters  ap. 1992-1996.  aAn experiment was designed to assess the effects of graded levels of beta-mannanase on performance and body weight uniformity of male broilers provided with diets based on corn and soybean meal and devoid of antibiotic growth promoters or coccidiostats. Four dietary treatments contained 0, 50, 80, and 110 MU of Hemicell/ton (where 1 MU = 10(6) enzyme activity units, 100 MU/ton is manufacturer's recommendation). Each treatment contained 15 pens with 40 birds/pen. Individual bird weights were determined on d 0, 21, and 42. From 21 to 42 d of age, feed intake for the 80 MU/ton treatment was significantly greater than the 50 MU/ton treatment. beta-Mannanase inclusion at 80 or 110 MU/ton induced improvements (P < 0.05) in weight gain (3.9 to 4.8%) and feed efficiency (3.5 to 3.8%) over the control, whereas inclusion of 50 MU/ton resulted in no significant benefit. There were no significant differences between 80 or 110 MU/ton. The experiment demonstrated that dietary inclusion of beta-mannanase at approximately 50 MU/ton is not sufficient for maximum response. Inclusion at 80 MU/ton improved broiler gains and feed conversion and increasing to 110 MU/ton resulted in no significant additional response. 3aliveweight gain 3afeed conversion 3abroiler feeding 3afeed additives 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aChickensxgrowth & development 2aDiet 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFeeding Behavior 2aMale 2aWeight Gainxdrug effects 2abeta-Mannosidasexadministration & dosagexpharmacology.1 aGeronian, K.1 aKnox, A.1 aMcNab, J.1 aMcCartney, E.0 tPoultry science.g2004 Dec., v. 83, no. 12 p.1992-1996x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/83.12.19923Available from publisher's Web site  a20050119b20050130c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/01/19  aOther US 7aarticle03261naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160100001300177245012400190300001800314520191800332650002002250650001002270650002002280650001602300650002202316650001202338650005402350650004002404650003702444650006402481650002802545700001702573700001202590773007602602852000902678856008102687930003302768945002502801946001302826655001202839IND4366224520221118041944.0041223e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436622452DNAL7 a156150162pmid7 a10.1093/ps/83.12.20232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aTako, E.10aEffects of in ovo feeding of carbohydrates and beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate on the development of chicken intestine  ap. 2023-2028.  aEarly development of the digestive tract is crucial for achieving maximal growth and development of chickens. Because the late-term embryo naturally consumes the amniotic fluids, insertion of a nutrient solution into the embryonic amniotic fluid [in ovo (IO) feeding] may enhance development. This study examined the effect of IO feeding on d 17.5 of incubation of carbohydrates (CHO) and beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) on small intestinal development of chickens during the pre and posthatch periods. Results shows that 48 h post-IO feeding procedure all IO feeding treatments exhibited increased villus width and surface area compared with the control group. At d 3 posthatch the surface area of an average villi was increased by 45% for the HMB IO group and by 33% for the CHO and CHO+HMB IO groups compared with controls (noninjected fertile eggs). The activity of jejunal sucrase-isomaltase (SI) was higher (P < 0.05) 48 h after IO feeding in all the IO fed embryos, whereas at day of hatch and at d 3 the CHO+HMB IO group had the highest maltase activity (P < 0.05), which was approximately 50% greater than control embryos. These observations indicated that small intestines of IO fed hatchlings were functionally at a similar stage of development as a conventionally fed 2-d-old chick. Body weight of all IO fed hatchlings was greater than controls, and these differences (P < 0.05) were sustained until the end of the experiment (10 d). At d 10 chicks that were IO fed with CHO had BW that were 2.2% higher, whereas HMB and CHO+HMB IO fed chicks showed 5 to 6.2% BW increase, respectively, compared with controls. The current study shows that the administration of exogenous nutrients into the amnion enhanced intestinal development by increasing the size of the villi and by increasing the intestinal capacity to digest disaccharides. This advantage probably leads to higher BW in IO fed chicks. 3aembryo (animal) 3avilli 3aenzyme activity 3abody weight 3aintestinal mucosa 2aAnimals 2aChick Embryoxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aDietary Carbohydratesxpharmacology 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aIntestinesxdrug effectsxembryologyxgrowth & development. 2aValeratesxpharmacology1 aFerket, P.R.1 aUni, Z.0 tPoultry science.g2004 Dec., v. 83, no. 12 p.2023-2028x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/83.12.20233Available from publisher's Web site  a20050119b20050130c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/01/19  aOther US 7aarticle02140naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100002100194245005100215300001800266500001500284520066900299650002800968650002200996650001601018650003001034650002501064650001401089650001601103650004001119650001201159650002801171650003301199650002001232650000901252650002601261650003901287650002301326650002401349653002401373773007601397852000901473856008101482930003301563945002501596946001301621655001201634IND4366225320221118042043.0041223e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436622532DNAL7 a156150242pmid7 a10.1093/ps/83.12.20832doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPuthpongsiriporn, U.10aEffects of dietary ratio of linoleic to linolenic acid on performance, antibody production, and in vitro lymphocyte proliferation in two strains of Leghorn pullet chicks  ap. 846-857.  aThe effects of dietary ratio of linoleic acid to linolenic acid on performance, mitogenic lymphocyte proliferation, and antibody production were evaluated in Leghorn pullets during a rigorous vaccination program. Diets were supplemented with flaxseed and corn oil to achieve 4 dietary ratios of linoleic acid to linolenic acid 17:1 (control), 8:1, 4:1, or 2:1. Each diet was fed to Hy-Line Brown or W-36 pullets from 1 d to 16 wk of age. Day-old pullets were randomly assigned to 8 replicate cages with 12 pullets per cage; the density was reduced to 8 pullets per cage at 11 wk of age. Dietary treatments did not affect body weight, feed consumption, or pullet mortality. At 12 wk of age, an interaction between diet and strain (P less than or equal to 0.004) showed Hy-Line W-36 pullets fed the 2:1 ratio had greater antibody production against Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine than those fed diets with higher ratios. At wk 16, pullets fed ratios of 4:1 and 2:1 had the greatest antibody production against NDV vaccine. Antibody production against infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) vaccine was also increased (P < 0.04) by ratios of 4:1 (2.244 optical density; OD) or 2:1 (2.508 OD) as compared with the control diet (1.576 OD). Hy-Line Brown pullets had greater antibody production against infectious bronchitis virus vaccine compared with Hy-Line W-36 pullets at 16 wk of age. These results indicate that feeding a reduced dietary ratio of linoleic to linolenic acid by adding flaxseed to the diets enhanced antibody response to NDV and IBDV vaccines without any negative effects on pullet performance. 3adietary fat 3avaccination 3aantibody formation 3aline differences 2aAnimals 2aAntibody Formation 2aBursa of Fabriciusxchemistry 2aChickensximmunologyxphysiology. 2aCorn Oilxadministration & dosage 2aDiet 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aFlax 2aInfectious bursal disease virusximmunology 2aLinoleic Acidxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aLymphocyte Activation 2aNewcastle disease virusximmunology 2aPoultry Diseasesximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aSoybeans 2aSpleenxchemistry 2aThymus Glandxchemistry 2aVaccinationxveterinary 2aZea mays 2aalpha-Linolenic Acidxadministration & dosagexanalysis.1 aScheideler, S.E.0 tPoultry science.g2005 June, v. 84, no. 6 p.846-857x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.6.8463Available from publisher's Web site  a20070831b20070902c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/06/18  aOther US 7aarticle02265naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140072001700158072001700175100001900192245007400211300001600285520106500301650001401366650001101380650001701391650001301408650001201421650001301433650003801446650003401484650000901518650001101527650001301538650001601551650003201567773007301599852000901672856007901681930003301760945002501793946001301818655001201831IND4372365120221118042336.0050718e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437236512DNAL7 a157829192pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.3.4822doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The research reported here is directed at the prediction of egg volume and surface area, and develops a formula that could be both accurate and suitable for calculations. The objective of this research was to improve the accuracy of the calculations of egg volume and surface area based on the measurements of the egg length and breadth. The experiment was carried out with 90 fresh eggs from a flock of Hy-Line Brown chicks at the age of 65 wk. The resulting formula for egg volume, V, was V = (0.6057 - 0.0018B)LB2 in which L is the egg length in millimeters, and B is the egg maximum breadth in millimeters. Egg surface area, S, was calculated as S = (3.155 - 0.0136L + 0.0115B)LB, in which both L and B are taken in millimeters. 3aequations 3avolume 3asurface area 3aaccuracy 2aAnimals 2aBiometry 2aChick Embryoxanatomy & histology 2aChickensxanatomy & histology 2aEggs 2aFemale 2aIndustry 2aMathematics 2aSensitivity and Specificity0 tPoultry science.g2005 Mar., v. 84, no. 3 p.482-484x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.3.4823Available from publisher's Web site  a20050913b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/08/05  aOther US 7aarticle01908naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140072001700158100001600175245005700191300001600248520080500264650001501069650001801084650002301102650002201125650001201147650005801159650002101217650000901238650002501247700001801272773007301290852000901363856007901372930003301451945002501484946001301509655001201522IND4372366520221118042516.0050718e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437236652DNAL7 a158448092pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.4.5432doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

To 40 d of age, coefficients of selenium retention increased (P < 0.05) daily in the SG and FG groups by 0.76 and 0.61%, respectively. From 40 to 100 d, the regression coefficients were not significant. Coefficients of selenium retention and retention per unit of body gain were higher in SG chickens. The influence of age on selenium content in BW gain of birds was evident (P < 0.01). From 5 to 40 d, allometric coefficients were 1.444 and 1.070 for SG and FG, respectively, and from d 40 to 100 the corresponding values were 1.282 and 1.081, respectively. 3aanimal age 3aanimal growth 3anutrient retention 2aAgingxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aChickensxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aFeeding Behavior 2aMale 2aSeleniumxmetabolism1 aFajmonova, E.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Apr., v. 84, no. 4 p.543-546x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.4.5433Available from publisher's Web site  a20050913b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/08/03  aOther US 7aarticle03723naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140072001700158072001700175100001700192245011900209300001600328500001500344520200400359650001902363650001602382650001202398650002302410650002102433650002002454650001602474650003902490650001202529650001602541650005102557650002102608650001102629650003502640650001102675650001402686650001002700650002502710650004902735650001702784650002402801653001802825700001702843700002202860700001902882773007302901852000902974856007902983930003303062945002503095946001303120655001203133IND4372365320221118042339.0050718e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437236532DNAL7 a157829202pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.3.4852doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Hens were placed in a curtain-sided house with 48 pens (10 birds per pen; 8 pens per treatment) at 31 wk and were fed a breeder ration with treatments as follows: HP, dietary available P = 0.55%; HPE, HP + E; MP, dietary available P = 0.35%; MPE, MP + E; LP, dietary available P = 0.17%; and LPE, LP + E. Feed and water were available ad libitum for 28 wk of lay. Diets were fed in mash form, and all other nutrients were formulated to meet or exceed NRC requirements. All hens were photostimulated in January (31 wk) with 15.5 h of light daily. Production data were recorded on a pen basis. Individual bird BW and feed consumption, by pen, were determined at monthly intervals from 31 to 62 wk. Hens were observed for weekly reproductive performance for hen housed egg production, hen-day egg production, settable eggs, cumulative settable eggs, hens out of lay, and hen mortality and for biweekly performance for egg fertility, hatchability of all eggs, hatchability of fertile eggs, egg weight loss, conductance, conductance constant (k), and embryonic mortality. Egg weight, eggshell thickness, egg components, and albumen and yolk P were measured monthly. At 62 wk of age, hen tibia P, plasma P, total fecal P, and water-soluble fecal P were determined. Decreasing dietary P resulted in no decreases in reproductive performance for turkey breeder hens to 62 wk. Additionally, decreased dietary P resulted in decreased total fecal P and water-soluble fecal P. Feeding turkey breeder hens dietary phytase enzyme resulted in significantly fewer hens going out of lay; however, this was not reflected in hen housed egg production. It was concluded that phosphorus could be lowered in turkey breeder hen diets, compared with current surveyed industry levels, without impairing reproductive performance. 3afeed additives 3aturkey eggs 3aexcreta 3alaying performance 3aegg hatchability 3amineral content 3aturkey hens 2a6-Phytasexadministration & dosage 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aChick Embryoxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aDietxveterinary 2aEating 2aEgg Shellxanatomy & histology 2aFemale 2aFertility 2aLight 2aPhosphorusxanalysis 2aPhosphorus, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aReproduction 2aTurkeysxphysiology 0aegg fertility1 aGrimes, J.L.1 aChristensen, V.L.1 aWineland, M.J.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Mar., v. 84, no. 3 p.485-493x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.3.4853Available from publisher's Web site  a20050913b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/08/05  aOther US 7aarticle03475naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100003400181245014200215300001800357500002400375506007600399520174300475506003702218650001102255650002502266650002002291650002302311650002202334650001302356650004402369650002502413650001502438650001802453650001802471650003302489650002202522700003102544700002102575700002802596700002702624700001902651700002602670773013602696852000902832856008002841856004802921655001202969IND4395589820221207103440.0070930e20071001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439558982DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.01230-072doi7 aPMC20750032pmcid7 a176935692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOceguera-Cervantes, Alejandro10aCharacterization of the Polyurethanolytic Activity of Two Alicycliphilus sp.

These were selected for their capacity to grow in a minimal medium (MM) supplemented with a commercial surface-coating polyurethane (PU) (Hydroform) as the carbon source (MM-PUh). Both bacterial strains were identified as Alicycliphilus sp. by comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Growth in MM-PUh showed hyperbolic behavior, with BQ1 producing higher maximum growth (17.8 ± 0.6 mg·ml⁻¹) than BQ8 (14.0 ± 0.6 mg·ml⁻¹) after 100 h of culture. Nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses of Hydroform showed that it was a polyester PU type which also contained N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) as an additive. Alicycliphilus sp. utilizes NMP during the first stage of growth and was able to use it as the sole carbon and nitrogen source, with calculated Ks values of about 8 mg·ml⁻¹. Enzymatic activities related to PU degradation (esterase, protease, and urease activities) were tested by using differential media and activity assays in cell-free supernatants of bacterial cultures in MM-PUh. Induction of esterase activity in inoculated MM-PUh, but not that of protease or urease activities, was observed at 12 h of culture. Esterase activity reached its maximum at 18 h and was maintained at 50% of its maximal activity until the end of the analysis (120 h). The capacity of Alicycliphilus sp. to degrade PU was demonstrated by changes in the PU IR spectrum and by the numerous holes produced in solid PU observed by scanning electron microscopy after bacterial culture. Changes in the PU IR spectra indicate that an esterase activity is involved in PU degradation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon 3adevelopmental stages 3aenzyme activity 3agas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anucleotide sequences 3apolyesters 3apolyurethanes 3aribosomal RNA 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asequence analysis1 aCarrillo-García, Agustín1 aLópez, Néstor.1 aBolaños-Nuñez, Sandra1 aCruz-Gómez, M.

The present paper is the first one of the papers devoted to a computer system elaborated by us for investigating the regularities of construction and calculating secondary and tertiary structures of globular proteins. This system takes account of a step-by-step proteins self-organization process. Section 1 is an introduction to the entire series and describes shortly a general scheme or the whole system (Fig.1). Section 2 is devoted to a method of calculating the secondary structure (SS) of globular proteins by their amino acid sequence based on using data of discriminant analysis in choosing conformation or a particular segment of polypeptide chain. A problem of searching for SS regular organization has been formulated here in the following way: each amino acid or fragment of the protein considered with the related set of signs values characterizing different types of interactions, should be attached to one of the two alternative SS classes. (As pairs of alternative classes there have been taken alpha-helix -not-helix, beta-structure-not-beta-structure, turn-not-turn, N-end-not-N-end, C-end-not-C-end. Section 2.1 deals with a search for the most informative characteristics influencing a division of alternative classes. The number of signs to be analyzed included both the frequently used characteristics (various physical-chemical parameters, hydrophobic moments of alpha-helices and beta-structures and so on) and a number of others (such as, the number of amino acids in hydrophobic cluster, hydrophobic cluster energy of a alpha-helix, energy of a hydrophobic side of beta-structure and so on). Sampling of informative characteristics was performed by Fisher's F-factor [14]. Makhalonobis's distance was taken as a measure for dividing into classes. Fig. 2 is a scheme of an algorithm of search for the most informative characteristics. The method has been realised on SM-4 and IBM-PS computers. A complete list of all the chosen characteristics is given in Table 1. Sets of characteristics and coefficients values of the discriminant function for different pairs of classes are presented in Tables 2-8. To attribute the t-th amino acid of a particular protein to one of the classes one may use the following rule of classification: if delta is greater than or equal to P, then a given amino acid belongs to class I, in the opposite case to class II, where delta = ..., and P is certain threshold; xt= (x1t, x2t,...,xpt) is the signs 1,2,...,p, calculated for t-th amino acid. Here Fisher's vector in designated by beta = ..., and ... = 1/2 beta (X1+X2); X1 and X2 are the vectors, being mean for classes I and II, and ... is the inverse united covarion matrix. Section 2.2. is devoted to automatic revealing the discrete secondary structures (alpha-helices and beta-structures). For this a model of SS formation has been proposed that uses the three integral signs: delta-N, delta-iN, and delta-C (where, for example, delta-iN(i2) is calculated as the average value delta from (I) for a region of amino acid sequence with the centre in the i-th position). With these signs taken into account a discriminant analysis of teaching sampling was performed for classes of a "alpha-helix-not-helix" "beta-structure-not-beta-structure", with delta-N, delta-iN, delta-C being calculated for N-end, internal region and C-end, respectively. The values delta-x for classes (alpha-not-alpha)9 and (beta-not-beta)7 are shown in Table 9. Shown in Fig.3 is the scheme of an algorithm for calculating the secondary structure of proteins. The method had been considered to predict the three states of SS (alpha, beta, c) with the 63% accuracy. Data on testing the method on teaching and control samplings are shown in Tables 10-13. Prediction accuracy competes with the best foreign methods [6]. One may note, however, some essential distinctions.

The secondary mRNA structure is made out of mutually complementary areas of this molecule, forming the so called hairpins spiral structures preventing ribosome movement along mRNA. An imitational computer model, which allows to estimate the effectiveness of an mRNA translation process regarding parameters of its secondary structure (energy stability of a hairpins, number of complementary pairs in them and localization of a hairpins) is suggested. The movement of ribosomes along mRNA is considered to be a stochastic step-by-step process. The quantitative identification of such a model parameter as a constant of hairpins melting by ribosome is carried out. It appeared that the value of this parameter lies within 0.1-1 sec-1. The model describes the kinetics of translation process in good accordance with the present experimental data and can be used for assessing the efficiency of the concrete mRNA translation process (natural an well an artificial, appearing in gene-engineering construction, molecular-genetical systems). 3amessenger RNA 3asimulation models 3amolecular conformation 3aribosomes 3aprotein secondary structure 0acomputer simulation 0atranslation 0ahairpin structures1 aIschenko, I.W.1 aOmelyjanchuk, L.W.0 tComputer analysis of structure, function and evolution of genetic macromolecules : intellectualisation problems N.A.

Description of protein topological structure is presented in fig. 1. Principle of system functioning consists in automatic generating and further test of various hypotheses on interdependence between topological and primary structures of protein molecules. An original format was suggested here for presenting knowledge in terms of computer methods for recognition of structural and functional determinants of biopolymers by their primary structures (sect.2). An important feature of the proposed method for automatic production of knowledge consists in using a mechanism of "feedback" between generation processes and testing the hypotheses. New hypotheses are generated not by their complete sampling within the knowledge format but using a logical analysis of various hypotheses already tested. So, each act of "generating and testing" an hypothesis is followed by "self-teaching" of expert system: it receives information needed for determining the most perspective direction of work and excluding deadlock, false ways of searching. To optimize its work the two types of knowledge are used in expert system: a) a priori knowledge (put into it by the elaborators) on theoretical methods and practical experience in application of pattern recognition methods, data analysis, method of optimal planning of experiments, physical, chemical and statistical properties of amino acid residues, description of their location in protein polypeptide chains; b) knowledge on statistically significant interrelations between amino acid sequences and topologies of protein and predicting abilities of the tested characteristics of amino acid sequences. Thus, using the principle of "generating and testing the hypotheses with feedback" makes it possible to design "a device of logical deduction" of new (i.e. unknown a priori) knowledge on the relationship between the topological structures of proteins and their amino acid sequences. The output of expert system is: 1) particular method for recognition of definite topological structures of proteins. OR 2) conclusion of expert system on its inability to devise such method based on experimental data presented. Method of recognition produced by the expert system (sect.3) is Fisher's linear discriminant (1) with the known coefficients B(0), B(1) .... B(n) determined during the expert system running. The linear discriminant contains a set of parameters Y(1)....Y(n). presenting the characteristics of amino acid sequences, whose form was also selected during the expert system functioning. Section 4 presents a description of expert system architecture with short outline of its main program units and functional connections between them. Section 5 deals with characteristics of input data of expert system (amino acid sequences, topological structures of proteins, physical and chemical properties of amino acid residues, bases of discrete spectral transformations, used for arrangement of continuous curves for variations of physical and chemical properties along amino acid sequences in discrete spectrum Yqv(s) of vectors of the mean Xq(j) in basis of vector-lines of matrix Fv(s,j)). Section 6 presents the program unit of generating methods for predicting topological structures of proteins by their amino acid sequences. Examples of solving rules used by expert system in its work are given. Section 7 gives description of the program unit for statistical analysis of methods for predicting topologies. Examples of the rules characterizing the methods are discussed in terms of adequacy, balance, accurate predictions of protein topological structures.

The work finds application in development of machine vision system for grain identification, classification and grading. 3aautomatic detection 3afood grains 3afood preparation 3aimage analysis 3amung beans 3aneural networks 3apigeon peas 3atrays 3awheat 0aColour features 0agrain identification 0aimage segmentation 0amultiple grain images 0atextural features1 aSavakar, Dayanand G.1 aBiradar, Vijay S.0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2009 Dec., v. 44, no. 12 p.2452-2458dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2009.02034.x 7aarticle03267naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245011500198300001800313500002400331506007600355520168000431506003702111650002602148650001902174650001102193650001302204650001002217650001102227650001702238650001702255650001402272651001202286651001202298651001102310651001702321700001902338700002102357700001902378700002402397700001602421700001802437700001802455700001902473700001902492773013702511852000902648856008002657655001202737IND4407766420221207102301.0080712e20080715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440776642DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02821-072doi7 aPMC24931772pmcid7 a184874022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZiebell, Kim10aGenotypic Characterization and Prevalence of Virulence Factors among Canadian Escherichia coli O157:H7 Strains  ap. 4314-4323.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this study, the association between genotypic and selected phenotypic characteristics was examined in a collection of Canadian Escherichia coli O157:H7 strains isolated from humans and cattle in the provinces of Alberta, Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Quebec. In a subset of 69 strains selected on the basis of specific phage types (PTs), a strong correlation between the lineage-specific polymorphism assay (LSPA6) genotype and PT was observed with all strains of PTs 4, 14, 21, 31, 33, and 87 belonging to the LSPA6 lineage I (LSPA6-LI) genotype, while those of PTs 23, 45, 67, and 74 belonged to LSPA6 lineage II (LSPA6-LII) genotypes. This correlation was maintained when additional strains of each PT were tested. E. coli O157:H7 strains with the LSPA6-LI genotype were much more common in the collection than were the LSPA6-LII or lineage I/II (LSPA6-LI/II)-related genotypes (82.6, 11.2, and 5.8%, respectively). Of the strains tested, proportionately more LSPA6-LI than LSPA6-LII genotype strains were isolated from humans (52.7% versus 19.7%) than from cattle (47.8% versus 80.2%). In addition, 96.7% of the LSPA6-LII strains carried the stx₂c variant gene, while only 50.0% of LSPA6-LI/II and 2.7% of LSPA6-LI strains carried this gene. LSPA6-LII strains were also significantly more likely to possess the colicin D gene, cda (50.8% versus 23.2%), and have combined resistance to streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline (72.1% versus 0.9%) than were LSPA6-LI strains. The LSPA6 genotype- and PT-related characteristics identified may be important markers of specific ecotypes of E. coli O157:H7 that have unique epidemiological and virulence characteristics.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli O157 3abacteriophages 3acattle 3aecotypes 3agenes 3ahumans 3astreptomycin 3atetracycline 3avirulence 3aAlberta 3aOntario 3aQuebec 3aSaskatchewan1 aSteele, Marina1 aZhang, Yongxiang1 aBenson, Andrew1 aTaboada, Eduardo N.1 aLaing, Chad1 aMcEwen, Scott1 aCiebin, Bruce1 aJohnson, Roger1 aGannon, Victor0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2008 July 15, v. 74, no. 14 p.4314-4323dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02821-073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03583naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245003600190300001600226500002400242520207400266650000802340650001502348650001602363650001602379650001902395650000902414650001202423650001502435650001002450650002102460650001302481650001602494650001702510650002302527650001202550650000902562650002302571650001102594650004202605650000902647650002702656650002602683650006702709700002502776700002202801700002102823773013302844852000902977856005502986655001203041IND4427013420221118040943.0091011e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442701342DNAL7 a198218822pmid7 a10.1111/j.1476-4431.2009.00458.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Judy E.10aNoninvasive ventilation in cats  ap. 416-425.  aIncludes references  aThe primary objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) in cats. The secondary objective was to determine whether cardiovascular parameters and anesthetic drug requirements associated with noninvasive ventilation differ from those associated with invasive ventilation. Randomized, cross-over design. A research laboratory in a veterinary teaching hospital. Eight healthy adult cats, 3 intact females and 5 intact males, weighing between 3 and 6 kg, were used. Each cat was randomly assigned to NIV via nasal mask, or invasive ventilation using an endotracheal tube. Mechanical ventilation was performed for 6 hours. Anesthesia was provided using continuous infusions of propofol and butorphanol. After a minimum 9-day washout period, the procedure was repeated using the alternate ventilation interface. Cardiovascular parameters (heart rate, rectal temperature, direct arterial blood pressure), arterial blood gases, drug requirements, sedation score, and ventilation parameters, were monitored throughout the procedures. These values were evaluated using ANCOVA for repeated measures. All cats were effectively ventilated using NIV. There were no significant differences in cardiovascular parameters, drug requirements, or sedation scores between groups. Although PaCO₂ values did not differ, PaO₂ values were significantly higher in the invasively ventilated group. Inspiratory tidal volumes were similar between groups, whereas expiratory tidal volumes were significantly lower in the NIV group. Inspiratory pressures were significantly higher in the NIV group. Respiratory frequency was significantly higher in the invasively ventilated group. NIV of cats is possible. However, currently it does not confer any cardiovascular benefit over invasive ventilation and drug requirements are similar. Use of a correctly fitted mask is essential for successful NIV as air leaks account for the observed discrepancy between inspiratory and expiratory volumes. Further investigation into this modality is warranted. 3aair 3aanesthesia 3aanesthetics 3ablood gases 3ablood pressure 3acats 3afemales 3aheart rate 3amales 3arespiratory rate 3asedation 3atemperature 3atidal volume 3aveterinary clinics 2aAnimals 2aCats 2aCross-Over Studies 2aFemale 2aIntubation, Intratrachealxveterinary 2aMale 2aPulmonary Gas Exchange 2aPulmonary Ventilation 2aRespiration, Artificialxinstrumentationxmethodsxveterinary.1 aBersenas, Alexa M.E.1 aMathews, Karol A.1 aKerr, Carolyn L.0 tJournal of veterinary emergency and critical care.g2009 Oct., v. 19, no. 5 p.416-425dBlackwell Publishing Incx1479-32617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-4431.2009.00458.x 7aarticle02533naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245010500170300001600275500002400291520126300315650001801578650001201596650000801608650002101616650001901637650001501656650001001671650001001681650001301691651001201704651001201716653002701728653001901755653002101774653002201795700001901817700001501836700001701851700001901868700001601887773010801903852000902011856005502020655001202075IND4392230620221118040939.0070610e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439223062DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2494.2007.00578.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNivyobizi, A.14aThe choice of a fitting model for in sacco degradation curves of some temperate and tropical grasses  ap. 198-207.  aIncludes references  aThe objective was to compare alternative models for fitting to data on degradation of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM) and crude protein (CP) in the rumen of two harvests of four temperate grasses, made into hay in Belgium, and one harvest of three tropical grasses commonly used in Burundi. Fifteen non-linear models were used and these included generalized Mitscherlich, simple Mitscherlich (or exponential), generalized Michaelis-Menten, Gompertz, logistic, simple Michaelis-Menten, segmented Van Milgen and von Bertalanffy models. Degradation profiles of DM, OM and CP obtained in sacco from the rumen of three mature sheep were fitted to all the models. The convergence success rate along with acceptable parameters was used as a first tool to eliminate models. Comparisons between the remaining twelve models were then made using the run test of sign, the root mean square prediction error, the root mean square error, the lack of fit test and the variance ratio test criteria. On the basis of an overall assessment using these tests, the Gompertz lagged model was the best suited to fit the degradation data of both temperate and tropical grasses. This study confirmed the superiority of sigmoid type functions over diminishing return-type models. 3acrude protein 3agrasses 3ahay 3anonlinear models 3aorganic matter 3aprediction 3arumen 3asheep 3avariance 3aBelgium 3aBurundi 0ain sacco degradability 0afitting models 0atropical grasses 0atemperate grasses1 aDeswysen, A.G.1 aMoreau, B.1 aDehareng, D.1 aLarondelle, Y.1 aPeeters, A.0 tGrass and forage science.g2007 June, v. 62, no. 2 p.198-207dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0142-52427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2494.2007.00578.x 7aarticle03713naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001900157245005800176300001800234500002400252500001500276520234800291650001302639650001102652650001402663650002002677650001102697650000902708650001102717650001902728650001502747650000802762650001602770650001602786650001202802650001002814650001202824650005902836650004702895650001602942650001602958653002502974700001802999773011503017852000903132856007803141655001203219IND4421776720221118040938.0090612e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442177672DNAL7 a195059292pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erp1962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCraufurd, P.Q.10aClimate change and the flowering time of annual crops  ap. 2529-2539.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aCrop production is inherently sensitive to variability in climate. Temperature is a major determinant of the rate of plant development and, under climate change, warmer temperatures that shorten development stages of determinate crops will most probably reduce the yield of a given variety. Earlier crop flowering and maturity have been observed and documented in recent decades, and these are often associated with warmer (spring) temperatures. However, farm management practices have also changed and the attribution of observed changes in phenology to climate change per se is difficult. Increases in atmospheric [CO₂] often advance the time of flowering by a few days, but measurements in FACE (free air CO₂ enrichment) field-based experiments suggest that elevated [CO₂] has little or no effect on the rate of development other than small advances in development associated with a warmer canopy temperature. The rate of development (inverse of the duration from sowing to flowering) is largely determined by responses to temperature and photoperiod, and the effects of temperature and of photoperiod at optimum and suboptimum temperatures can be quantified and predicted. However, responses to temperature, and more particularly photoperiod, at supraoptimal temperature are not well understood. Analysis of a comprehensive data set of time to tassel initiation in maize (Zea mays) with a wide range of photoperiods above and below the optimum suggests that photoperiod modulates the negative effects of temperature above the optimum. A simulation analysis of the effects of prescribed increases in temperature (0-6 °C in +1 °C steps) and temperature variability (0% and +50%) on days to tassel initiation showed that tassel initiation occurs later, and variability was increased, as the temperature exceeds the optimum in models both with and without photoperiod sensitivity. However, the inclusion of photoperiod sensitivity above the optimum temperature resulted in a higher apparent optimum temperature and less variability in the time of tassel initiation. Given the importance of changes in plant development for crop yield under climate change, the effects of photoperiod and temperature on development rates above the optimum temperature clearly merit further research, and some of the knowledge gaps are identified herein. 3aZea mays 3acanopy 3aflowering 3afarm management 3amodels 3acorn 3aspring 3aclimate change 3acrop yield 3aair 3aphotoperiod 3atemperature 3aclimate 3acrops 2aClimate 2aCrops, Agriculturalxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aFlowersxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPhotoperiod 2aTemperature 0adevelopmental stages1 aWheeler, T.R.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2009 July, v. 60, no. 9 p.2529-2539dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erp1963Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02369naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245011600129300001600245500001500261520132500276650001401601650001601615650001001631650001401641650001401655650002301669653000901692653003001701653001601731653002701747653003001774653002001804700001401824773007901838852000901917930003301926945001301959946001101972655001201983IND2060828520221118041053.0971210e199511  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206082852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrabhanjan, H.10aStudies on rheological properties of tamarind kernel powder, its derivatives and their blends with maize starch  ap. 245-253.  a2019-12-05  aPasting and flow properties of cooked solutions of tamarind kernel powder (TKP), its carboxymethyl and hydroxypropyl derivatives, exhibited shear dependent and pseudoplastic flow behaviour characteristics. Chemical modification decreased the shear dependence of the solution viscosity as the degree of substitution increased. The solutions did not exhibit a yield stress at the concentrations studied. The effect of TKP and its carboxymethyl and hydroxypropyl derivatives, at different concentrations, on the rheological properties of maize starch dispersions was also studied. The seed gum associated with starch, and the effect was maximum at 10% concentration of the former in the blend. This was evident by the lowering of pasting temperature and the synergistic increase in pseudoplasticity and yield value of the blend pastes. The TKP derivatives also showed maximum association with starch at 10% concentration in the blend but, in comparison to TKP, the degree of association decreased. Thus, the pasting temperature of the blend increased while the pseudoplasticity and yield value decreased as a function of DS/MS. At higher levels of modification, the association was decreased. These results have been explained on the basis of molecular association of the seed gum and its derivatives with starch molecules. 3asolutions 3acorn starch 3aseeds 3aviscosity 3atamarinds 3apasting properties 0agums 0ahydroxypropyl derivatives 0aderivatives 0arheological properties 0acarboxymethyl derivatives 0aflow properties1 aAli, S.Z.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g1995 Nov., v. 28, no. 3 p.245-253x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02258naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005100126300001600177500001500193520126900208650001301477650001801490650001301508650001701521650001101538653001201549653002001561653002001581653002401601653002001625700001801645700001901663700001701682700001601699773007901715852000901794930003301803945001301836946001101849655001201860IND2200887120221118040954.0991001e199811  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220088712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLloyd, L.L.10aCarbohydrate polymers as wound management aids  ap. 315-322.  a2019-12-05  aWound management aids have, in recent years, seen a transition from being simple natural coverings which give a wound protection from the external environment during the formation of the scab to specialized high technology materials which are produced from both synthetic and natural polymers. Much of the development has resulted from a greater understanding of the processes involved in wound healing coupled with advances in technology to produce biocompatible materials with the necessary physical and chemical characteristics for enhancement of the healing process. Polysaccharides, being naturally occurring biomolecules, were an obvious choice for investigation as potential wound management aids. In recent years it was recognised that not only can polysaccharides be produced with the required physical characteristics for a wound management product but that the actual polysaccharide or polysaccharide derivative may itself actively participate in the process of wound healing. This paper sets out to review the various types of polysaccharides which were used as wound management aids, the physical forms in which they are used and also the biological properties of polysaccharides which enable them to participate actively in the wound healing process. 3achitosan 3ahydrocolloids 3apolymers 3aferulic acid 3achitin 0ahealing 0abranan ferulate 0awound dressings 0abioactive dressings 0apolysaccharides1 aKennedy, J.F.1 aMethacanon, P.1 aPaterson, M.1 aKnill, C.J.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g1998 Nov., v. 37, no. 3 p.315-322x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a19991031b19991104c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02584naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001600163245010700179300001400286500002400300520120700324650001701531650001601548650001001564650002401574650001301598650002201611650001901633650001401652650001201666650001401678650001701692650001501709650001501724650002701739653002101766653002701787700001401814700001801828773009701846852000901943856006901952930003302021945002502054946001102079655001202090IND4382961320221118041041.0060821e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438296132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2006.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ104 0aQ5041 aLagrain, B.10aImpact of redox agents on the physico-chemistry of wheat gluten proteins during hydrothermal treatment  ap. 49-53.  aIncludes references  aThe impact of the oxidants potassium bromate and potassium iodate and the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) on the rheological behaviour of 20% (w/v) gluten-in-water suspensions during thermal treatment was monitored with the rapid visco analyser (RVA). The suspensions were subjected to a linear temperature increase from 40 to 95 °C in 14 min, a holding step of 40 min at 95 °C, a cooling step (7 min) with a linear temperature decrease to 50 °C, and a final holding step at 50 °C (13 min). Potassium iodate (1.18 and 1.77 μmol/g protein) and potassium bromate (1.52 and 15.2 μmol/g protein) decreased RVA viscosities in the holding step and increased sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) protein extractabilities suggesting a greater heat resistance and decreased gliadin-glutenin cross-linking. In contrast, in the presence of DTT (1.65 and 3.30 μmol/g protein) RVA viscosity increased at lower temperatures and lowered SDS extractabilities. It is postulated that low concentrations of reducing agent facilitate gliadin-glutenin cross-linking during heating while oxidants hinder gluten polymerization due to decreased levels of free sulphydryl groups and less flexibility of the glutenin chains. 3awheat gluten 3asuspensions 3awater 3ahot water treatment 3aoxidants 3apotassium bromate 3adithiothreitol 3aviscosity 3agliadin 3aglutenins 3acrosslinking 3aextraction 3adetergents 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 0apotassium iodate 0aprotein extractability1 aBrijs, K.1 aDelcour, J.A.0 tJournal of cereal science.g2006 July, v. 44, no. 1 p.49-53dAcademic Pressx0733-52107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2006.03.0033electronic resource  a20061101b20061202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/10/31  aNon-US 7aarticle03055naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003600164245010700200300001600307500002400323520133900347650000801686650002801694650001401722650001801736650001701754650001101771650001201782650002101794650001501815650003801830650001201868650001401880650003401894650004901928650001101977650003301988650003302021650002802054650004002082650001702122700002102139700002202160700002202182700003202204700002102236700002402257700002502281700002002306773010602326852000902432856004802441655001202489IND4435699820221118040827.0100416e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443569982DNAL7 a203643512pmid7 a10.1007/s00438-010-0529-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinervini, Crescenzio Francesco10aEvidences for insulator activity of the 5′UTR of the Drosophila melanogaster LTR-retrotransposon ZAM  ap. 503-509.  aIncludes references  aInsulators or chromatin boundary are DNA elements that organize the genome into discrete regulatory domains by limiting the actions of enhancers and silencers through a “positional-blocking mechanism”. The role of these sequences, both in modulation of the enhancers range of action (enhancer-promoter selectivity) and in the organization of the chromatin in functional domains, is emerging strongly in these last years. There is a great interest in identifying new insulators because deeper knowledge of these elements can help understand how cis-regulatory elements coordinate the expression of the target genes. However, while insulators are critical in gene regulation and genome functioning, only a few have been reported so far. Here, we describe a new insulator sequence that is located in the 5′UTR of the Drosophila retrotransposon ZAM. We have used an “enhancer-blocking assay” to test its effects on the activity of the enhancer in transiently transfected Drosophila S2R⁺ cell line. Moreover, we show that the new insulator is able to affect significantly the enhancer-promoter interaction in the human cell line HEK293. These results suggest the possibility of employing the ZAM insulator in gene transfer protocols from insects to mammals in order to counteract the transgene positional and genotoxic effects. 3aDNA 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3achromatin 3agene transfer 3agenotoxicity 3ahumans 3ainsects 3aretrotransposons 3atransgenes 2a5' Untranslated Regionsxgenetics 2aAnimals 2aCell Line 2aDrosophila Proteinsxgenetics 2aDrosophila melanogasterxcytologyxgenetics. 2aHumans 2aInsulator Elementsxgenetics 2aRepressor Proteinsxgenetics 2aRetroelementsxgenetics 2aTerminal Repeat Sequencesxgenetics 2aTransfection1 aRuggieri, Simona1 aTraversa, Michele1 aD'Aiuto, Leonardo1 aMarsano, Rene' Massimiliano1 aLeronni, Daniela1 aCentomani, Isabella1 aDe Giovanni, Claudio1 aViggiano, Luigi0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2010 May, v. 283, no. 5 p.503-509dSpringer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-010-0529-4 7aarticle02720naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245011500169300001600284500002400300520162400324650001701948650001501965650000901980650001901989650001102008650003102019650001702050650001602067650001802083650002002101700002402121700002102145700002602166773009702192852000902289856004802298655001202346IND4423355820221118040926.0090718e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442335582DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-009-0039-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemanceau, Philippe10aIron dynamics in the rhizosphere as a case study for analyzing interactions between soils, plants and microbes  ap. 513-535.  aIncludes references  aIron is an essential element for plants and microbes. However, in most cultivated soils, the concentration of iron available for these living organisms is very low because its solubility is controlled by stable hydroxides, oxyhydroxides and oxides. In the rhizosphere, there is a high demand of iron because of the iron uptake by plants, and microorganisms which density and activity are promoted by the release of root exudates. Plants and microbes have evolved active strategies of iron uptake. Iron incorporation by these organisms lead to complex interactions ranging from competition to mutualism. These complex interactions are under the control of physico-chemical properties of the soils in which they occur, and reciprocally iron uptake strategies of plants and microbes impact these soil properties. These iron-mediated interactions between soils, plants and microbes impact the plant growth and health and their analysis, together with that of the resulting iron dynamics, is of a major agronomic interest. Analysis of the complex interactions soils, plants and microbes represent also a unique opportunity to progress in our knowledge of the rhizosphere ecology. This progression requires merging complementary expertises and study strategies in soil science, plant biology and microbiology. This review provides information on (i) iron status in soil and rhizosphere, iron uptake by plants and microbes, and on (ii) the corresponding study strategies. Finally, illustrations of how integration of these approaches allows gaining knowledge in the complex interactions occurring in the rhizosphere are given. 3acase studies 3ahydroxides 3airon 3amicroorganisms 3aoxides 3aphysicochemical properties 3aplant growth 3arhizosphere 3aroot exudates 3asoil properties1 aBauer-Kaase, Petra.1 aKraemer, Stephan1 aBriat, Jean-François0 tPlant and soil.g2009 Aug., v. 321, no. 1-2 p.513-535dSpringer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-009-0039-5 7aarticle02001naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245010400160300001400264500002400278520087100302650002001173650001401193650001301207650001601220650001601236650001201252650001601264650001701280650001301297650001101310650001301321650002101334650002201355700001701377700001701394700001601411773010701427852000901534856004801543655001201591IND4407088520221118040812.0080620e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440708852DNAL7 a10.1007/s00606-008-0011-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadice, S.10aAnatomical differences on development of fertile and sterile pollen grains of Prunus salicina Lindl  ap. 63-69.  aIncludes references  aAnatomical changes occurring during the microsporogenic development of P. salicina Lindl. were studied in male fertile and male sterile genotypes. Male fertile pollen grains showed three well determined pore regions, without ektexine. Intine was thick and surrounded the vegetative cell. Vegetative cells enclosed the generative cells; their cytoplasm was rich in plastids, abundant RER and active mitochondria. Development of sterile pollen was different from the meiosis step. Microspores did not show germination pores and ektexine was continuous around the whole grain. Pollen grains showed an atypical shape. The tapetum persisted after the tetrad stage and showed hypertrophy and vacuole development, resulting in abnormal microspore development. Only a few pollen grains and rudiments of collapsed microspores close to the anther wall were formed at anthesis. 3aPrunus salicina 3aflowering 3agenotype 3agermination 3ahypertrophy 3ameiosis 3amicrospores 3amitochondria 3aplastids 3apollen 3avacuoles 3avegetative cells 3awhole grain foods1 aOntivero, M.1 aGiordani, E.1 aBellini, E.0 tPlant systematics and evolution.g2008 June, v. 273, no. 1-2 p.63-69dSpringer Viennax0378-26977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00606-008-0011-5 7aarticle03531naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245008900182300001600271500002400287520196300311650001602274650001502290650001402305650002302319650001902342650001202361650001402373650003002387650002202417650002002439650002602459650001502485650002502500650000902525650002202534650001202556650003902568650004802607650002602655650004002681650003202721650001902753650004502772650002302817700002202840773008202862852000902944856004802953655001203001IND4410203220221118040600.0080912e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441020322DNAL7 a186420242pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-008-0785-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Weiqing10aAtCSLD2 is an integral Golgi membrane protein with its N-terminus facing the cytosol  ap. 823-838.  aIncludes references  aCellulose synthase-like proteins in the D family share high levels of sequence identity with the cellulose synthase proteins and also contain the processive β-glycosyltransferase motifs conserved among all members of the cellulose synthase superfamily. Consequently, it has been hypothesized that members of the D family function as either cellulose synthases or glycan synthases involved in the formation of matrix polysaccharides. As a prelude to understanding the function of proteins in the D family, we sought to determine where they are located in the cell. A polyclonal antibody against a peptide located at the N-terminus of the Arabidopsis D2 cellulose synthase-like protein was generated and purified. After resolving Golgi vesicles from plasma membranes using endomembrane purification techniques including two-phase partitioning and sucrose density gradient centrifugation, we used antibodies against known proteins and marker enzyme assays to characterize the various membrane preparations. The Arabidopsis cellulose synthase-like D2 protein was found mostly in a fraction that was enriched with Golgi membranes. In addition, versions of the Arabidopsis cellulose synthase-like D2 proteins tagged with a green fluorescent protein was observed to co-localize with a DsRed-tagged Golgi marker protein, the rat alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase. Therefore, we postulate that the majority of Arabidopsis cellulose synthase-like D proteins, under our experimental conditions, are likely located at the Golgi membranes. Furthermore, protease digestion of Golgi-rich vesicles revealed almost complete loss of reaction with the antibodies, even without detergent treatment of the Golgi vesicles. Therefore, the N-terminus of the Arabidopsis cellulose synthase-like D2 protein likely faces the cytosol. Combining this observation with the transmembrane domain predictions, we postulate that the large hydrophilic domain of this protein also faces the cytosol. 3aArabidopsis 3aD2 protein 3acellulose 3acellulose synthase 3acentrifugation 3acytosol 3adigestion 3agreen fluorescent protein 3amembrane proteins 3aplasma membrane 3apolyclonal antibodies 3aprediction 3apurification methods 3arats 3asequence analysis 3asucrose 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCytoplasmxmetabolism 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aGolgi Apparatusxmetabolism 2aImmunoblotting 2aMembrane Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aModels, Biological1 aKeegstra, Kenneth0 tPlanta.g2008 Oct., v. 228, no. 5 p.823-838dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-008-0785-2 7aarticle03225naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100001500181245012300196300001600319500002400335500001500359520144400374650001601818650001801834650001801852650002001870650002101890650002501911650001101936650003201947650001801979650001501997650001302012650002602025650001702051650002302068650002002091650001802111650003502129650001302164653001602177653002102193653001602214653001002230653001502240700001502255700002002270700001502290700001302305773012202318852000902440856006902449930003302518945002502551946001102576655001202587IND4382897620221118040755.0060818e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438289762DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-005-9065-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aK001 0aF110 0aK1001 aMoller, R.10aEffect of Light and Activated Charcoal on Tracheary Element Differentiation in Callus Cultures of Pinus Radiata D. Don  ap. 161-171.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aLight has been found to increase the proportion of tracheary elements differentiating in callus cultures derived from xylem-parenchyma of Pinus radiata D. Don grown on an induction medium containing activated charcoal but no phytohormones. The differentiation rate increased from 20% when callus was grown in darkness to 45% when callus was grown with a 16 h or 24 h photoperiod. When callus was grown with a 16 h photoperiod, tracheary elements were observed 2 days after transfer of callus to the induction medium, as compared to 5 days when callus was cultured in darkness. The differentiation rate was also influenced by the concentration of activated charcoal added to the induction medium, the optimum concentration being 5 g l-1. Exclusion of activated charcoal from the induction medium decreased the differentiation rate to 2%. The activities of the lignin-related enzymes L-phenylalanine ammonia lyase and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase were significantly higher in cell cultures grown with a 16 h photoperiod as compared to when grown in darkness. The results show that light had a stimulating effect on tracheary element differentiation and the activities of lignin-related enzymes in P. radiata callus cultures. The new growth conditions markedly improve this cell culture system and make it particularly useful for functional gene testing and cell-wall analysis of in vitro grown tracheary elements of coniferous gymnosperms. 3acell growth 3aPinus radiata 3alignification 3alight intensity 3amicropropagation 3acell differentiation 3acallus 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3adose response 3acell walls 3aexplants 3ain vitro regeneration 3aforest trees 3atracheary elements 3aenzyme activity 3aculture media 3acinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase 3acharcoal 0amethodology 0ain vitro culture 0axylogenesis 0axylem 0aparenchyma1 aBall, R.D.1 aHenderson, A.R.1 aModzel, G.1 aFind, J.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2006 May, v. 85, no. 2 p.161-171dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-005-9065-z3electronic resource  a20060824b20060906c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/08/24  aNon-US 7aarticle03123naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174072000900183100001700192245014600209300001600355500002400371500001500395520096900410650001601379650002201395650002001417650001701437650001101454650002101465650002501486650001601511650002101527650001001548650002401558650001201582650003301594650003801627650001901665650005201684650002801736650002701764650004801791650006801839653002801907653002501935653003401960653001901994700001402013700001402027700001702041700001702058700001802075700001402093700001302107700001302120700001502133773011702148852000902265856007002274930003302344945002502377946001102402655001202413IND4382888420221118040703.0060818e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438288842DNAL7 a168767052pmid7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2006.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL003 0aL2001 aMauchamp, B.10aPolycalin (chlorophyllid A binding protein): A novel, very large fluorescent lipocalin from the midgut of the domestic silkworm Bombyx mori L  ap. 623-633.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe studied a protein from the midgut of the silkworm Bombyx mori characterized by its ability to bind the prosthetic group of chlorophyll, that confers fluorescent properties to this protein. Several techniques, 2D electrophoresis purification, MS-MS and Maldi-TOF peptide sequencing, RT-PCR and nucleotide sequencing were used to obtain the nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence. The coding sequence was compared to the gene sequence to define the number and size of introns and exons.The gene spanned 45.5 kb of DNA and consisted of 46 exons. The cDNA encoded a protein of 2721 amino acids.The protein was identified as a lipocalin with novel features. Most lipocalins are proteins with high affinity to small lipophilic molecules, with a molecular size in the 25kDa range and a well conserved tertiary structure. The apoprotein described here revealed 15 lipocalin like structures, in line. We called this protein a polycalin (pentadecacalin). 3aapoproteins 3acomplementary DNA 3achlorophyllides 3afluorescence 3amidgut 3abinding proteins 3aamino acid sequences 3aBombyx mori 3amolecular weight 3aexons 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBombyxxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGastrointestinal Tractxchemistry 2aGenome, Insect 2aInsect Proteinsxanalysisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0achlorophyllid binding protein 0apentadecacalin1 aRoyer, C.1 aGarel, A.1 aJalabert, A.1 aDa Rocha, M.1 aGrenier, A.M.1 aLabas, V.1 aVinh, J.1 aMita, K.1 aKadono, K.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2006 Aug., v. 36, no. 8 p.623-633dElsevier Sciencex0965-17487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2006.05.0063electronic resource  a20060906b20061003c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/09/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03889naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100001700181245006000198300001800258500002400276500001500300520228200315650001502597650001102612650001202623650002002635650001602655650001702671650001402688650001302702650002002715650000902735650001802744650001402762650002502776650001702801650001702818650002402835650000902859650002202868650001402890651001102904653001602915700002102931773008902952852000903041856008503050856009303135930003303228945002503261946001303286655001203299IND4382875620221118040827.0060817s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438287562DNAL7 a10.1080/019041606007675912doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF120 0aJ500 0aF5001 aGordon, W.B.10aCorn hybrid response to starter fertilizer combinations  ap. 1287-1299.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResearch has shown that some corn (Zea mays L.) hybrids grown under reduced tillage conditions respond to starter fertilizer containing nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), while others do not. This research studied variability of responsiveness among corn hybrids to starter fertilizer containing a more complete complement of nutrients. The experiment was conducted from 1996 to 1998 on a producer's field near Scandia, KS, on a Carr sandy-loam soil (coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive calcareous, mesic Typic Udifluvents). The response of four corn hybrids (Pioneer 3563, Pioneer 3346, DeKalb 591, and DeKalb 646) to starter fertilizer combinations containing N, P, potassium (K), sulfur (S), and zinc (Zn) was evaluated. In all three years of the experiment, starter fertilizer containing N and P consistently increased grain yield, reduced the number of thermal units needed from emergence to maturity, decreased grain-moisture content at harvest, and increased total P uptake (grain plus stover at maturity) of Pioneer 3346 and DeKalb 591, but had no effect on Pioneer 3563 and DeKalb 646. Addition of S to the starter mix produced additional yield increases for Pioneer 3346 and DeKalb 591, whereas addition of K and Zn to the starter did not show any additional yield benefit for these two hybrids. Grain yield of Pioneer 3563 and DeKalb 646 was not improved by starter fertilizer, regardless of the elemental composition. When no starter fertilizer was applied, early-season root development was greater in Pioneer 3563 and DeKalb 646 than in the other two hybrids. However, the addition of starter fertilizer increased numbers of roots and depth of rooting in Pioneer 3346 and DeKalb 591 but had no effect on Pioneer 3563 and DeKalb 636. Results showed starter fertilizer benefited grain yield for two hybrids. Grain yield of the other two hybrids, however, was not influenced by starter, regardless of which nutrients were supplied. This response may be attributed to differences in root-growth characteristics of the hybrids. The two responsive hybrids did, however, yield an average of 0.75 mg ha(-1) greater than the two non-responsive hybrids. This result indicates it is unlikely that all of the yield loss from not using a starter can be avoided by hybrid selection. 3aphosphorus 3asulfur 3ahybrids 3anutrient uptake 3agrain yield 3aharvest date 3acultivars 3aZea mays 3areduced tillage 3acorn 3awater content 3apotassium 3anitrogen fertilizers 3acrop quality 3aroot systems 3astarter fertilizers 3azinc 3agenetic variation 3aheat sums 3aKansas 0afertilizers1 aPierzynski, G.M.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2006, v. 29, no. 7 p.1287-1299dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041606007675913Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080310b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/09/14  aOther US 7aarticle02666naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182072000900191100002200200245011700222300001400339500002400353500001500377520126400392650001901656650002201675650002101697650001101718650001001729650001301739650002401752650001901776650001001795650001301805653001501818653001701833700001701850700001501867700001901882773011201901852000902013856006902022930003302091945002502124946001102149655001202160IND4382893320221118040809.0060818e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438289332DNAL7 a180890612pmid7 a10.1016/j.asd.2006.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL400 0aL001 0aL6001 aKristoffersen, L.10aSparse sensillar array on Trioza apicalis (Homoptera, Triozidae) antennae--an adaptation to high stimulus levels  ap. 85-92.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo investigate the morphological basis for olfactory reception in the carrot psyllid (Trioza apicalis) we used scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Our study reveals a very sparse sensillar setup. We identify and describe several different types of single-walled sensilla likely to have an olfactory function, as well as mechanosensory hairs and intracuticular sensilla. A T. apicalis antenna is about 0.6 mm long and has 10 segments. Apically on the flagellum there are two conspicuous multi-porous single-walled bristles. There are six cuticular cavities on the flagellum; two smaller on the apical flagellomere, and four larger located on the lateral side of the antenna on flagellomeres 2, 4, 6 and 7. Each cavity contains two sensilla and there are three varieties of cavity sensilla. Mechano- and chemosensory hairs appear in low numbers on all segments but the third. Carrot psyllids most likely use olfactory cues to locate their rather strongly smelling host plants, and we argue that the low number of olfactory sensilla found in this insect may accommodate high concentrations of odour stimuli. There is no sexual dimorphism in the sensillar setup. In concordance with this, no sex pheromones have been described in the Psylloidea so far. 3achemoreceptors 3ainsect morphology 3amechanoreceptors 3aTrioza 3asmell 3asensilla 3aolfactory receptors 3aultrastructure 3aodors 3aantennae 0aadaptation 0aodor stimuli1 aHallberg, E.1 aWallen, R.1 aAnderbrant, O.0 tArthropod structure & development.g2006 June, v. 35, no. 2 p.85-92dElsevier Science Ltd.x1467-80397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.asd.2006.04.0013electronic resource  a20060830b20060906c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/08/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02359naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001800172245009300190300001800283500002400301500001500325520094100340650002001281650001001301650001101311650001501322650002901337650001201366650002101378650002301399650002301422650001201445650001501457650002601472651001101498653002101509773008901530852000901619856008501628856009301713930003301806945002501839946001301864655001201877IND4382875020221118040837.0060817s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438287502DNAL7 a10.1080/019041606007674352doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aF120 0aJ2001 aFageria, N.K.10aLiming and copper fertilization in dry bean production on an Oxisol in no-tillage system  ap. 1219-1228.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA field study was conducted with the objective of determining response of dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) to liming and copper (Cu) fertilization applied to an Oxisol.

Leaf samples were taken four times during the summer of 1997 and analyzed for total diffusible ions, which included sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), and magnesium (Mg), and for soluble ions, which included zinc (Zn) and manganese (Mn). Quality and quantity of yield were also measured. The lowest relative turgidity, 0.8, was measured at ECi (electrical conductivity of irrigation water) 4.8 dS/m, which decreased with time to 0.75 for all treatments. The Na/K ratio indicated relative sodium accumulation. It increased fast with time from about 0.1 to 1.4 under high salinity and more slowly, from 0.1 to 0.5, under the low-salinity treatment. Average yield of fresh berries under all treatments (except one) ranged between 8.0 and 8.5 kg/vine under the respective saline and fresh-water irrigation. This difference was not significant, but in view of the first-year experiment this result should be regarded as provisional. The juice quality criteria, as determined by the production of total soluble solids (TSS) pH2, improved from 321 to 288, indicating low acidity under the saline treatment and higher acidity under the non-saline treatment. The ratio of TSS/acidity, which changed slightly from 34 to 32, also indicated a moderate reduction in acidity under saline conditions, especially under the 'Ruggeri' rootstock. Thus, it was concluded that (a) by the use of saline water the quality of the berries may be improved, (b) 'Ruggeri' rootstock was less affected than 'Salt Creek' by salinity in both quantity and quality of yield, and (c) relative sodium (Na) content in the lamina and the petiole increased with time during the growth period while relative turgidity declined, indicating a possible accumulation of toxic ions over time. 3amanganese 3aacidity 3atotal soluble solids 3aion transport 3ajuice quality 3acrop yield 3aturgor 3afruit quality 3asodium 3asaline water 3aVitis vinifera 3acalcium 3awine grapes 3arootstocks 3apotassium 3airrigation water 3asalinity 3azinc 3aphytotoxicity 3amagnesium 3apH 3afruit crops 3aIsrael 0asoluble solids1 aBen-Asher, J.1 aMalach, Y. de1 aSagih, M.1 aBravdo, B.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2006, v. 29, no. 5 p.783-795dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041606006491533Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080605b20080704c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/09/13  aOther US 7aarticle03123naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181072000900190100001400199245010000213300001600313500002400329520113500353650002201488650001701510650001601527650002701543650002001570650002101590650001901611650001901630650002501649650002101674650001101695650001001706650001601716650001201732650001101744650001301755650001901768650001701787650001701804650002001821650001601841653002201857653002001879700001701899700001901916700001701935700001701952700001901969700001401988700001602002700002002018700001802038773008702056852000902143856008502152856009302237930003302330945002502363946001302388655001202401IND4382873620221118040732.0060817s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438287362DNAL7 a10.1080/019041606006491872doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF120 0aF600 0aJ500 0aF500 0aJ100 0aX1001 aGirma, K.10aMid-season prediction of wheat-grain yield potential using plant, soil, and sensor measurements  ap. 873-897.  aIncludes references  aThe components that define cereal-grain yield potential have not been well defined. The objective of this study was to collect many differing biological measurements from a long-term winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) study in an attempt to better define yield potential. Four treatments were sampled that annually received 0, 45, 90, and 135 kg N ha-1 at fixed rates of phosphorus (P) (30 kg ha-1) and potassium (K) (37 kg ha-1). Mid-season measurements of leaf color, chlorophyll, normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI), plant height, canopy temperature, tiller density, plant density, soil moisture, soil NH4-N, NO3-N, organic carbon (C), total nitrogen (N), pH, and N mineralization potential were collected. In addition, soil texture and bulk density were determined to characterize each plot. Correlations and multiple linear-regression analyses were used to determine those variables that can predict final winter wheat grain yield. Both the correlation and regression analyses suggested mid-season NDVI, chlorophyll content, plant height, and total N uptake to be good predictors of final winter wheat grain yield. 3aTriticum aestivum 3awinter wheat 3agrain yield 3aagricultural forecasts 3aplant nutrition 3anutrient content 3asoil fertility 3asoil nutrients 3anitrogen fertilizers 3afertilizer rates 3aleaves 3acolor 3achlorophyll 3atillers 3acanopy 3anitrogen 3amineralization 3asoil texture 3abulk density 3anutrient uptake 3acrop models 0ayield forecasting 0ayield potential1 aMartin, K.L.1 aAnderson, R.H.1 aArnall, D.B.1 aBrixey, K.D.1 aCasillas, M.A.1 aChung, B.1 aDobey, B.C.1 aKamenidou, S.K.1 aKariuki, S.K.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2006, v. 29, no. 5 p.873-897dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041606006491873Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080605b20080704c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/09/13  aOther US 7aarticle03755naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004100133040001800174100002600192245013900218300001800357500002400375506007600399520165000475506003702125650002302162650003102185650001202216650001502228650002502243650002902268650001302297650002002310650000902330650001202339650001902351650001402370650001102384650001602395650002402411650001302435650001202448650003302460650003302493650005802526650008102584650001302665650001102678650002802689650000902717650002402726650001602750650003602766700002302802700002302825700002102848700001902869773011702888852000903005856009103014655001203105IND4370570020221207124456.0050529s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437057002DNAL7 a159083682pmid7 aPMC11118772pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.73.6.3408-3414.20052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAulinger, Benedikt A.10aCombining Anthrax Vaccine and Therapy: a Dominant-Negative Inhibitor of Anthrax Toxin Is Also a Potent and Safe Immunogen for Vaccines  ap. 3408-3414.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAnthrax is caused by the unimpeded growth of Bacillus anthracis in the host and the secretion of toxins. The currently available vaccine is based on protective antigen (PA), a central component of anthrax toxin. Vaccination with PA raises no direct immune response against the bacilli and, being a natural toxin component, PA might be hazardous when used immediately following exposure to B. anthracis. Thus, we have sought to develop a vaccine or therapeutic agent that is safe and eliminates both secreted toxins and bacilli. To that end, we have previously developed a dually active vaccine by conjugating the capsular poly-[gamma]-D-glutamate (PGA) with PA to elicit the production of antibodies specific for both bacilli and toxins. In the present report, we describe the improved potency of anthrax vaccines through the use of a dominant-negative inhibitory (DNI) mutant to replace PA in PA or PA-PGA vaccines. When tested in mice, DNI alone is more immunogenic than PA, and DNI-PGA conjugate elicits significantly higher levels of antibodies against PA and PGA than PA-PGA conjugate. To explain the enhanced immunogenicity of DNI, we propose that the two point mutations in DNI may have improved epitopes of PA allowing better antigen presentation to helper T cells. Alternatively, these mutations may enhance the immunological processing of PA by altering endosomal trafficking of the toxin in antigen-presenting cells. Because DNI has previously been demonstrated to inhibit anthrax toxin, postexposure use of DNI-based vaccines, including conjugate vaccines, may provide improved immunogenicity and therapeutic activity simultaneously.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus anthracis 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aanthrax 3aantibodies 3aantigen presentation 3aantigen-presenting cells 3aepitopes 3aimmune response 3amice 3amutants 3apoint mutation 3asecretion 3atoxins 3avaccination 3avaccine development 3avaccines 2aAnimals 2aAnthrax Vaccinesximmunology 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxblood 2aAntigens, Bacterialxchemistryximmunologyxtoxicity. 2aBacterial Toxinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxchemistryximmunologyxtoxicity. 2aEpitopes 2aFemale 2aImmunoglobulin Gxblood 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aVaccination 2aVaccines, Conjugateximmunology1 aRoehrl, Michael H.1 aMekalanos, John J.1 aCollier, R.

CT consists of a pentameric, receptor-binding B subunit (CTB) and a monomeric A subunit (CTA) that has latent enzymatic activity. In addition to its enterotoxicity, CT has potent mucosal adjuvant activity and can also function as a carrier molecule with many potential applications in cell biology. In earlier studies, the toxic CTA₁ domain was replaced by several other antigenic protein domains to produce holotoxin-like chimeras for use as potential mucosal vaccines. In the present study we utilized the twin arginine translocation (tat) system to produce fluorescent CT chimeras, as well as fluorescent chimeras of Escherichia coli heat-labile toxins LTI and LTIIb. Fusion proteins containing either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) and the A₂ domain of CT, LTI, or LTIIb were transported to the periplasm of E. coli by the tat system, and the corresponding B polypeptides of CT, LTI, and LTIIb were transported to the periplasm by the sec system. The fluorescent fusion proteins were shown to assemble spontaneously and efficiently with the corresponding B polypeptides in the periplasm to form chimeric holotoxin-like molecules, and these chimeras bound to and entered cultured cells in a manner similar to native CT, LTI, or LTIIb. The GFP and mRFP derivatives of CT, LT, and LTIIb developed here are useful tools for studies on the cell biology of trafficking of the CT/LT family of bacterial enterotoxins. In addition, these constructs provide proof in principle for the development of novel chimeric CT-like or LT-like vaccine candidates containing CTA₂ fusion proteins that cannot be delivered to the periplasm of E. coli by use of the sec secretion pathway.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aVibrio cholerae 3achimerism 3acholera toxin 3acultured cells 3adiarrhea 3aenterotoxins 3aenzyme activity 3agreen fluorescent protein 3apolypeptides 3asecretion 3atoxicity 3avaccines 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Toxinsxmetabolism 2aBiological Transport 2aChlorocebus aethiops. 2aCholera Toxinxmetabolism 2aEnterotoxinsxmetabolism 2aEscherichia coli Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFluorescence 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMembrane Transport Proteinsxgenetics 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxmetabolism 2aVero Cells1 aErbe, Jarrod L.1 aHolmes, Randall K.0 tInfection and immunity.g2005 June, v. 73, no. 6 p.3627-3635dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.73.6.3627-3635.20053Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03093naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004100133040001800174100001500192245010500207300001800312500002400330506007600354520151500430506003701945650001801982650001602000650002602016650002502042650001802067650001802085650001302103650002002116650001502136650001302151650001402164650001402178650001702192650003302209650005902242650003302301650003502334700002502369773011702394852000902511856009102520655001202611IND4370571820221207101411.0050529s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437057182DNAL7 a159083862pmid7 aPMC11118642pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.73.6.3568-3576.20052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Bing10aInducible Antisense RNA Expression in the Characterization of Gene Functions in Streptococcus mutans  ap. 3568-3576.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn order to examine gene function in Streptococcus mutans, we have recently initiated an antisense RNA strategy. Toward this end, we have now constructed and evaluated three Escherichia coli-S. mutans shuttle expression vectors with the fruA and scrB promoters from S. mutans, as well as the tetR-controlled tetO promoter from Staphylococcus aureus. Among these, the tetO/tetR system proved to be the most tightly controlled promoter. By using this shuttle plasmid system, modulation of gene function by inducible antisense RNA expression was demonstrated for comC antisense fragments of different sizes as well as for distinct gtfB antisense fragments. It was demonstrated that the size, but not the relative position, of an antisense DNA fragment is important in mediating the antisense phenomenon. Furthermore, by constructing and screening random DNA libraries with the tet expression shuttle system, 78 growth-retarded transformants harboring antisense DNA fragments were also identified. Almost all of them corresponded to homologous essential genes in other bacteria. In addition, a novel essential gene, the coaE gene, encoding dephospho-coenzyme A kinase, which is involved in the final step of coenzyme A catabolism in S. mutans, was identified and characterized. These results suggest that the antisense RNA strategy can be useful for identifying novel essential genes in S. mutans bacteria as well as further characterizing the physiology (including potential virulence factors) of these organisms.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA libraries 3aEscherichia 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStreptococcus mutans 3aantisense DNA 3aantisense RNA 3abacteria 3aessential genes 3ametabolism 3aplasmids 3ascreening 3avirulence 2aGene Library 2aGenes, Essentialxphysiology 2aPhosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)xgenetics 2aRNA, Antisensexbiosynthesis 2aStreptococcus mutansxgenetics1 aKuramitsu, Howard K.0 tInfection and immunity.g2005 June, v. 73, no. 6 p.3568-3576dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.73.6.3568-3576.20053Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03383naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004100133040001800174100002000192245010400212300001800316500002400334506007600358520147700434506003701911650002501948650003101973650001302004650002002017650001002037650001102047650001102058650002202069650000902091650001102100650001202111650001302123650002502136650001402161650001402175650001702189650001402206650001402220650001302234650001202247650003502259650003102294650003402325650000902359650002302368650002102391650007102412650001402483700002102497700002202518773011702540852000902657856009102666655001202757IND4370571020221207101405.0050529s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437057102DNAL7 a159083782pmid7 aPMC11118212pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.73.6.3492-3501.20052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDomenech, Pilar10aContribution of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis MmpL Protein Family to Virulence and Drug Resistance  ap. 3492-3501.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe genome sequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis revealed the presence of 12 membrane proteins proposed to have a function in the transport of lipids. Insertional inactivation of 11 of these has revealed that only 1 (MmpL3) is apparently essential for viability. Five of these proteins are conserved within the genome of Mycobacterium leprae. The drug susceptibilities of these 11 mutants to a broad spectrum of agents are unaltered, suggesting that unlike their function in other organisms, these proteins do not play a significant role in intrinsic drug resistance. Each of these mutants was assessed for growth kinetics and lethality in a murine low-dose aerosol model of tuberculosis, and four were found to be impaired in one or both measures of virulence. Two of these, with mutations of MmpL4 and the previously characterized MmpL7, which transports phthiocerol dimycocerosate, were found to have both impaired growth kinetics and impaired lethality. Mutants with inactivation of MmpL8, which transports a precursor of the sulfatides, or MmpL11, which transports an unknown substrate, were found to establish infection normally but to be significantly attenuated for lethality in time-to-death studies. These studies support the concept that MmpL-mediated lipid secretion both contributes to the innate ability of the pathogen to survive intracellularly and also contributes directly to the host-pathogen dialogue that determines the ultimate outcome of infection.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycobacterium leprae 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aaerosols 3adrug resistance 3adrugs 3agenome 3alipids 3amembrane proteins 3amice 3amodels 3amutants 3amutation 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3asecretion 3atuberculosis 3aviability 3avirulence 2aAerosols 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxphysiology 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterial 2aMembrane Proteinsxphysiology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Inbred DBA 2aMycobacterium tuberculosisxdrug effectsxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aVirulence1 aReed, Michael B.1 aBarry, Clifton E.0 tInfection and immunity.g2005 June, v. 73, no. 6 p.3492-3501dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.73.6.3492-3501.20053Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02662naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001800163245012800181300001400309500002400323500001500347520115200362650002601514650000901540650001601549650002101565650002201586650002201608650001701630650002701647650003501674653003801709653001001747653002401757700001701781700001801798700001601816700001401832700001801846700001801864700001801882773009701900852000901997856006902006930003302075945002502108946001102133655001202144IND4382961820221118041030.0060821e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438296182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2006.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aQ5041 aBeaugrand, J.10aAntibodies against wheat xylanase inhibitors as tools for the selective identification of their homologues in other cereals  ap. 59-67.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPolyclonal antibodies (PAbs) were raised against wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) TAXI- and XIP-type xylanase inhibitors by rabbit immunization. A small contaminant in both antigens, not detected by SDS-PAGE and later identified through Western blot as a recently discovered third type of xylanase inhibitor from wheat, i.e. thaumatin-like xylanase inhibitor (TL-XI), led to the coproduction of PAbs against this protein in the rabbits. To obtain inhibitor-specific PAbs, the PAbs against TAXI, XIP and TL-XI were separated by affinity chromatography using immobilised recombinant and native xylanase inhibitors. The purified PAbs allowed the immunoquantification of each type of wheat xylanase inhibitor using Western blot and densitometric analysis against purified inhibitor standards. The method allowed the detection of the purified inhibitors at the 20 ng level. As the PAbs against the wheat xylanase inhibitors cross-reacted with their homologous targets from other cereals, immunoprobing allowed identification of XIP homologues in oats (Avena sativa L.) and TL-XI homologues in durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) and rye (Secale cereale L.). 3apolyclonal antibodies 3aoats 3adurum wheat 3aWestern blotting 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aTriticum aestivum 3aAvena sativa 3aendo-1,4-beta-xylanase 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 0athaumatin-like xylanase inhibitor 0awheat 0axylanase inhibitors1 aGebruers, K.1 aVerverken, C.1 aFierens, E.1 aCroes, E.1 aGoddeeris, B.1 aCourtin, C.M.1 aDelcour, J.A.0 tJournal of cereal science.g2006 July, v. 44, no. 1 p.59-67dAcademic Pressx0733-52107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2006.02.0033electronic resource  a20061031b20061102c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/10/31  aNon-US 7aarticle01560naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245015000123300001800273520069800291650001500989650002201004650001701026650001201043650001501055650001401070650001601084700002301100773008201123852000901205939003301214946001101247655001201258IND9302018020221118040625.0930416e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930201802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmin, G.10aBy-products formed during direct conversion of sugar beets to ethanol by Zymomonas mobilis in conventional sumerged and solid-state fermentations  ap. 1187-1192.  aThe nature and amounts of by-products formed during conversion of sugar beets to ethanol by Z. mobilis in Conventional Submerged Fermentation (CSF) and Solid-state Fermentation (SSF) were investigated.

The influence of fermentation temperature on synthesis of by-products in SSF was also studied. High fermentation temperature favoured sorbitol synthesis and low fermentation temperature the synthesis of levan. The best results were obtained at 35 degrees C.

Mushrooms were treated in two ways: (1) Sliced mushrooms were blanched and osmotically processed in 5, 10 and 15% salt solutions for 5, 10, 20 and 30 min at room temperature (called type 1 mushrooms); (2) Sliced and blanched mushrooms were osmotically dehydrated in 60% sucrose solution for 10 min at 50C and then transferred to the same processing conditions as mentioned in (1) (called type 2 mushrooms). The moisture content, sodium chloride and sucrose concentrations for both types of mushrooms were monitored with time. A mathematical model was used to describe the mass transfer kinetics for the two types of mushrooms. Contour plots of the mass changes in water and solutes were obtained and compared. The rates of mass changes were also determined. It was found that processing in a 15% salt solution results in the greatest ratio of rate moisture change to rate salt change for both type 1 and type 2 mushrooms. It is also the optimum condition for moisture removal and salt loading. The process method for type 2 mushroom was found the best in controlling sodium chloride penetration. 3amushrooms 3afood processing 3aosmosis 3amass transfer 3akinetics 0adehydration1 aLe Maguer, M.0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g1992, v. 16, no. 3 p.215-231x0145-88927nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02020naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245011800148300001400266500001500280520085300295650001501148650002001163650001201183650002101195650002801216650002601244650002601270650002101296650003701317650001501354650003501369650003301404653002201437653001401459773009401473852000901567939003301576946001301609655001201622IND9302020020221118040718.0930406e199110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930202002DNAL7 a17968122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeshpande, M.V.10aFactors affecting stability of Sclerotium rolfsii UV-8 mutant cellulase complex under saccharification conditions  ap. 75-82.  a2019-12-04  aEnzyme stability studies in case of Sclerotium rolfsii UV-8 mutant have been investigated under the conditions used for saccharification of cellulose (50 degrees C, pH 4.5, 48 h). Avicelase (measure of exoenzymes) and xylanase were found to be less stable than CMCase (endoglucanase) and beta-glucosidase. Merthiolate (and other Hg compounds) added as a biocide, inactivated avicelase and xylanase about 60-70%. Of the antibiotics tested, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and streptomycin sulfate were found suitable as an additive in cellulose hydrolysis system. The optimum hydrolysis of alkali-treated (AT)-rice straw, AT-bagasse, Solka Floc SW40, and Avicel P.H.101 was observed under shaking conditions at pH 4.5, 50 degrees C in CO2 atmosphere.

Plants have been both donors and recipients of horizontally mobilized genes and their genetic barter partners include prokaryotes and eukaryotes from all kingdoms. By expanding the gene pool beyond species boundaries, HGT events can drive genomic and phenotypic changes that increase fitness substantially. Accumulating evidence suggests that HGT is particularly prevalent between organisms that are either intimately associated or establish at least occasionally cell-cell contacts (e.g. in mutualistic or parasitic relationships). Here, I summarize current knowledge about HGT in plants, discuss possible molecular mechanisms and adaptive values of HGT events and highlight recent progress made in reconstructing HGT processes in laboratory experiments. 3agene transfer 3aplant genetics 3aplant adaptation 3agenetic recombination 2aAnimals 2aDNAxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGene Transfer, Horizontal 2aGenetic Engineering 2aPlantsxgenetics 0aliterature reviews 0ahorizontal gene transfer 0amolecular genetics0 tTrends in plant science.g2010 Jan., v. 15, no. 1 p.11-22dElsevier Science Ltd.x1360-13857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2009.10.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20110513b20110603c00000000  aINDdRSCe2010/03/08  aNon-US 7aarticle03246naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119100002500128245022200153300001600375500002400391520209300415650001802508650001002526650001902536650002102555650002102576650001402597700002102611773009702632852000902729856008902738930003302827945002502860946001102885655001202896IND4431524520221118040815.0100119e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443152452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ201 0aQ2021 aEl-Ziney, Mohamed G.10aEffectiveness of reuterin alone and in combination with nisin or other food contact surfaces sanitizers and cleaners for disinfection of stainless steel surfaces contaminated with Escherichia coli and Listeria innocua  ap. 145-149.  aIncludes references  aThe efficacy of reuterin as disinfectant individually or in combination with nine disinfectants and cleaning agents or bacteriocin nisin was evaluated against planktonic cells and biofilms (stainless steel) of E. coli k12 and L. innocua. Maximum effect of each compound or their formulation with reuterin was determined at room temperature after 30 s and 5 min. In planktonic cells, after 30 s of the exposure to reuterin (200 Au/ml), the levels of viable cells of E. coli and L. innocua decreased by 1.2 and 0.65 log10 cfu/ml, respectively. The inhibitory effect of reuterin against both organisms was enhanced significantly by adding sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl, 0.15%) followed by phosphoric acid (H3PO4,1%) and nisin (60 IU/ml) whereas, combination with sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS, 0.06%) only pronounced the effect against L. innocua. This might be indicated by the presence of synergistic effect between reuterin and these substances. At the end of exposure time (5 min), reuterin led to a total destruction effect of E. coli while L. innocua was reduced by 5.2 log10 cfu/ml. Interaction between reuterin and dimethyl ethyl benzyl ammonium chloride (BAC, 0.06%) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 1%) or peracetic acid (PAA, 0.03%) decreased their immediate effect (30 s), however, in except of PAA treatment, at the end of exposure time, total population destruction of both organisms was obtained. The addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, 0.06%) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 1%) or tri-sodium sulfate (TSF, 9.5%) to reuterin did not improve its inhibitory effect. In surface test, a similar disinfecting effect of reuterin against both organisms contaminated soiled stainless steel surfaces was obtained. A combination of reuterin and nisin or NaOCl had a disinfecting effect against biofilms compared to planktonic cell test. It is concluded that reuterin alone and its formulation with NaOCl or nisin could be used to develop an effective disinfectant system able to decontaminate successfully food contact surfaces and to prevent the development of bacterial resistances. 3adisinfectants 3anisin 3afood pathogens 3aEscherichia coli 3aListeria innocua 3asynergism1 aJakobsen, Mogens0 tJournal of food, agriculture & environment.g2009 , v. 7, no. 3-4 p.145-149x1459-02557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.world-food.net/scientificjournal.php3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100301b20100305c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/03/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03122naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119100002300128245015600151300001600307500002400323520164200347650001501989650002102004650001402025650002802039650002402067650002502091650002502116650000902141650002302150700002402173700002302197700001702220700001902237700002202256700002302278700003102301700001802332700002602350773009702376852000902473856008902482930003302571945002502604946001102629655001202640IND4431525720221118040813.0100119e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443152572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT200 0aT3001 aRoohinejad, Shahin10aEffect of hypocholesterolemic properties of brown rice varieties containing different gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels on Sprague-Dawley male rats  ap. 197-203.  aIncludes references  aBrown rice (BR) or unmilled rice is the whole grain of rice, from which the germ and outer layers containing the bran have not been removed. Brown rice seeds are rich in more nutritional components, such as dietary fibers, vitamins B and E, gamma (γ)-oryzanol and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) than the ordinary milled rice grains. GABA or 4-aminobutyrate is a well known non-protein-based amino acid that is one of the major inhibitory neurotransmitters in the sympathetic nervous system. In the present study, the influence of brown rice varieties containing different GABA levels on blood cholesterol in Sprague-Dawley male rats was investigated. Quantitative analysis of GABA, Gamma oryzanol, dietary fiber, protein and fat was carried out using appropriate method. Hypercholesterolemia and elevation of LDL-cholesterol was successfully ameliorated by most of the brown rice diets (p < 0.05). A significant negative correlation (p < 0.05) between serum TC level and γ-oryzanol content of diets was observed. Moreover, a significant negative correlation (p < 0.05) between serum LDL-C level and dietary fiber content of diets was observed. In contrast, there was no correlation between GABA content and TC, LDL-C, HDL-C and glucose levels. Although no correlation was found between GABA content and lipid profile suppression, this study suggests that the changes of blood cholesterol can be modulated by using brown rice varieties instead of polished rice in human diet. Even though GABA not played a role for prediction of lipid profile changes, this study was capable to show the hypercholesterolemic effect of brown rice verities. 3abrown rice 3afunctional foods 3avarieties 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3ahypocholesterolemia 3ahypercholesterolemia 3acholesteremic effect 3arats 3alaboratory animals1 aOmidizadeh, Alireza1 aMirhosseini, Hamed1 aRasti, Babak1 aSaari, Nazamid1 aMustafa, Shuhaimi1 aYusof, Rokiah Mohd1 aHussin, Anis Shobirin Meor1 aHamid, Azizah1 aManap, Mohd Yazid Abd0 tJournal of food, agriculture & environment.g2009 , v. 7, no. 3-4 p.197-203x1459-02557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.world-food.net/scientificjournal.php3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100316b20100403c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/03/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02281naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110100002000119245007000139300001600209500002400225520135500249650001101604650002101615650002601636700002101662700002001683773009701703852000901800856008901809930003301898945002501931946001101956655001201967IND4431515520221118040844.0100119e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443151552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aN2001 aYılmaz, Deniz.10aFinite element analysis of a failure in rear-mounted mower pulley  ap. 865-868.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of this study was to analyze the failure of a V-belt pulley in rear-mounted mower used in agriculture. In investigation on failure pulley, optical microscope viewing was used to understand material microstructure. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was to simulate pulley deformation. The examined results showed that the failure type was fracture on input pulley. After optical microscope viewing analysis, it was found that some chemical components of pulley material were lower than standard value. The hardness value of material was determined as 90 HB by hardness test dates. C rate of pulley material was lower than the standard value. It could be stated that this low carbon rate affects the yield strength of the material negatively. Torque and maximum bearing load calculated by pulley power were 176.85 Nm and 7860 N, respectively. After FEA solution process, maximum equivalent stress of 55.331 MPa was determined. The simulation stress results were compared with the yield point of the pulley’s material and found that the maximum stress didn’t exceed the yield point. Hence, as a result of the investigations the failure pulley was determined as material and manufacturing process fault. As a conclusion, according to the experimental and simulation evaluation results, suggestions were made in order to prevent the pulley damage. 3amowers 3aequipment design 3aequipment performance1 aCelik, H.

Soil samples from four field sites amended with ZnSO4 were used to investigate ageing of soluble Zn under field conditions over a 2-year period. Lability of Zn measured using 65Zn radioisotope dilution showed a significant decrease over time and hence evidence of Zn fixation in three of the four soils. However, 0.01 M CaCl2 extractions and toxicity measurements using a genetically modified lux-marked bacterial biosensor did not indicate a decrease in soluble/bioavailable Zn over time. This was attributed to the strong regulatory effect of abiotic properties such as pH on these latter measurements. These results also showed that Zn ageing occurred immediately after Zn spiking, emphasising the need to incubate freshly spiked soils before ecotoxicity assessments. Ageing effects were detected in Zn-amended field soils using 65Zn isotopic dilution as a measure of lability, but not with either CaCl2 extractions or a lux-marked bacterial biosensor. 3aacute toxicity 3asoil pollution 3azinc 3aecotoxicology 3abiosensors 3aisotope dilution technique 3asoil pH 3abacteria 3aEscherichia coli 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 2aZincxanalysis 3aAustralia 0asoil properties1 aBroos, Kris1 aHeemsbergen, Diane1 aWarne, Michael St.J.1 aMcLaughlin, Mike J.1 aHodson, Mark E.1 aNortcliff, Stephen0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2010 Jan., v. 158, no. 1 p.339-345dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2009.06.0343Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/02/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02948naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119100002200128245016000150300001600310500002400326520178200350650001902132650003002151650001702181650001702198650001902215650002202234650002502256651000902281700002002290773009702310852000902407856008902416930003302505945002502538946001102563655001202574IND4431517220221118040826.0100119e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443151722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aX1001 aHajalilou, Behzad10aInvestigation of hydrogeochemical factors and groundwater quality assessment in Marand Municipality, northwest of Iran: A multivariate statistical approach  ap. 930-937.  aIncludes references  aGroundwater is the only major source for drinking water, agricultural and industrial uses in Marand Municipality, so guaranteeing the quality of the water is highly needed in this region. In this study, data sets from two sampling periods (spring and summer) were used to evaluate the chemical quality of water and to study effective factors and hydrogeochemistry processes in Marand groundwater. While carrying out factor analysis, three major parameters of groundwater composition were extracted. According to the Cluster dendrogram the highest similarity exists between HCO3 2- and Mg2+ in the groundwater of the region. Piper diagram and correlation matrix results indicated that the main type of groundwater was bicarbonate with influential role of alkaline earths. Studying isoelectrical conductivity, total dissolved solid contours, and a pie chart in hydrochemical maps shows an increase in EC, TDS and chloride concentration in the groundwater located in the northeast of the region. Changes in the spatial interpretation of the groundwater parameters indicated that the quality and geochemical characteristics of groundwater had a close correlation with topography, geology and hydrograph of Marand plain. Samples which have been obtained from southern parts of the region (near to aquifer recharge center) showed very suitable quality, but the composition of the groundwater changes in the northeast because of an increase of ionic constituents and the existence of fine grain sediments in aquifer zones. We can conclude that factors such as groundwater flow paths, water level increase and human influences made this part of the region sustainable. In this case human influences can include anthropogenic inputs such as urban wastewater and agricultural activities. 3adrinking water 3agroundwater contamination 3ahydrogeology 3ageochemistry 3ahydrochemistry 3achemical analysis 3astatistical analysis 3aIran1 aKhaleghi, Fazel0 tJournal of food, agriculture & environment.g2009 , v. 7, no. 3-4 p.930-937x1459-02557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.world-food.net/scientificjournal.php3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100420b20100501c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/04/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02572naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110100001800119245014900137300001400286500002400300500001500324520128300339650001801622650002001640650002301660650001701683650001601700650002501716650000901741650002401750650001301774650002201787653001401809700001901823700001701842700001701859773009501876852000901971856008901980930003302069945002502102946001102127655001202138IND4431521720221118040741.0100119e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443152172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT2001 aKutlu, Turkan10aProtective effect of dietary apricot kernel oil supplementation on cholesterol levels and antioxidant status of liver in hypercholesteremic rats  ap. 61-65.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aApricot kernel oil is a rich source of MUFA and PUFA, including mainly oleic (about 70%) and linoleic acids, respectively. In addition, apricot kernel oil could be considered as a good source of bioactive compounds such as tocopherols and phytosterols consisting mainly of the γ-isomer and β-sitosterol, respectively. Given to its high content of oleic acid, apricot kernel oil is considered as a healthy supplement in diet. In the present study, we investigated the effects of apricot kernel oil supplementation on cholesterol and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) activity in hypercholesteremic rats. Hypercholesteremia was produced by feeding rats with a semisynthetic diet that contained high cholesterol and cholic acid. A high cholesterol diet caused a decrease in CAT and GPx activity, while apricot kernel oil caused a significant activity increase of these enzymes (P < 0.05). The group fed with apricot kernel oil supplementation showed higher enzyme activities than sunflower oil groups irrespective of cholesterol (P < 0.05). Results of the present study indicate that apricot kernel oil causes improvement in liver antioxidant status of rats in comparison to sunflower oil which is a commonly consumed vegetable oil. 3asunflower oil 3aenzyme activity 3alaboratory animals 3ahuman health 3acholesterol 3aantioxidant activity 3arats 3adietary supplements 3aapricots 3aprotective effect 0aseed oils1 aDurmaz, Gokhan1 aAtes, Burhan1 aErdogan, Ali0 tJournal of food, agriculture & environment.g2009 , v. 7, no. 3-4 p.61-65x1459-02557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.world-food.net/scientificjournal.php3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100227b20100305c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/02/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02468naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110100001600119245008100135300001400216500002400230500001500254520144100269650001901710650001101729650001701740650002501757651002101782653003101803700002201834773009501856852000901951856008901960930003302049945002502082946001102107655001202118IND4431521620221118041004.0100119e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443152162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aKoca, Ilkay10aPhysical, chemical and antioxidant properties of solid and sour apple pekmez  ap. 58-60.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPekmez is a traditional Turkish food commonly produced from grape. It can also be produced from fruits containing high amounts of sugar like apple, plum, and apricot. Apple pekmez has been produced from fresh apples in Turkey using traditional techniques. Apple pekmez is produced as either liquid or solid. The acidity of apple juice is not reduced with pekmez soil, or CaCO3 in sour apple pekmez production. In this study, physical, chemical, and antioxidant properties of solid and sour apple pekmez were determined. For this purpose, thirty samples of pekmez were analysed. Hunter L values of pekmez samples ranged between 15.06 and 24.42. Hunter a value was between + 0.32 and +3.81 and b value was between +0.47 and +4.62. Additional analysed characteristics were water activity (0.550-0.867), total soluble solids (65-85%), total sugar content (258.60-739.40 g kg-1), reducing sugar (167.20-617.60 g kg-1), unreducing sugar (1.80-198.70 g kg-1), pH (3.04-4.58), total acidity (9.90-75.30 g kg-1), crude protein (2.60-12.40 g kg-1), ash (8.00-28.70 g kg-1) and hydroxymethyl furfural (23.54-2133.52 mg kg-1). Total phenolics value of the pekmez samples ranged between 4603.60 and 14,252.25 mg kg-1, and total antioxidant activity (expressed as FRAP values) between 47.34 and 327.86 mmol g-1.

As the temperature management is a very important function for fresh foods, it is desirable that the quality conditions during storage and transport are clearly understood and traceable. This paper describes the development of a temperature-managed traceability system based on RFID tag, GPS, mobile communication based on TTT theory. The system has been tested with the Haikou-Beijing transport scenario for chilled tilapia. The results show that the system is helpful in quality control, traceability and efficiency of frozen and chilled food during storage and transportation chain.

It can be used to improve management and to select species for revegetation and agroforestry systems. The BNF of tree legumes was estimated in four areas of the Brazilian dry forest (caatinga), analyzing potentially fixing species (target species) and non fixing species (reference species), using the 15N natural abundance methodology. The differences between the isotopic signals of target and reference species permit the safe identification of N2-fixing plants and reasonably precise calculations of proportions of N derived from the air (%Ndfa). Species with great N2 fixation capacity were identified, notably Mimosa tenuiflora, Mimosa arenosa and Piptadenia stipulacea. The mean biological fixation contributions to the plants were high, varying from 27 to 68%. However, the estimated quantities of N added annually to the leaf biomass in the systems were low (2.5 and 11.2 kg ha−1 year−1), due to low proportions of fixing plants in the vegetation communities. In situations of native vegetation regeneration, when the succession is dominated by fixing species, fixation could reach up to 130 kg ha−1 year−1. 3atropical forests 3adry forests 3anitrogen fixation 3aforest trees 3aBrazil1 aSampaio, E.V.S.B.1 aSantos, C.E.R.S.1 aFernandes, A.R.0 tJournal of arid environments.g2010 Mar., v. 74, no. 3 p.344-349dAcademic Pressx0140-19637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2009.09.0183Available from publisher's Web site  a20100125b20100205c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/01/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02385naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110100002900119245011600148300001600264500002400280500001500304520119700319650002301516650002701539650001401566650002101580650002201601653001901623653002401642700002201666700002001688700002701708773009701735852000901832856008901841930003301930945002501963946001101988655001201999IND4431519520221118040647.0100119e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443151952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8311 aSiddiquee, Shafiquzzaman10aIn vitro studies on the potential Trichoderma harzianum for antagonistic properties against Ganoderma boninense  ap. 970-976.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aGanoderma boninense is a bracket fungus that is pathogenic on oil palms causing basal stem rot, while some members of the genus Trichoderma are good biological control agents against numerous plant fungal diseases. We isolated and tested T. harzianum for in-vivo nursery to suppress diseases caused by G. boninense. A total of 48 local isolates of T. harzianum were selected for screening of their antagonistic properties against G. boninense(strain PER 71) by dual culture techniques. The results showed that all of the isolates of T. harzianum inhibited the growth of PER 71 with percentage of inhibition radial growth (PIRG) values ranging from 47.86 to 72.06%. The best eight samples from the dual cultures were then tested for their production of volatile antifungal compounds against PER 71, which gave PIRG values between 24.53 and 58.70% over 6 days. The values ranged from 18.35 to 40.16% over 6 days for the antifungal activities of their non-volatile compounds. Isolate FA 30 was demonstrated to be the best isolate not only to the dual culture inhibition tests but also the best for the production of inhibitory properties from both volatile and non-volatile antifungal compounds. 3afungal antagonists 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aGanoderma 3ain vitro studies 3aTrichoderma lixii 0aHypocrea lixii 0aGanoderma boninense1 aYusuf, Umi Kalsom1 aHossain, Kausar1 aSāroẏāra Jāhāna.0 tJournal of food, agriculture & environment.g2009 , v. 7, no. 3-4 p.970-976x1459-02557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.world-food.net/scientificjournal.php3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100420b20100501c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/04/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02399naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001800172245006500190300001600255500002400271500001500295520071900310650001401029650001301043650001001056650002101066650001101087650001801098650002101116650001801137650002001155650002601175650001101201650002201212650001801234650002701252650001501279650001401294650002201308650002201330650001901352650002301371653001601394653001801410700002301428700001901451700002301470700002201493773012301515852000901638856006901647930003301716945002501749946001101774655001201785IND4382895620221118041029.0060818e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438289562DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-005-9030-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF600 0aF1101 aVanegas, P.E.10aParticle bombardment, a method for gene transfer in marigold  ap. 359-363.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMarigold (Tagetes erecta) leaf explants were bombarded with plasmid pBI426 in a low pressure particle inflow gun.

Several reports have showed that in vitro micropropagation is a feasible method to produce large quantities of 'clonal' plants from R. pseudoacacia, however, no information is available on micropropagation of R. ambigua or the other assumed parental species, R. hispida. Here, we report on a tissue culture system for efficient micropropagation of R. ambigua plants by enhanced branching of axillary buds taken from a single branch of a donor tree. The culture system consists of sequential use of three media, namely, the bud-induction medium (MS medium supplemented with 0.8-1.4 mg l-1 6-BA, 0.05-0.08 mg l-1 NAA and 0.07-0.1 mg l-1 GA), elongation medium (MS medium added with 0.35-0.5 mg l-1 6-BA, 0.05-0.08 mg l-1 NAA and 0.07-0.1 mg l-1 GA) and root-induction medium (1/4 MS medium fortified with 1.7-2.5 mg l-1 IAA and 0.1-0.5 mg l-1 IBA). In addition, we investigated the genetic stability (relative to the donor plant) of a sample of 41 morphologically normal plants randomly taken from ca. 13,000 micropropagated plants, by using the inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) marker with 32 selected primers. We found that of the 226 reproducible bands scored, 24 were polymorphic (10.62%), thus pointing to the occurrence, though at a relatively low level compared with an earlier study on R. pseudoacacia, of genomic variation in these micropropagated plants. Further sequencing on seven loci underlying the variations showed that two had significant homology to known or predicted plant genes. 3aRobinia hispida 3aclonal variation 3aRobinia pseudoacacia 3abenzyladenine 3amicropropagation 3agenetic markers 3amicrosatellite repeats 3adose response 3agibberellic acid 3aexplants 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3ain vitro regeneration 3abuds 3aforest trees 3aculture media 3aindole acetic acid 3aindole butyric acid 3agenetic stability 0amethodology 0ain vitro culture 0amolecular sequence data 0aRobinia 0anucleotide sequences1 aLi, Y.1 aGong, L.1 aLi, F.1 aDong, Y.1 aLiu, B.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2006 Mar., v. 84, no. 3 p.343-351dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-005-9043-53electronic resource  a20060823b20060906c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/08/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02559naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001500163245008400178300001600262500002400278500001500302520102000317650002101337650002401358650001801382650001501400650002101415650001301436650002601449650001801475650001201493650002701505650002101532650001301553650002601566650001801592650001101610650002001621653002101641653001601662653001101678700001401689700001501703700001701718773012301735852000901858856006901867930003301936945002501969946001101994655001202005IND4382895020221118040856.0060818e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438289502DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-005-9041-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF1101 aJunaid, A.10aSomatic embryo proliferation, maturation and germination in Catharanthus roseus  ap. 325-332.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn the present study an efficient somatic embryogenesis method has been developed in Catharanthus roseus. Friable embryogenic callus was induced from hypocotyl of in vitro germinated seeds on Murashige and Skoog basal nutrient media supplemented with various auxins particularly 2,4-D (1.0 mg l-1). However, only NAA (1.0 mg l-1) produced somatic embryos in cultures. Embryo proliferation was even high on the same medium added with BAP. Cotyledonary somatic embryo germinated and converted into plantlets in BAP (0.5 mg l-1) added medium following a treatment with gibberellic acid (1.0 mg l-1) for maturation. Carbon sources and concentrations had a marked influence on maturation process. Plantlet conversion was better achieved when embryos were matured on 3% fructose or 3-6% maltose. The result discussed in this paper indicates that somatic embryos were produced in numbers and converted plantlets can be used as raw material, genetic modification to embryo precursor cell may improve alkaloid yield further. 3aseed germination 3aCatharanthus roseus 3adose response 3ahypocotyls 3agibberellic acid 3aexplants 3asomatic embryogenesis 3abenzyladenine 3amaltose 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3amicropropagation 3afructose 3ain vitro regeneration 3aculture media 3acallus 3asomatic embryos 0ain vitro culture 0amethodology 0aauxins1 aMujib, A.1 aBhat, M.A.1 aSharma, M.P.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2006 Mar., v. 84, no. 3 p.325-332dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-005-9041-73electronic resource  a20060823b20060906c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/08/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02576naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001500172245011100187300001600298500002400314500001500338520091200353650002701265650001801292650001901310650001801329650002201347650001301369650002101382650002501403650001801428650002001446650002601466650001701492650001301509650002101522650002601543650001001569650002301579653002101602653001601623700002101639700001401660700001501674700001301689700001501702773012201717852000901839856006901848930003301917945002501950946001101975655001201986IND4382898720221118040952.0060818e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438289872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-005-9070-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF600 0aF1401 aKang, H.J.10aProduction of transgenic Aralia elata regenerated from Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated transformed roots  ap. 187-196.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTransgenic hairy roots were induced from petiole and root segments of in vitro plant Aralia elata, a medicinal woody shrub, after co-cultivation with A. rhizogenes ATCC 15834.

Sulfur amino acids (SAA), methionine and cystine (Met + Cys), are the limiting amino acids (AA) and have the lowest availability among the AAs in nine treatments. The availability of SAA (ASAA) ranged from -18.6% in raw beans to 39.8-68.0% in thermally processed beans. Autoclaving at 121 degrees C for 10-90 min gradually reduced ASAA values. The mean availability for each AA (MAEAA) is the average of the AIAA values for the same AA. MAEAA values ranged from 82.1% (arginine) to 50.4% (Met + Cys). The mean availability in each treatment (MAET) is the average of the AIAA values in the same treatment. The difference between MAET and true digestibility of protein (TDP) was less than 7%. However, the differences between ASAA and TDP (16-37%) and between ASAA and MAET (14-30%) were large. The ASAA-corrected amino acid score (AASASAA) for raw beans was negative (-29.4%) and ranged from 61.8 to 42.1% for thermally processed beans. From a comparison among the protein quality indexes, AASASAA is the preferred method to evaluate protein quality of beans. 3aprotein composition 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aheat treatment 3aamino acids 3abioavailability 3adigestibility 0aindexes of nutrient availability1 aWilliams, W.P.1 aKunkel, M.E.1 aActon, J.C.1 aHuang, Y.1 aWardlaw, F.B.1 aGrimes, L.W.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1996 May, v. 44, no. 5 p.1296-1301x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf95030163Available from publisher's Web site  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03931naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100002600163245010900189300001600298500002400314520212200338650003502460650002702495650001502522650002902537650002502566650000902591650002302600650002102623650000902644650001902653650002102672650001302693650002402706650002102730650002602751650001602777650001802793650002802811650002802839650002002867650002102887650002402908650001502932650002102947651001302968700001802981700001902999700002303018773011303041852000903154856008503163930003303248945002503281946001103306655001203317IND4431375520221118041108.0100115e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443137552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2009.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF110 0aJ5001 aRodrigues, M.

Penca de Mirandela) is grown in Portugal during autumn and winter months when heavy rains can be expected. In this agrosystem the management of N is a considerable challenge due to the risk of nitrate leaching. Field experiments with tall cabbage and rye were carried out during the growing seasons of 2007/2008 and 2008/2009. The experimental design included three fertilisers that delay N availability by different mechanisms [Floranid permanent, containing isobutylidene diurea (IBDU); Basacote, a polymer-coated fertiliser; and Entec 26, containing 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) as nitrification inhibitor], two urea treatments (total N applied basally; and divided into two equal rates in preplant and topdress application), and a zero N control. The fertilisers were applied at a rate of 120kgNha⁻¹. A pot experiment with tall cabbage followed by ryegrass grown in the same pots was carried out in 2007/2008. The fertiliser treatments were essentially the same and a rate of 2.94g N/pot was applied. Dry matter yield, plant N concentration, plant N recovery and indices of N-use efficiency were compared among the fertiliser treatments. In the pot experiment, soil nitrate concentration was also monitored by using anion exchange membranes inserted directly into the soil. Urea produced mean DM yields statistically higher than control in all crops and in both field and pot experiments and years. No significant differences in DM yield were usually found among fertilised treatments. Basacote produced DM yields often not significantly different from that of control. In the field experiment of tall cabbage, plants recovered 20 and 50% of the amount of N applied, respectively in Basacote and in the other fertilised plots. In the pot experiment, tall cabbage+ryegrass recovered 49.6 and ≈100% of N applied, respectively in Basacote and in the other fertilised plots. From the strictly agronomic point of view, none of the slow-release N materials provided advantages over urea to be advised for this agrosystem, considering also their high cost. 3aBrassica oleracea var. costata 3agreen leafy vegetables 3acole crops 3aslow-release fertilizers 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aurea 3aapplication timing 3afertilizer rates 3arain 3aagroecosystems 3anitrate nitrogen 3aleaching 3anutrient management 3anitrogen balance 3afield experimentation 3acover crops 3atop dressings 3anutrient use efficiency 3adry matter accumulation 3aplant nutrition 3anutrient content 3aion exchange resins 3acrop yield 3aagronomic traits 3aPortugal1 aSantos, Helga1 aRuivo, Sérgio1 aArrobas, Margarida0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2010 Feb., v. 32, no. 2 p.137-143dElsevier Science Pub.

Exposed LM on the ventral side of boneless loins was evaluated with visible and near-infrared spectroscopy (VISNIR; 450 to 1,000 nm) using a commercial system that was developed for on-line evaluation of beef tenderness. Boneless loin sections were aged (2°C) until 14 d postmortem, and two 2.54-cm-thick chops were obtained from the 11th-rib region. Fresh (never frozen) chops were cooked (71°C) and LM slice shear force (SSF) was measured on each of the 2 chops. Those 2 values were averaged, and that value was used for all analyses. Loins were blocked by plant (n = 3), production day (n = 24), and observed SSF (mean = 13.9 kg; SD = 3.7 kg; CV = 26.8%; range 6.4 to 32.4 kg). One-half of the loins were assigned to a calibration data set, which was used to develop regression equations, and one-half of the loins were assigned to a prediction data set, which was used to validate the regression equations. A partial least-squares regression model was developed, and loins were classified as predicted tender or not predicted tender if their VISNIR-predicted SSF was <14.0 kg or ≥14.0 kg, respectively. Analysis of variance was used to determine the effect of VISNIR classification on SSF. The calibration data set and prediction data set had 61.9 and 60.9% of the loins classified as predicted tender, respectively. For both the calibration data set and the prediction data set, mean SSF was less for loins predicted tender than loins not predicted tender (P < 0.001). Relative to loins that were not predicted tender, the percentage of loins with SSF ≥20 kg was less for loins predicted tender in the calibration data set (3.6 vs. 8.1%) and prediction data set (1.8 vs. 13.6%). These results clearly indicate that the VISNIR technology could be used to noninvasively classify pork loins on-line for tenderness. 3abeef 3aboning 3acalibration 3achops 3aclassification 3adata collection 3aequations 3aleast squares 3aloins 3ameat tenderness 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3apork 3aprediction 3aslaughterhouses 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aKing, D.A.1 aWheeler, T.L.0 tJournal of animal science.g2011 Nov., v. 89, no. 11 p.3803-3808dAmerican Society of Animal SciencewJournal:jnl45556x1525-31637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/548613Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2011-4249  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/110831_Shackelford_et_al_2011893803.pdf  aUSDA 7aarticle02971naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178100002100187245012300208300001800331500002400349500001500373520089500388650001601283650001501299650001801314650001701332650002001349650001701369650001501386650003201401650001501433650002001448650002601468650001501494650001201509650001801521650002301539650001101562650001901573650002601592650002501618650002801643650002501671650001101696650003401707650002901741650002701770650000901797650002201806650001501828653001601843653001901859700002201878700002001900700002201920700002201942700001701964773009801981852000902079856009002088930003302178945002502211946001302236655001202249IND4431374920221118040945.0100115e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443137492DNAL7 a200365322pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2009.11.0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aJ1001 aSarkar, Sutripta10aEffectiveness of inoculation with isolated Geobacillus strains in the thermophilic stage of vegetable waste composting  ap. 2892-2895.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAn inoculum containing two amylolytic and three cellulolytic thermophilic bacteria, isolated from a preceding compost pile and identified as Geobacillus species by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, was applied to a mixture of market waste, rice straw and cow dung (5:1:0.2) so that the initial cell density was 2×10⁸ colony forming unit (CFU) per gram dry weight at 55°C. The inoculation increased the total cell count particularly in the thermophilic stage as determined by flow cytometry. Concomitantly, there was a significant rise in microbial metabolism in the compost pile as reflected by the dehydrogenase activity. As a result, the C/N ratio dropped more rapidly in the inoculated mixture than that in the control without inoculum. The study, therefore, suggested that inoculation by thermophilic bacteria would be effective in the composting process at least in the thermophilic stage. 3aGeobacillus 3afood waste 3acattle manure 3asolid wastes 3aoxidoreductases 3aMSW composts 3arice straw 3acellulolytic microorganisms 3avegetables 3aenzyme activity 3athermophilic bacteria 3acomposting 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aCattle 2aFlow Cytometry 2aGeobacillusxgenetics 2aManurexmicrobiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aOryza. 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aRefuse Disposalxmethods 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSoil 2aSoil Microbiology 2aVegetables 0afood wastes 0aorganic wastes1 aBanerjee, Rajdeep1 aChanda, Sunanda1 aDāśa, Pradīpa.1 aGanguly, Sandipan1 aPal, Subrata0 tBioresource technology.g2010 Apr., v. 101, no. 8 p.2892-2895dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.11.0953Available from publisher's Web site  a20100302b20100403c00000000  aINDdRSCe2010/03/02  aOther US 7aarticle02576naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178100003000187245007900217300001800296500002400314500001500338520097200353650001401325650002801339650001501367650001601382650001401398650001701412650001501429650001601444650002701460650002901487650001401516650003201530651001101562653001801573653002001591700002701611700001901638700002101657700002201678700003201700700002201732773009801754852000901852856009001861930003301951945002501984946001302009655001202022IND4431374420140725000000.0100115e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443137442DNAL7 a200565372pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2009.11.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aM0011 ade Morais, Michele Greque10aPreparation of nanofibers containing the microalga Spirulina (Arthrospira)  ap. 2872-2876.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSpirulina is a microalga which offers biological functions highly favorable for tissue engineering. Highly porous scaffolds can be produced by electrospinning containing biomass of Spirulina. The goal of this contribution was therefore to establish spinning conditions allowing to produce well defined nanofibers with diameters down to about 100nm and to produce nanofibers with various concentration of the biomass for subsequent studies in tissue engineering applications. The experimental results reveal that the blend system PEO/biomass is behaved surprisingly well in electrospinning. Very thin bead-free nanofibers with diameters of about 110nm can be produced for different biomass contents of up to 67wt.% of the nanofibers and for PEO concentrations in the spinning solution well below 4wt.%. These results suggest to us the use of the biomass containing nanofibers as extracellular matrices for stem cell culture and future treatment of spinal chord injury. 3aSpirulina 3aelectrical conductivity 3ananofibers 3aArthrospira 3aviscosity 3apolyethylene 3amicroalgae 2aBioreactors 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aNanofibersxmicrobiology 2aSpirulina 2aTissue Engineeringxmethods 0aBrazil 0aCyanobacteria 0aelectrospinning1 aStillings, Christopher1 aDersch, Roland1 aRudisile, Markus1 aPranke, Patrícia1 aCosta, Jorge Alberto Vieira1 aWendorff, Joachim0 tBioresource technology.g2010 Apr., v. 101, no. 8 p.2872-2876dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.11.0593Available from publisher's Web site  a20100302b20100403c00000000  aINDdRSCe2010/03/02  aOther US 7aarticle02147naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001700137245011700154300001800271520093000289650001601219650001001235650001101245650001601256650001401272650001201286650001101298650002101309650003801330650001601368650003201384653001101416653001101427700001901438700002101457773010201478852000901580856007701589930003301666945001301699946001301712655001201725IND2053357520221118041043.0961003e199606  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205335752DNAL7 a10.1021/jf950512a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScarponi, L.10aGrowth response and changes in starch formation as a result of imazethapyr treatment of soybean (Glycine max L.)  ap. 1572-1577.  aDecreased dry weight, increased fresh weight, and increased phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL; EC 4.3.1.15) and tyrosine ammonia-lyase (TAL: EC 4.3.1) activities were found in imazethapyr-treated roots and shoots of soybean compared to untreated controls. In the treated seedlings, glucose content increased while starch decreased, giving rise to a decline in the sum of free and allocated glucose. Moreover, ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase activity (RUBISCO; EC 4.1.1.39) decreased in the treated shoots. The exogenous application of a mixture of valine, leucine, and isoleucine with the herbicide treatment prevented the effects on glucose and starch contents and on RUBISCO activity, but not on fresh and dry weight or PAL and TAL activities. These findings suggest that the former are a consequence of the herbicide inhibition of the synthesis of the branched-chain amino acids, while the latter could be stress symptoms. 3aGlycine max 3aroots 3ashoots 3aimazethapyr 3aseedlings 3aglucose 3astarch 3anutrient content 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aamino acids 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 0astress 0agrowth1 aMartinetti, L.1 aNemat Alla, M.M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1996 June, v. 44, no. 6 p.1572-1577x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf950512a3Available from publisher's Web site  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01618naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001600137245008400153300001800237520049800255650001600753650002400769650002100793650002300814650002000837650001400857650000800871650001300879650001400892653001500906653001200921653001800933700002200951773010200973852000901075856007701084930003301161945001301194946001301207655001201220IND2053356620221118041009.0961003e199606  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205335662DNAL7 a10.1021/jf95053822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKraus, G.A.10aSynthesis and testing of compounds that inhibit soybean cyst nematode egg hatch  ap. 1548-1550.  aSoybean cyst nematode infestation continues to be a serious agricultural problem. As part of an interdisciplinary effort to identify a biorational solution to the problem, analogs of glycinoeclepin A, a natural hatching stimulus of the nematode, were prepared and tested. Several of the analogs were discovered to inhibit the hatching of soybean cyst nematode eggs. On the basis of the results of egg hatch tests, the minimum functionality for egg hatch inhibition appears to be a keto diacid. 3aGlycine max 3aHeterodera glycines 3anematode control 3abiological control 3aallelochemicals 3asynthesis 3aova 3ahatching 3abioassays 0ainhibition 0aanalogs 0aglycinoclepin1 aVander Louw, S.J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1996 June, v. 44, no. 6 p.1548-1550x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf95053823Available from publisher's Web site  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02680naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100001700176245008800193300001600281500002400297500001500321520122300336650001501559650001801574650002301592650002701615650002301642650003101665650001301696650001501709653004301724653002101767700001701788700002201805700001901827700002601846700002401872700002001896773010301916852000902019856008902028930003302117945002502150946001102175655001202186IND4431369820221118040955.0100115e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443136982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aQ5011 aCoppa, Mauro10aPrediction of milk fatty acid composition by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy  ap. 182-189.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aNear-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) (700-2500 nm) was used to predict milk fatty acid (FA) composition. Broad FA variability was ensured by using experimental cow milk derived from different feeding regimes (pasture and preserved forages with or without lipid supplements). Detailed FA composition was analyzed by gas chromatography. Predictive equations (354 samples) were developed for liquid and oven-dried milk samples using modified partial least squares with cross-validation and external validation (114 samples). Coefficient of determination in external validation (R²V) and residual predictive deviation (RPD) were good (R²V ≥ 0.88; RPD ≥ 3.26) for saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), unsaturated fatty acids (UNSAT), trans FA, trans and cis-C18:1, caproic, caprilic, capric, lauric, myristic, palmitic and oleic acids in oven-dried milk, approximate for polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), stearic, vaccenic and rumenic acids (R²V ≤ 0.81; RPD ≤ 3.23) and poor for linoleic, linolenic, total n-6 and n-3 acids. The quantification was more accurate for oven-dried milk, but good results were also obtained for SFA, MUFA, palmitic and oleic acids in liquid milk. 3adairy cows 3amilk analysis 3aruminant nutrition 3afatty acid composition 3aexperimental diets 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3amilk fat 3aprediction 0anear-infrared reflectance spectroscopy 0amilk composition1 aFerlay, Anne1 aLeroux, Christine1 aJestin, Michel1 aChilliard, Y.q(Yves)1 aMartin, B.q(Bruno)1 aAndueza, Donato0 tInternational dairy journal.g2010 Mar., v. 20, no. 3 p.182-189dElsevier Sciencex0958-69467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.11.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20100330b20100403c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/03/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02184naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002000137245007000157300001800227520101700245650002101262650002301283650001901306650002501325650001501350650001701365650001401382650002901396650001501425700002101440700001701461700001601478700001601494700001801510773010101528852000901629856007701638930003301715945001301748946001301761655001201774IND2053408520221118041105.0961007e199605  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205340852DNAL7 a10.1021/jf950540t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSivropoulou, A.10aAntimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of Origanum essential oils  ap. 1202-1205.  aThree Origanum essential oils, Origanum vulgare ssp. hirtum, Origanum dictamnus, and a commercially available Origanum oil, were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and showed a high content of carvacrol, thymol, gamma-terpinene, and p-cymene representing 73.7%, 92.8%, and 87.78% of the total oil, respectively. The three essential oils exhibited high levels of antimicrobial activity against eight strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Among the major components of the three oils, carvacrol and thymol exhibited the highest levels of antimicrobial activity, while their biosynthetic precursors gamma-terpinene and p-cymene were inactive. The essential oil of 0. vulgare ssp. hirtum was extremely bactericidal at 1/4000 dilution and even at dilutions as high as 1/50000 caused considerable decrease in bacterial growth rates.

It is notable that 9 out of 11 sludges in which the pH was maintained between 6.6 and 8.1 retained anammox activity, while those with either a lower or higher pH did not. Moreover, anammox-positive sludge had a significantly higher concentration of [formula removed] plus [formula removed] than did anammox-negative sludge. A significant difference was not observed between anammox-positive and -negative sludge regarding [formula removed] in the influent, DO concentration in aeration tanks, and the concentrations of [formula removed], free nitric acid, and free ammonia. 3aanimal production 3aswine 3apig manure 3awastewater treatment 3abiological treatment 3aactivated sludge 3aammonia 3aoxidation 3anitrogen 3aanaerobic digesters 3amicrobial activity 2aAmmoniaxmetabolism 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aBacteria, Anaerobicxmetabolism 2aBiofilms 2aBioreactors 2aChromatography, Ion Exchange 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aSewagexmicrobiology 2aSwine 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 2aWater Purificationxmethods 0aanaerobic ammonium oxidation1 aYasuda, Tomoko1 aSuzuki, Kazuyoshi1 aSakai, Takahiro1 aSuzuki, Naoto1 aSuzuki, Ryoji1 aMatsuba, Kenji1 aYokoyama, Hiroshi1 aOgino, Akifumi1 aTanaka, Yasuo1 aUeda, Shingo1 aTakeuchi, Mio1 aYamagishi, Takao1 aSuwa, Yuichi0 tBioresource technology.g2010 Apr., v. 101, no. 8 p.2685-2690dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.10.0813Available from publisher's Web site  a20100227b20100305c00000000  aINDdRSCe2010/02/26  aOther US 7aarticle02321naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001200137245010700149300001800256500001500274520112100289650001901410650001001429650001601439650001401455650002001469650002601489650003801515653003001553653002301583653001101606653001501617653001201632700002001644773010201664852000901766856007701775930003301852945001301885946001301898655001201911IND2053359020221118041017.0961003e199606  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205335902DNAL7 a10.1021/jf95073512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGan, Z.10aProduction and characterization of monoclonal antibodies against wheat flour diacylgalactosylglycerols  ap. 1609-1615.  a2019-12-04  aSeven immunoglobulin M (IgM)-type monoclonal antibodies were developed against wheat diacylgalactosylglycerols (MGDG). That with the highest titer, MG405, was characterized in detail using a solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Inhibition experiments with galactose, glycerol, galactosylglycerol, and lipid standards containing fatty acids typical of those in MGDG indicated that MG405 was directed against the whole MGDG molecule rather than parts of its structure. Six other monoclonal antibodies, also IgM type, had similar specificities. Antibody binding was reduced by 30% when fetal bovine serum, used as antibody diluent and blocking agent, was replaced with gelatin in an ELISA carried out with purified MG405. The plasma cofactor beta 2-glycoprotein I (beta 2GPI) increased binding only slightly, suggesting that some other plasma cofactor may potentiate antibody binding to MGDG. MG405 also appeared not to be an intrinsically low affinity antibody to beta 2GPI. Availability of antibodies such as MG405 could provide a valuable means of investigating polar liquid functionality in foods. 3across reaction 3adough 3awheat flour 3agalactose 3adiacylglycerols 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 0abread dough gas retention 0agalactosylglycerol 0alipids 0ainhibition 0abinding1 aSchofield, J.D.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1996 June, v. 44, no. 6 p.1609-1615x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf95073513Available from publisher's Web site  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02893naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178100003900187245008500226300001800311500002400329500001500353520086700368650002501235650001401260650002501274650002101299650001801320650004401338650001901382650002701401650001401428650002201442650002701464650003401491650001601525650001001541650003201551650002101583650002401604650003901628650003501667650004501702650001301747650002601760650004301786650003201829653000901861700002301870700003501893700002701928700002001955773009801975852000902073856009002082930003302172945002502205946001302230655001202243IND4431371920221118041111.0100115e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443137192DNAL7 a199396682pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2009.10.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aX3501 aSelvakumar, Kuppusamy Vaithilingam14aThe potential of free cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on textile dye degradation  ap. 2678-2684.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of the present work was to reduce chemical oxygen demand (COD), color of textile effluent containing dye Procion Blue 2G and recycle the treated effluent. To achieve this objective, the degradation potential of bacterial strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa was tested. In degradation, the ‘clean' electro-oxidation (EO) process was combined with bio-treatment such that an electro-oxidation step was included between two bio-degradation treatments. Bio-oxidation process was carried out under aerobic and anoxic conditions. Results showed more than 90% reduction in COD and complete removal of color at the end of two cycles of combined oxidation process with a post electro-oxidation. The treated effluent was then subjected to photo-oxidation to remove the microbes so that the water can be recycled after the removal of total dissolved solids (TDS). 3abiological treatment 3atriazines 3awastewater treatment 3aelectrochemistry 3areactive dyes 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiodegradation 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aoxidation 3aspectral analysis 3achemical oxygen demand 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBioreactors 2aColor 2aColoring Agentsxmetabolism 2aElectrochemistry 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPseudomonas aeruginosaxmetabolism 2aSpectrophotometry, Ultraviolet 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 2aTextiles 2aTriazinesxmetabolism 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxmetabolism 2aWater Purificationxmethods 0adyes1 aBasha, Chiya Ahmed1 aPrabhu, Harinarayan Janardhana1 aKalaichelvi, Ponnusamy1 aNelliyan, Sudha0 tBioresource technology.g2010 Apr., v. 101, no. 8 p.2678-2684dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.10.0773Available from publisher's Web site  a20100227b20100305c00000000  aINDdRSCe2010/02/26  aOther US 7aarticle02442naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001700137245009100154300001800245500001500263520117000278650001201448650001901460650001501479650001501494650002001509650002701529650002501556650001301581650002001594650002501614653002601639653001201665700002201677700001701699700001601716700001701732773010201749852000901851856007701860930003301937945001301970946001301983655001201996IND2053358220221118041201.0961003e199606  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205335822DNAL7 a10.1021/jf950551m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWagner, S.C.10aBentazon degradation in soil: influence of tillage and history of bentazon application  ap. 1593-1598.  a2019-12-04  aLaboratory studies determined the fate of bentazon (3-isopropyl-1H-2,1,3-benzothiadiazin-4(3H)-one 2,2-dioxide) in soil as affected by tillage and history of application. Bentazon degradation in two soils from Mississippi and three soils from Illinois under conventional-tillage (CT) and notillage (NT) (3-18 years) with varying histories of bentazon application (0-9 applications) was studied. The half-life (DT50) for bentazon degradation ranged from 4.6 to 49.5 d; half-lives for NT of the two soils with the longest history of bentazon application were lower than those for CT. Half-lives for soils with no bentazon history were 3-11-fold higher than bentazon half-lives of those previously exposed to bentazon. Dissipation of bentazon was accompanied with increases in nonextractable material. Methylbentazon was the most consistently observed metabolite (1.7-5.8% applied 14C after 48 d). Bentazon mineralization ranged from 12% to 18% applied after 48 d and 2% to 3% applied after 22 d for bentazon history and nonhistory soils, respectively. Patterns of mineralization were affected by tillage in the two of the five soils with the longest bentazon history. 3ahistory 3amineralization 3ametabolism 3ano-tillage 3aclay loam soils 3aapplication technology 3abiochemical pathways 3abentazon 3asilt loam soils 3achemical degradation 0aherbicide degradation 0atillage1 aZablotowicz, R.M.1 aGaston, L.A.1 aLocke, M.A.1 aKinsella, J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1996 June, v. 44, no. 6 p.1593-1598x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf950551m3Available from publisher's Web site  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02394naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001700137245010300154300001800257500001500275520095900290650001801249650001201267650002101279650001601300650001001316650001601326650002201342650001201364650002001376650001901396650004301415653003001458653001401488653001901502653002301521653003001544653003101574653001101605700002101616700001601637773010201653852000901755856007701764930003301841945001301874946001301887655001201900IND2055114820221118041137.0970129e199607  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205511482DNAL7 a10.1021/jf950522b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWillis, R.B.10aImproved method for manual, colorimetric determination of total Kjeldahl nitrogen using salicylate  ap. 1804-1807.  a2019-12-04  aA manual colorimetric method for analyzing ammonia or total Kjeldahl nitrogen is described that eliminates irreproducibility due to variability in time between additions of reagents. Variability is negligible when trisodium phosphate is substituted in the buffer in place of the usual disodium phosphate and sodium hydroxide. The resulting procedure is very simple and reliable and uses salicylate, which is the most environmentally acceptable of the alternative colorimetric reagents. Only two reagents are used, the first containing trisodium phosphate, salicylate, and sodium nitroprusside and the second containing hypochlorite. The accuracy of the method was verified in two ways: first, by analyzing the digestate of three NBS standards and comparing the results to the NBS certified value; second, by analyzing the digestate of in-house samples and comparing the results using this procedure to the results using two other colorimetric procedures. 3aplant tissues 3aammonia 3anitrogen content 3asalicylates 3aliver 3acolorimetry 3achemical analysis 3aBovidae 3aconifer needles 3aanimal tissues 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0anbs standard bovine liver 0astandards 0aplant analysis 0aanalytical methods 0anbs standard pine needles 0anbs standard tomato leaves 0aleaves1 aMontgomery, M.E.1 aAllen, P.R.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1996 July, v. 44, no. 7 p.1804-1807x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf950522b3Available from publisher's Web site  a19970303b19970307c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02059naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001500137245017400152300001800326520082400344650001401168650001301182650001901195650002601214650003801240653002401278700001601302700001501318700001501333700001601348700001701364700001301381700002001394773010201414852000901516856007701525930003301602945001301635946001301648655001201661IND2055113120221118041227.0970129e199607  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205511312DNAL7 a10.1021/jf950625u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaza, A.I.10aDevelopment of monoclonal antibodies against caprine alphaS2-casein and their potential for detecting the substitution of ovine milk by caprine milk by an indirect ELISA  ap. 1756-1761.  aMonoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been generated against purified caprine alpha S2-casein recovered from goat's milk casein by cation-exchange chromatography. Using hybridoma technology, eight MAbs reactive against whole caprine caseins were identified and characterized. All of them failed to show a significant cross-reactivity when tested against sheep and cow whole caseins and beef, horse, porcine, chicken, and soya proteins, as well as gelatin and bovine serum albumin. One of the monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cell line B2B appeared to be species monospecific and reacted only with the caprine alpha S2-casein fraction by immunoblotting analysis. Subsequently, MAb B2B was used in an indirect ELISA format for detection of defined amounts of goat's milk (0.5-15%) in ewe's milk (v/v) mixtures. 3agoat milk 3aewe milk 3aalphaS1-casein 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 0agoat milk detection1 aMorales, P.1 aMartin, R.1 aGarcia, T.1 aAnguita, G.1 aGonzalez, I.1 aSanz, B.1 aHernandez, P.E.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1996 July, v. 44, no. 7 p.1756-1761x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf950625u3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01881naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001300137245011000150300001800260500001500278520075900293650002601052650001701078650002601095650003801121650001601159653001501175700002001190700001901210700001701229700001501246773010101261852000901362856007701371930003301448945001301481946001301494655001201507IND2053431320221118041123.0961007e199605  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205343132DNAL7 a10.1021/jf950673e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, T.10aDevelopment of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for a broad spectrum triazole fungicide: hexaconazole  ap. 1352-1356.  a2019-12-04  aPolyclonal antibodies were produced against 5-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-hydroxy-6-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)hexanoic acid (hexaconazole-hapten) conjugated to bovine serum albumin.

A 10% aroma recovery appeared to be suitable for the efficient concentration of strawberry pulp. 3astrawberries 3afruit juices 3afruit pulp 3aodors 3avolatile compounds1 aLee, S.H.0 tJournal of food quality.g1992 Oct., v. 15, no. 5 p.321-332wJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04670naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100001500189245012100204300001800325500002400343500001500367520231200382650002102694650001002715650001602725650002402741650002502765650001602790650001202806650003102818650003302849650001502882650000902897650002102906650001302927650001902940650002302959650001002982650001102992650004503003650002103048650006003069650005903129650006303188650003703251650001103288650002203299650002803321650001403349650003303363650001403396650003303410650001003443650001603453651001803469653001803487653002203505653002303527700001503550700001403565700001403579700001403593773010903607852000903716856009203725930003303817945002503850946001303875655001203888IND4443395320221118035920.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444339532DNAL7 a215355162pmid7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01783.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ502 0aQ4021 aHong, J.H.10aImpacts of Glutathione Maillard Reaction Products on Sensory Characteristics and Consumer Acceptability of Beef Soup  ap. S427-S434.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe sensory characteristics and consumer acceptability of beef soup with added glutathione Maillard reaction products (GMRPs) were investigated to examine the effects of the GMRPs on beef-soup flavor compared to soups made with glutathione (GSH) and monosodium glutamate (MSG), a control (CON), or a control soup made with 150% beef content (CON150). The sensory characteristics of the beef soups were examined by descriptive analysis. The overall acceptabilities of the beef soups were rated by consumers. Principal component analysis was performed on descriptive data as explanatory variables with overall acceptability as a supplementary variable to observe the relationships between the descriptive data and consumer acceptability, as well as the relationships between the beef-soup samples and their sensory attributes. The samples containing GMRPs had "beef flavor" that was stronger than the CON and MSG samples, and comparable to that of the GSH sample and CON150. The GMRP samples had stronger "green onion flavor,""garlic flavor," and "boiled egg white flavor" than the other samples. The beef soup containing MSG was preferred to CON, CON150, and GSH. The samples with GMRPs were least favored because of their pronounced metallic and astringent notes. The results of this study imply the feasibility of GMRPs as a flavor enhancer since the soups containing these compounds showed more complex flavor profiles than GSH. However, future studies are required to optimize the MR conditions that produce GMRPs without undesirable characteristics. Practical Application: This study examined the practicability of the Maillard reaction products between glutathione (GSH) and glucose (GP) or fructose (FP) as a flavor enhancer by investigating the sensory characteristics and consumer acceptability evoked by them in a beef-soup system. This study helps flavor and food industry to develop a new flavor enhancer by providing practical information, such as beef flavor-enhancing effect of FP and GP compared to that by increasing beef content or adding GSH or MSG. In addition, it is expected that the outcome of this study, such as sensory attributes of and consumer responses to GSH Maillard reaction products, compliments previous studies that mostly focused on chemical analysis of Maillard reaction. 3aflavor enhancers 3asoups 3aglutathione 3aconsumer acceptance 3amonosodium glutamate 3aoff flavors 3aglucose 3aMaillard reaction products 3aprincipal component analysis 3aflavorings 3abeef 3aflavor compounds 3afructose 3afood additives 3afood acceptability 2aAdult 2aFemale 2aFlavoring Agentsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFood Preferences 2aFructosexanalogs & derivativesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aGlucosexanalogs & derivativesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aGlutathionexanalogs & derivativesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aHot Temperaturexadverse effects 2aHumans 2aMaillard Reaction 2aMeat Productsxanalysis 2aOdorants. 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aSensation 2aSodium Glutamatexmetabolism 2aTaste 2aYoung Adult 0aKorea (South) 0ameat products 0aMaillard reaction 0asensory properties1 aJung, D.W.1 aKim, Y.S.1 aLee, S.M.1 aKim, K.O.0 tJournal of food science.g2010 Oct., v. 75, no. 8 p.S427-S434dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01783.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/14  aOther US 7aarticle04388naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100001700189245012300206300001800329500002400347500001500371520220700386650002302593650001702616650002302633650001702656650000902673650001302682650002302695650001502718650001602733650001002749650001902759650001502778650001902793650001402812650002302826650002402849650001202873650001002885650002502895650002302920650001102943650001702954650002802971650001802999650001103017650000903028650001403037650002503051650001603076650002403092650002403116650001003140650004103150651001003191653001803201653002303219653002303242700001903265700001903284700002203303773010903325852000903434856009203443930003303535945002503568946001303593655001203606IND4443395120221118035802.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444339512DNAL7 a215355142pmid7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01780.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ126 0aQ5061 aGiri, Anupam10aHeadspace Volatiles along with Other Instrumental and Sensory Analyses as Indices of Maturation of Horse Mackerel Miso  ap.

The critical ripening time was estimated by quantitative and/or qualitative analyses of volatile compounds, peptides, amino acids, product color, and total phenolics of the fish miso matrix throughout fermentation. The results confirmed that the application of koji for the fermentation of horse mackerel meat to produce fish miso significantly reduced the fishy off odor and promoted the development of highly acceptable fish miso with a nutty, cheesy, and fruity aroma. Ethyl acetate, ethyl heptanoate, ethyl decanoate, 2-methylpropanal, 3-methylbutanal, 2,3-butanedione, dimethyl trisulfide, and 3-(methylthio) propanal were identified as key odor-active compounds in fish miso prepared from horse mackerel meat. Among the volatiles, 2-methylpropanal, 3-methylbutanal, and 2,3-butanedione were identified to serve as potential indicators of the maturation of fish miso. Amino acid content could also be a potential indicator of maturation of protein-rich, fermented products such as fish miso. In addition, surface color analysis of fish miso revealed a high correlation between sensory attributes and color components. Specifically, r and b values were considered potential indicators of maturation. Practical Application: Variability is a major drawback in fermented products such as fish miso and it requires establishing the optimum ripening time, defined as that providing the aroma attributes qualitatively and quantitatively mostly appreciated by consumers. We have carried out this work for comprehensive determination of the critical ripening time by applying several instrumental and sensory tools including quantitative and/or qualitative analysis of volatile compounds, peptides, amino acids, product color, and total phenolics of the fish miso matrix throughout the fermentation period. The outcome of the present study can be efficiently applied for detection of maturation in similar types of fermented product for large-scale production. 3atemporal variation 3afermentation 3aheadspace analysis 3aolfactometry 3akoji 3apeptides 3afood acceptability 3afatty fish 3aamino acids 3acolor 3aodor compounds 3afish paste 3afermented fish 3aoff odors 3aphenolic compounds 2aAldehydesxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aColor 2aCondimentsxanalysis 2aDiacetylxanalysis 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aFish Productsxanalysis 2aFood Handling 2aHumans 2aMale 2aOdorants. 2aOryzaxmicrobiology. 2aPerciformes 2aSeedsxmicrobiology 2aSoy Foodsxanalysis 2aTaste 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxanalysis 0aJapan 0aripening time 0avolatile compounds 0asensory properties1 aOkamoto, Akira1 aOkazaki, Emiko1 aOhshima, Toshiaki0 tJournal of food science.g2010 Oct., v. 75, no. 8 p.S406-S417dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01780.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/14  aOther US 7aarticle04331naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100001700180245019600197300001800393500002400411520175200435650001102187650001502198650002002213650001602233650002502249650003002274650002202304650002602326650002202352650002302374650002302397650002302420650001602443650001702459650001402476650001902490650005702509650001802566650009102584650004102675650002802716650007002744650002302814650002402837650002802861650002102889650006702910650003002977650004103007650001803048650002303066650003603089650001703125650002503142653002803167700001903195700002103214700001803235700002003253700001903273773010903292852000903401856009203410930003303502945002503535946001303560655001203573IND4443394520221118035656.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444339452DNAL7 a215355082pmid7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01816.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ1211 aSheu, Sen-Je10aUse of Tuf Gene-Based Primers for the PCR Detection of Probiotic Bifidobacterium Species and Enumeration of Bifidobacteria in Fermented Milk by Cultural and Quantitative Real-Time PCR Methods  ap. M521-M527.  aIncludes references  aDue to the increasing use of bifidobacteria in probiotic products, it is essential to establish a rapid method for the qualitative and quantitative assay of the bifidobacteria in commercial products. In this study, partial sequences of the tuf gene for 18 Bifidobacterium strains belonging to 14 species were determined. Alignment of these sequences showed that the similarities among these Bifidobacterium species were 82.24% to 99.72%. Based on these tuf gene sequences, 6 primer sets were designed for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay of B. animalis subsp. animalis, B. animalis subsp. lactis, B. bifidum, B. breve, B. longum subsp. infantis, B. longum subsp. longum, and the genus of Bifidobacterium, respectively. These Bifidobacterium species are common probiotic species present in dairy and probiotic products. When each target Bifidobacterium spp. was assayed with the designed primers, PCR product with expected size was generated. In addition, for each target species, more than 70 bacterial strains other than the target species, including strains of other Bifidobacterium species, strains of Lactobacillus spp., Enterococcus spp., and other bacterial species, all generated negative results. PCR assay with primers specific to B. animalis subsp. lactis and B. longum subsp. longum confirmed the presence of these Bifidobacterium species in commercial yogurt products. In addition, for each product, enumeration of the bifidobacteria cells by culture method with BIM-25 agar and the quantitative real-time PCR showed similar cell counts. Such results indicated that within 15-d storage (4 °C) after manufacture, all the bifidobacteria cells originally present in yogurt products were viable and culturable during the storage. 3ayogurt 3aprobiotics 3aBifidobacterium 3aDNA primers 3anucleotide sequences 3apolymerase chain reaction 3afood microbiology 3aquantitative analysis 3aspecies diversity 3asequence alignment 3amicrobial genetics 3astrain differences 3aplate count 3astorage time 3aviability 2aBacterial Load 2aBacterial Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aBifidobacteriumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aCultured Milk Productsxmicrobiology 2aDatabases, Nucleic Acid 2aLactobacillaceaexgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aLimit of Detection 2aMicrobial Viability 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Typing 2aPeptide Elongation Factor Tuxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aProbioticsxisolation & purification 2aRefrigeration 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aTime Factors 2aYogurtxmicrobiology 0amolecular sequence data1 aHwang, Wen-Zhe1 aChiang, Yu-Cheng1 aLin, Wen-Hsin1 aChen, Hsin-Chih1 aTsen, Hau-Yang0 tJournal of food science.g2010 Oct., v. 75, no. 8 p.M521-M527dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01816.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/14  aOther US 7aarticle03021naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100002100180245011500201300001800316500002400334520110800358650002901466650001101495650001201506650001601518650002601534650002801560650002301588650001701611650001401628650002101642650002701663650002401690650001701714650002201731650001301753650002401766650001601790650001301806650010001819650002101919653002001940700002101960700001501981700001901996700002002015700002002035700002002055700001902075700002002094773010902114852000902223856009202232930003302324945002502357946001302382655001202395IND4443394320221118035717.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444339432DNAL7 a215355062pmid7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01789.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ1201 aShigematsu, Toru10aIsolation and Characterization of Barosensitive Mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Obtained by UV Mutagenesis  ap. M509-M514.  aIncludes references  aUsing UV mutagenesis, 2 high-pressure (HP) sensitive (barosensitive) mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were obtained. The HP inactivation of the mutants, as well as their parent strains, followed 1st-order kinetics in the range of 175 to 250 MPa within 600 s. Both mutants showed larger 1st-order inactivation rate constant values or significant loss of viabilities, compared with their parent strains in the pressure range tested. The inactivation rate constant value of one of the mutants was comparable with that of a previously reported highly barosensitive strain, which was generated by deletion of hsp104 in a trehalose deficient strain. The activation volume values of HP inactivation reactions in the 2 mutants were apparently equivalent with those of their parent strains. This suggested that the mutation did not bring drastic volume changes of the key molecules for HP inactivation. Their auxotrophic properties, growth, and ethanol fermentation were identical in mutant and parent strains. The mutants could therefore be useful for fermentations where control by HP processing is desired. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3ayeasts 3amutants 3amutagenesis 3aultraviolet radiation 3ahigh pressure treatment 3astrain differences 3ainactivation 3aviability 3amicrobial growth 3aalcoholic fermentation 2aEthanolxmetabolism 2aFermentation 2aFood Microbiology 2aKinetics 2aMicrobial Viability 2aMutagenesis 2aPressure 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aUltraviolet Rays 0abarosensitivity1 aNasuhara, Yusuke1 aNagai, Gen1 aNomura, Kazuki1 aIkarashi, Kenta1 aHirayama, Masao1 aHayashi, Mayumi1 aUeno, Shigeaki1 aFujii, Tomoyuki0 tJournal of food science.g2010 Oct., v. 75, no. 8 p.M509-M514dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01789.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/13  aOther US 7aarticle03613naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100001400189245008500203300001800288500002400306500001500330520125700345650002101602650001101623650002201634650002001656650002501676650001901701650002501720650002001745650002301765650002101788650002301809650001401832650002201846650009001868650002801958650004601986650002102032650003702053650003202090650007402122650003602196650002102232650001102253650001502264650002102279650003002300650002602330650007202356653001902428653003502447700001502482700001602497700001402513700001302527700001802540700001202558700001602570773010902586852000902695856009202704930003302796945002502829946001302854655001202867IND4443393620221118035715.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444339362DNAL7 a215354992pmid7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01781.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aT2001 aLi, Yuhua10aModified Apple Polysaccharides Could Induce Apoptosis in Colorectal Cancer Cells  ap.

We, therefore, extracted modified apple polysaccharides (MAP) from apple and hypothesized that MAP have a cancer-preventive effect as do other ingredients of apple. Three human colorectal cancer cell lines: SW-1116, HT-29, and Caco-2 were exposed to different concentrations of MAP (0% to 0.1%). Inhibition of cell proliferation was measured by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. DNA fragmentation was visualized by agarose-gel electrophoresis. The amount of apoptotic cells was assessed by flow cytometry, and protein level of caspase 3, 8, 9, Bax, and Bcl-2 was evaluated by Western blot. At the concentrations of 0.01% to 0.1%, MAP showed growth-inhibiting and apoptosis-inducing effects on cancer cells. It increased the expression of caspase 3, 8, 9, and Bax, while decreased of Bcl-2, which denoted that MAP may induce apoptosis through both the mitochondrial-mediated and death receptor-mediated apoptotic ways. These data indicate that MAP has the potential for clinical prevention and treatment for colon cancer. 3ahuman cell lines 3aapples 3aDNA fragmentation 3aanimal proteins 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aflow cytometry 3abiochemical pathways 3apolysaccharides 3acell proliferation 3aapplication rate 3achemical structure 3aapoptosis 3aprotective effect 2aAntineoplastic Agents, Phytogenicxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aApoptosis Regulatory Proteinsxmetabolism 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aColorectal Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxmetabolismxprevention & control. 2aDNA Fragmentationxdrug effects 2aFruitxchemistry 2aHumans 2aHydrolysis 2aMalusxchemistry 2aMonosaccharidesxanalysis 2aOsmolar Concentration 2aPolysaccharidesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 0acultured cells 0amodified apple polysaccharides1 aNiu, Yinbo1 aWu, Huanjie1 aSun, Yang1 aLi, Qian1 aKong, Xianghe1 aLiu, Li1 aMei, Qibing0 tJournal of food science.g2010 Oct., v. 75, no. 8 p.H224-H229dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01781.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/14  aOther US 7aarticle03176naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180072000900189100003400198245011700232300001800349500002400367500001500391520119200406650002501598650001101623650001601634650001701650650001301667650002301680650001701703650001201720650001701732650002101749650001101770650001501781650001501796650001201811650003101823650003101854650003401885650001701919650002001936650003201956650002101988650002202009650003902031650002002070651001202090653002602102700002302128700002402151700002802175700001802203773010902221852000902330856009202339930003302431945002502464946001302489655001202502IND4443393120221118035827.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444339312DNAL7 a215354942pmid7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01798.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ106 0aQ506 0aQ1161 aThorarinsdottir, Kristin Anna14aThe Effects of Presalting Methods from Injection to Pickling, on the Yields of Heavily Salted Cod (Gadus morhua)  ap. E544-E551.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe production of heavy-salted cod (Bacalao) has changed from being a single-step process (kench) salting to a multistep procedure varying between producers and countries. Presalting by injection, brining, or pickling is increasingly applied prior to pile (dry) salting. This article describes the effects of different presalting methods (injection and brining, brining only, and pickling) on yield and chemical composition of salted cod fillets, in comparison to a single-kench salting step. The procedures used influenced the weight yields and chemical composition of the products. Injection was significantly different from other methods in increasing weight yields throughout brining, dry salting, and rehydration. The yield of nitrogenous compounds tended to be lower for injected and brine-salted fillets, mainly due to higher losses of nonprotein nitrogen. Salting procedures for cod have changed rapidly in recent years. Injection is increasingly used as a presalting method. It has been suggested to have strong effects on weight yields of salted cod products. This article describes the effects of injection on weight yields on products in salted, rehydrated, and cooked stage. 3achemical composition 3aweight 3asalted fish 3aGadus morhua 3apickling 3anitrogen compounds 3apretreatment 3abrining 3afish fillets 3afood composition 3ayields 3acod (fish) 2aAlgorithms 2aAnimals 2aDietary Proteinsxanalysis 2aFood Preservationxmethods 2aFood Preservativesxchemistry 2aGadus morhua 2aHot Temperature 2aMuscle, Skeletalxchemistry 2aSaltsxchemistry 2aSeafoodxanalysis 2aSodium Chloride, Dietaryxanalysis 2aWaterxanalysis 0aIceland 0aprocessing technology1 aArason, Sigurjón.1 aThorkelsson, Gudjon1 aSigurgisladottir, Sjofn1 aTornberg, Eva0 tJournal of food science.g2010 Oct., v. 75, no. 8 p.E544-E551dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01798.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/13  aOther US 7aarticle03750naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100002400189245008000213300001800293500002400311500001500335520118600350650002901536650002201565650001901587650002601606650002101632650002101653650002301674650001901697650001401716650002601730650001701756650001901773650002701792650002601819650002301845650005201868650003701920650002501957650003901982650002002021650003502041650001902076650004502095650002702140650002502167650002902192650003502221650002402256650002802280650004102308650004002349650002302389650002102412650001902433650004002452653001402492653002502506700002702531700003202558700002502590700002302615700002502638773010902663852000902772856009202781930003302873945002502906946001302931655001202944IND4443393320221118035804.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444339332DNAL7 a215354962pmid7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2009.01502.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ300 0aQ2001 aCamilloto, Geany P.10aEffect of Active Packaging Incorporated with Triclosan on Bacteria Adhesion  ap.

The antimicrobial efficacy, the hydrophobicity, microscopic and the mechanical characteristics of the films, as well free energy of adhesion between bacteria and antimicrobial films were evaluated. It was observed that both polyethylene and cellulose based films incorporated with the antimicrobial were homogeneous. Furthermore, the addition of triclosan did not affect mechanical characteristics of the films (P > 0.05). However, triclosan incorporated into polyethylene films reduced its hydrophobicity while antimicrobial cellulose based films became more hydrophobic. The adhesion was thermodynamically favorable between tested bacteria and polyethylene films. On the other hand, the adhesion to triclosan cellulose based film was thermodynamically unfavorable to Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and favorable to Listeria innocua and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Polyethylene and cellulose based films showed inhibitory effect against S. aureus and E. coli, being the inhibition halo higher for polyethylene films. This study improves the knowledge about antimicrobial films. 3aantimicrobial properties 3afilms (materials) 3amicrostructure 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aEscherichia coli 3aListeria innocua 3abacterial adhesion 3afood packaging 3acellulose 3amechanical properties 3apolyethylene 3ahydrophobicity 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aanti-infective agents 3athermal properties 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aBacterial Adhesionxdrug effects 2aCellulosexchemistry 2aDisk Diffusion Antimicrobial Tests 2aElastic Modulus 2aEscherichia colixdrug effects 2aFood Packaging 2aHydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions 2aListeriaxdrug effects 2aMechanical Phenomena 2aMicroscopy, Atomic Force 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aPolyethylenexchemistry 2aPseudomonas aeruginosaxdrug effects 2aStaphylococcus aureusxdrug effects 2aSurface Properties 2aTensile Strength 2aThermodynamics 2aTriclosanxchemistryxpharmacology. 0atriclosan 0aantimicrobial agents1 aPires, Ana Clarissa S.1 aSoares, Nilda de Fátima F.1 aAraújo, Emiliane A.1 aAndrade, Nélio J.1 aFerreira, Sukarno O.0 tJournal of food science.g2010 Oct., v. 75, no. 8 p.E557-E564dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2009.01502.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110113b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/13  aOther US 7aarticle03879naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072000900162100002300171245014800194300001800342500010400360500002400464500001500488520146200503650001801965650003001983650001802013650002102031650002602052650002502078650002102103650002502124650001902149650001902168650001702187650002202204650002202226650002102248650001102269650004702280650002502327650002002352650005002372650002902422650005702451650004102508650002202549653003002571653002802601653002802629653001402657653001902671653001702690653003302707700002102740700002702761700001802788700002302806700002402829700002102853773010802874852000902982856008302991930003303074945002503107946001303132655001203145IND4443370020221118035711.0101015e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444337002DNAL7 a209233542pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI-05-10-01052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8331 aWright, Kathryn M.14aThe N-Terminal Domain of PMTV TGB1 Movement Protein Is Required for Nucleolar Localization, Microtubule Association, and Long-Distance Movement  ap. 1486-1497.  aIn the special issue: Cell biology of plant-virus interactions / edited by Biao Ding and John Carr.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe triple-gene-block (TGB)1 protein of Potato mop-top virus (PMTV) was fused to fluorescent proteins and expressed in epidermal cells of Nicotiana benthamiana under the control of the 35S promoter. TGB1 fluorescence was observed in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and nucleolus and occasionally associated with microtubules. When expressed from a modified virus (PMTV.YFP-TGB1) which formed local lesions but was not competent for systemic movement, yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-TGB1 labeled plasmodesmata in cells at the leading edge of the lesion and plasmodesmata, microtubules, nuclei, and nucleoli in cells immediately behind the leading edge. Deletion of 84 amino acids from the N-terminus of unlabeled TGB1 within the PMTV genome abolished movement of viral RNA to noninoculated leaves. When the same deletion was introduced into PMTV.YFP-TGB1, labeling of microtubules and nucleoli was abolished. The N-terminal 84 amino acids of TGB1 were fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and expressed in epidermal cells where GFP localized strongly to the nucleolus (not seen with unfused GFP), indicating that these amino acids contain a nucleolar localization signal; the fusion protein did not label microtubules. This is the first report of nucleolar and microtubule association of a TGB movement protein. The results suggest that PMTV TGB1 requires interaction with nuclear components and, possibly, microtubules for long-distance movement of viral RNA. 3aplant viruses 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aplasmodesmata 3aprotein subunits 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aPotato mop-top virus 3aactive transport 3aamino acid sequences 3aviral proteins 3acell nucleolus 3amicrotubules 3aprotein transport 3aepidermis (plant) 3apromoter regions 3aleaves 2aActive Transport, Cell Nucleusxphysiology 2aBiological Transport 2aCells, Cultured 2aGene Expression Regulation, Viralxphysiology 2aMicrotubulesxphysiology 2aPlant Viral Movement Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Virusesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTobaccoxcytology 0atriple-gene-block protein 0aviral movement proteins 0amolecular sequence data 0acytoplasm 0avirus movement 0acell nucleus 0aprotein localization signals1 aCowan, Graham H.1 aLukhovitskaya, Nina I.1 aTilsner, Jens1 aRoberts, Alison G.1 aSavenkov, Eugene I.1 aTorrance, Lesley0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2010 Nov., v. 23, no. 11 p.1486-1497dAPS Pressx0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-05-10-01053Available from publisher's Web site  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/09  aOther US 7aarticle04262naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072000900162072000900171072000900180100002100189245016500210300001800375500010400393500002400497500001500521520175900536650003202295650002202327650002502349650001102374650001602385650001302401650001502414650002002429650002202449650002302471650002302494650003102517650002602548650001302574650003002587650002302617650003402640650001202674650003102686650001902717650005002736650002002786650002802806650005202834650004202886650000902928650002502937650001702962650005902979650003703038653002003075700002203095700002303117700002003140700002003160700002103180700002003201773010803221852000903329856008303338930003303421945002503454946001303479655001203492IND4443369320221118035915.0101015e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444336932DNAL7 a209233522pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI-05-10-01172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF833 0aF500 0aF6001 aHöller, Kerstin10aEnhanced Glutathione Metabolism Is Correlated with Sulfur-Induced Resistance in Tobacco mosaic virus–Infected Genetically Susceptible Nicotiana tabacum Plants  ap. 1448-1459.  aIn the special issue: Cell biology of plant-virus interactions / edited by Biao Ding and John Carr.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSulfur-induced resistance, also known as sulfur-enhanced defense (SIR/SED) was investigated in Nicotiana tabacum cv. Samsun nn during compatible interaction with Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in correlation with glutathione metabolism. To evaluate the influence of sulfur nutritional status on virus infection, tobacco plants were treated with nutrient solutions containing either sufficient sulfate (+S) or no sulfate (−S). Sufficient sulfate supply resulted in a suppressed and delayed symptom development and diminished virus accumulation over a period of 14 days after inoculation as compared with −S conditions. Expression of the defense marker gene PR-1a was markedly upregulated in sulfate-treated plants during the first day after TMV inoculation. The occurrence of SIR/SED correlated with a higher level of activity of sulfate assimilation, cysteine, and glutathione metabolism in plants treated with sulfate. Additionally, two key genes involved in cysteine and glutathione biosynthesis (encoding adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate reductase and γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, respectively) were upregulated within the first day after TMV inoculation under +S conditions. Sulfate withdrawal from the soil was accelerated at the beginning of the infection, whereas it declined in the long term, leading to an accumulation of sulfur in the soil of plants grown with sulfate. This observation could be correlated with a decrease in sulfur contents in TMV-infected leaves in the long term. In summary, this is the first study that demonstrates a link between the activation of cysteine and glutathione metabolism and the induction of SIR/SED during a compatible plant-virus interaction in tobacco plants, indicating a general mechanism behind SIR/SED. 3asigns and symptoms (plants) 3avirus replication 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3asulfur 3aglutathione 3asulfates 3abiomarkers 3agene expression 3aNicotiana tabacum 3adisease resistance 3anutrient solutions 3agene expression regulation 3aamino acid metabolism 3acysteine 3aglutamate-cysteine ligase 3ainduced resistance 3apathogenesis-related proteins 3atobacco 3aadenylyl-sulfate reductase 3adisease course 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxphysiology 2aGenetic Markers 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aPlant Diseasesxprevention & controlxvirology. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSoil 2aSulfurxpharmacology 2aTime Factors 2aTobaccoxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolismxvirology. 2aTobacco Mosaic Virusxphysiology 0aplant nutrition1 aKirály, Lóránt1 aKünstler, András1 aMüller, Maria.1 aGullner, Gábor1 aFattinger, Maria1 aZechmann, Bernd0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2010 Nov., v. 23, no. 11 p.1448-1459dAPS Pressx0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-05-10-01173Available from publisher's Web site  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/09  aOther US 7aarticle05253naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174072000900183072000900192100002300201245004100224300001600265500002400281500001500305520299600320650001703316650002703333650001003360650001103370650001703381650001303398650002003411650002403431650002203455650001003477650002203487650001203509650001903521650001603540650002103556650002303577650001303600650002303613650002503636650002003661650001303681650001203694650003803706650001103744650002603755650002603781650004303807650000903850650003903859653001203898653002303910653005003933653001603983653001903999700002504018700001304043700001704056700002204073700002204095700001604117700002004133773011804153852000904271856008604280930003304366945002504399946001104424655001204435IND4443375120221118035911.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444337512DNAL7 a207279702pmid7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2010.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL001 0aF821 0aK0011 aBlomquist, Gary J.10aPheromone production in bark beetles  ap. 699-712.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe first aggregation pheromone components from bark beetles were identified in 1966 as a mixture of ipsdienol, ipsenol and verbenol. Since then, a number of additional components have been identified as both aggregation and anti-aggregation pheromones, with many of them being monoterpenoids or derived from monoterpenoids. The structural similarity between the major pheromone components of bark beetles and the monoterpenes found in the host trees, along with the association of monoterpenoid production with plant tissue, led to the paradigm that most if not all bark beetle pheromone components were derived from host tree precursors, often with a simple hydroxylation producing the pheromone. In the 1990s there was a paradigm shift as evidence for de novo biosynthesis of pheromone components began to accumulate, and it is now recognized that most bark beetle monoterpenoid aggregation pheromone components are biosynthesized de novo. The bark beetle aggregation pheromones are released from the frass, which is consistent with the isoprenoid aggregation pheromones, including ipsdienol, ipsenol and frontalin, being produced in midgut tissue. It appears that exo-brevocomin is produced de novo in fat body tissue, and that verbenol, verbenone and verbenene are produced from dietary α-pinene in fat body tissue. Combined biochemical, molecular and functional genomics studies in Ips pini yielded the discovery and characterization of the enzymes that convert mevalonate pathway intermediates to pheromone components, including a novel bifunctional geranyl diphosphate synthase/myrcene synthase, a cytochrome P450 that hydroxylates myrcene to ipsdienol, and an oxidoreductase that interconverts ipsdienol and ipsdienone to achieve the appropriate stereochemistry of ipsdienol for pheromonal activity. Furthermore, the regulation of these genes and their corresponding enzymes proved complex and diverse in different species. Mevalonate pathway genes in pheromone producing male I. pini have much higher basal levels than in females, and feeding induces their expression. In I. duplicatus and I. pini, juvenile hormone III (JH III) induces pheromone production in the absence of feeding, whereas in I. paraconfusus and I. confusus, topically applied JH III does not induce pheromone production. In all four species, feeding induces pheromone production. While many of the details of pheromone production, including the site of synthesis, pathways and knowledge of the enzymes involved are known for Ips, less is known about pheromone production in Dendroctonus. Functional genomics studies are under way in D. ponderosae, which should rapidly increase our understanding of pheromone production in this genus. This chapter presents a historical development of what is known about pheromone production in bark beetles, emphasizes the genomic and post-genomic work in I. pini and points out areas where research is needed to obtain a more complete understanding of pheromone production. 3abark beetles 3aaggregation pheromones 3amales 3amidgut 3aalpha-pinene 3afat body 3agene expression 3aenzymatic reactions 3aenzyme substrates 3afrass 3ajuvenile hormones 3afemales 3aphytochemicals 3ahost plants 3acytochrome P-450 3achemical structure 3aIps pini 3agender differences 3abiochemical pathways 3aoxidoreductases 3agenomics 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aHistory, 20th Century 2aHistory, 21st Century 2aInsect Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aPheromonesxbiosynthesisxhistory. 0aenzymes 0aliterature reviews 0ageranyl diphosphate synthase/myrcene synthase 0aisoprenoids 0amonoterpenoids1 aFigueroa-Teran, Rubi1 aAw, Mory1 aSong, Minmin1 aGorzalski, Andrew1 aAbbott, Nicole L.1 aChang, Eric1 aTittiger, Claus0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2010 Oct., v. 40, no. 10 p.699-712dElsevier Sciencex0965-17487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2010.07.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/07  aNon-US 7aarticle03726naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174072000900183100001900192245013200211300001600343500002400359520154300383650002101926650001401947650001901961650002201980650002302002650002002025650002502045650002502070650002402095650001502119650002202134650002402156650002002180650001002200650001202210650002202222650001202244650005702256650002502313650006102338650005402399650006202453650002802515650004102543650001402584650002602598653002202624653002302646700002602669700002002695700001902715700002402734773011802758852000902876856008602885930003302971945002503004946001103029655001203040IND4443376520221118040028.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444337652DNAL7 a206917822pmid7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2010.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL003 0aL2001 aWang, Hong-Lei10aNeofunctionalization in an ancestral insect desaturase lineage led to rare Δ6 pheromone signals in the Chinese tussah silkworm  ap. 742-751.  aIncludes references  aThe Chinese tussah silkworm, Antheraea pernyi (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae) produces a rare dienoic sex pheromone composed of (E,Z)-6,11-hexadecadienal, (E,Z)-6,11-hexadecadienyl acetate and (E,Z)-4,9-tetradecadienyl acetate, and for which the biosynthetic routes are yet unresolved. By means of gland composition analyses and in vivo labeling we evidenced that pheromone biosynthesis towards the immediate dienoic gland precursor, the (E,Z)-6,11-hexadecadienoic acid, involves desaturation steps with Δ6 and Δ11 regioselectivity. cDNA cloning of pheromone gland desaturases and heterologous expression in yeast demonstrated that the 6,11-dienoic pheromone is generated from two biosynthetic routes implicating a Δ6 and Δ11 desaturase duo albeit with an inverted reaction order. The two desaturases first catalyze the formation of the (E)-6-hexadecenoic acid or (Z)-11-hexadecenoic acid, key mono-unsaturated biosynthetic intermediates. Subsequently, each enzyme is able to produce the (E,Z)-6,11-hexadecadienoic acid by accommodating its non-respective mono-unsaturated product. Besides elucidating an unusually flexible pheromone biosynthetic pathway, our data provide the first identification of a biosynthetic Δ6 desaturase involved in insect mate communication. The occurrence of this novel Δ6 desaturase function is consistent with an evolutionary scenario involving neo-functionalization of an ancestral desaturase belonging to a gene lineage different from the Δ11 desaturases commonly involved in moth pheromone biosynthesis. 3aAntheraea pernyi 3asilkworms 3asex pheromones 3ainsect pheromones 3agender differences 3aexocrine glands 3achemical composition 3abiochemical pathways 3adienoic fatty acids 3aoxygenases 3acomplementary DNA 3aenzymatic reactions 3aenzyme activity 3amales 3afemales 3aenzyme substrates 2aAnimals 2aBombyxxchemistryxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFatty Acid Desaturasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aInsect Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aInsectaxchemistryxclassificationxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPheromonesxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aPhylogeny 2aSubstrate Specificity 0adelta6-desaturase 0adelta11-desaturase1 aLiénard, Marjorie A.1 aZhao, Cheng-Hua1 aWang, Chen-Zhu1 aLöfstedt, Christer0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2010 Oct., v. 40, no. 10 p.742-751dElsevier Sciencex0965-17487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2010.07.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/07  aNon-US 7aarticle03353naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164100002200173245011900195300001600314500002400330520171900354650002002073650001602093650002102109650002202130650001902152650001502171650002502186650002302211650003102234650001702265650001202282650004302294650001102337650003602348650003302384650001102417650003502428650003602463651001202499700001802511700002002529773011102549852000902660856008502669930003302754945002502787946001102812655001202823IND4443374820221118035905.0101015e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444337482DNAL7 a208225622pmid7 a10.1017/S00220299100005432doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 aWerner, Christina10aEfficacy of homeopathic and antibiotic treatment strategies in cases of mild and moderate bovine clinical mastitis  ap. 460-467.  aIncludes references  aThe objective of this clinical control trial was to examine the effectiveness of the classical homeopathic treatment strategy in cases of mild and moderate bovine clinical mastitis in comparison with antibiotic and placebo treatments. Owing to characteristics of the selected herds, only cases of clinical mastitis caused by environmental pathogens and clinical cases with negative bacteriological result in the pre-treatment milk sample were included in the trial. A total of 136 lactating dairy cows with 147 affected quarters from four herds in Germany were randomly allocated to three treatment groups. The cows were examined on days 0, 1, 2 and on days 7, 14, 28 and 56 post initial infection to assess clinical signs. Simultaneously, with the exception of days 1 and 2, quarter milk samples for laboratory examinations (bacteriology, somatic cell count) were collected to assess bacteriological and cytological cure rates. On days 28 and 56, treatment strategies did not differ significantly with respect to the clinical outcomes and the total cure rate in cases of bacteriological negative mastitis (n=56). In cases of pathogen-positive mastitis (n=91), the cure rate after 4 and 8 weeks was similar between the two treatment strategies, homeopathy and antibiotic treatment, but the difference between the homeopathic and the placebo treatment at day 56 was significant (P<0·05). The results indicate a therapeutic effect of homeopathic treatment in cases of mild and moderate clinical mastitis. However, independent of treatment strategy and bacteriological status, the total cure rate was on a low level, revealing limitations in the effectiveness of both antibiotic and homeopathic treatment strategies. 3abovine mastitis 3aantibiotics 3aveterinary drugs 3ahomeopathic drugs 3adisease course 3adairy cows 3alongitudinal studies 3asomatic cell count 3arandomized clinical trials 3adrug therapy 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aCattle 2aCephalosporinsxtherapeutic use 2aCloxacillinxtherapeutic use 2aFemale 2aMastitis, Bovinexdrug therapy 2aMateria Medicaxtherapeutic use 3aGermany1 aSobiraj, Axel1 aSundrum, Albert0 tJournal of dairy research.g2010 Nov., v. 77, no. 4 p.460-467dCambridge University Pressx0022-02997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299100005433Available from publisher's Web site  a20101217b20110101c00000000  aINDd7CTe2010/11/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02303naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010400167300001600271520133100287592002801618650001101646650001101657650002001668650001701688651001001705700001601715700001901731700001701750700001901767773010101786856008101887852000901968655001201977IND60522640420221119144805.0160603e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052264042DNAL7 a10.1007/s11769-016-0814-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Wensheng10aEvolution process of urban spatial pattern in Hubei Province based on DMSP/OLS nighttime light data  ap. 366-376.  aThis paper intends to investigate the urban spatial patterns of Hubei Province and its evolution from three different perspectives: urban nodes, urban connections and urban clusters. The research adopts nighttime light imagery of cities in Hubei Province, the viewpoint of ′point-axis-area′ in the ′point-axis system′ theory, and employs light index model, gravity model and social network analysis. The findings are as follows: 1) In terms of urban nodes, the urbanization process of Hubei has been carried out mainly on the basis of external expansion rather than internal increasing. The polarization trend of urban connection network is strengthening. 2) As for urban connections, the estimation of urban connections using light index model is capable of containing various actual flow, and the connections are getting increasingly closer. 3) In regard to urban groups, seven urban groups of varying sizes have formed. On that basis, three stable and relatively independent urban groups as the centers, namely Wuchang, Yichang and Xiangyang emerge as well. But the structures of ′Wuhan Metropolitan Area′, ′Yichang-Jingzhou-Jingmen City Group′ and ′Xiangyang-Shiyen-Suizhou City Group′, which are defined by local development strategy in Hubei Province, are different from the above three urban groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3amodels 3asocial networks 3aurbanization 3aChina1 aRun, Jiying1 aZhuo, Rongrong1 aJiang, Yupei1 aWang, Xiaofang0 tChinese geographical science.g2016 June, v. 26, no. 3 p.366-376dScience Pressx1002-00637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11769-016-0814-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03545naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245017300170300001600343520186000359592002802219650002702247650001102274650001102285650001602296650001802312650001102330650001102341650001002352650002102362650002602383650002502409650003302434650002002467650000902487650000902496650002402505650001002529650002202539653001502561653003002576653002002606653003302626653001702659700001802676700001602694700001902710700001902729700001502748773013302763856008602896852000902982655001202991IND60629811920221121052748.0190410e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062981192DNAL7 a10.1016/S1002-0160(17)60475-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Meijun,10aPersistence of Cry1Ac Protein from Transgenic Bt Cotton Cultivation and Residue Returning in Fields and Its Effect on Functional Diversity of Soil Microbial Communities  ap. 114-122.  aThe persistence of Cry1Ac protein in the soil and its effect on soil microbial communities are a core issue in assessing the ecological risk of transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton. In this study a field experiment was conducted on the cultivation of transgenic Bt cotton (Jin 26 and BtJi 668) with the immediate returning of residues to the fields, in order to quantify the Cry1Ac protein content in the fields and investigate its effects on the functional diversity of soil microbial communities. Cry1Ac protein in the residue-soil mixture was gradually degraded in the transgenic Bt cotton fields. After transgenic Bt cotton straw was returned to the fields for 30 d, 63.73% and 58.33% of the initial amounts of Cry1Ac protein were degraded in the Jin 26 and BtJi 668 fields, respectively. Before the crops were sown in the following year (180 d after returning the straw), no Cry1Ac protein was detected in the fields. After returning the cotton straw to the fields for 30 d, the Shannon-Wiener and McIntosh indices of soil microbial communities in the transgenic Bt cotton fields were significantly higher than those in the non-transgenic cotton fields. Meanwhile, the utilization of carbon sources including amino acids, amines, and carbohydrates by the soil microbial communities significantly increased. Both the McIntosh index and the utilization of carbohydrates increased until 180 d. Principal component analysis revealed that amino acids, amides, and carbohydrates were the main carbon sources distinguishing the two principal component factors. These findings indicated that Cry1Ac protein did not accumulate in the fields after transgenic Bt cotton was planted for one year and the residues were immediately returned to the fields; however, the original functional diversity of soil microbial communities was affected continuously.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aamides 3aamines 3aamino acids 3acarbohydrates 3acarbon 3acotton 3acrops 3acrystal proteins 3afield experimentation 3afunctional diversity 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprotein content 3arisk 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 3astraw 3atransgenic plants 0aBiolog GN2 0acarbon source utilization 0adiversity index 0aprincipal component analysis 0astraw return1 aFENG, Meichen1 aXIAO, Lujie1 aSong, Xiaoyan,1 aDING, Guangwei1 aYANG, Wude0 tPedosphere.g2019 Feb., v. 29, no. 1 p.114-122dElsevier LtdaSoil Science Society of ChinawJournal:jnl4085839x1002-01607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(17)60475-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245005700168300001600225500002000241520170800261592002801969650002401997650002102021650001902042650001102061650001202072650001202084650001202096650001302108650001102121650001402132650002602146650000902172650001402181650001602195650001402211650001502225651001102240700001802251700001902269700002302288700002002311773015102331856007802482852000902560655001202569IND60587955920180301000000.0180103e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058795592DNAL7 a10.1002/jpln.2016004552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMyrvang, Mona Bakke14aThe use of carbonatite rock powder as a liming agent  ap. 326-335.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCarbonatite rock powder, originating from the Lillebukt Alkaline Complex at Stjernøy in northern Norway, can potentially be used as a slow‐releasing lime and potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg) fertilizer due to a high concentration of the easily weathered minerals calcite (42%) and biotite (30%). However, the enrichment of barium (Ba) and strontium (Sr) may cause an undesired uptake to plants when carbonatite is applied to agroecosystems. A pot experiment was designed to investigate the liming and fertilization effects of carbonatite and the potential mobilization of Ba and Sr compared to a dolomite lime commonly used in Norwegian agriculture. These liming agents were mixed with a sandy soil applied to different amounts of peat, and the uptake of Ba, Sr, calcium (Ca), Mg, and K by Festuca arundinácea Schreb. Kora (tall fescue) and Trifolium repens L. Milkanova (white clover) was evaluated. The liming agents were generally incapable of buffering the acidifying effect from increased applications of peat, while the plant dry mass was unaffected. Compared to pots given dolomite and soluble K, the availability of K from carbonatite to plants was equally high or higher, and no difference in the K:(Ca + Mg) ratio in plants was observed. Carbonatite was a significant source to plant Ba and Sr, and the uptake seemed to follow the Ca uptake. Addition of peat amplified the uptake of Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, and K to plants, probably an effect of organic acid‐induced weathering of carbonatite. White clover took up Ba, Sr, and Ca more effectively than tall fescue, but the Ba and Sr concentrations in plants were relatively moderate compared to concentrations reported from field investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aTrifolium repens 3aagroecosystems 3abarium 3abiotite 3acalcite 3acalcium 3adolomite 3aliming 3amagnesium 3amagnesium fertilizers 3apeat 3apotassium 3asandy soils 3astrontium 3aweathering 3aNorway1 aHeim, Michael1 aKrogstad, Tore1 aAlmås, Åsgeir R.1 aGjengedal, Elin0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2017 June, v. 180, no. 3 p.326-335dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl64178x1436-87307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.2016004553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01488naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245007400159300001800233520051400251592002800765650001600793650001400809650001600823650002300839650002300862650001800885700002700903700002200930700001900952773010700971856007501078852000901153655001201162IND60578759320180316000000.0170814e20140905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057875932DNAL7 a10.1021/ol50231182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTreder, Adam P.10aSolid-Phase Synthesis of Piperazinones via Disrupted Ugi Condensation  ap. 4674-4677.  aThe first application of aziridine aldehyde dimers in solid-phase synthesis is reported.

DDG was subjected to high-shear and jet-cooking, with or without alkaline pH adjustment and autoclaving. Soluble and insoluble fractions were analyzed for protein, oil and ash. Extracts were analyzed for phenolic acids and antioxidant activity. Protein contents were significantly elevated in the insoluble fractions after treatment and the oil content was drastically increased in the insoluble fraction after high-shear and jet-cooking without pH adjustment. Alkaline pH adjustment resulted in a soluble fraction that was highest in phenolic acids, but not antioxidant activity. The highest antioxidant activity was found in the 50% ethanol extract from DDG that had been subjected to high-shear and jet-cooking. These results suggest that high-shear and jet-cooking may be useful processing treatments to increase the value of DDG by producing fractions high in protein, oil and extractable phenolic acids with high antioxidant activity. The DDG fractions and extracts described herein may be useful as food and nutraceutical ingredients, and, if used for these applications, will increase the value of DDG and ease economic burdens on ethanol producers, allowing them to compete in the bio-fuel marketplace.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprotein content 3acaffeic acid 3aautoclaving 3acorn 3aferulic acid 3abyproducts 3afood processing 3aethanol production 3acorn oil 3apH 3aantioxidant activity 3adistillers grains 3aalkali treatment 3aethanol 3aantioxidants 3aplant proteins 2aAlkalies 2aAntioxidantsxchemistry 2aCooking 2aPhenolsxchemistry 2aPlant Oilsxchemistry 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistry 2aZea maysxchemistry 0acoumaric acids 0acoumaric acid 0aextraction 0adistillers 0agrains 0aphenolic acids1 aChen, D.1 aRose, D.J.1 aBerhow, M.0 tFood science and technology international.g2010 Aug., v. 16, no. 4 p.297-304dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10820132093538213Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/468233Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04030naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011800163300001600281520257200297592002802869650004702897650001502944650001102959650001202970650002002982650001103002650001603013650002103029650002603050650001103076650001503087651001403102653002803116653001003144653000903154653001103163653001803174653002203192653002203214653002503236700001703261700001603278700002603294700002103320773009203341856008203433852000903515655001203524IND60562655820221116213559.0220523e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056265582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2015.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartens, B.10aImproving terrestrial evaporation estimates over continental Australia through assimilation of SMOS soil moisture  ap. 146-162.  aTerrestrial evaporation is an essential variable in the climate system that links the water, energy and carbon cycles over land. Despite this crucial importance, it remains one of the most uncertain components of the hydrological cycle, mainly due to known difficulties to model the constraints imposed by land water availability on terrestrial evaporation. The main objective of this study is to assimilate satellite soil moisture observations from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission into an existing evaporation model. Our over-arching goal is to find an optimal use of satellite soil moisture that can help to improve our understanding of evaporation at continental scales. To this end, the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) is used to simulate evaporation fields over continental Australia for the period September 2010–December 2013. SMOS soil moisture observations are assimilated using a Newtonian Nudging algorithm in a series of experiments. Model estimates of surface soil moisture and evaporation are validated against soil moisture probe and eddy-covariance measurements, respectively. Finally, an analogous experiment in which Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) soil moisture is assimilated (instead of SMOS) allows to perform a relative assessment of the quality of both satellite soil moisture products. Results indicate that the modelled soil moisture from GLEAM can be improved through the assimilation of SMOS soil moisture: the average correlation coefficient between in situ measurements and the modelled soil moisture over the complete sample of stations increased from 0.68 to 0.71 and a statistical significant increase in the correlations is achieved for 17 out of the 25 individual stations. Our results also suggest a higher accuracy of the ascending SMOS data compared to the descending data, and overall higher quality of SMOS compared to AMSR-E retrievals over Australia. On the other hand, the effect of soil moisture data assimilation on the evaporation fields is very mild, and difficult to assess due to the limited availability of eddy-covariance data. Nonetheless, our continental-scale simulations indicate that the assimilation of soil moisture can have a substantial impact on the estimated dynamics of evaporation in water-limited regimes. Progressing towards our goal of using satellite soil moisture to increase understanding of global land evaporation, future research will focus on the global application of this methodology and the consideration of multiple evaporation models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite 3aalgorithms 3acarbon 3aclimate 3aeddy covariance 3aenergy 3aevaporation 3ahydrologic cycle 3amicrowave radiometers 3amodels 3asoil water 3aAustralia 0aTerrestrial evaporation 0aGLEAM 0aSMOS 0aAMSR-E 0aSoil moisture 0aData assimilation 0aNewtonian Nudging 0aAustralian hydrology1 aMiralles, D.1 aLievens, H.1 aFernández-Prieto, D.1 aVerhoest, N.E.C.0 tITC journal.g2016 June, v. 48 p.146-162dElsevier B.V.wJournal:22337x1569-84327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2015.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02651naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245011300175300001600288520102100304592002801325650002901353650002801382650002101410650001201431650001301443650002001456650002401476650002501500650001901525650002901544650001901573650001801592650002001610650002201630650001801652650001501670650000901685650002101694650001501715653001701730653001301747653001301760653001901773653002301792653001901815700002001834700002401854773013501878856008702013852000902100655001202109IND60622693520221122053905.0190131e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062269352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.11.1952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aK., Saral Sarojini10aMahua oil-based polyurethane/chitosan/nano ZnO composite films for biodegradable food packaging applications  ap. 163-174.  aBiodegradable food packaging films were fabricated from Mahua oil-based polyurethane (PU) and chitosan (CS), incorporated with different proportions of zinc oxide nanoparticles. The structure and properties of the solvent-cast films were evaluated. PU/CS with 5% nano ZnO composite film showed improved tensile strength and stiffness. The incorporation of zinc oxide nanoparticles enhanced the antibacterial properties, barrier properties and hydrophobicity of the film. The weight loss of PU/CS/5% nano ZnO biodegradable film was 86% after 28 days in the soil. The shelf life period of carrot pieces wrapped with the composite film was extended up to 9 days. The film containing zinc oxide nanoparticles was effective in reducing the bacterial contamination when compared to the commercial polyethylene film. In essence, the composite film possessed all desirable characteristics to be considered as a food packaging material that has been fabricated from low environmental impact bio-polyol based polyurethane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibacterial properties 3abacterial contamination 3abiodegradability 3acarrots 3achitosan 3acomposite films 3acomposite materials 3aenvironmental impact 3afood packaging 3afood-packaging materials 3ahydrophobicity 3ananoparticles 3apackaging films 3apolyethylene film 3apolyurethanes 3ashelf life 3asoil 3atensile strength 3azinc oxide 0aPolyurethane 0aChitosan 0aNano ZnO 0aComposite film 0aBarrier properties 0aFood packaging1 aM.P., Indumathi1 aG.R., Rajarajeswari0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 124 p.163-174dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.11.1953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03255naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011500168520156500283592002801848650002801876650000801904650001701912650001501929650002901944650001101973650001401984650001101998650001402009650000902023650001702032650001102049650001302060650001502073651001002088653001902098653002702117653001402144653001902158653000902177653000802186653000802194653000702202653000702209653000802216653000802224653000902232653000902241653000802250700001602258700001402274700001502288700001702303700001702320700001802337700001902355700001802374773011802392856008602510852000902596655001202605IND60783412820221122213909.0221004e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078341282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1157582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Xiaoman10aPesticide fate at watershed scale: A new framework integrating multimedia behavior with hydrological processes  aPesticide pollution has been one serious ecological and environmental issue due to its wide application, high toxicity, and complex environmental behavior. The fugacity model has been widely used to quantify biogeochemical cycles of pesticides due to its clear compartments, simple structure, and easy-accessible data. However, the lack of detailed hydrological processes limits its application for large and heterogeneous watershed. In present study, a new framework was proposed through integration of hydrological processes of SWAT and pesticide fate of fugacity model, and was applied into a typical watershed in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China. The results showed that surface runoff, soil erosion, and percolation varied spatiotemporally, which highlighted the importance of considering regional and seasonal heterogeneity of pesticide transport variables in the fugacity model. The amount of dichlorvos (DDV) and chlorpyrifos (CHP) in air, water, soil, and sediment phase were estimated as 0.26 kg, 19.77 kg, 1.06 × 10⁴ kg, and 0.55 kg, respectively. Spatiotemporally, pesticide concentrations in water phase peaked in summer, while the middle and southwest regions of the watershed were identified as the hotspots for pesticide pollution. Compared with the classical model, the new framework provided technical support for the pesticide assessment at watershed scale with heterogeneous hydrological conditions, which can be easily extended to other watersheds, and integrated with other models for comprehensive agricultural management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural management 3aair 3achlorpyrifos 3adichlorvos 3aenvironmental management 3amodels 3apollution 3arunoff 3asediments 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3asummer 3atoxicity 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aPesticide fate 0aHydrological processes 0aWatershed 0aFugacity model 0aSWAT 0aDDV 0aCHP 0aFS 0aGW 0aPR1 0aPR2 0aPSRI 0aPSEI 0aPPI1 aZhang, Ziqi1 aChen, Lei1 aJiao, Cong1 aZhu, Kaihang1 aGuo, Jinsong1 aPang, Mingyue1 aJin, Zhongtian1 aShen, Zhenyao0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 319 p.115758-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1157583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001100147245008400158300001600242520165000258592002801908650002001936650001101956650001101967650002301978650001202001651001002013700001702023700001402040700001402054700001502068700001402083700001802097700001902115773010102134856008102235852000902316655001202325IND60522640620221119145213.0160603e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052264062DNAL7 a10.1007/s11769-016-0808-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yu10aComprehensive evaluation of ski resort development conditions in northern China  ap. 401-409.  aChina′s bid for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games will promote rapid development of domestic ski tourism. More than 10 provinces in the northern China list ski tourism as a new source of growth in the tourism industry. Formulating a scientific evaluation system is an important foundation for ski resort development. By referring to the conditions of existing international ski resorts, a comprehensive index system for evaluating ski resort development was developed based on natural factors, human factors, athletic sports, and popular ski tourism. The system was composed of one target layer, two indices, seven sub-indices and twenty-five basic indices. Based on data collected during a field investigation in 2012 and on a statistical model, the development conditions of the following ski resorts were quantified: Yabuli Ski Resort in Heilongjiang Province and Beidahu Ski Resort in Jilin Province in Northeast China, Wanlong Ski Resort in Hebei Province and Nanshan Ski Resort in Beijing in the northern China, and Silk Road International Ski Resort in Uygur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang in the northwestern China. The resulting index values of development conditions at Beidahu, Yabuli, Wanlong, Nanshan, and Silk Road International Ski Resorts were 0.304, 0.278, 0.270, 0.214, and–0.025, respectively. Various natural and human factors exert positive and negative effects on the development potential of ski resorts. The development conditions of the five ski resorts were inferior to those of first-class international resorts. Therefore, the development conditions of the five ski resorts should be improved with future construction.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3ahumans 3asports 3astatistical models 3atourism 3aChina1 aZhao, Minyan1 aGuo, Peng1 aZheng, Ji1 aLi, Zehong1 aLi, Fujia1 aShi, Yuanyuan1 aDong, Suocheng0 tChinese geographical science.g2016 June, v. 26, no. 3 p.401-409dScience Pressx1002-00637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11769-016-0808-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01781naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245011200161300001600273520049300289592002800782650001700810650004300827650001900870650001400889650004400903650001500947650001300962650002600975653002201001653001801023653001901041653001801060700001401078700001801092700001901110700001701129700001701146700001201163773008201175856008101257852000901338655001201347IND60515199320221122221456.0170124e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051519932DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-016-1010-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMo, Shuli12aA novel o-nitrobenzyl-based photocleavable antitumor prodrug with the capability of releasing 5-fluorourail  ap. 459-467.  aAn o-nitrobenzyl-based photocleavable antitumor prodrug with a terminal carboxyl group was designed and synthesized.

We caught one male in both years. This male remained the whole time in the area where he hatched. We caught his female in 1998 and it remained close to the breeding place. During the non-breeding season — the period between August and February — both partners used the same land section. The home range size (Minimum-Convex-Polygon, 95 %) we determined for the male at 8.0 (1997/98) and 6.2 km² (1998/99), the female used an area of 7,1 km². The monthly home ranges varied between 1.9 and 5.3 km² (male) and 1.4 and 4.4 km² (female). The chronological evolution of the area used by the two sexes was different. Whereas the female was flying over the biggest home range in August during the non-breeding time, this was the time of the smallest home range with the male. With the advancing season (sinking temperatures, first snows) and the reducing availability of prey, the home range were enlarged successively. One important food source was at a compost plant. Lanes and the male's place of hatching represented the main whereabouts. The surrounding areas of arable land were used little. During both non-breeding times we determined the roost place use of the male over a period in each case of 160 nights. While the male spent 18.1 % of all nights away from the place of hatching in 1998/99, it did so only twice (1.3 %) the previous winter. We attribute this to lower temperatures in 1998/99 and see a rudimentary zugun-ruhe. The female slept away from this area only in eleven nights (6.9 %). Two other red kites showed a marked alternation of the roosting place. One female changed her roosting place eight times in 12 nights.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMilvus milvus 3aarable soils 3abreeding sites 3acomposts 3afemales 3aflight 3ahatching 3ahome range 3amales 3aradio 3aroosting behavior 3atelemetry 3atemperature 3awinter 3aGermany1 aStübbe, Michael,1 aHerrmann, Stefan0 tJournal für Ornithologie.g2003 July, v. 144, no. 3 p.284-294dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949854x2193-71927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF024656283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245010600153300002200259520139800281592002801679650001801707650002101725650001301746650002001759650001801779650001701797650001901814650000701833650001601840650001601856700001501872700001401887700001401901773012701915856007402042852000902116655001202125IND60641167320221121043238.0190505e20161110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064116732DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra18773k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Tao10aInactivation of E. coli bacteria ingested by Limnoithona sinensis and Daphnia magna using chloramines  ap. 107323-107330.  aZooplankton may harbor bacteria and protect them from disinfection inactivation while treating drinking water. This has rarely been quantified in research studies using chloramines to inactivate Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria ingested by zooplankton. In this study, chloramines (2 mg L⁻¹) were used to inactivate the internalized E. coli bacteria ingested by zooplankton (Limnoithona sinensis and Daphnia magna). The results showed that both Limnoithona sinensis and Daphnia magna could protect the internalized E. coli against chloramination and the latter could provide stronger protection. The transfer of chloramines, from the bulk water into the guts of zooplankton by ingestion, was inhibited when chloramines were used as disinfectants, reaching the E. coli bacteria in the digestive tract of zooplankton mainly via penetration. The amount of internalized E. coli killed by chloramines increased with the increase in Cₜ values, whereas the quantity of chloramines really affecting the internalized bacteria decreased. It was found that 1.1 log₁₀ reduction of the internalized E. coli in L. sinensis and 1.0 log₁₀ in D. magna were obtained at a Cₜ value of 80 mg min L⁻¹, with less than 40% of the applied disinfection reaching the ingested bacteria. The pH value had an obvious impact on the inactivation effect, whereas the temperature had little influence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteria 3adigestive tract 3adisinfectants 3adisinfection 3adrinking water 3apH 3atemperature 3azooplankton1 aMiao, Gang1 aDing, Lei1 aChen, Wei0 tRSC advances.g2016 Nov. 10, v. 6, no. 109 p.107323-107330dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra18773k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01191naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245008400178300001800262520029400280592002800574650001600602650001300618650001300631650001700644700002100661773009800682856008900780990002300869852000900892655001200901IND60098511120221120052330.0141104e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009851112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.07.10942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTredway, Donald R.10aAnastrozole versus clomiphene citrate: which is better for ovulation induction?  ap. 1549-1551.  aAlthough anastrozole may be used as an oral therapeutic agent in ovulation induction, it is not recommended as a replacement for clomiphene citrate.

Characterizing surface soils for energetic contamination has been conducted extensively in the past. However, deriving mass deposition rates on soils for specific munition-related activities, necessary for determining the cumulative impact of these activities and developing range sustainability models, has been problematic. Factors include determining the energetic residues deposition area, discriminating current deposition from previous activities, separating the residues from the collection matrix, and processing the samples. To circumvent these problems, methods were developed for sampling energetic residues on clean snow surfaces. At firing points, a clean snow surface allows the collection of propellant residues from a known quantity and type of munition. Explosives residues from projectile detonations can be sampled from clean snow- and ice-covered surfaces in active impact areas. Sampling protocols have been optimized and quality assurance procedures have been developed during years of research on munition residues deposition rates. These methods are currently being used in the US, Canada, and Norway for both energetics and metal contaminants with other applications under consideration. This paper describes the current sampling protocol for clean snow surfaces and presents examples of its application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexplosives 3ametals 3amodels 3aquality control 3asnow 3asoil 3asoil pollution 3awater pollution 3aCanada 3aNorway 3aUnited States1 aWalsh, Marianne E.1 aRamsey, Charles A.0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2012 Sept., v. 223, no. 7 p.3689-3699dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-012-1141-5  aDNAL 7aarticle01940naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245005400163300001600217520086900233592002801102650002501130650001201155650000901167650001901176650001101195650002201206650002401228653001801252653001601270653001801286653003201304700001501336700001701351700001401368773008201382856008101464852000901545655001201554IND60515199420221122134958.0170124e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051519942DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-016-1033-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Yanli10aReducing the climate shift in a new coupled model  ap. 488-494.  aClimate drift refers to spurious long-term changes that may be inherent in coupled models when external forcing factors are fixed. Understanding the sources of this drift and tuning the drift are crucial for obtaining reasonable simulations from coupled models. To prepare for the upcoming Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, a new coupled model has been constructed based on the Community Earth System Model and the Grid-point Atmospheric Model of IAP LASG version 2. However, the surface temperature predicted by the new model is too underestimated, and this underestimation is caused by a type of climate drift, i.e., “initial shock.” This study analyzes the source of the cold surface temperature from the perspective of energy balance and attempts to reduce the surface temperature drift by tuning the relative humidity threshold for low cloud.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEarth system science 3aclimate 3acold 3aenergy balance 3amodels 3arelative humidity 3asurface temperature 0aClimate drift 0aCESM-GAMIL2 0aInitial shock 0aRelative humidity threshold1 aLi, Lijuan1 aDong, Wenjie1 aWang, Bin0 tScience bulletin.g2016 Mar., v. 61 p.488-494dElsevier B.V.x2095-92737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-016-1033-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245008200209520111800291592002801409650001601437650001301453650001801466650001001484650001001494650002001504650002401524650001401548650001201562650001201574650001301586651001301599653001601612653003001628653001101658700002701669700003201696700002401728700001901752700002501771700001801796700006001814773009401874856008101968852000902049655001202058IND60725108620221119105221.0210124e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072510862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2019.1044262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmin-Safwan, Adnan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5510-915910aDataset on reproductive status of ovary mud crab at different salinity levels  aThis article investigated how crabs responded to different culture salinities through ovarian maturation stages using combination of external morphology (ovarian coloration and gonadosomatic index), and histological assessment (oocyte structures and diameter sizes).

During mark-recapture sessions, we captured by hand 1,103 individuals over the 3 years 2008–2010 from which only 5 were marble-colored. This color morph’s frequency of occurrence was thus less than 1% within the estimated subadult and adult stone crayfish population. Although many biological papers and determination keys regarding crayfish are based upon analysis of exoskeletal coloration, recent studies have asserted that this characteristic provides unreliable guidance when determining species inasmuch as it easily results in errors because many crayfish species exhibit an extensive variety of color morphs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAstacidae 3aadults 3acolor 3acrayfish 3amorphs 3aCentral European region 3aCzech Republic 0astone crayfish 0acoloration 0amark-recapture 0aestimated population1 aŘímalová-Kadlecová, Kateřina1 aBílý, Michal,1 aKoščo, Ján,0 tBiologia.g2013 June 13, v. 68, no. 4 p.707-711dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-013-0208-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245010500180300001300285520106800298592002801366650001901394650001401413650001601427650001701443650002301460650002101483650001401504653001901518653002701537653002701564653003901591653002301630653002501653700003201678700004301710700003401753700002901787700002901816773013001845856008601975852000902061655001202070IND60629812120221121052749.0190410e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062981212DNAL7 a10.1016/S1002-0160(18)60053-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGARCÍA-SALDAÑA, Arturo10aFertirrigation with Low-Pressure Multi-Gate Irrigation Systems in Sugarcane Agroecosystems: A Review  ap. 1-11.  aThere are very few studies on the application of fertilizers through irrigation water (fertirrigation) using a multi-gate irrigation system in sugarcane AES. Through fertirrigation, the application of fertilizers can be simplified, and their distribution uniformity in sugarcane fields improved. This paper provides an overview of the state of the art regarding fertirrigation with multi-gate irrigation in sugarcane agroecosystems (AES). In order to systematize, organize, and discuss the scientific data on fertirrigation with low-pressure multi-gate irrigation systems in sugarcane AES, bibliographic material from the following full-text scientific journal databases was screened: the Elsevier Science Direct Freedom Collection, Springer Link, and the International Society for Horticultural Science. Next, a matrix of keywords was used to analyze the interrelationships among the available literature, current issues, and the recent findings. We conclude that development of fertirrigation technologies with low-pressure multi-gate irrigation is much needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecosystems 3adatabases 3afertigation 3ahorticulture 3airrigation systems 3airrigation water 3asugarcane 0aclimate change 0acrop water requirement 0afertilizer application 0afertilizer distribution uniformity 0asugarcane industry 0awater use efficiency1 aLANDEROS-SÁNCHEZ, Cesáreo1 adel Refugio CASTAÑEDA-CHÁVEZ, María1 aMARTÍNEZ-DÁVILA, Juan Pablo1 aPérez Vázquez, Arturo,1 aCARRILLO-ÁVILA, Eugenio0 tPedosphere.g2019 Feb., v. 29, no. 1 p.1-11dElsevier LtdaSoil Science Society of ChinawJournal:jnl4085839x1002-01607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(18)60053-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03133naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245016000181300001600341520182300357592002802180650001202208650001602220650001102236650002202247650000902269650001302278650001402291650001602305650001602321650001902337653002802356653002102384653001802405653003102423653001602454653002502470700002002495773010102515856008602616852000902702655001202711IND60561838720221121165956.0170713e20170401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056183872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2017.01.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoyaghchi, Fateme Ahmadi10aParametric study and multi-criteria optimization of total exergetic and cost rates improvement potentials of a new geothermal based quadruple energy system  ap. 130-141.  aThe current study presents a new designed quadruple energy production system integrated with geothermal energy involving a cascade organic Rankine cycle, liquefied natural gas vaporization process, proton exchange membrane electrolyzer to produce four types of energies, namely electricity power, heating load for vaporizing liquefied natural gas, cooling effect and hydrogen. Besides conventional analyses, advanced thermodynamic and thermoeconomic analyses are conducted to determine the irreversibilities and related cost rates within the components of the desired system to find the amount of total avoidable exergy destruction rate, and total avoidable cost rates. Moreover, the effect of substantial design parameters namely, upper cycle mass flow rate, liquefied natural gas mass flow rate, geothermal mass flow rate, turbine 1 inlet pressure, liquefied natural gas pressure, geothermal pressure and condenser 1 outlet temperature are evaluated on the total avoidable exergy destruction, total avoidable exergy destruction cost and investment cost rates as well as their subdivisions. Sensitivity studies indicate that geothermal mass flow rate has a drastic positive effect on the total avoidable exergy destruction rate and total exergy destruction cost rate within 137.2% and 119.5%, respectively while condenser 1 outlet temperature improves total avoidable investment cost rate by about 0.05$/h, as compared with other parameters. Finally, Non-dominated Sort Genetic Algorithm-II is applied to achieve the maximum improvement potential for desired system. Optimization results show that total avoidable exergy destruction rate and total avoidable exergy destruction cost rate get 3.27 and 4.9 times, respectively and total avoidable investment cost rate is improved within 17.4% relative to the base point.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling 3aelectricity 3aexergy 3ageothermal energy 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3amass flow 3anatural gas 3atemperature 3avolatilization 0aAdvanced exergoeconomic 0aLNG vaporization 0aH2 production 0aQuadruple production cycle 0aCascade ORC 0aNSGA-II optimization1 aSafari, Hediyeh0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2017 Apr. 01, v. 137 p.130-141dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2017.01.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245019300163300001600356500001500372520143400387592002801821650001001849650001201859650002701871650002301898650001001921650001001931650001001941650003701951650001601988650003102004650001102035650002502046650001702071650002602088650001602114650001502130650002202145650001702167650001302184650002002197650001502217650001202232650001202244650002102256653001002277700001802287700002102305700002602326700002302352700001902375700002502394773010702419856004802526852000902574655001202583IND4473381720221118131035.0120515e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447338172DNAL7 a10.1007/s11105-011-0377-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbid, Ghassen10aComparative Expression and Cellular Localization of Myo-inositol Phosphate Synthase (MIPS) in the Wild Type and in an EMS Mutant During Common Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) Seed Development  ap. 780-793.  a2019-12-06  aIn plants, the myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (EC 5.5.1.4; MIPS) is an evolutionarily conserved enzyme protein and catalyzes the synthesis of myo-inositol, which is a central molecule required for cell metabolism and plant growth. A full-length cDNA encoding common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) MIPS (designated Pv_BAT93 MIPS) was isolated from seed of P. vulgaris (cv, BAT93) by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The cDNA of Pv_BAT93 MIPS comprised 1,873 bp, which encodes 510 amino acids. The Pv_BAT93 MIPS gene was highly homologous with those of other plant species, such as P. vulgaris (cv, Taylor’s Horticultural), Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago sativa and Glycine max. DNA blot analysis indicated that at least three copies of MIPS are present in the common bean genome. RT-PCR analysis indicated that the Pv_BAT93 MIPS transcripts existed in developing seeds and other common bean tissues, including leaves, flowers, and cotyledons but showed lower levels expression in roots and stems. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that Pv_BAT93 MIPS gene is differentially expressed during common bean seed development. In situ hybridization of developing seeds in the wild type and in the ethyl methanesulfonate mutant showed that expression of Pv_BAT93 MIPS was identified in the embryo tissues, from the globular to late cotyledon stages, confirming a possible involvement of Pv_BAT93 MIPS in common bean seed development.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeans 3aenzymes 3aethyl methanesulfonate 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3agenes 3aroots 3astems 3arapid amplification of cDNA ends 3aamino acids 3agene expression regulation 3aleaves 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aplant growth 3ain situ hybridization 3aGlycine max 3ametabolism 3acomplementary DNA 3amyo-inositol 3aproteins 3aMedicago sativa 3acotyledons 3aflowers 3amutants 3aseed development 0aseeds1 aSassi, Khaled1 aMuhovski, Yordan1 aJacquemin, Jean-Marie1 aMingeot, Dominique1 aTarchoun, Neji1 aBaudoin, Jean-Pierre0 tPlant molecular biology reporter.g2012 June, v. 30, no. 3 p.780-793dSpringer-Verlagx0735-96407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11105-011-0377-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02094naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245015300175300001800328520097700346592002801323650003901351650001501390650002001405650001801425650001301443650001901456700002401475700002001499700001901519773009801538856008801636990002301724852000901747655001201756IND60098511220221123045435.0141104e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009851122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.11.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakos, Hassan W.10aPaternal body mass index is associated with decreased blastocyst development and reduced live birth rates following assisted reproductive technology  ap. 1700-1704.  aOBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between paternal body mass index (BMI), embryo development and pregnancy, and live birth outcomes after assisted reproductive technology (ART).

Chemometrics was used to evaluate the similarity and differences of SGPs from different regions based on their fingerprints. The results of the present study showed that polysaccharides from 18 batches of Sarcandra glabra had a high degree of similarity based on the HPSEC, PCD-HPLC, and FT-IR fingerprints. The samples from different regions could be classified by clustering analysis based on their nuances. The five monosaccharides (Gal, Rha, Xyl, GlcA, and Glc) and the wavelengths of FT-IR (3371 cm⁻¹ and 1411 cm⁻¹) could be selected as herb markers for the quality control of Sarcandra glabra.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aSarcandra glabra 3achemometrics 3acluster analysis 3aderivatization 3agel chromatography 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amonosaccharides 3apolysaccharides 3aquality control 3awavelengths 0aSarcandra glabra 0aFingerprint analysis 0aPolysaccharides 0aChemometrics analysis1 aGong, Xingqun1 aWang, Zichen1 aPan, Chun1 aZhao, Yang1 aGao, Xiangdong1 aLiu, Wei0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 123 p.957-967dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.11.1033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013300163300001600296520168700312592002801999650001102027650002002038650001102058650002202069650002302091650002402114650002502138650001202163650001202175650001902187650001702206651001002223700001902233700001802252773010102270856008102371852000902452655001202461IND60522640820221119145034.0160603e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052264082DNAL7 a10.1007/s11769-016-0806-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Dandan10aSpatial-temporal characteristics and factors influencing commuting activities of middle-class residents in Guangzhou City, China  ap. 410-428.  aThe middle class in metropolitan Chinese cities has become an important social group. With the rapid development of urbanization and constant advancement of suburbanization, the middle class has increasingly come to influence city traffic. Research into middle-class commuting activities thus has practical significance for improving traffic congestion and reducing the commuting burden in metropolitan cities. Based on a dataset formed by 816 completed surveys, this paper analyzes the commuting mode, time and distance of middle-class residents in Guangzhou City using the descriptive statistical method. The results indicate that private cars are the main commuting mode, followed by public transport. Meanwhile, middle-class residents mainly undertake medium-short time and medium- short distance commuting. The study subsequently uses multilevel logistic regression and multiple linear regression models to analyze the factors that influence commuting mode choice, time and distance. The gender, age, number of family cars, housing source and jobs-housing balance are the most important factors influencing commuting mode choice; housing, population density, jobs-housing balance and commuting mode significantly affect commuting time; and transport accessibility, jobs-housing balance and commuting mode are the notable factors affecting commuting distance. Finally, this paper analyzes what is affecting the commuting activities of middle-class residents and determines the differences in commuting activity characteristics and influence factors between middle-class and ordinary residents. Policy suggestions to improve urban planning and urban management are also proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3adata collection 3agender 3aissues and policy 3apopulation density 3aregression analysis 3asocioeconomic status 3asurveys 3atraffic 3aurban planning 3aurbanization 3aChina1 aZhou, Chunshan1 aYe, Changdong0 tChinese geographical science.g2016 June, v. 26, no. 3 p.410-428dScience Pressx1002-00637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11769-016-0806-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01154naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001700187245002300204300001300227506007600240520019300316592002800509506003700537650000800574650001500582650002500597650002300622773010600645856008000751852000900831655001200840IND60119386320221207103957.0141214e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011938632DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2009-10-3-2122doi7 aPMC26909912pmcid7 a193444902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlicek, Paul14aThe need for speed  ap. 2094.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDNA sequence data are being produced at an ever-increasing rate.

This ice spear is possibly from the particle-induced undercooled region in front of the freezing interface and the consequent morphological instability. After the appearance of the new ice lens, its growth dynamics are quantitatively analyzed. The growth speed of ice decreases with time, which can be attributed to the premelted film flow-controlled interface movement.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolloids 3afreezing 3aice 3aquantitative analysis 0aColloidal suspensions 0aSolidification 0aIce lens 0aGrowth dynamics1 aWang, Jincheng1 aWang, Lilin1 aWang, Zhijun1 aLi, Junjie1 aLin, Xin0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Sept. 20, v. 553 p.681-688dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.05.0923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245012600177500001400303520116400317592002801481650002601509650001201535650002201547650001601569650001601585650001301601650001401614650001301628650000901641650001201650650001101662650002301673650001601696650002701712650001401739653002801753653002201781653002801803653002801831700002601859700002701885700002401912773009901936856009002035852000902125655001202134IND60727494820221120224024.0210311e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072749482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7365032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaigle, Nicole J.10aTriploidy affects postprandial ammonia excretion but not specific dynamic action in 1+ brook charr, Salvelinus fontinalis  aNAL-light  aThe use of sterile triploids in aquaculture is currently limited because of reduced performance in situations of aerobic stress such as high temperature, hypoxia, and exhaustive exercise. Many studies have therefore attempted to find underlying metabolic differences between triploids and their diploid counterparts to improve triploid rearing protocols. This study investigated the effects of triploidy on postprandial metabolism (and therefore also pre-feeding standard metabolic rate; SMR) in 1+ (193 ± 5 g; mean ± SE) diploid and triploid brook charr, Salvelinus fontinalis. Oxygen uptake and total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) excretion were measured at 14–15 °C for previously fasted (for eight days) fish from 48 h before to 48 h after being sham-fed or fed a single ration of 0.4% of their body mass. While there were no ploidy-related differences in SMR or any of the measured SDA parameters, triploids had significantly higher net TAN excretion (by 36%) than diploids. Such a difference in protein metabolism could affect triploid growth and survival when simultaneously faced with suboptimal conditions, though further studies are warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalvelinus fontinalis 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3aaquaculture 3abody weight 3adiploidy 3aexcretion 3aexercise 3afish 3ahypoxia 3aoxygen 3aprotein metabolism 3atemperature 3athermic effect of food 3atriploidy 0aStandard metabolic rate 0aAmmonia excretion 0aPostprandial metabolism 0aSpecific dynamic action1 aSacobie, Charles F.D.1 aVerhille, Christine E.1 aBenfey, Tillmann J.0 tAquaculture.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 536 p.736503-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7365033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011200172300001600284520157300300592002801873650002401901650002501925650002601950650001201976650001501988650001602003650001502019650001302034650001402047650002302061651001102084653002502095653003502120653002102155653003702176653001102213700002102224700002202245773013102267856005102398852000902449655001202458IND50086617320221116175140.0140412e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008661732DNAL7 a10.1080/1389224X.2012.6700512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiiro, Richard F.10aFactors in the Transfer of Governance-Facilitation Skills within Farmers' Marketing Organizations in Uganda  ap. 231-245.  aPurpose: Training transfer has been examined for formal industrial and service organizations in developed countries but rarely for rural organizations in sub-Saharan Africa. This study sought to identify transfer system factors that best explain the transfer of governance-facilitation skills provided to leaders of farmers' marketing organizations (FMOs) in Uganda. Design/methodology/approach: Face to face interviews using interview schedules containing selected elements of the Learning Transfer System Inventory were conducted with 99 FMO leaders to collect data on the factors that could affect transfer of governance-facilitation skills. Findings: Hierarchical regression revealed that personal capacity to transfer, transfer design, supervisor support and feedback on performance were significant predictors of perceived transfer of governance-facilitation skills. Practical implications: Results point to the need for extension organizations that work with rural farmers' organizations to design effective training methods and transfer approaches that enhance training transfer, as well as promote leadership that values and supports training transfer to FMOs. Originality/value: The focus on member owned, participatorily run rural farmers' organizations to test factors affecting transfer of critical skills adds value to the training transfer discourse. Additionally, the role of trainee characteristics, transfer design and work environment factors in enhancing training transfer within developing country local organizations in rural Africa is confirmed.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloped countries 3adeveloping countries 3aenvironmental factors 3afarmers 3ainterviews 3ainventories 3aleadership 3alearning 3amarketing 3aworking conditions 3aUganda 0aTransfer of training 0aGovernance-facilitation skills 0aTransfer factors 0aFarmers' marketing organizations 0aUganda1 aMazur, Robert E.1 aMatsiko, Frank B.0 tjournal of agricultural education and extension.g2012 June 1, v. 18, no. 3 p.231-245dTaylor & Francis Groupx1750-86227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1389224X.2012.670051  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010900169520162500278592002801903650002701931650002401958650001801982650001402000650001102014650001502025650001202040650002102052650001902073650001702092653001702109653001702126653001402143653001802157700005702175773009902232856008502331852000902416655001202425IND60746022520221119191744.0210904e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074602252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2021.1057662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerrie, Angela10aDeveloping biopesticide-based programmes for managing powdery mildew in protected strawberries in the UK  aPowdery mildew, caused by Podosphaera aphanis, is an important disease of strawberries and currently its control in the UK is very dependent on conventional fungicides. A series of experiments were carried out to integrate conventional fungicides with biopesticides and biostimulants for mildew control. In 2015–2016, the biopesticides Sonata (Bacillus pumilis) and AQ10 (Ampelomyces quisqualis) achieved at least as good as or better mildew control where they were applied alone rather than alternated with or tanked mixed with conventional fungicides. Three mildew management programmes were evaluated in 2017 on an ever-bearer cultivar. In the B. pumilis based programme, the need for treatment and the choice of products were partially determined by predicted mildew risks. The incidence of mildew on leaves was very low in untreated plots with virtually no mildew observed in the other treated plots. By contrast, mildew on the fruit rose rapidly from 2 % in late July to >90 % in late August in untreated plots. In treated plots, the percentage of fruit with mildew did not rise above 3 % with the three managed programmes based on B. pumilis. There were no significant differences in total yield and marketable yield between the managed programmes and the routine fungicide programme, but all were significantly greater than the untreated control. Most of the unmarketable fruit in the untreated control was due to infection with powdery mildew. The results suggested that strawberry powdery mildew can be effectively managed by the integrated use of biopesticides, biostimulants and conventional fungicides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmpelomyces quisqualis 3aPodosphaera aphanis 3abiopesticides 3acultivars 3afruits 3afungicides 3amildews 3aplant protection 3apowdery mildew 3astrawberries 0aBiopesticide 0aBiostimulant 0aFungicide 0aPlant extract1 aXu, Xiangming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4567-71170 tCrop protection.g2021 Nov., v. 149 p.105766-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2021.1057663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245016100169300001600330520160600346592002801952650001301980650001401993650001302007650003502020650001502055650001602070650003002086650001702116650001102133650001802144650001602162650001702178650001502195650001302210650002202223650001902245653002902264653001402293653002502307700001602332700001602348700001202364700001402376700001502390773010702405856008702512852000902599655001202608IND60605414320221120084039.0200621e20180920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060541432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.05.0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Chaoge10aInfluencing factors on the stabilization of colloid biliquid aphrons and its effectiveness used for density modification of DNAPLs in subsurface environment  ap. 439-445.  aAquifer contamination caused by non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) is a serious environmental problem worldwide, especially dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs). They could quickly deposited as an impermeable layer at the bottom of aquifer because of their low solubility and high density. NAPLs contaminated zones can serve as a persistent source of groundwater pollution, and pose a serious threat to human health and ecosystems. Density modification displacement (DMD) is a promising approach to prevent DNAPLs downward migration during surfactant-based remediation process. In this work, colloid biliquid aphrons (CBLA) was prepared and characterized; the influencing factors on CBLA stabilization were investigated, and the effectiveness of CBLA used for DNAPLs density modification in groundwater was evaluated. The results indicated that the optimum preparation phase volume ratio (PVR) of CBLA was 8; the particle size of CBLA decreased drastically while PVR ranged from 2 to 8; the ζ-potential of CBLA was negative and had a positive relationship with PVR. CBLA solution had shear thinning properties, and the relationship between shear stress and shear rate belongs to Herschel-Bulkley model; sulfate ion showed stronger destructive ability on CBLA compared with chloride ion. Moreover, the optimum ratio of CBLA to trichloroethylene (TCE) for density modification was 9/5, and the density of TCE could be changed from 1.464 g/cm³ to 0.980 g/cm³. Therefore, CBLA could transform DNAPL to LNAPL successfully, and it had promising potential for DNAPL polluted groundwater remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3achlorides 3acolloids 3adense nonaqueous phase liquids 3aecosystems 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3ahuman health 3amodels 3aparticle size 3aremediation 3ashear stress 3asolubility 3asulfates 3atrichloroethylene 3azeta potential 0aColloid biliquid aphrons 0aStability 0aDensity modification1 aDong, Juan,1 aRen, Liming1 aFan, Ye1 aLi, Bowen1 aHu, Wenhua0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Sept. 20, v. 553 p.439-445dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.05.0933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005300148245012000201300001800321520104800339592002801387596006301415596009001478596008001568650004401648650001401692650002501706650001201731650001301743650001901756650001001775650001601785650001001801650003301811650001301844650000901857700001701866700001801883700001601901700001601917700001701933700001601950773011101966856008202077852000902159655001202168IND60685377120221120225647.0200303e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068537712DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-019-02929-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Peiyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0233-681410aPreparation of cellulose nanofibrils from okara by high pressure homogenization method using deep eutectic solvents  ap. 2511-2520.  aThe interest in the application of deep eutectic solvents (DES) as a green solvent has increased rapidly. The application of DES in agro-industrial okara treatment can be developed into industrialization. In order to simplify the degreasing, deproteinization and cellulose extraction steps in the process of pretreating okara cellulose, a new approach to cellulose extraction from okara via one-pot DES treatment is established. Three different complexing agents, choline salts in oxalic acid, in glycerol and in urea are studied in this work. The structure and properties of cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) prepared by high pressure homogenization following pretreatment of okara with anionic systhesized DES are investigated. The effects of different systems on the degree of microfibrillation of okara are analyzed using techniques such as SEM, FTIR, TD and DTG. The results indicate that by pretreating okara with choline chloride–oxalic acid type solvent, CNFs with average diameter of 27 nm are obtained using high pressure homogenization.  aPublisher supplied data  a201819cState Key Laboratory of Pulp and Paper Engineering  a17JS017cShaanxi Provincial Department of Education Key Laboratory Research Open Fund  aBJ15-29cShaanxi University of Science and Technology Research Initial Fund 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acellulose 3acellulose nanofibers 3acholine 3aglycerol 3ahomogenization 3aokara 3aoxalic acid 3asalts 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3aurea1 aWang, Yumeng1 aHou, Qingqing1 aLiu, Hezhen1 aLei, Haozhe1 aJian, Boxing1 aLi, Xinping0 tCellulose.g2020 Mar., v. 27, no. 5 p.2511-2520dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-019-02929-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245014100158300001800299520089600317592002801213650003901241650002101280650001401301650002401315650002001339650002501359650001801384650001801402650002301420650001101443650001601454650001901470650002501489650001501514650002001529650001001549650001301559650002901572650003201601700001301633700001901646773012401665856007401789852000901863655001201872IND60617730220221120110945.0181026e20180321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061773022DNAL7 a10.1039/c7fo01040k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Xiaodong10aCationic peroxidase from proso millet induces human colon cancer cell necroptosis by regulating autocrine TNF-α and RIPK3 demethylation  ap. 1878-1888.  aA cationic peroxidase (POD) was purified from proso millet seeds (PmPOD) using ammonium sulfate fractionation, cation exchange, and size exclusion chromatography. The purified PmPOD showed toxicity to normal cells and tumor cells, but was more sensitive in HT29 cells. Furthermore, the mechanism driving HCT116 and HT29 cell death by PmPOD was the induction of receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1)- and RIPK3-dependent necroptosis, independent of apoptosis. More importantly, PmPOD could induce tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production through transcriptional upregulation. In addition, PmPOD could restore RIPK3 expression in HCT116 cells via the demethylation of the RIPK3 genomic sequence. Taken together, these results suggest that two distinct mechanisms are involved in PmPOD-induced necroptosis: the autocrine production of TNF-α and the restoration of RIPK3 expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanicum miliaceum subsp. miliaceum 3aammonium sulfate 3aapoptosis 3aautocrine signaling 3acation exchange 3acolorectal neoplasms 3ademethylation 3afractionation 3agel chromatography 3ahumans 3anecroptosis 3aneoplasm cells 3anucleotide sequences 3aperoxidase 3aprotein kinases 3aseeds 3atoxicity 3atranscription (genetics) 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aWang, Ru1 aWang, Zhuanhua0 tFood & function.g2018 Mar. 21, v. 9, no. 3 p.1878-1888dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7fo01040k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245015600172520180400328592002802132650003302160650001202193650001202205650001602217650001102233650002102244650002802265650001302293650001102306650000902317650001102326650001502337653002502352653001202377653003802389653002202427653001502449700001902464700002002483773009102503856009002594852000902684655001202693IND60727495020221120202503.0220321e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072749502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1297032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIzadi, Parin10aHolistic insights into extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) in anammosx bacterial matrix and the potential sustainable biopolymer recovery: A review  aAnaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox) process has been proven to be a favorable and innovative process, for treatment of nitrogen-rich wastewater due to decreased oxygen and carbon requirements at very high nitrogen loading rates. Anammox process is mainly operated through biofilm or granular sludge structures, as for such slow-growing microorganisms, elevated settling velocity of granules allows for adequate biomass retention and lowered potential risk of washouts. Stability of granular sludge biomass is extremely critical, yet the formation mechanism is poorly understood. There are number of important functions linked to Extracellular Polymeric Substance (EPS) in anammox bacterial matrix, such as; structural stability, aggregation promotion, maintenance of physical structure in the granules, water preserving and protective cell barrier. There is an increasing demand to introduce accurate methods for proper EPS extraction and characterization, to expand the perception of anammox granule stability and potential resource recovery. Analyzing EPS with a focus on various (mechanical and physical) properties can lead to biopolymer production from granular sludge. Biopolymers such as EPS are attractive alternatives substituting the conventional chemical polymers furthermore their recovery from the waste sludge and the potential applications in industrial sectors, leads to a radical enhancement of both environmental and economical sustainability, accelerating the circular economy advancements. Here, this study aims to overview the newest understanding on the structure of anammox sludge EPS, obtained recently and to assess the potential challenges and prospects to identify the knowledge gaps towards constructing an inclusive anammox EPS recovery and characterization procedure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3abiofilm 3abiomass 3abiopolymers 3acarbon 3acircular economy 3aeconomic sustainability 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3arisk 3asludge 3awastewater 0aBiological treatment 0aAnammox 0aExtracellular polymeric substance 0aResource recovery 0aBiopolymer1 aIzadi, Parnian1 aEldyasti, Ahmed0 tChemosphere.g2021 July, v. 274 p.129703-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1297033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005800152245007300210300001600283520152600299592002801825650001601853650001901869650001301888650001401901650001201915650001001927650001201937650002701949650001101976650001701987650000902004650001402013650001602027650001302043650001402056653001902070653001602089653001402105653002602119700001402145700001802159700002002177773010702197856008702304852000902391655001202400IND60605414520221120073055.0200621e20180920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060541452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.05.0972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jianping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5118-197010aFoaming of crude oil: Effect of acidic components and saturation gas  ap. 432-438.  aFoaming tendency of crude oil is diverse due to the variance in crude oil components. Crude oil viscosity, asphaltene, and resin contents have been studied in general, but the specific surfactant molecules that stabilize crude oil foam are not identified. Carbon dioxide oftentimes accompanies hydrocarbon gases in reservoirs rich in natural CO₂ and fields where CO₂ enhanced recovery is implemented. Crude oil acidic components and carbon dioxide may have considerable significance to foam formation and defoaming kinetics. We studied the effect of acidic components and saturation gas on foaming of crude oils with pneumatic and depressurization tests respectively. Foaminess, foamability and time to half collapse are used to characterize foaming of oils. We present a new piecewise model that can be divided into two segments with almost equal timescales to fit the collapse curve and we use parabola function and expdec1 function to model the two segments respectively. The t values at the intersection of two segments are approximately the same as time to half collapse. Model parameter A is close to foamability. Increase in the rigidity of the interface and viscosity of the bulk liquid may account for excellent foam stability of some acids/oil systems. Some acidic crude oil components, for example, naphthenic acids, long-chain fatty acids, increase foaminess significantly, suggesting that crude oil antifoams combined with reagents that will react with some acidic components may have better performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasphaltenes 3acarbon dioxide 3acolloids 3adefoaming 3afoaming 3agases 3aliquids 3along chain fatty acids 3amodels 3anaphthenates 3aoils 3apetroleum 3asurfactants 3avariance 3aviscosity 0aCrude oil foam 0aFoamability 0aFoaminess 0aDepressurization foam1 aHe, Limin1 aLuo, Xiaoming1 aZhang, Chunying0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Sept. 20, v. 553 p.432-438dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.05.0973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03063naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011900174300001400293520175500307592002802062650001402090650001602104650001202120650000902132650001702141650001502158650001802173650001502191650001002206650001202216650001002228650001602238653002102254653002102275653002302296700002602319700002302345700005902368773010702427856008602534852000902620655001202629IND60525293420221123012401.0190318e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052529342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaeng.2016.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStockton, Kelly A.10aComparison of hydraulics and particle removal efficiencies in a mixed cell raceway and Burrows pond rearing system  ap. 52-61.  aWe compared the hydrodynamics of replicate experimental mixed cell and replicate standard Burrows pond rearing systems at the Dworshak National Fish Hatchery, ID, in an effort to identify methods for improved solids removal. We measured and compared the hydraulic residence time, particle removal efficiency, and measures of velocity using several tools. Computational fluid dynamics was used first to characterize hydraulics in the proposed retrofit that included removal of the traditional Burrows pond dividing wall and establishment of four counter rotating cells with appropriate drains and inlet water jets. Hydraulic residence time was subsequently established in the four full scale test tanks using measures of conductivity of a salt tracer introduced into the systems both with and without fish present. Vertical and horizontal velocities were also measured with acoustic Doppler velocimetry in transects across each of the rearing systems. Finally, we introduced ABS sinking beads that simulated fish solids then followed the kinetics of their removal via the drains to establish relative purge rates. The mixed cell raceway provided higher mean velocities and a more uniform velocity distribution than did the Burrows pond. Vectors revealed well-defined, counter-rotating cells in the mixed cell raceway, and were likely contributing factors in achieving a relatively high particle removal efficiency-88.6% versus 8.0% during the test period. We speculate retrofits of rearing ponds to mixed cell systems will improve both the rearing environments for the fish and solids removal, improving the efficiency and bio-security of fish culture. We recommend further testing in hatchery production trials to evaluate fish physiology and growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3abiosecurity 3aburrows 3afish 3afish culture 3ahatcheries 3ahydrodynamics 3aphysiology 3aponds 3arearing 3atanks 3avelocimetry 0aParticle removal 0aInvasive species 0aMixed-cell raceway1 aMoffitt, Christine M.1 aWatten, Barnaby J.1 aVinci, Brian J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5724-69550 tAquacultural engineering.g2016 Sept., v. 74 p.52-61dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33898x0144-86097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaeng.2016.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03092naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001100148245012600159300001600285506011700301506007600418520130100494592002801795506003701823650002701860650001201887650002101899650002601920650002201946650001701968650001401985650001101999650002102010650001602031650000702047650001502054650001302069650001002082650001002092650002102102653001202123653001602135653002202151653004202173700001902215700001602234700001802250700001502268700001502283700001702298773011902315856008302434852000902517655001202526IND60788721220221207141122.0220816e202301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078872122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fshw.2022.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Na10aEffects of post-mortem aging process on characteristic water-soluble taste-active precursors in yellow-feathered broilers  ap. 242-253.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChilled chicken has become the mainstream of chicken consumption. In order to explore the effect of post-mortem aging on water-soluble flavor precursors of chicken, pH, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) degradation, flavor nucleosides, free amino acids and water-soluble low molecular weight peptides were determined using Qingyuan partridge yellow-feathered broilers as material during 0–4 °C post-mortem aging in 48 h. The results showed that the pH value fell to the limit pH 5.64 (4 h) in chicken breast and 6.21 (3 h) in thigh. Regardless of chicken breast or thigh, ATP dropped rapidly within 3 h. It was found that the K-value in chicken thigh was the lowest at 2 h indicating the freshness was the best. Considering the equivalent umami concentration (EUC), the value at 3 h and 4 h was relatively high, but the corresponding electronic tongue umami value was not high, which further showed that the water-soluble low molecular taste peptide played an important role on the post-mortem aging process. Combined with cluster analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), it was preliminarily inferred that the optimal time for chilled chicken during 0–4 °C post-mortem aging was 2 h, which could provide a theoretical basis for the further processing of fresh chicken.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abreasts 3acluster analysis 3adiscriminant analysis 3aelectronic tongue 3afood science 3afreshness 3ahumans 3amolecular weight 3anucleosides 3apH 3apartridges 3apeptides 3ataste 3aumami 3awater solubility 0aChicken 0aPost-mortem 0aFlavor precursors 0aLow molecular weight peptides (LMWPs)1 aZeng, Xianming1 aLi, Lingyun1 aZhang, Xinyue1 aWang, Peng1 aHan, Minyi1 aXu, Xinglian0 tFood science and human wellness.g2023 Jan., v. 12, no. 1 p.242-253dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23299x2213-45307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fshw.2022.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02273naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245010900177300001500286520114400301592002801445650001701473650002901490650002201519650002501541650001501566650002301581651001701604653001101621653002301632653001701655653001701672700002501689773010301714856008501817852000901902655001201911IND60568299520221121071533.0170504e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056829952DNAL7 a10.1080/09397140.2017.13158532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Abdulrazzak, Dalal10aReconstructing historical baselines for the Persian/Arabian Gulf Dugong, Dugong dugon (Mammalia: Sirena)  ap. 95-102.  aRetrospective estimates of historic abundances and distributions of marine organisms are crucial to understanding the anthropogenic impacts on the structure and species of coastal ecosystems, especially in the case of vulnerable species such as the Dugong (Dugong dugon). The Persian/Arabian Gulf is home to the second largest Dugong population in the world, yet little is known about their current or past abundance, distribution, and ecological role. Here, we examine historical changes in dugong distribution and estimate perceived changes in their abundance. We create a ‘dugong discovery curve’ and compile global density estimates as proxies for the overall health of the population in the Gulf. We find that since 1950 dugong range may have contracted by one quarter, and despite their large population, their overall densities in the Gulf are far lower than in other areas within their range. Basic understanding of historical trajectories for Dugongs is needed in order to develop appropriate management plans and conservation targets, particularly in light of large and wide-spread coastal development projects in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDugong dugon 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquatic organisms 3adevelopment projects 3aecosystems 3avulnerable species 3aPersian Gulf 0aDugong 0ahistorical ecology 0aPersian Gulf 0aArabian Gulf1 aPauly, D.q(Daniel),0 tZoology in the Middle East.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 63, no. 2 p.95-102dTaylor & Francisx2326-26807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09397140.2017.13158533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245007200182300001600254500001500270520100100285592002801286650002501314650001201339650002201351650000901373650001501382650001701397650001701414650001001431650001601441650001601457650001101473650001201484650003601496650005501532650002701587650001101614650002201625650005301647650005401700653001201754700001301766700001201779773010801791856008101899852000901980655001201989IND4473641620221118032836.0141111e20110920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447364162DNAL7 a219300972pmid7 a10.1016/j.jgg.2011.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Dabing10aCytological analysis and genetic control of rice anther development  ap. 379-390.  a2019-12-06  aMicrosporogenesis and male gametogenesis are essential for the alternating life cycle of flowering plants between diploid sporophyte and haploid gametophyte generations.

Towards a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling rice male reproductive development, we describe here the cytological changes of anther development through 14 stages, including cell division, differentiation and degeneration of somatic tissues consisting of four concentric cell layers surrounding and supporting reproductive cells as they form mature pollen grains through meiosis and mitosis. Furthermore, we compare the morphological difference of anthers and pollen grains in both monocot rice and eudicot Arabidopsis thaliana.

However, the relationship between the IL-1β-511 C/T polymorphism and gastric carcinogenesis remains inconclusive. A systematical electronic search was conducted of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases. A random and a fixed effects model were exploited to estimate summary odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were carried out with respect to ethnicity, quality assessment scores, control sources, genotyping methods, cancer histopathology and location, and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. A total of 45 studies containing 9,066 cases of gastric cancer and 11,192 control subjects satisfied the inclusion criteria. The IL-1β-511 C/T polymorphism was found to enhance the risk of stomach cancer for overall and HWE-satisfying studies. Asians showed a positive relationship in both the overall and HWE-satisfying groups, whereas Caucasians did not. Based on subgroup analysis, H. pylori infection and genotype analysis using PCR–RFLP methods increase the association between IL-1β-511 T allele carrier and risk of stomach cancer. A positive relationship was found between the IL-1β-511 C/T SNP and stomach carcinoma susceptibility, and the results suggest that Asian ethnicity, H. pylori infection and methodologically, PCR–RFLP genotyping strengthen this relationship. Reflecting on prevalence of H. pylori in Asian countries, additional studies on the IL-1β-511 C/T SNP in the context of ethnicity and H. pylori infection may provide key insights into the mechanism underlying gastric cancer carcinogenesis. It was found PCR–RFLP is the most reliable genotyping method, and thus, it is recommendable to adopt it to determine the presence of the IL-1β-511 C/T SNP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsians 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aWhites 3aalleles 3acarcinogenesis 3acarcinoma 3aconfidence interval 3adatabases 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ahistopathology 3ainterleukins 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3aodds ratio 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3arisk 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3astomach 3astomach neoplasms1 aHyun, Myung-Han1 aYang, Jong-Pill1 aYoon, Jeong-Min1 aPark, Sungsoo0 tMolecular biology reports.g2015 Jan., v. 42, no. 1 p.119-134dSpringer-Verlagx0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-014-3748-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03797naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245011400176300001800290520217100308592002802479650001102507650002302518650001602541650001702557650002002574650001402594650001702608650001402625650002402639650003002663650001302693650000902706650001202715650001602727651001802743653001002761653002102771653002402792700005502816700005702871700005802928700002302986700002103009700002203030700002203052773011303074856008303187852000903270655001203279IND60746022920221119191431.0210911e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074602292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2021.07.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorreia, M. Isabel T.D.10aPrevalence of malnutrition risk and its association with mortality: nutritionDay Latin America survey results  ap. 5114-5121.  aAcross the globe, the prevalence of hospital malnutrition varies greatly depending on the population served and on local socioeconomic conditions. While malnutrition is widely recognized to worsen patient outcomes and add financial burdens to healthcare systems, recent data on hospital malnutrition in Latin America are limited. Our study objectives were: (1) to quantify the prevalence of malnutrition risk in Latin American hospital wards, and (2) to explore associations between nutritional risk status, in-hospital food intake, and health outcomes.On nutritionDay (nDay), a specific day every year, hospital wards worldwide can participate in a one-day, cross-sectional audit. We analyzed nDay data collected in ten Latin American countries from 2009 to 2015, including demographic and nutrition-related findings for adult patients (≥18 years) from 582 hospital wards/units. Based on patient-reported responses to questions related to the Malnutrition Screening Tool, we determined the prevalence of malnutrition risk (MST score ≥2). We also summarized patient-reported food intake on nDay, and we analyzed staff-collected outcome data at 30 days post-nDay.The prevalence of malnutrition risk in the Latin American nDay study population (N = 14,515) was 39.6%. More than 50% of studied patients ate one-half or less of their hospital meal, ate less than normal in the week before nDay, or experienced weight loss in the prior three months. The hospital-mortality hazard ratio was 3.63 (95% CI [2.71, 4.88]; P < 0.001) for patients eating one-quarter of their meal (compared with those who ate the full meal), increasing to 6.6 (95% CI [5.02, 8.7]; P < 0.0001) for patients who ate none of the food offered.Based on compilation of nDay surveys throughout Latin America, 2 of every 5 hospitalized patients were at risk for malnutrition. The associated risk for hospital mortality was up to 6-fold higher among patients who ate little or none of their meal on nDay. This high prevalence showed scant improvement over rates two decades ago—a compelling rationale for new focus on nutrition education and training of professionals in acute care settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aclinical nutrition 3afood intake 3ahazard ratio 3ahealth services 3ahospitals 3amalnutrition 3amortality 3anutrition education 3anutrition risk assessment 3apatients 3arisk 3asurveys 3aweight loss 3aLatin America 0aAdult 0aNutrition status 0aNutritional support1 aSulo, Suela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7567-147X1 aBrunton, Cory1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3799-37421 aSulz, Isabella1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1807-62921 aRodriguez, Dolores1 aGómez, Gabriel,1 aTarantino, Silvia1 aHiesmayr, Michael0 tClinical nutrition.g2021 Sept., v. 40, no. 9 p.5114-5121dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2021.07.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02271naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245015600170300001600326520085900342592002801201650001501229650001201244650001501256650001401271650001201285650001201297650001501309650000901324650001201333650001101345650002101356650001801377650001401395650001001409650001701419651002101436653003301457653003101490653000901521653002101530700001901551700002101570773010401591856008501695852000901780655001201789IND60568299620221121071606.0170504e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056829962DNAL7 a10.1080/09397140.2017.13158542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÇiçek, Kerim10aFood composition of the Near Eastern Fire Salamander, Salamandra infraimmaculata Martens, 1885 (Amphibia: Urodela: Salamandridae) from Eastern Anatolia  ap. 130-135.  aThis study presents data on the food composition of the Near Eastern Fire Salamander, Salamandra infraimmaculata, from Bingöl, eastern Turkey. A total of 139 prey items was determined in the food content of 28 individuals (14 juveniles, 7 males, and 7 females). Insecta (N%= 37.4), Gastropoda (27.3%), and Isopoda (25.9%) constitute together 91% of the food items. The most frequent prey groups in the diet are Coleoptera (F%=50.0%), Isopoda (57.1%), and Gastropoda (46.4%). Coleoptera (V%= 34.6%), Gastropoda (28.0%), and Isopoda (23.5%) had the highest prey volumes. No significant difference was found between the sexes in food composition. The species generally feeds upon poorly flying or slow-moving invertebrates, but is opportunistic in taking up more mobile prey species as well. Diptera, Odonata and Hemiptera were found in small numbers only.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColeoptera 3aDiptera 3aGastropoda 3aHemiptera 3aIsopoda 3aOdonata 3aSalamandra 3adiet 3afemales 3aflight 3afood composition 3ainvertebrates 3ajuveniles 3amales 3aprey species 3aTurkey (country) 0aNear Eastern Fire Salamander 0aSalamandra infraimmaculata 0adiet 0afood composition1 aKoyun, Mustafa1 aTok, Cemal Varol0 tZoology in the Middle East.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 63, no. 2 p.130-135dTaylor & Francisx2326-26807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09397140.2017.13158543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013800157300001800295520161400313592002801927650002001955650001901975650001901994650002102013650003902034650001702073650001602090650002602106650001602132650001902148650001702167650002102184650001502205650001902220650001902239650001502258650001902273650001402292650000902306650001702315650001402332650001902346650000702365650002102372700001202393700001602405700001802421700001502439773014102454856007402595852000902669655001202678IND60685087920221119164439.0200227e20200226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068508792DNAL7 a10.1039/c9tb02259g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Xiangbin12aA tumor-targeted, intracellular activatable and theranostic nanodiamond drug platform for strongly enhanced in vivo antitumor therapy  ap. 1660-1671.  aEnhancing tumor homing and improving the efficacy of drugs are urgent needs for cancer treatment. Herein a novel targeted, intracellularly activatable fluorescence and cytotoxicity nanodiamond (ND) drug system (ND-PEG-HYD-FA/DOX, NPHF/D) was successfully prepared based on doxorubicin (DOX) and folate (FA) covalently bound to PEGylated NDs, in which the DOX was covalently coupled via an intracellularly hydrolyzable hydrazone bond that was stable in the physiological environment to ensure minimal drug release in circulation. Cell uptake studies demonstrated the selective internalization of NPHF/D by folate receptor (FR) mediated endocytosis in the order MCF-7 > HeLa > HepG2 ≫ CHO, using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and flow cytometry. Interestingly, the DOX fluorescence of NPHF/D was significantly quenched, while the fluorescence recovery and cytotoxicity took place by low pH regulation in intracellular lysosomes, which made NPHF/D act as a fluorescence OFF–ON messenger for activatable imaging and cancer therapy. Of note, NPHF/D significantly inhibited the growth of tumors. Simultaneously, it was demonstrated that the introduction of FA and the cleavability of the hydrazone greatly enhanced the therapeutic performance of NPHF/D. In addition, toxicity studies in mice verified that the composites were devoid of any detected hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity using histopathology and blood biochemistry studies. Our work provides a novel strategy for cancer therapy, using ND-conjugated cancer drugs, and the exploration of theranostic drug-delivery systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood chemistry 3acancer therapy 3acardiotoxicity 3achemical bonding 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3adrug delivery systems 3aendocytosis 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3afolate receptors 3afolic acid 3ahepatotoxicity 3ahistopathology 3ahydrazones 3aimage analysis 3alysosomes 3amice 3ananodiamonds 3aneoplasms 3anephrotoxicity 3apH 3atoxicity testing1 aLi, Lin1 aWei, Shiguo1 aWang, Songbai1 aLi, Yingqi0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2020 Feb. 26, v. 8, no. 8 p.1660-1671dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9tb02259g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001400166245014900180300001600329520113700345592002801482650001401510650002201524650001401546650001401560650002801574650001301602650001401615650001301629650001201642650001601654650002701670650002201697650001101719650001801730650002001748650001301768700001301781700001501794700001401809700001501823773010001838856008101938852000902019655001202028IND60120229720221121042245.0150131e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012022972DNAL7 a252662352pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-014-3749-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jitao10aTranscriptome analysis of eyestalk and hemocytes in the ridgetail white prawn Exopalaemon carinicauda: assembly, Annotation and Marker Discovery  ap. 135-147.  aThe ridgetail white prawn Exopalaemon carinicauda is one of major economic mariculture species in eastern China. The deficiency of genomic and transcriptomic data is becoming the bottleneck of further researches on its good traits. In the present study, 454 pyrosequencing was undertaken to investigate the transcriptome profiles of E. carinicauda. A collection of 1,028,710 sequence reads (459.59 Mb) obtained from cDNA prepared from eyestalk and hemocytes was assembled into 162,056 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Of these, 29.88 % of 48,428 contigs and 70.12 % of 113,628 singlets possessed high similarities to sequences in the GenBank non-redundant database, with most significant (E value <1e⁻¹⁰) unigenes matches occurring with crustacean and insect sequences. KEGG analysis of unigenes identified putative members of biological pathways related to growth and immunity. In addition, we obtained a total of putative 125,112 SNPs and 13,467 microsatellites. These results will contribute to the understanding of the genome makeup and provide useful information for future functional genomic research in E. carinicauda.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrustacea 3acomplementary DNA 3adatabases 3aeconomics 3aexpressed sequence tags 3agenomics 3ahemocytes 3aimmunity 3ainsects 3amariculture 3amicrosatellite repeats 3asequence analysis 3ashrimp 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aunigenes1 aLi, Jian1 aChen, Ping1 aLiu, Ping1 aHe, Yuying0 tMolecular biology reports.g2015 Jan., v. 42, no. 1 p.135-147dSpringer-Verlagx0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-014-3749-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03303naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001500181245018900196300001800385506007600403520157100479592002802050506003702078650001302115650001702128650001702145650002002162650001702182650002102199650001502220650001702235650001402252650001502266650000702281650001902288650001502307700001702322700001702339700001802356700001702374700002602391700001602417700001902433700001902452700001802471700001902489700001702508773014102525856007402666852000902740655001202749IND60685088020221207111720.0200227e20200226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068508802DNAL7 a10.1039/c9tb02302j2doi7 aPMC70580962pmcid7 a320558102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Shuai10aRatiometric fluorescent probes based on through-bond energy transfer of cyanine donors to near-infrared hemicyanine acceptors for mitochondrial pH detection and monitoring of mitophagy  ap. 1603-1615.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTwo ratiometric near-infrared fluorescent probes have been developed to selectively detect mitochondrial pH changes based on highly efficient through-bond energy transfer (TBET) from cyanine donors to near-infrared hemicyanine acceptors. The probes consist of identical cyanine donors connected to different hemicyanine acceptors with a spirolactam ring structure linked via a biphenyl linkage. At neutral or basic pH, the probes display only fluorescence of the cyanine donors when they are excited at 520 nm. However, acidic pH conditions trigger spirolactam ring opening, leading to increased π-conjugation of the hemicyanine acceptors, resulting in new near-infrared fluorescence peaks at 740 nm and 780 nm for probes A and B, respectively. This results in ratiometric fluorescence responses of the probes to pH changes indicated by decreases of the donor fluorescence and increases of the acceptor fluorescence under donor excitation at 520 nm due to a highly efficient TBET from the donors to the acceptors. The probes only show cyanine donor fluorescence in alkaline-pH mitochondria. However, the probes show moderate fluorescence decreases of the cyanine donor and considerable fluorescence increases of hemicyanine acceptors during the mitophagy process induced by nutrient starvation or under drug treatment. The probes display rapid, selective, and sensitive responses to pH changes over metal ions, good membrane penetration, good photostability, large pseudo-Stokes shifts, low cytotoxicity, mitochondria-targeting, and mitophagy-tracking capabilities.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiphenyl 3acytotoxicity 3adrug therapy 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ametal ions 3amitochondria 3amitophagy 3amonitoring 3apH 3aphotostability 3astarvation1 aWang, Jianbo1 aZhang, Yibin1 aWhisman, Nick1 aBi, Jianheng1 aSteenwinkel, Tessa E.1 aWan, Shulin1 aMedford, Jerry1 aTajiri, Momoko1 aLuck, Rudy L.1 aWerner, Thomas1 aLiu, Haiying0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2020 Feb. 26, v. 8, no. 8 p.1603-1615dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9tb02302j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01378naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012300174300001600297500001500313520032000328592002800648650001600676650001700692650001000709651000900719651000900728653001200737653002100749653001200770700002300782700002500805773010400830856008500934852000901019655001201028IND60568299720221121071608.0170504e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056829972DNAL7 a10.1080/09397140.2017.13158562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKazerani, Farzaneh10aAdditions to the Pipunculidae fauna of Iran, with the description of a new species of Tomosvaryella (Insecta: Diptera)  ap. 147-153.  a2019-12-06  aWe present new records of Pipunculidae from western and north-western Iran, including the description of Tomosvaryella subsylvatica sp. n. and another eleven species new to the national fauna, which currently comprises 33 species. http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:C537D120-D296-4CE9-86A1-9F6482D4FD1D  aPublisher supplied data 3anew species 3aPipunculidae 3afauna 3aIran 0aIran 0aDiptera 0abig-headed flies 0arecords1 aKhaghaninia, Samad1 aKehlmaier, Christian0 tZoology in the Middle East.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 63, no. 2 p.147-153dTaylor & Francisx2326-26807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09397140.2017.13158563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245011600170520167200286592002801958650001601986650001502002650001502017650001802032650002502050651001002075653001802085653001502103653002402118653002202142653001702164700001502181700001602196700005602212700001702268700001402285700001602299773009102315856009002406852000902496655001202505IND60727495420221120202529.0220103e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072749542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1298032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Zheng10aTemporal and spatial variability of antibiotics in agricultural soils from Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, northern China  aThe objective of this study was to investigate the temporal and spatial distribution of antibiotics in agricultural soils of Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, which is a major agricultural producing area and economically developed region in China. In this study, 105 soil samples including 13 groups of soil profile samples (0–20, 20–40 and 40–60 cm) and 23 paired surface soil samples of greenhouse and open-field were collected from four provinces/municipality in 2018. The occurrence of 20 antibiotics, including four tetracyclines (TCs), seven quinolones (QNs), six sulfonamides (SAs) and three macrolides (MLs) were measured. The concentrations of total antibiotics fell in the range of 1.62–575 μg kg⁻¹, with the mean value of 68.8 μg kg⁻¹. TCs and QNs were dominant antibiotics in soil, accounting for 99.6% of the total concentration. Regional differences of antibiotic residues in soil were found among the four regions as well as between different cropping systems. The levels of antibiotics in greenhouse soils (3.52–575 μg kg⁻¹) were higher than those in open-field soils (1.62–142 μg kg⁻¹). In soils of greenhouse of 1–6 years old, the levels of antibiotics were higher than those with longer history (7–30 years). Antibiotics were mainly distributed in the depth of 0–20 cm. The total concentrations of antibiotics/QNs followed the order of 0–20 cm > 40–60 cm > 20–40 cm, due to probably their interactions with total organic carbon and associated bacterial communities. The results in the study will provide data supports for the formulation of soil antibiotic contamination prevention and control measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3agreenhouses 3amacrolides 3aquinolones 3asoil profiles 3atotal organic carbon 3aChina 0aTetracyclines 0aQuinolones 0aBacterial community 0aPlanting duration 0aSoil profile1 aYang, Side1 aZhao, Lixia1 aLi, Xiaojing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9854-89011 aWeng, Liping1 aSun, Yang1 aLi, Yongtao0 tChemosphere.g2021 June, v. 272 p.129803-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1298033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012100168300001600289520133200305592002801637650001601665650001601681650001701697650003901714650002901753650001101782650001901793650001301812700002701825700002601852700006101878773012201939856008202061852000902143655001202152IND60685377620221120225907.0200303e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068537762DNAL7 a10.1007/s11120-019-00688-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAra, Anjue Mane10aStark fluorescence spectroscopy on peridinin–chlorophyll–protein complex of dinoflagellate, Amphidinium carterae  ap. 233-239.  aBecause of their peculiar but intriguing photophysical properties, peridinin–chlorophyll–protein complexes (PCPs), the peripheral light-harvesting antenna complexes of photosynthetic dinoflagellates have been unique targets of multidimensional theoretical and experimental investigations over the last few decades. The major light-harvesting chlorophyll a (Chl a) pigments of PCP are hypothesized to be spectroscopically heterogeneous. To study the spectral heterogeneity in terms of electrostatic parameters, we, in this study, implemented Stark fluorescence spectroscopy on PCP isolated from the dinoflagellate Amphidinium carterae. The comprehensive theoretical modeling of the Stark fluorescence spectrum with the help of the conventional Liptay formalism revealed the simultaneous presence of three emission bands in the fluorescence spectrum of PCP recorded upon excitation of peridinin. The three emission bands are found to possess different sets of electrostatic parameters with essentially increasing magnitude of charge-transfer character from the blue to redder ones. The different magnitudes of electrostatic parameters give good support to the earlier proposition that the spectral heterogeneity in PCP results from emissive Chl a clusters anchored at a different sites and domains within the protein network.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphidinium 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3alight harvesting complex 3amodels 3aphotosynthesis 3apigments1 aShakil Bin Kashem, Md.1 aGrondelle, Rienk van,1 aWahadoszamen, Md.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7602-201X0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2020 Mar., v. 143, no. 3 p.233-239dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl32702x0166-85957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-019-00688-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245015200157300001600309520160200325592002801927650001401955650002301969650002101992650001102013650001702024650001902041650001402060650002102074650002102095650001202116650002202128650000902150650002702159700001602186700001402202700001402216700002302230700001802253700001602271700001702287700001602304773012202320856007402442852000902516655001202525IND60617730620221120110923.0181026e20180124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061773062DNAL7 a10.1039/c7fo01082f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Wenhua14aThe mechanism of reduced IgG/IgE-binding of β-lactoglobulin by pulsed electric field pretreatment combined with glycation revealed by ECD/FTICR-MS  ap. 417-425.  aBovine β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) is a major allergen existing in milk and causes about 90% of IgE-mediated cow's milk allergies. Previous studies showed that pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment could partially unfold the protein, which may contribute to the improvement of protein glycation. In this study, the effect of PEF pretreatment combined with glycation on the IgG/IgE-binding ability and the structure of β-Lg was investigated. The result showed that PEF pretreatment combined with glycation significantly reduced the IgG and IgE binding abilities, which was attributed to the changes of secondary and tertiary structure and the increase in glycation sites and degree of substitution per peptide (DSP) value determined by electron capture dissociation Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ECD/FTICR-MS). Unexpectedly, glycation sites (K47, K91 and K135) added by two mannose molecules were identified in glycated β-Lg with PEF pretreatment. Moreover, the results indicated that PEF pretreatment at 25 kV cm⁻¹ for 60 μs promoted the reduction of IgG/IgE-binding capacity by increasing the glycation degree of β-Lg, whereas single PEF treatment under the same conditions markedly enhanced the IgG/IgE-binding ability by partially unfolding the structure of β-Lg. The results suggested that ECD/FTICR-MS could help us to understand the mechanism of reduction in the IgG/IgE-binding of β-Lg by structural characterization at the molecular level. Therefore, PEF pretreatment combined with glycation may provide an alternative method for β-Lg desensitization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergens 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3abinding capacity 3acattle 3adissociation 3aelectric field 3aglycation 3aimmunoglobulin E 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amannose 3amass spectrometry 3amilk 3apulsed electric fields1 aTu, Zongcai1 aWang, Hui1 aZhang, Lu1 aKaltashov, Igor A.1 aZhao, Yunlong1 aNiu, Chendi1 aYao, Honglin1 aYe, Wenfeng0 tFood & function.g2018 Jan. 24, v. 9, no. 1 p.417-425dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7fo01082f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05525naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024003900136024004600175040001800221100001900239245019600258300001400454506007600468506003100544520306500575592002803640596007003668506003703738650001603775650001503791650001003806650001703816650001803833650002303851650001603874650002003890650001703910650001403927650001403941650001603955650001103971650001303982650001703995650001104012650001504023650001704038650003804055650002804093650002704121650001804148650001604166650001204182653002304194653001804217653001404235653003804249653002004287653001804307653002204325653001304347653001704360700002504377700002104402700002204423700002004445700002604465773010704491856008604598856004504684961001704729852000904746655001204755IND60525293820221215142407.0190318e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052529382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaeng.2016.05.0042chorus7 a10.1016/j.aquaeng.2016.05.0042doi7 a10.1016/j.aquaeng.2016.05.0042chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavidson, John10aEffects of feeding a fishmeal-free versus a fishmeal-based diet on post-smolt Atlantic salmon Salmo salar performance, water quality, and waste production in recirculation aquaculture systems  ap. 38-51.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe Atlantic salmon farming industry has progressively decreased the proportion of fishmeal used in commercial diets due to rising costs and sustainability concerns. A variety of alternate proteins have been identified to partially replace fishmeal; however, very little research has described the effect of feeding alternate protein, fishmeal-free diets to Atlantic salmon, particularly post-smolts cultured in recirculation aquaculture systems (RAS). Therefore, a 6-month study was conducted to compare the effects of feeding a fishmeal-free diet (FMF) versus a fishmeal-based diet (FM) on post-smolt Atlantic salmon performance, water quality, and waste production rates in six replicated RAS. Experimental diets were fed to Atlantic salmon (281±5g to begin) in triplicate RAS. Protein ingredients used in the FMF diet included mixed nut meal, poultry meal, wheat flour, and corn protein concentrate; while the FM diet contained menhaden meal, poultry meal, soy protein concentrate, and blood meal proteins. Fish oil derived from whiting fish trimmings was used in the FMF diet to establish a wild fisheries input to farmed fish output ratio of 0:1; while menhaden oil was the primary lipid source for the FM diet. Both diets were formulated with approximately 42% crude protein and 27% crude fat. Each RAS was operated with flushing rates that created an average system hydraulic retention time of 20 days (5% system volume flushed daily) and a mean feed loading rate of 3.2kg feed/m3 of daily make-up water volume. Atlantic salmon growth, survival, and feed conversion ratios (FCR) were unaffected (P>0.05) by diet. At the conclusion of the study, Atlantic salmon fed the FMF and FM diets were 1.716±0.076 and 1.720±0.065kg; cumulative survival was >99% for both; and average FCR was 0.89±0.03 and 0.90±0.02, respectively. The FMF diet resulted in greater total phosphorous (TP), carbonaceous biochemical oxygen (cBOD), and total suspended solids (TSS) mass per kg feed in the effluent (P<0.05). The FMF and FM diets produced 0.009±0.001 v. 0.006±0.001kg TP/kg feed; 0.079±0.005 v. 0.056±0.005kg cBOD/kg feed; and 0.297±0.028 v. 0.221±0.032kg TSS/kg feed, respectively. A significantly higher percentage of TSS was captured by radial flow settlers of RAS receiving the FMF diet compared to capture by settlers associated with the FM diet. Mass balance data, radial settler removal efficiency, and observations of flushed solids suggested that the FMF diet produced fecal matter with better settling characteristics. Lower TSS and true color values (P<0.05), indicative of clearer water, were measured in RAS receiving the FMF diet. Total phosphorous (most of which was dissolved) was 4 times greater in the culture water of RAS that received the FMF diet, e.g., 4.3±0.1mg/L v. 0.9±0.0mg/L for the FM Diet. This was the first research attempt to formulate a fishmeal-free diet for Atlantic salmon with this ingredient profile and one of few studies to demonstrate uncompromised Atlantic salmon performance when feeding a diet without fishmeal.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000079170 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalmo salar 3ablood meal 3acolor 3acorn protein 3acrude protein 3aexperimental diets 3afarmed fish 3afeed conversion 3afish culture 3afish meal 3afisheries 3aingredients 3alipids 3amenhaden 3amenhaden oil 3aoxygen 3aphosphorus 3apoultry meal 3arecirculating aquaculture systems 3asoy protein concentrate 3atotal suspended solids 3awater quality 3awheat flour 3awhiting 0aAlternate proteins 0aFishmeal-free 0aAquafeeds 0aRecirculating aquaculture systems 0aAtlantic salmon 0aWater quality 0aAquaculture waste 0aNut meal 0aPoultry meal1 aBarrows, Frederic T.1 aKenney, P.

However, sex-specific differences in responses to drought, phosphorus (P) shortage or their combination are less known. In our study, impacts of drought, P shortage and their combination on the performance of Populus cathayana males and females were investigated. Drought and P deficiency caused a greater negative impact on female growth than on male growth. P application ameliorated the more negative effect of drought on the shoot dry matter accumulation and P concentration in male leaves, while smaller effects were observed in females. The concentration of citrate in the rhizosphere of males was higher under drought combined with P application than under adequate water availability, and the increase was greater in males than in females. Males also showed a higher abundance of main soil microbial groups, including bacteria, actinomycetes, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and Gram+ and Gram- bacteria in the rhizosphere, resulting in a more resistant microhabitat. In contrast, the abundance of bacteria and AMF was less in the rhizosphere of females exposed to stress conditions, while saprophytic fungi increased significantly. P enhanced drought resistance more in stress-resistant males but less in females under relatively severe drought stress. Increased drought resistance by P in males might be associated with greater plasticity in rhizosphere processes when compared with females.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aPopulus cathayana 3abacteria 3acitrates 3adioecy 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3adry matter accumulation 3afemales 3aleaves 3amales 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aphosphorus 3arhizosphere 3asaprophytes 3asexual dimorphism 3asoil 3awater stress 0aP shortage 0aRhizosphere processes 0aMain soil microbial groups 0aCarbohydrates1 aHe, Yue1 aZhou, Bin1 aKorpelainen, Helena1 aLi, Chunyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2895-27860 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2020 July, v. 175 p.104049-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2020.1040493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245009300177520153600270592002801806650000801834650001101842650001301853650001901866650001801885650000901903650002101912650001701933650001701950650001101967650001201978650001301990650001402003650001902017650001402036650001402050650001002064650000702074653003102081653002602112653002102138653001402159653002102173653002002194700001902214700002202233700001902255773009002274856009002364852000902454655001202463IND60727495520221120210113.0220103e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072749552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1298042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCornejo, Oscar M.10aDegradation of Acid Violet 19 textile dye by electro-peroxone in a laboratory flow plant  aThis paper deals with the degradation of Acid Violet 19 (AV19) textile dye by the electro-peroxone (E-peroxone) process in a laboratory flow plant using a filter press cell fitted with a 3D gas diffusion electrode (3D GDE) containing a graphite felt positioned on carbon-cloth PTFE as cathode, and a Ti|IrSnSb-oxides plate as anode. H₂O₂ was formed by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the cathode; the air was supplied by an external compressor. The O₃ produced externally by an ozonator was added in the pipeline at the outlet of the electrolyzer to promote the reaction between the H₂O₂ and O₃ to produce OH, which is the responsible for the mineralization of the dye. The effect of electrolyte flow rate (Q), current density (j), and initial concentration of AV19 dye on its degradation was addressed. The best electrolysis in a solution containing 40 mg TOC L⁻¹, 0.05 M Na₂SO₄, at pH 3, was obtained at j = 20 mA cm⁻², Q = 2.0 L min⁻¹, using a pressure of the air fed to the 3D GDE of PGDE = 3 psi, and an ozone inlet mass flow rate of F03 = 14.5 mg L⁻¹, achieving 100% discoloration, 60% mineralization, with mineralization current efficiency and energy consumption of 36% and 0.085 kWh(gTOC)⁻¹. The degradation of AV19 dye was also performed by anodic oxidation plus H₂O₂ electrogenerated (AO-H₂O₂) and ozonation. The oxidation power was AO-H₂O₂ < ozonation < E-peroxone. Three carboxylic acids were quantified by chromatography as oxidation end products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aanodes 3acathodes 3achromatography 3adiscoloration 3adyes 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolysis 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3afabrics 3agraphene 3amass flow 3amineralization 3aoxidation 3aozonation 3aozone 3apH 0aDegradation of textile dye 0aH2O2 electrosynthesis 0aAnodic oxidation 0aOzonation 0aElectro-peroxone 0aWater treatment1 aOrtiz, Mariela1 aAguilar, Zaira G.1 aNava, José L.0 tChemosphere.g2021 May, v. 271 p.129804-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1298043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03658naa a2200805 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245016100174520143100335592002801766650004201794650002501836650001801861650001701879650001901896650003001915650002101945650001001966650001301976650002501989650001102014650002002025650001602045650001902061650002102080650001402101650001902115650001802134650001402152650001002166650001302176650001602189650001102205650001102216650002002227650001802247650002002265650001602285650001302301650002902314653000802343653000802351653000902359653000902368653000602377653001002383653000602393653000702399653000802406653000702414653000702421653001202428653000802440653001902448653001302467653002302480700002402503700002502527700002502552700002302577700002202600773012102622856008802743852000902831655001202840IND60688226820221118135118.0200607e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068822682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2020.1040502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrito, Fred A.L.10aElevated CO2 improves assimilation rate and growth of tomato plants under progressively higher soil salinity by decreasing abscisic acid and ethylene levels  aHigh salinity in the soil hampers crop performance. In this context, elevated atmospheric CO₂ concentration can alter plant responses to excess salinity, as shown by studies exposing plants to high concentration of NaCl (osmotic shock) in controlled conditions under constant irradiance and temperature. These experiments, however, may not reflect the conditions that occur in natural environments. Here, we studied the impact of progressively imposed salt stress on tomato plant biomass, hormone biosynthesis and primary metabolism under elevated CO₂ concentration with fluctuating irradiance and temperature. Na⁺ concentration and Na⁺: K⁺ ratios in plant tissues were increased by high salinity under both ambient and elevated CO₂ concentration. Elevated CO₂ led to enhanced growth in tomato plants under salt stress through stimulation of photosynthesis and reduced concentrations of abscisic acid and the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid in both leaves and roots. Furthermore, whereas high salinity reduced the concentration of Krebs Cycle intermediates and increased the concentration of photorespiratory metabolites glycine and serine, all were restored to control levels by elevated CO₂. Our results demonstrate a beneficial effect of rising atmospheric CO₂ concentration for crops and reveal new interactions in the physiological network controlling salinity stress responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aabscisic acid 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3acarboxylic acids 3acrops 3aethylene 3aglycine (amino acid) 3aleaves 3alight intensity 3ametabolites 3aosmotic stress 3aphotorespiration 3aphytomass 3aplant response 3aplant tissues 3apotassium 3aroots 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3aserine 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asoil salinity 3astress response 3atemperature 3atomatoes 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 0aABA 0aACC 0aaCO2 0aeCO2 0aA 0aCi/Ca 0aE 0ags 0aNPQ 0aRD 0aDW 0aqRT-PCR 0aTCA 0aClimate change 0aHormones 0aPrimary metabolism1 aPimenta, Thaline M.1 aHenschel, Juliane M.1 aMartins, Samuel C.V.1 aZsögön, Agustín1 aRibeiro, Dimas M.0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2020 Aug., v. 176 p.104050-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2020.1040503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03854naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245010400210300001800314520175100332592002802083596004502111596007102156596004002227650001902267650001802286650001602304650001802320650001002338650001002348650003402358650001302392650001302405650001402418650001202432650002702444650003002471650001402501650002502515650002502540650001502565650002902580700006102609700006202670700006402732700006002796700006002856700006002916700002302976700005902999773013803058856008303196852000903279655001203288IND60771494820221123044526.0220911e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077149482DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-021-04014-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlkemade, Joris A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1477-293610aGenome-wide association study reveals white lupin candidate gene involved in anthracnose resistance  ap. 1011-1024.  aKEY MESSAGE: GWAS identifies candidate gene controlling resistance to anthracnose disease in white lupin. White lupin (Lupinus albus L.) is a promising grain legume to meet the growing demand for plant-based protein. Its cultivation, however, is severely threatened by anthracnose disease caused by the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum lupini. To dissect the genetic architecture for anthracnose resistance, genotyping by sequencing was performed on white lupin accessions collected from the center of domestication and traditional cultivation regions. GBS resulted in 4611 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 181 accessions, which were combined with resistance data observed under controlled conditions to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Obtained disease phenotypes were shown to highly correlate with overall three-year disease assessments under Swiss field conditions (r > 0.8). GWAS results identified two significant SNPs associated with anthracnose resistance on gene Lalb_Chr05_g0216161 encoding a RING zinc-finger E3 ubiquitin ligase which is potentially involved in plant immunity. Population analysis showed a remarkably fast linkage disequilibrium decay, weak population structure and grouping of commercial varieties with landraces, corresponding to the slow domestication history and scarcity of modern breeding efforts in white lupin. Together with 15 highly resistant accessions identified in the resistance assay, our findings show promise for further crop improvement. This study provides the basis for marker-assisted selection, genomic prediction and studies aimed at understanding anthracnose resistance mechanisms in white lupin and contributes to improving breeding programs worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data  a727230chorizon 2020 framework programme  a17.00090cstaatssekretariat für bildung, forschung und innovation  a613551cseventh framework programme 3aColletotrichum 3aLupinus albus 3aanthracnose 3adomestication 3afungi 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3agenomics 3aimmunity 3alandraces 3alegumes 3alinkage disequilibrium 3amarker-assisted selection 3apathogens 3aplant source protein 3apopulation structure 3aprediction 3aubiquitin-protein ligase1 aNazzicari, Nelson1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2710-98851 aMessmer, Monika M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6120-00791 aAnnicchiarico, Paolo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8027-10351 aFerrari, Barbara1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7100-55011 aVoegele, Ralf T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6068-82441 aFinckh, Maria R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2925-40581 aArncken, Christine1 aHohmann, Pierre1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7029-05660 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2022 Mar., v. 135, no. 3 p.1011-1024dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl2874x0040-57527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-021-04014-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02372naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245013400168520113100302592002801433650001601461650002001477650001701497650002401514650001701538650001401555650003701569651001001606653003001616653002301646653003201669653001901701653001601720700001401736700001801750700001701768773009001785856009001875852000901965655001201974IND60727495920221120210002.0220103e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072749592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1298312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Rui10aBastnäsite nanoparticles in carbonatite-syenite-hosted REE deposit： implication for La and Ce migration and bastnäsite growth  aHigh-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations of bastnäsite from the Maoniuping rare earth element (REE) deposit at Panxi, SW China, revealed the presence of nanoparticles in the surface of bastnäsite crystal. The nanoparticles are identified as the bastnäsite nanocrystals, with 5–30 nm in length, by energy-dispersive spectrometry and fast fourier transform patterns. This represents the first observation of bastnäsite nanoparticle in nature, confirming a new form of migration and precipitation of La and Ce in the hydrothermal fluids. Meanwhile, we herein reveal that random attachment of small bastnäsite nanoparticles during aggregation-based growth initially produces large bastnäsite nanoparticles, driven by the tectonic stress. Subsequent evolution of the random aggregation and orientation of large bastnäsite nanoparticles result in bastnäsite crystal formation, driven by the tectonic stress and inherent surface stress. This underlines the bastnäsite crystallization by random aggregation and the significant role of tectonic stress in forming the bastnäsite crystal in REE deposit.  aPublisher supplied data 3abastnaesite 3acrystallization 3ananocrystals 3arare earth elements 3aspectroscopy 3atectonics 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aChina 0aBastnäsite nanoparticles 0aRare earth element 0aMigration and precipitation 0aCrystal growth 0aREE deposit1 aBo, Benyu1 aTao, Dongping1 aChen, Genwen0 tChemosphere.g2021 May, v. 271 p.129831-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1298313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245010400172300001600276520114900292592002801441650001501469650001301484650000801497650001601505650002101521650001401542650002501556650001901581650001501600650001801615650001701633650001301650650001701663650001601680650001601696653002501712653001501737653001701752653001601769653002301785700001901808700002001827700001801847700002001865700002101885700001801906700002401924773013501948856008702083852000902170655001202179IND60766306920221120103230.0220719e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076630692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.01.1562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSepahvand, Sima10aModified cellulose nanofibers aerogels as a novel air filters; Synthesis and performance evaluation  ap. 601-609.  aNanofilters made with high adsorption freeze-dried modified cellulose nanofiber (CNF) aerogel were produced. The modification was made using functional groups containing phthalimide, and then their ability to adsorb particulate matter (PM) was evaluated and compared with the control filter (HEPA). The results showed that the highest adsorption of PM₂.₅ (99.95%) belonged to the nanofilters made of 1.5% phthalimide-modified CNF aerogel, and the lowest adsorption (76.66%) was related to the control samples. Moreover, based on the results, the nanofilter produced from freeze-dried phthalimide-modified CNF aerogel showed high filtration efficiency as well as excellent resistance to temperature and humidity. This modification enables the filter to operate in different environmental conditions, especially for particles less than 0.1 μm that are mainly responsible for reducing air quality, human health, air visibility, and climate change. In conclusion, we developed an environmentally friendly biodegradable nanofilter capable of high-performance filtration functions and structural stability in different environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaerogels 3aair 3aair quality 3abiodegradability 3acellulose 3acellulose nanofibers 3aclimate change 3afiltration 3afreeze drying 3ahuman health 3ahumidity 3aparticulates 3aphthalimide 3atemperature 0aCellulose nanofibers 0aNanofilter 0aFreeze-dryer 0aHEPA filter 0aParticulate matter1 aJonoobi, Mehdi1 aAshori, Alireza1 aRabie, Davood1 aGauvin, Florent1 aBrouwers, H.J.H.1 aYu, Qingliang1 aMekonnen, Tizazu H.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 203 p.601-609dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.01.1563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245015500168300001600323520136600339592002801705650001501733650001501748650001401763650002301777650003001800650002301830650001301853650001301866653002401879653001601903653001401919653000801933653001801941653002301959700001601982700005801998700001602056700001702072700005502089700005302144700005602197700001902253700001602272700002202288773010202310856008302412852000902495655001202504IND60731304220221122063906.0211213e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073130422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2021.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chunzheng10aMechanical pressure-mediated Pd active sites formation in NaY zeolite catalysts for indirect oxidative carbonylation of methanol to dimethyl carbonate  ap. 269-280.  aThe structural transformation of metal-containing zeolite catalysts subjected to mechanical compression is often disregarded in the preparation of catalysts. Herein, the impact of the mechanical compression on the catalytic active sites of Pd/NaY catalysts responsible for the indirect oxidative carbonylation of methanol to dimethyl carbonate (DMC) has been disclosed. The DMC selectivity of the catalysts was found to strongly depend on the mechanical-pressure applied, as the mechanical pressure controlled the ratio of Pd⁽²⁺ᵟ⁾⁺ and Pdᵟ⁺ species (0 < δ ≤ 2) in the catalysts. The mono-dispersed Pd clusters (1.3 nm) in the Pd/NaY catalyst were obtained under mechanical treatment of 300 MPa. This catalyst showed high CO conversion of 89% and DMC selectivity of 83%, that maintained for at least 150 h. Combining experimental and density functional theory studies, we revealed that the Pdᵟ⁺ rather than the Pd⁽²⁺ᵟ⁾⁺ species enhanced the adsorption of CO and CH₃ONO reactants and inhibited the decomposition of CH₃ONO reactant into byproducts, and thus enhanced the DMC selectivity. The mechanical pressure applied had a noticeable effect on the structural features of the metal-containing zeolite catalysts, but despite its importance, this aspect has been poorly considered in the field of heterogenous catalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbonates 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adensity functional theory 3amechanical methods 3amethanol 3azeolites 0aMechanical pressure 0aActive site 0aPalladium 0aNaY 0aCarbonylation 0aDimethyl carbonate1 aXu, Ningkun1 aLiu, Ting-Ting1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5431-76771 aXu, Weisong1 aGuo, Hailing1 aLi, Yanpeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5626-17771 aBai, Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6614-38971 aWu, Xin-Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3147-83331 aGong, Xue-Qing1 aLiu, Xinmei1 aMintova, Svetlana0 tJournal of catalysis.g2021 Apr., v. 396 p.269-280dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2021.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245014400166300001400310506010400324506007600428520139100504592002801895506003701923650003401960650001801994650001802012650001002030650001702040650000902057650001702066650002102083650001102104650002502115650001902140650002602159653001202185653001002197653001902207653001702226653001502243700001502258700001502273700001902288700001402307773011702321856008302438852000902521655001202530IND60788722220221207144024.0220816e202301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078872222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fshw.2022.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Huairui10aComparative analysis of physicochemical properties, ginsenosides content and α-amylase inhibitory effects in white ginseng and red ginseng  ap. 14-27.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGinseng (Panax ginseng C.A.

In the present study, color parameters and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were determined to evaluate the differences of ginseng color and microstructure induced by processing procedure. Quantitative analysis of multi-components by a single-marker (QAMS) method and anti-α-amylase activity test were used to assess variations of chemical ingredients and pharmacological activity between white and red ginseng. Finally, molecular docking studies were carried out to screen out the most effective compound against α-amylase. Results indicated that processing had a significant impact on the physicochemical properties and pharmacological activity of white and red ginseng. After processing, the color value of L* declined significantly. Red ginseng sample displayed a compact structure and presented of a gel layer on the surface compared to white ginseng. Additionally, the content of ginsenosides and the activity of anti-α-amylase decreased. The contents of total ginsenosides were positively correlated with the anti-α-amylase activities of ginseng, and ginsenoside Rb1 might be the most effective compound to inhibit the activity of α-amylase.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aPanax ginseng 3aalpha-amylase 3acolor 3afood science 3agels 3aginsenosides 3ahealth promotion 3ahumans 3amedicinal properties 3amicrostructure 3aquantitative analysis 0aGinseng 0aColor 0aMicrostructure 0aGinsenosides 0aα-Amylase1 aCheng, Yao1 aZhang, Xue1 aWang, Yingping1 aZhao, Hui0 tFood science and human wellness.g2023 Jan., v. 12, no. 1 p.14-27dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23299x2213-45307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fshw.2022.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245010900170520119800279592002801477650002701505650001401532650001301546650001601559650002201575650001501597650001101612650001501623650001401638650001701652650002801669650001301697650003001710653001301740653002001753653001001773653002701783700001201810700001501822700001701837700001501854700001801869700001201887700001601899700001701915700001701932773009101949856009002040852000902130655001202139IND60727496120221122142028.0220321e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072749612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1298452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Rong14aThe use of different sublethal endpoints to monitor atrazine toxicity in nematode Caenorhabditis elegans  aIn this work, Caenorhabditis elegans was employed as an in vivo model to determine the toxic effects of atrazine at different concentrations. After the exposure period from the larval stage L1 to adulthood day 1, atrazine (10 mg/L) significantly decreased the body length and lifespan of nematodes. In addition, exposure to ≥0.01 mg/L atrazine remarkably increased the intestinal reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and reduced locomotion behavior of nematodes, while exposure to ≥ 1 mg/L atrazine decreased the brood size of nematodes. Moreover, atrazine (0.001–0.1 mg/L) upregulated the expression levels of hsp-6::GFP and hsp-6/60 in nematodes, indicating the activation of mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR). On the contrary, atrazine (1–10 mg/L) downregulated the expression levels of hsp-6::GFP and hsp-6/60 in nematodes. Furthermore, mtUPR induction governed by the RNAi knockdown of atfs-1 could increase the vulnerability of nematodes against atrazine toxicity. Overall, our findings highlighted the dynamic responses of nematodes toward different concentrations of atrazine, which could be monitored using different sublethal endpoints as bioindicators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aadulthood 3aatrazine 3abody length 3aexposure duration 3aintestines 3alarvae 3alocomotion 3alongevity 3amitochondria 3areactive oxygen species 3atoxicity 3aunfolded protein response 0aAtrazine 0aStress response 0amtUPR 0aCaenorhabditis elegans1 aLiu, Ru1 aLi, Weixin1 aWang, Yixuan1 aWan, Xiang1 aSong, Ninghui1 aYu, Yue1 aXu, Jiaming1 aBu, Yuanqing1 aZhang, Aiguo0 tChemosphere.g2021 July, v. 274 p.129845-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1298453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03645naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245021400212520208100426592002802507650001002535650001402545650000802559650002502567650001402592650001102606650001802617650001702635650001502652650001802667650001302685653004502698653005402743653001002797653001502807653001602822700001802838700002002856700002302876700002002899700002302919700002002942773011802962856008603080852000903166655001203175IND60746023920221119191908.0220124e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074602392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2021.1067042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKadowaki, Masanao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1725-040410aValidity of the source term for the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Station accident estimated using local-scale atmospheric dispersion simulations to reproduce the large-scale atmospheric dispersion of 137Cs  aThe source term of ¹³⁷Cs from the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Station (FDNPS) accident was estimated from the results of local-scale atmospheric dispersion simulations and measurements. To confirm the source term's validity for reproducing the large-scale atmospheric dispersion of ¹³⁷Cs, this study conducted hemispheric-scale atmospheric and oceanic dispersion simulations. In the dispersion simulations, the atmospheric-dispersion database system Worldwide version of System for Prediction of Environmental Emergency Dose Information (WSPEEDI)-DB and oceanic dispersion model SEA-GEARN-FDM that were developed by the Japan Atomic Energy Agency were used. Compared with the air concentrations of ¹³⁷Cs measured by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, overall, the WSPEEDI-DB simulations well reproduced the measurements, whereas the simulation results partly overestimated some measurements. Furthermore, the validity of the deposition of ¹³⁷Cs by WSPEEDI-DB was investigated using SEA-GEARN-FDM and concentrations of ¹³⁷Cs in seawater sampled from the North Pacific. Seawater concentrations of ¹³⁷Cs by the oceanic dispersion simulation, in which the deposition flux of ¹³⁷Cs by WSPEEDI-DB was used as input from the atmosphere to oceans, were statistically consistent to the measurement. However, the simulated seawater concentrations of ¹³⁷Cs were underestimated regionally in the North Pacific. Both the overestimation of air concentrations and underestimation of seawater concentrations could be attributed to the less amounts of ¹³⁷Cs deposition by less precipitation over the North Pacific. The overestimation and underestimation could be improved without contradiction between the air and seawater concentrations of ¹³⁷Cs using more realistic precipitation in atmospheric dispersion simulations. This shows that the source term validated in this study could reproduce the spatiotemporal distribution of ¹³⁷Cs from the FDNPS accident in both local and large-scale atmospheric dispersion simulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aaccidents 3aair 3acesium radioisotopes 3adatabases 3amodels 3anuclear power 3apower plants 3aprediction 3aradioactivity 3aseawater 0aHemispheric-scale atmospheric dispersion 0aFukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power station accident 0a137Cs 0aWSPEEDI-DB 0aSource term1 aFuruno, Akiko1 aNagai, Haruyasu1 aKawamura, Hideyuki1 aTerada, Hiroaki1 aTsuduki, Katsunori1 aEl-Assad, Hamza0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2021 Oct., v. 237 p.106704-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2014x0265-931X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2021.1067043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02501naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245012600173300001200299520116200311592002801473650001601501650002401517650001101541650001601552650001401568650001101582650001701593650001201610650001301622650001501635650002101650650001501671650002301686650000901709650001001718650002401728650001401752650001901766650001001785651002101795700001901816773010501835856008201940852000902022655001202031IND60621488220221120202220.0181117s1997    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062148822DNAL7 a10.1177/1564826597018002062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuhnlein, Harriet V.10aImproved Retinol, Carotene, Ferritin, and Folate Status in Nuxalk Teenagers and Adults after a Health Promotion Programme  ap. 1-9.  aPlasma retinol and carotene, erythrocyte folate, serum ferritin, and haemoglobin were determined in native people living on the west coast of British Columbia before and after a three-year intervention programme of nutrition education and health promotion emphasizing local cultural food. One hundred ninety-nine persons participated before (T1) and 267 after (T2) the programme, with 107 persons participating in both periods. Overall T2 mean ± SEM adult (20–60 years) retinol increased (p <.05) over T1 from 23.8 ± 0.5 to 42.4 ± 17.3 μg/dl, carotene increased from 37.4 ± 1.2 to 54.1 ± 1.6 μg/dl, and erythrocyte folate increased from 226 ± 8 to 264 ± 8 ng/ml. T2 mean ± SEM adult ferritin and haemoglobin for all ages/sexes combined did not change; however, haemoglobin for older women 41 to 60 years of age increased (p <.05) from 12.4 ± 0.4 to 13.2 ± 0.2 g/dl, and the percentage of teenagers at risk for low ferritin levels was reduced for females from 85% to 17% and for males from 50% to 11%.

Various approaches are being promoted but information on their impact and sustainability is sparse. This study examines experiences of Self Help Africa and partners in Ghana, Uganda and Malawi. It asks: What is good practice in community extension for agriculture? What has been the impact of community extension on food security for smallholder farmers? What is the potential for scale-up and policy influence?Design/methodology/approach: Findings are based on a three-country mixed methods study of 240 households, farmer groups and community, government and NGO extensionists.Findings: Models of good practice include: community selection of extensionists, a twin technical and community development focus, and mutual learning. Impact of community based extension approaches on uptake of technologies, food security and livelihoods of poor groups was found to be broadly positive.Practical implications: Community based approaches appear sustainable where: communities provide support for their extensionists; community extensionists have marketable skills; communities and extensionists are developing Community Based Organisations (CBOs); and linkages are maintained with research and extension bodies. Community based extension approaches are being scaled-up in Malawi and elsewhere. To achieve sustainable pro-poor impacts, support will be needed for continued technical and community development training and back-stopping for community extensionists, and evaluation of different approaches.Originality/value: The study provides important evidence that community extensionists can help facilitate innovation in sustainable agriculture and reach the poor in a cost-effective way. They should be seen by policy-makers as part of pluralistic demand-driven extension, complementing over-stretched extension services.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity development 3acost effectiveness 3aextension education 3afarmers 3afood security 3aissues and policy 3alivelihood 3anongovernmental organizations 3asustainable agriculture 3aGhana 3aMalawi 3aUganda 0aSmallholders 0aAfrica 0aKnowledge 0aInnovation 0aFarmer-to-farmer 0aExtension1 aRafanomezana, Jenny1 aNyirenda, Mahara1 aOkotel, Misaki1 aSubbey, Vincent0 tjournal of agricultural education and extension.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 19, no. 1 p.21-35dTaylor & Francis Groupx1750-86227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1389224X.2012.714712  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003900135040001800174100001900192245005200211300001600263506007600279520141500355592002801770506003701798650002001835650001401855650002001869650001801889653002901907653000901936653002001945653002001965653001401985700002301999773014302022856008602165852000902251655001202260IND60568300520221207075158.0200115e20170102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056830052DNAL7 a298811292pmid7 aPMC59883742pmcid7 a10.1080/01621459.2015.11306342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossell, David10aNonlocal Priors for High-Dimensional Estimation  ap. 254-265.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aJointly achieving parsimony and good predictive power in high dimensions is a main challenge in statistics. Nonlocal priors (NLPs) possess appealing properties for model choice, but their use for estimation has not been studied in detail. We show that for regular models NLP-based Bayesian model averaging (BMA) shrink spurious parameters either at fast polynomial or quasi-exponential rates as the sample size n increases, while nonspurious parameter estimates are not shrunk. We extend some results to linear models with dimension p growing with n. Coupled with our theoretical investigations, we outline the constructive representation of NLPs as mixtures of truncated distributions that enables simple posterior sampling and extending NLPs beyond previous proposals. Our results show notable high-dimensional estimation for linear models with p > >n at low computational cost. NLPs provided lower estimation error than benchmark and hyper-g priors, SCAD and LASSO in simulations, and in gene expression data achieved higher cross-validated R² with less predictors. Remarkably, these results were obtained without prescreening variables. Our findings contribute to the debate of whether different priors should be used for estimation and model selection, showing that selection priors may actually be desirable for high-dimensional estimation.

Walp.) landraces at leaf physiological and metabolite profile levels  aDrought threatens the world’s food production, particularly in Sub Saharan Africa low external input and rain fed agricultural systems, where cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) is an important food crop. In the context of growing concerns regarding climate changes implications on water availability, this study aimed at 1) to evaluate the drought responses in cowpea landraces with contrasting drought tolerance levels (A55 – high sensitivity; A80 - mild sensitivity; A116 - tolerant), 2) using an integrated physiological (leaf gas exchanges; chlorophyll a fluorescence) and biochemical (photoprotective pigments; RuBisCO activity; primary metabolite profiling) analysis to identify drought tolerance probes, in plants submitted to three water availability levels (well-watered, WW; mild drought, MD; severe drought, SD). A116 plants maintained a better water status under drought, what could justify the higher Pₙ and Pₙₘₐₓ values in MD, as well as higher photochemical use of energy (reflected in the photochemical quenching (qL) and in the quantum yield of non-cyclic electron transport (Y₍II₎)), and the lower need of photoprotective thermal dissipation mechanisms (given by the non-photochemical quenching (qN), and the quantum yield of regulated energy dissipation at photosystem PSII (Y₍NPQ₎)), in MD and SD plants. Greater declines of net (Pₙ) and potential (Pₙₘₐₓ) photosynthesis were observed in A55 plants, which frequently showed significant impacts already under MD conditions in most parameters, whereas A80 usually displayed and intermediate behaviour. Still, even A55 showed some acclimation response, regarding photoprotective mechanisms associated with high contents of zeaxanthin, lutein, and carotenes, and high Y₍NPQ₎, and qN values, supporting the absence of an increase in the non-regulated energy dissipation at PSII (Y₍NO₎ did not increased) even in SD plants. Additionally, A55 was not significantly affected in RuBisCO activity, which showed to be quite resilient in cowpea. A primary metabolite profiling, complemented with a partial least square discrimination analysis (PLS-DA), allowed a better separation of A116 and A55 plants according to their degree of drought tolerance. In response to drought, A116 showed the greatest accumulation of most responsive metabolites, 14 in total, with sucrose, fucose, urea, alanine and putrescine being exclusively increased in this genotype, suggesting that they can be candidates as drought tolerance proxies. Other compounds, as proline, valine, isoleucine (among amino acids), and rhamnose and raffinose (among sugars) showed close increase patterns across landraces, thus they would be involved in the common drought response of cowpea plants. This pioneer approach to characterize Africa’s and Central Mozambique highly diverse cowpea germplasm, highlights the advantages of an integrated physiological and biochemical analysis, to identify response mechanisms and potential probes for drought tolerance in cowpea, aiming at to support selection and breeding strategies to obtain high yield and drought tolerant elite varieties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVigna unguiculata 3aacclimation 3aalanine 3acarotenes 3achlorophyll 3aclimate change 3acowpeas 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aelectron transfer 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescence 3afood crops 3afood production 3afucose 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3aisoleucine 3alandraces 3aleast squares 3aleaves 3alutein 3ametabolites 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosystem II 3aplant breeding 3aproline 3aputrescine 3aradiation resistance 3araffinose 3arain 3arhamnose 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3asucrose 3aurea 3avaline 3azeaxanthin 3aMozambique 0aChl 0aFo 0aFs/Fm’ 0aFv/Fm and Fv’/Fm’ 0aGC-TOF-MS 0ags 0aiWUE 0aPCA 0aPLS-DA 0aPIDyn,PIChr,PITotal 0aPn 0aPnmax 0aPSII 0aqLandqN 0aRuBisCO 0aRWC 0aTr 0aY(II),Y(NPQ),Y(NO) 0aPhotoprotection 0aPhotosynthesis 0aPrimary metabolome 0aRuBisCO 0aWater deficit1 aRodrigues, Ana P.1 aAntónio, Carla1 aRodrigues, Ana M.1 aLeitão, António E.1 aBatista-Santos, Paula1 aNhantumbo, Nascimento1 aMassinga, Rafael1 aRibeiro-Barros, Ana I.1 aRamalho, José C.0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2020 July, v. 175 p.104060-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2020.1040603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245016000170520133900330592002801669650002101697650002701718650001601745650001401761650002201775650001801797650001201815650001801827650000901845650001501854650001501869650002101884650001401905650001601919653002701935653002501962653001801987653002402005653002802029700001902057700001302076700001502089700001502104700001202119700001702131700001302148700005802161700001602219773010202235856008602337852000902423655001202432IND60746024220221119191501.0220207e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074602422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2021.1070632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZong, Xinxiang10aNovel emulsion film based on gelatin/polydextrose/camellia oil incorporated with Lactobacillus pentosus: Physical, structural, and antibacterial properties  aEdible films incorporated with probiotics and prebiotics have been presented an efficient strategy for food preservation. In this study, novel bioactive emulsion films fabricated from gelatin (GEL), camellia oil (CO, 50% and 100%, based on GEL), polydextrose (PD, 10% and 20%, based on GEL), and L. pentosus (10⁹ CFU/mL) were evaluated by SEM, FTIR, DSC, mechanical, barrier, antioxidant and antibacterial properties analyses. Results suggested that the viability of L. pentosus was not affected by the addition of 50% CO, while significantly decreased by 100% CO (P < 0.05). The CO, PD and their combination significantly decreased the tensile strength and enhanced the elongation at break (P < 0.05). The water vapor barrier and UV-resistance properties of the films were improved with the incorporation of CO (P < 0.05). The FTIR and SEM suggested that CO was successfully distributed in GEL-based films through emulsification. The L. pentosus was also observed to be embedded in the GEL matrix by SEM. The GEL/CO50/PD20 film exhibited the highest DPPH free radical scavenging activity (46.18 ± 1.36%) and the largest inhibition zones against S. aureus (33.84 ± 0.31 mm) and E. coli (34.25 ± 0.69 mm). In conclusion, the novel probiotic emulsion film could provide a new method to develop active food packaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactobacillus pentosus 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3afood preservation 3afree radicals 3agelatin 3ahydrocolloids 3aoils 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3atensile strength 3aviability 3awater vapor 0aAntibacterial activity 0aAntioxidant activity 0aCell survival 0aPhysical properties 0aProbiotic emulsion film1 aZhang, Xingguo1 aBi, Keyi1 aZhou, Ying1 aZhang, Min1 aQi, Jun1 aXu, Xinglian1 aMei, Lin1 aXiong, Guoyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3845-46091 aFu, Mengwei0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2021 Dec., v. 121 p.107063-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2021.1070633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01966naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245003500164300001600199520088400215592002801099650001501127650001401142650001801156650001101174650001901185653003301204653002601237653002501263653002601288700001301314700001901327700002001346773014301366856008601509852000901595655001201604IND60568300620221117173852.0200115e20170102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056830062DNAL7 a10.1080/01621459.2015.11316992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZou, Tao10aCovariance Regression Analysis  ap. 266-281.  aThis article introduces covariance regression analysis for a p-dimensional response vector. The proposed method explores the regression relationship between the p-dimensional covariance matrix and auxiliary information. We study three types of estimators: maximum likelihood, ordinary least squares, and feasible generalized least squares estimators. Then, we demonstrate that these regression estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal. Furthermore, we obtain the high dimensional and large sample properties of the corresponding covariance matrix estimators. Simulation experiments are presented to demonstrate the performance of both regression and covariance matrix estimates. An example is analyzed from the Chinese stock market to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed covariance regression model.

The quantity of K. marxianus L1-1 varied significantly in the fermentation process of rice-acid soup and the first and third days were the two key turning points in the growth phase of K. marxianus L1-1. Importantly, the concentrations of ethyl acetate, ethanol, acetic acid, and L-lactic acid increased from day 1 to day 3. At least 4231 genes and 2937 proteins were identified and 610 differentially expressed proteins were annotated to 30 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways based on the analysis results of transcriptome and proteome. The key genes and proteins including up-regulated alcohol dehydrogenase family, alcohol O-acetyltransferase, acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase, acyl-coenzyme A thioester hydrolase, and down-regulated aldehyde dehydrogenase family were involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways, starch and sucrose metabolism pathways, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism pathways, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and pyruvate metabolism pathways, thus promoting the formation of ethyl acetate, organic acids, alcohols, and other esters. Our results revealed the formation mechanisms of ethyl acetate and organic acids in rice-acid soup inoculated with K. marxianus L1-1.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aKluyveromyces marxianus 3aacetic acid 3aacetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 3aacyl coenzyme A 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3aaldehyde dehydrogenase 3aethanol 3aethyl acetate 3afermentation 3afood science 3agene expression regulation 3agluconeogenesis 3aglycolysis 3ahumans 3ahydrolases 3alactic acid 3aproteome 3apyruvic acid 3arice 3asoups 3astarch 3asucrose 3athioesters 3atranscriptome 0aKluyveromyces marxianus 0aFermented rice soup 0aEthyl acetate 0aOrganic acid 0aFormation mechanism1 aQin, Likang1 aHu, Laili1 aMiao, Song0 tFood science and human wellness.g2023 Jan., v. 12, no. 1 p.45-56dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23299x2213-45307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fshw.2022.07.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245011400168300001600282520136400298592002801662650002301690650002401713650001301737650000901750650002901759650001601788650002501804653001901829653001001848653001701858653001501875653003101890700002001921700002101941773009701962856008602059852000902145655001202154IND60561835720221120095352.0170124e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056183572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2013.11.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Haider10aThermodynamic analysis of a thermoelectric power generator in relation to geometric configuration device pins  ap. 634-640.  aThermoelectric generators (TEG) are cost effective solid-state devices with low thermal efficiencies. The limitations, due to the operational temperature of the thermoelectric materials, suppress the Carnot efficiency increase of the device. Although thermoelectric generators have considerable advantages over the other renewable energy devices, low convergence efficiency of the device retains thermoelectric devices behind its competitors. In order to keep up with the competition, improvement of device efficiency becomes crucial for the practical applications. The design configuration of the device pin legs, lowering the overall thermal conductance, can improve the device efficiency. Therefore, in the present study, the influence of pin leg geometry on thermal performance of the device is formulated thermodynamically. In this case, the exponential area variation of pin legs is considered and dimensionless geometric parameter ‘a’ is introduced in analysis. The influence of dimensionless geometric parameter on efficiency and power output is demonstrated for different temperature ratios and external load resistance ratios. It is found that increasing dimensionless geometric parameter improves the thermal efficiency of the device; however, the point of maximum efficiency does not coincide with the point of the maximum device output power.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3aelectric generators 3ageometry 3alegs 3arenewable energy sources 3atemperature 3athermal conductivity 0aThermoelectric 0aPower 0aLeg geometry 0aEfficiency 0aExponential area variation1 aSahin, Ahmet Z.1 aYilbas, Bekir S.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2014 Feb., v. 78 p.634-640dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2013.11.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01688naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001900189245011900208300001300327506007600340520048100416592002800897506003700925650003100962650001800993650001101011650002601022700002001048700001801068700002101086700002101107773010701128856008201235852000901317655001201326IND60119383120221207101914.0141214e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011938312DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2009-10-12-r1422doi7 aPMC28129492pmcid7 a200285422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLun, Desmond S12aA blind deconvolution approach to high-resolution mapping of transcription factor binding sites from ChIP-seq data  ap. 2292.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe present CSDeconv, a computational method that determines locations of transcription factor binding from ChIP-seq data.

Generally, the generated ash is landfilled, particularly in BC, with only a small amount being used beneficially. It is anticipated that the difficulty associated with the management of ash will worsen over time as the industry increases its reliance on green fuel. Thus, there is a strong need to identify beneficial uses of pulp and paper boiler ash for the sake of environmental and economic sustainability. The purpose of this report is to provide the first step in this direction, a review of proposed or implemented uses for coal and hog (or wood) ash around the world. Considering both the properties of the ash and local opportunities, this could be the first step toward screening the applications that may apply to individual mills. Several large-scale practices use ash, such as land application (as a nutrient source or as a liming agent), use in the construction industry (as a replacement for cement or as a fill material), and reclamation of mine sites and stabilization of unpaved forest roads. In some cases, relatively small-scale applications have been used which included uses such as a compost component, agent for pH adjustment of liquid streams and slurries, blasting abrasive, and source of quartz for glass manufacturing to name a few. It is important to note that the chemical nature of both fly and bottom ashes can be quite variable due to the type of wood residues combusted as well as combustion equipment used and must be considered in identifying beneficial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acement 3acoal 3acombustion 3acomposts 3aconstruction industry 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenvironmental management 3aforests 3aglass 3aland application 3apH 3apaper 3apulp 3apulp and paper industry 3apulp and paper mills 3aquartz 3aswine 3awood 3aBritish Columbia 3aQuebec 0aAsh utilization 0aCanadian pulp paper mills 0aBiomass boiler ash 0aFly ash 0aBottom ash 0aAsh application 0aAB 0aASTM 0aBC 0aCCE 0aCCME 0aCFIA 0aGHG 0aITE 0aLOI 0aMSW 0aNS 0aON 0aQC 0aTNV 0aXRF1 aMahmood, Talat1 aKamal, Abu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1759-49360 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 319 p.115728-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1157283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03462naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002700184245006700211300002000278500001500298506007600313520149500389592002801884506003701912650003401949650001201983650001401995650001702009650001102026650001302037650001902050650002102069650001902090650001802109650001302127650002002140650001702160650001602177653001702193700002002210700002802230700002002258700002202278700002202300700002302322700001602345700001802361700002402379700002302403700002902426700002202455700002602477700003202503700002002535773017702555856008302732852000902815655001202824IND4481613020221207131632.0120502e20110927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448161302DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11061271082doi7 aPMC31826992pmcid7 a219309302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutiérrez, Alejandro,10aAberrant AKT activation drives well-differentiated liposarcoma  ap. 16386-16391.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWell-differentiated liposarcoma (WDLPS), one of the most common human sarcomas, is poorly responsive to radiation and chemotherapy, and the lack of animal models suitable for experimental analysis has seriously impeded functional investigation of its pathobiology and development of effective targeted therapies. Here, we show that zebrafish expressing constitutively active Akt2 in mesenchymal progenitors develop WDLPS that closely resembles the human disease. Tumor incidence rates were 8% in p53 wild-type zebrafish, 6% in p53 heterozygotes, and 29% in p53-homozygous mutant zebrafish (P = 0.013), indicating that aberrant Akt activation collaborates with p53 mutation in WDLPS pathogenesis. Analysis of primary clinical specimens of WDLPS, and of the closely related dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) subtype, revealed immunohistochemical evidence of AKT activation in 27% of cases. Western blot analysis of a panel of cell lines derived from patients with WDLPS or DDLPS revealed robust AKT phosphorylation in all cell lines examined, even when these cells were cultured in serum-free media. Moreover, BEZ235, a small molecule inhibitor of PI3K and mammalian target of rapamycin that effectively inhibits AKT activation in these cells, impaired viability at nanomolar concentrations. Our findings are unique in providing an animal model to decipher the molecular pathogenesis of WDLPS, and implicate AKT as a previously unexplored therapeutic target in this chemoresistant sarcoma.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3asarcoma 3aviability 3adrug therapy 3ahumans 3amutation 3aheterozygosity 3aWestern blotting 3acultured cells 3aanimal models 3apatients 3aphosphorylation 3apathogenesis 3aDanio rerio 0achemotherapy1 aSnyder, Eric L.1 aMarino-Enriquez, Adrian1 aZhang, Yi-Xiang1 aSioletic, Stefano1 aKozakewich, Elena1 aGrebliunaite, Ruta1 aOu, Wen-bin1 aSicinska, Ewa1 aRaut, Chandrajit P.1 aDemetri, George D.1 aPerez-Atayde, Antonio R.1 aWagner, Andrew J.1 aFletcher, Jonathan A.1 aFletcher, Christopher D.

Due to the incomplete replication of linear chromosomes by DNA polymerase, telomeric DNA shortens with repeated cell divisions until the telomeres reach a critical length, at which point the cells enter senescence. Telomere length is an indicator of biological aging, and dysfunction of telomeres is linked to age-related pathologies like cardiovascular disease, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease and cancer. Telomere length has been shown to be positively associated with nutritional status in human and animal studies. Various nutrients influence telomere length potentially through mechanisms that reflect their role in cellular functions including inflammation, oxidative stress, DNA integrity, DNA methylation and activity of telomerase, the enzyme that adds the telomeric repeats to the ends of the newly synthesized DNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aDNA repair 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aParkinson disease 3adiet 3aneoplasms 3anutrients 3anutritional status 3aoxidative stress 3aproteins 3atelomeres 2aAnimals 2aDNAxchemistry 2aDNA Methylation 2aDNA Repair 2aDiet 2aHumans 2aNutritional Statusxphysiology 2aTelomerasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTelomerexmetabolism0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2011 Oct., v. 22, no. 10 p.895-901dElsevier Inc.x0955-28637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2010.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01632naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245009800173300001800271520057100289592002800860650002000888650001200908650001700920650002200937650000900959650002200968700001900990700001801009700001501027700001901042773010101061856008801162990002301250852000901273655001201282IND60098508420221123030631.0141104e20110315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009850842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.08.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xiao-Jun10aProtective effect of calcium folinate against methotrexate-induced endosalpinx damage in rats  ap. 1526-1530.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of calcium folinate (CF) applied in 10% of the methotrexate (MTX) dosage against morphologic and steroid-receptor damage induced by MTX in rat endosalpinx.

Histological validation of the metrics derived from dMRI methods are needed to fully characterize their ability to capture biologically-relevant histological features non-invasively. The data described here were used to correlate metrics derived from dMRI and quantitative histology in an animal model of axonal degeneration (“Histological validation of per-bundle water diffusion metrics within a region of fiber crossing following axonal degeneration” [1]). Unilateral retinal ischemia/reperfusion was induced in 10 rats, by the elevation of pressure of the anterior chamber of the eye for 90 min. Five rats were used as controls. After five weeks, injured animals were intracardially perfused to analyze the optic nerves and chiasm with dMRI and histology. This resulted in 15 brain scans, each with 80 diffusion-sensitizing gradient directions with b = 2000 and 2500 s/mm² and 20 non-diffusion-weighted images (b = 0 s/mm²), with isometric voxel resolution of 125 μm³. Histological sections were obtained after dMRI. Optical microscopy photomicrographs of the optic nerves (stained with toluidine blue) are available, as well as their corresponding automatic segmentations of axons and myelin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3abrain 3aeyes 3ahistology 3aischemia 3alight microscopy 3amagnetism 3amyelin sheath 3anerve tissue 3arats 3atoluidine blue 0aDiffusion 0aMagnetic resonance imaging 0aAxonal degeneration 0aCrossing fibers 0aRetinal ischemia 0aMicrostructure1 aRojas-Vite, Gilberto1 aCoronado Leija, Ricardo,1 aRamírez-Manzanares, Alonso1 aMarroquin, J.

The objective of this study was to identify the variation in root plasticity across commonly grown Australian wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars in response to a phosphorus (P)‐enriched band. Ten wheat cultivars were screened for root proliferation within a 150 mg P kg⁻¹ band in P‐responsive soil. Plants were destructively harvested at the four‐leaf phenological stage and various growth parameters, including root length density (RLD), were measured on banded and uniformly adequate P treatments. All wheat cultivars increased RLD between three and nine times in the P band. However, there was no significant difference in root plasticity among the cultivars tested. Although all cultivars produced longer, though ≈ 9% thinner roots when responding to the P band, the phenotypic response was unable to compensate fully for the lower P status encountered in the soil. Despite 23% longer root lengths in the P‐band treatments, P uptake per unit root length was 78% lower than in uniformly adequate P treatments. Our results indicate that root plasticity of wheat cultivars in a P‐enriched band was phenotypically similar. Further research is necessary before selecting for wheat cultivars that respond to localised nutrient patches with increased RLD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3acultivars 3aphenology 3aphenotype 3aphosphorus 3aplasticity 3aroots 3asoil 3awheat1 aGuppy, Chris N.1 aTighe, Matthew K.1 aFlavel, Richard J.1 aYoung, Iain M.0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2017 Apr., v. 180, no. 2 p.169-177dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl64178x1436-87307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.2016005033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01961naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245010900154300002000263520083100283592002801114650001101142650002301153650002101176650001301197650001801210650001401228650001301242650001701255700001501272700001401287700001701301700001801318700001901336700001201355773012501367856007401492852000901566655001201575IND60641164720221120220810.0190505e20160902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064116472DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra18720j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Yang12aA porous ternary PtPdCu alloy with a spherical network structure for electrocatalytic methanol oxidation  ap. 83373-83379.  aA porous ternary alloy Pt₅PdCu₅ was prepared via hydrothermal reaction in a water–ethylene glycol mixed solvent by using the block copolymer Pluronic P123 as a structure-directing agent. The as-prepared Pt₅PdCu₅ alloy exhibits a unique spherical porous network structure with a high specific surface area of 86.9 m² g⁻¹, which represented one of the highest values reported for Pt-based nanostructures. In contrast, a Pt₅PdCu₅ alloy with a normal sponge-like porous network structure was obtained under the same synthetic conditions in the absence of P123.

We designed a two-step experiment by first exposing juvenile turbot to harbour sediment for 26 days and then transferring them to clean sea water with different frequencies of feeding for 35 days. Without food limitation, fish previously exposed to contaminated sediment compensated for weight, length and lipid reserve losses; we did not record any differences in size, Fulton’s K condition index and triacylglycerol/sterol (TAG/ST) ratio after the 35-day depuration period compared to the reference fish. This result could be related to the compensatory growth mechanism observed in a wide range of fish species following a period of growth depression. With food limitation during the 35-day depuration period, recovery growth was not sufficient to restore length and weight values similar to the reference fish. Moreover, turbot previously exposed to contaminated sediment and subsequently fed twice or once a week exhibited extremely low TAG/ST ratios, but the reference fish submitted to the same restrictive feeding conditions did not. This study indicates that juvenile fish affected by chemical pollution can improve their biological performance if pollution events are followed by a period of abundant food. However, if pollution events occur during periods of food scarcity, e.g. in winter, storage of energy reserves will be compromised.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScophthalmus maximus 3acleaning 3acompensatory growth 3aenergy 3ajuveniles 3apollution 3aseawater 3asediments 3atriacylglycerols 3aturbot 3awinter1 aHenry, F.1 aRabhi, K.1 aAmara, R.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2014 Dec., v. 21, no. 23 p.13488-13495dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-3281-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245009600172300001600268520167000284592002801954650001401982650002301996650001402019650001002033650002002043650002002063650001802083650001002101650001502111650001202126650001202138650001202150650001502162650002402177650001002201650001602211650001102227650002302238650001302261650001502274651001602289700002102305700001902326773008402345856008102429852000902510655001202519IND60515196820221122004252.0160312e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051519682DNAL7 a10.1007/s10646-016-1613-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarpenter, Joanna K.14aThe effect of two glyphosate formulations on a small, diurnal lizard (Oligosoma polychroma)  ap. 548-554.  aFormulations of glyphosate-based herbicides continue to dominate the global herbicide market, while there continue to be concerns regarding the impact of this herbicide on non-target organisms. Research also indicates that the additives within certain glyphosate formulations, such as surfactants, are actually more toxic than the glyphosate active ingredient alone. Concerns arise in particular when glyphosate formulations are proposed for vegetation control in areas inhabited by rare or threatened species. Although the effect of glyphosate on birds and mammals is well studied, reptiles remain neglected in ecotoxicological studies. We investigated whether dermal exposure to two different commercial glyphosate formulations affected performance measures in the New Zealand common skink (Oligosoma polychroma). Fifty-eight skinks were each placed in a box of straw to simulate field conditions and sprayed once with Agpro Glyphosate 360, Yates Roundup Weedkiller (both at the label-specified concentrations of 144 mg glyphosate per 1 L water), or water (control). Agpro Glyphosate 360 contained ethoxylated tallow amine at a concentration of <200 g/L, while the surfactant within Yates Roundup Weedkiller was unknown. Following treatment skinks were kept in captivity and sampled for selected temperature and mass over a four-week period. Neither glyphosate formulation had a significant impact on mass. However, skinks treated with Yates Roundup Weedkiller selected significantly higher temperatures across 3 weeks following exposure. This heat-seeking behaviour could be a fever response to increase metabolism and thereby counteract physiological stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScincidae 3aactive ingredients 3aadditives 3abirds 3acaptive animals 3adermal exposure 3aecotoxicology 3afever 3aglyphosate 3alizards 3amammals 3amarkets 3ametabolism 3anontarget organisms 3astraw 3asurfactants 3atallow 3athreatened species 3atoxicity 3avegetation 3aNew Zealand1 aMonks, Joanne M.1 aNelson, Nicola0 tEcotoxicology.g2016 Apr., v. 25, no. 3 p.548-554dSpringer USx0963-92927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-016-1613-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03732naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245012200211300001600333520228900349592002802638650001902666650002102685650002302706650001502729650001902744650001502763650001002778650001602788650002502804650001402829650001002843650002502853651001102878653001502889653003402904653002502938653000802963653002002971653001802991700001703009700002403026773011703050856008603167852000903253655001203262IND60562653820221123000853.0181015e20170515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056265382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.01.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKårelid, Victor1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1621-432110aEffects of recirculation in a three-tank pilot-scale system for pharmaceutical removal with powdered activated carbon  ap. 163-171.  aThe removal of pharmaceutically active compounds by powdered activated carbon (PAC) in municipal wastewater is a promising solution to the problem of polluted recipient waters. Today, an efficient design strategy is however lacking with regard to high-level overall, and specific, substance removal in the large scale. The performance of PAC-based removal of pharmaceuticals was studied in pilot-scale with respect to the critical parameters; contact time and PAC dose using one PAC product selected by screening in bench-scale. The goal was a minimum of 95% removal of the pharmaceuticals present in the evaluated municipal wastewater. A set of 21 pharmaceuticals was selected from an initial 100 due to their high occurrence in the effluent water of two selected wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Sweden, whereof candidates discussed for future EU regulation directives were included. By using recirculation of PAC over a treatment system using three sequential contact tanks, a combination of the benefits of powdered and granular carbon performance was achieved. The treatment system was designed so that recirculation could be introduced to any of the three tanks to investigate the effect of recirculation on the adsorption performance. This was compared to use of the setup, but without recirculation. A higher degree of pharmaceutical removal was achieved in all recirculation setups, both overall and with respect to specific substances, as compared to without recirculation. Recirculation was tested with nominal contact times of 30, 60 and 120 min and the goal of 95% removal could be achieved already at the shortest contact times at a PAC dose of 10–15 mg/L. In particular, the overall removal could be increased even to 97% and 99%, at 60 and 120 min, respectively, when the recirculation point was the first tank. Recirculation of PAC to either the first or the second contact tank proved to be comparable, while a slightly lower performance was observed with recirculation to the third tank. With regards to individual substances, clarithromycin and diclofenac were ubiquitously removed according to the set goal and in contrast, a few substances (fluconazole, irbesartan, memantine and venlafaxine) required specific settings to reach an acceptable removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aactivated carbon 3aactive ingredients 3aadsorption 3aclarithromycin 3adiclofenac 3adrugs 3afluconazole 3amunicipal wastewater 3ascreening 3atanks 3awastewater treatment 3aSweden 0aAdsorption 0aAdvanced wastewater treatment 0aMunicipal wastewater 0aPAC 0aPharmaceuticals 0aRecirculation1 aLarsson, Gen1 aBjörlenius, Berndt0 tJournal of environmental management.g2017 May 15, v. 193 p.163-171dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.01.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01570naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245010000162300001800262520057300280592002800853650001700881650002300898650002300921650001500944650001100959700002300970700001900993700002001012700002101032773010701053856007501160852000901235655001201244IND60578757420221119223309.0170814e20140905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057875742DNAL7 a10.1021/ol502203y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFallows, Andrew

These problems have worsened as water demands have increased. Egypt’s Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation is currently trying to avoid water deficits by returning agricultural drainage water to the irrigation canals. In the Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate, some canals have an oversupply in some months and deficits in others. Ministry officials started a project by constructing culverts connected canal ends with the main drain (Bhr Nashrat) to provide supplemental agricultural drainage backflows (SADB) channeled through these culverts. However, this return is not controlled, and flows are based only on differences in the hydraulic head. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of SADB to counteract water shortages when the water supply from head regulators (WSHR) is insufficient. Our analysis considered the adequacy of the water supply and indicators of dependability and equity of supply. We tested two water supply conditions: (1) WSHR only and (2) WSHR plus SADB. During the summer (May–September) of 2008, SADB significantly improved the system’s ability to meet the irrigation water requirements (IWR) in some months. Adequacy and dependability, therefore, improved from “fair” to “good.” During the following winter (October–April), SADB improved adequacy and equity only in March and April, since water availability was generally sufficient under WSHR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aculverts 3adrainage 3adrainage water 3afarmers 3airrigation canals 3airrigation systems 3airrigation water 3aquantitative analysis 3ariver deltas 3asummer 3awater shortages 3awinter 3aEgypt1 aKitamura, Y.1 aShimizu, K.1 aAbou El Hassan, W.1 aFujimaki, H.0 tPaddy and water environment.g2015 Oct., v. 13, no. 4 p.367-378dSpringer Japanx1611-24907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10333-014-0454-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245013900209300001200348520132700360592002801687650001301715650001601728650002701744650001101771650001501782650001501797650001501812650003301827650002401860650001101884650001501895650002501910653001201935653002301947653000901970653002401979653003302003653002502036700006202061700002502123700001802148773011302166856008602279852000902365655001202374IND60562653920221123000828.0181015e20170515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056265392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.01.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaodong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6333-374010aStatistical monitoring and dynamic simulation of a wastewater treatment plant: A combined approach to achieve model predictive control  ap. 1-7.  aThe on-line monitoring of Chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total phosphorus (TP) restrains wastewater treatment plants to achieve better control of aeration and chemical dosing. In this study, we applied principal components analysis (PCA) to find out significant variables for COD and TP prediction. Multiple regression method applied the variables suggested by PCA to predict influent COD and TP. Moreover, a model of full-scale wastewater treatment plant with moving bed bioreactor (MBBR) and ballasted separation process was developed to simulate the performance of wastewater treatment. The predicted COD and TP data by multiple regression served as model input for dynamic simulation. Besides, the wastewater characteristic of the wastewater treatment plant and MBBR model parameters were given for model calibration. As a result, R² of predicted COD and TP versus measured data are 81.6% and 77.2%, respectively. The model output in terms of sludge production and effluent COD based on predicted input data fitted measured data well, which provides possibility to enabled model predictive control of aeration and coagulant dosing in practice. This study provide a feasible and economical approach to overcome monitoring and modelling restrictions that limits model predictive control of wastewater treatment plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3abioreactors 3achemical oxygen demand 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aphosphorus 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3aregression analysis 3asludge 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aControl 0aDynamic simulation 0aMBBR 0aMultiple regression 0aPrincipal component analysis 0aWastewater treatment1 aRatnaweera, Harsha1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1456-25411 aHolm, Johan Abdullah1 aOlsbu, Vibeke0 tJournal of environmental management.g2017 May 15, v. 193 p.1-7dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.01.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245011700162300001600279500002000295520146400315592002801779650001301807650001501820650001101835650002201846650001501868650002601883650001501909650001901924650001901943650002201962650001501984650001101999650001902010650001002029650001002039650000902049650001702058650001602075650001502091700002202106700002202128773015102150856007802301852000902379655001202388IND60587954020180301000000.0180103e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058795402DNAL7 a10.1002/jpln.2016000402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNadav, Itamar10aWater repellency reduction using soil heating in infiltration ponds of a wastewater soil aquifer treatment (SAT)  ap. 142-152.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aReuse of treated wastewater (TWW) for irrigation in agriculture is a common alternative water source in arid regions suffering from fresh water (FW) shortage. Soil aquifer treatment (SAT) is frequently used for advanced TWW purification. Infiltration rates of water through the soil can decrease as a consequence of organic matter (OM) accumulation and the consequent induction of water repellency. In this research, soil heating to high temperatures was examined for its efficiency in OM content reduction and increased infiltration. In a laboratory experiment conducted using a hand burner and a combustion oven, water repellency was found to be reduced following increased heating temperature or heating duration, directly resulting in reduction of OM level. Chemical analysis of OM extracted from the heat treated soils revealed reduction in hydrophobic substances as a consequence of increased temperatures by soil heating and heating duration. In model ponds built to simulate large infiltration basins, OM content was reduced as a result of intensive and moderate soil heating in comparison to the untreated pond. However, no reduction in water repellency and only slight changes in infiltration rate were found as a consequence of soil heating. The differences in results obtained in the laboratory and the field experiments were probably related to the fact that the soil in the field experiment has been continuously reloaded with TWW containing OM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aarid zones 3abasins 3achemical analysis 3acombustion 3afield experimentation 3afreshwater 3aheat treatment 3ahydrophobicity 3ainfiltration rate 3airrigation 3amodels 3aorganic matter 3aovens 3aponds 3asoil 3asoil heating 3atemperature 3awastewater1 aTarchitzky, Jorge1 aChen, Y.q(Yona),0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2017 Apr., v. 180, no. 2 p.142-152dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl64178x1436-87307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.2016000403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01344naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245012700158300001800285520035900303592002800662650001200690650001100702650002300713650002300736650002500759700001900784700001900803700001700822773010700839856007500946852000901021655001201030IND60578757620221119223257.0170814e20140905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057875762DNAL7 a10.1021/ol502208w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Sangjune10aDiastereoselective N-Sulfonylaminoalkenylation of Azulenes from Terminal Alkynes and Azides via N-Sulfonyl-1,2,3-triazoles  ap. 4468-4471.  aThe development of rhodium-catalyzed diastereoselective N-sulfonylaminoalkenylation of azulenes using N-sulfonyltriazoles is described.

However, under climate change circumstances, AWD can be optimized when taking advantage of favorable water seasonality conditions to increase crop yield and irrigation water use efficiency. Therefore, a field trial was conducted to find suitable water depth for reducing rice irrigation water use by combining four different water depth treatments (T₂cₘ, T₃cₘ, T₄cₘ, and T₅cₘ) with rainfall through a randomized complete block design having 3 replications. Water depths were applied weekly from transplanting to heading. The results showed that water stress at vegetative stage decreased plant height and tillers number between 7 and 33 % at panicle initiation, followed by total and partial growth recovery. In addition, panicle number per hill showed a 53–180 % decrease at the heading stage. Severe water stress induced by the lowest water treatment significantly reduced yield components between 15 and 52 % at harvest. It was found that weekly application of 3 cm water depth combined with rainfall improved AWD effectiveness, and yielded the highest beneficial water productivity with less yield expenses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3adrying 3afield experimentation 3aheading 3ahills 3ainflorescences 3airrigation 3airrigation water 3amonsoon season 3apaddies 3arain 3arice 3atillers 3atropics 3auncertainty 3avegetative growth 3awater stress 3awater treatment 3awater use efficiency 3ayield components 3aTaiwan1 aChung, Wen Guey1 aWang, Yumin,1 aTraoré, Seydou,0 tPaddy and water environment.g2015 Oct., v. 13, no. 4 p.379-389dSpringer Japanx1611-24907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10333-014-0458-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245013800167300001800305520192700323592002802250596006302278650003402341650001902375650001902394650001802413650001302431650001602444700002102460700001802481700001802499700002002517700005702537773012202594856008302716852000902799655001202808IND60774588820221121223640.0220421e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077458882DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-022-07100-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoner, Sougata10aEffect of interface coupling between polarization and magnetization in La0.7Pb0.3MnO3 (LPMO)/P(VDF-TrFE) flexible nanocomposite films  ap. 7621-7641.  aLa₀.₇Pb₀.₃MnO₃(LPMO) nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by sol–gel auto-combustion method. These were embedded in P(VDF-TrFE) to form (0–3) nanocomposite (NC) films by solution casting method for 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 vol.% of LPMO. Phase and morphology studies on LPMO NPs reveal R-3c structure and mean particle size of (61.03 ± 17.41) nm, respectively. The XRD and SEM studies on LPMO/P(VDF-TrFE) nanocomposite films confirm the presence of constitutive phases and dispersion of LPMO particle in P(VDF-TrFE) matrix. There is increase in permittivity of NC films (above 1 vol.% of LPMO) in low frequency region (< 1 kHz) due to MWS effect. The observation of low DC leakage current density (~ 10⁻⁶A/mm²) at application of high field and low tangent loss (< 0.01) for NC films signifies presence of very small free charge carriers in NC films. Proper ferroelectric loop is obtained for NC film up to 2 vol.% of LPMO in polymer matrix. Magnetization (M) measurements of LPMO NPs confirm the ferromagnetic nature and the existence of Curie temperature at ~ 357 K of these NPs. M-H characteristics for NC films demonstrate the increase in magnetization of NC films with increase in volume percentage of NPs. The interface coupling between ferroelectric polarization and magnetization in NC films was verified by measuring magnetoelectric (ME) coupling coefficient of these NC films. A maximum ME coupling coefficient ([Formula: see text]) of 170.15 mV/Oe-cm is observed for NC films having 0.2 LPMO vol.% with a self-bias voltage of 12.68 mV. A negative MD effect is observed in NC films, and a maximum magneto-dielectric coupling (MDC%) of − 6.4 at 0.7 T is also witnessed for NC films having 5 LPMO vol.%. Interface coupled phenomenon by polarization and magnetization in LPMO/P(VDF-TrFE) thick film results in excellent magnetoelectric (ME) and magneto-dielectric (MD) coefficients.  aPublisher supplied data  aLT830006cDepartment of Atomic Energy, Government of India 3aelectric potential difference 3aferromagnetism 3ananocomposites 3aparticle size 3apolymers 3atemperature1 aDeshmukh, Pratik1 aAhlawat, Anju1 aSingh, Rashmi1 aMajumder, S.

In this study, the first exonization event was detected when the modified rice EPSPS marker gene was inserted with the Ac transposon 5′ end, which provided a splice donor site to yield abundant novel transcripts. To assess the contribution of splice donor and acceptor sites of transposon sequences, we inserted a Ds element into each intron of the EPSPS marker gene. This process yielded 14 constructs, with the Ds transposon inserted in the forward and reverse direction in each of the 7 introns of the EPSPS marker gene. The constructs were transformed into tobacco plants, and novel transcripts were identified by RT-PCR with specific primers. Exonization of Ds in EPSPS was biased towards providing splice donor sites of the inserted Ds sequence. Additionally, when the Ds inserted in reverse direction, a continuous splice donor consensus region was determined by offering 4 donor sites in the same intron. Information on these exonization events may help enhance gene divergence and functional genomic studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3arice 3atransposons 3atransposition (genetics) 3atobacco 3aexons 3aintrons 3agenetic markers 2aAlternative Splicing 2aBase Sequence 2aConsensus Sequence 2aDNA Transposable Elementsxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aExons 2aIntrons 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNonsense Mediated mRNA Decay 2aPlant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aProtein Isoformsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aRNA Splice Sites 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Plantxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0agenes1 aYang, Xiujun,1 aLi, Kuan-Te1 aLiu, Li-yu Daisy1 aCharng, Yuh-Chyang0 tPlant molecular biology.g2012 July, v. 79, no. 4-5 p.509-519dSpringer-Verlagx0167-44127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-012-9927-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012000167300001600287520118700303592002801490650002101518650001501539650001301554650001501567650000901582650003001591650001201621650001201633650001701645650002501662650002201687650001401709650001501723650001501738653003701753653001601790653002401806653002101830653002001851653005701871700005601928700001701984700001202001700002202013773010302035856008502138852000902223655001202232IND60562654020221122215126.0170307e20170501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056265402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.01.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ranbin10aEmbedding constructed wetland in sequencing batch reactor for enhancing nutrients removal: A comparative evaluation  ap. 302-308.  aIn the present study, a novel green bio-sorption reactor (GBR) was firstly proposed and preliminarily investigated by embedding constructed wetland (CW) into the aeration tank of the conventional activated sludge (CAS). This integrated novel system owns the striking features of adding carriers of wetland substrate (i.e. the dewatered alum sludge in this case) in CAS for robust phosphorus adsorption and enriching the biomass. Meanwhile, the “green” feature of this GBR imparted aesthetic value of CW to the CAS system. The preliminary 3-month trial of GBR based on a sequencing batch reactor (GB-SBR) with diluted piggery wastewater demonstrated an average removal of 96%, 99% and 90% for BOD, TP and TN, respectively. The comparison with moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) and integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) reflected the advantages of GBR over purification performance, aesthetic value and potential carbon sink. Moreover, the carriers used in the GBR are dewatered alum sludge which is in line with the policy of “recycle, reuse and reduce”. Overall, this GBR undoubtedly offered a more sustainable and economical solution for retrofitting the aging CAS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aadsorption 3aaeration 3aaesthetics 3aalum 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abiofilm 3abiomass 3acarbon sinks 3aconstructed wetlands 3aissues and policy 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3awastewater 0aGreen bio-sorption reactor (GBR) 0aAlum sludge 0aConstructed wetland 0aActivated sludge 0aAesthetic value 0aSimultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND)1 aZhao, Yaqian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2449-43701 aZhao, Jinhui1 aXu, Lei1 aSibille, Caroline0 tJournal of environmental management.g2017 May 01, v. 192 p.302-308dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.01.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02022naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245010800174300001800282520099200300592002801292650001001320650002201330650001301352700002301365700001901388700002601407700002401433700002001457773009801477856008901575990002301664852000901687655001201696IND60098509020221123030726.0141104e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009850902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.07.10622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLedig, Susanne10aRecurrent aberrations identified by array-CGH in patients with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome  ap. 1589-1594.  aOBJECTIVE: To identify genetic causes of Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome. DESIGN: Prospective laboratory study. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENT(S): Fifty-six patients with MRKH syndrome. INTERVENTION(S): Identification of microdeletions and –duplications in a group of 48 MRKH patients by array-CGH. Results obtained by array-CGH were confirmed by RT-qPCR. Sequential analysis of two candidate genes LHX1 and HNF1B in a group of 56 MRKH patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Identification of chromosomal regions and genes (recurrent and private) associated with MRKH syndrome. RESULT(S): We could delineate three definitively relevant regions (1q21.1, 17q12, and 22q11.21) and suggest that LHX1 und HNF1B are candidate genes for MRKH syndrome, because we identified recurrent deletions affecting these genes and a possible causative missense mutation in LHX1.

This is usually made in order to add value, reduce costs, and improve the environment, and therefore has been taken as an effective approach for developing an eco-industrial park, improving resource efficiency, and reducing pollutant emission. Most conventional evaluation approaches ignored the contribution of natural ecosystem to the development of industrial symbiosis and cannot reveal the interrelations between economic development and environmental protection, leading to a need of an innovative evaluation method. Under such a circumstance, we present an emergy analysis-based evaluation method by employing a case study at Shenyang Economic and Technological Development Zone (SETDZ). Specific emergy indicators on industrial symbiosis, including emergy savings and emdollar value of total emergy savings, were developed so that the holistic picture of industrial symbiosis can be presented. Research results show that nonrenewable inputs, imported resource inputs, and associated services could be saved by 89.3, 32.51, and 15.7 %, and the ratio of emergy savings to emergy of the total energy used would be about 25.58 %, and the ratio of the emdollar value of total emergy savings to the total gross regional product (GRP) of SETDZ would be 34.38 % through the implementation of industrial symbiosis. In general, research results indicate that industrial symbiosis could effectively reduce material and energy consumption and improve the overall eco-efficiency. Such a method can provide policy insights to industrial park managers so that they can raise appropriate strategies on developing eco-industrial parks. Useful strategies include identifying more potential industrial symbiosis opportunities, optimizing energy structure, increasing industrial efficiency, recovering local ecosystems, and improving public and industrial awareness of eco-industrial park policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aeco-efficiency 3aecosystems 3aemergy 3aenvironmental protection 3aindustrial symbiosis 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3aparks 3aChina1 aLiu, Zuoxi1 aXue, Bing1 aDong, Huijuan1 aFujita, Tsuyoshi1 aChiu, Anthony0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2014 Dec., v. 21, no. 23 p.13572-13587dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-3287-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245018600168520113000354592002801484650002601512650001601538650001701554650001901571650002001590650001201610650002101622650001001643650003001653650002301683653001501706653001501721653001501736653001001751653001001761700002101771700002201792700005601814773009401870856008101964852000902045655001202054IND60725106520221119105249.0210124e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072510652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2019.1044052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHakim, Joseph A.10aHigh-throughput amplicon sequencing datasets of the metacommunity DNA of the gut microbiota of naturally occurring and laboratory aquaculture green sea urchins Lytechinus variegatus  aWe present high-throughput amplicon sequence (HTS) datasets of the microbial metacommunity DNA of the gut tissue and the gut digesta of naturally occurring (n = 3) and laboratory aquaculture (n = 2) green sea urchins, Lytechinus variegatus. The HTS datasets were generated on an Illumina MiSeq by targeting the amplicons of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. After the raw sequences were quality checked and filtered, 88% of the sequence reads were subjected to bioinformatics analyses to generate operation taxonomic units (OTUs), which were then verified for saturation by using rarefaction analysis at a 3% sequence variation. Further, the OTUs were randomly subsampled to the minimum sequence count values. Then, the FASTA-formatted representative sequences of the microbiota were assigned taxonomic identities through multiple databases using the SILVA ACT: Alignment, Classification and Tree Service (www.arb-silva.de/aligner).

The most effective strategy under given conditions is often unclear to these stakeholders as it requires insight into several aspects of the contaminants such as sources, properties, and mitigation options. Furthermore the various parties in the urban water cycle are not always aware of each other's requirements and priorities. Processes to set priorities and come to agreements are lacking, hampering the articulation and implementation of possible solutions.To support decision makers with this task, a decision support system was developed to serve as a point of departure for getting the relevant stakeholders together and finding common ground. The decision support system was iteratively developed in stages. Stakeholders were interviewed and a decision support system prototype developed. Subsequently, this prototype was evaluated by the stakeholders and adjusted accordingly. The iterative process lead to a final system focused on the management of contaminants of emerging concern within the urban water cycle, from wastewater, surface water and groundwater to drinking water, that suggests mitigation methods beyond technical solutions. Possible wastewater and drinking water treatment techniques in combination with decentralised and non-technical methods were taken into account in an integrated way. The system contains background information on contaminants of emerging concern such as physical/chemical characteristics, toxicity and legislative frameworks, water cycle entrance pathways and a database with associated possible mitigation methods. Monitoring data can be uploaded to assess environmental and human health risks in a specific water system.

The muscles free amino acid profile (FAA) was not influenced by nitrifying salts. The pH24 was the factor which had the greatest consequences on the dry-cured ham characteristics analysed. The increase in nicotinamide and decrease in pyridoxine by curing salts and the decrease in both vitamins by pH24, had no major effect on the nutritional value of the dry-cured ham because the remaining amounts were within the intervals found in the nutritional data base for dry-cured ham. The results obtained suggested a cooperative action of vitamins B3 and B6 and the antioxidant enzyme system against oxidation. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were reduced by the addition of curing salts but were low in all cases, suggesting high antioxidant stability in dry-cured ham which was corroborated by the low volatile aldehyde contents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3aantioxidants 3adatabases 3aenzymes 3afree amino acids 3aham 3alegs 3amuscles 3anicotinamide 3anutrition 3anutritive value 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stability 3apH 3apyridoxine 3ariboflavin 3asalts 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 0aDry-cured ham 0apH24 0aCuring salts 0aB vitamins 0aAmino acids 0aOxidative stability1 aSárraga, C.1 aCastellari, M.1 aValero, A.1 aGarcía Regueiro, J.A.1 aArnau, J.0 tFood chemistry.g2013 Dec. 01, v. 141, no. 3 p.3207-3214dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.06.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01653naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006000149245013900209300001800348500002900366520044200395592002800837650001100865650001900876650001400895700001700909700002100926700001900947700002400966700005900990700005301049773012101102856008301223852000901306655001201315IND60718145720221118083033.0201120e20201030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071814572DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c032552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoritate, Makoto1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2182-391410aSynthesis of DFGH-Ring Derivatives of Physalins via One-Pot Construction of GH-Ring and Evaluation of Their NF-κB-Inhibitory Activity  ap. 8877-8881.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aWe designed and synthesized a series of derivatives containing the right-side DFGH-ring structure of physalin-type natural products, decorated with a hydrophobic substituent.

DESIGN: Prospective clinical research study. SETTING: Academic reproductive medicine center. PATIENT(S): Eighteen couples carrying a balanced reciprocal or Robertsonian chromosomal rearrangement. INTERVENTION(S): PGD on blastocyst trophectoderm biopsy specimens. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Aneuploidy, implantation, pregnancy, and delivery rates after SNP microarray–based aneuploidy and translocation screening. RESULT(S): Single nucleotide polymorphism microarray was capable of detecting translocation-associated imbalances as small as 9.0 megabases. In the 12 transfers performed, sustained implantation occurred for 9 (45%) of 20 balanced-normal and euploid embryos replaced. The clinical pregnancy rate in patients receiving a transfer was 75% with six singleton deliveries and three ongoing singleton pregnancies thus far. Significantly fewer embryos were eligible for transfer with the incorporation of simultaneous 24-chromosome aneuploidy screening. Arrested embryos were also significantly more likely to possess unbalanced chromosomes when compared with developmentally competent blastocysts. CONCLUSION(S): This SNP microarray–based method provides the first opportunity to improve outcomes through comprehensive identification of euploid embryos from translocation carrier couples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaneuploidy 3abiopsy 3ablastocyst 3achromosome translocation 3achromosomes 3ahumans 3amedicine 3amicroarray technology 3apatients 3apolyploidy 3apregnancy rate 3ascreening 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aNorthrop, Lesley E.1 aKasabwala, Khushabu1 aSu, Jing1 aLevy, Brynn1 aScott, Richard T., Jr.cJr.0 tFertility and sterility.g2011 Apr., v. 95, no. 5 p.1606-1612.e2dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.11.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01813naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245014000171300001800311500002900329520052100358592002800879650001600907650002300923650002500946650002300971650001800994650001601012650001401028650001201042650001001054700001901064700001701083700005901100700005501159773012101214856008301335852000901418655001201427IND60718145820221118083034.0201120e20201104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071814582DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c032612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Long-Sheng10aAsymmetric Hydrogenation of 2-Aryl-3-phthalimidopyridinium Salts: Synthesis of Piperidine Derivatives with Two Contiguous Stereocenters  ap. 8882-8887.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aAsymmetric hydrogenation of 2-aryl-3-phthalimidopyridinium salts catalyzed by the Ir/SegPhos catalytic system was described, leading to the corresponding chiral piperidine derivatives bearing two contiguous chiral centers, with high levels of enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities.

In this study, non-precious metal ORR electrocatalysts derived by the encapsulation of Co nanoparticles in N-doped graphene nanoshells were synthesized by a typical one-step pyrolysis process. Compared with commercial Pt/C catalysts, the prepared Co-30@N-G hybrid electrocatalyst showed a high ORR activity at the same level in an alkaline medium. Subsequently, the Co-30@N-G hybrid electrocatalyst has been used as a cathode of Zn–air batteries, which displays equivalent performance to the systems derived using a commercial Pt/C catalyst. The Co-30@N-G derived mechanical rechargeable Zn–air battery showed a persistent flat discharge curve with minimum voltage loss at a high discharge rate of 40 mA cm⁻². The robustness of the Co-30@N-G ORR catalyst can allow the batteries to work constantly by periodically replacing the Zn anode and electrolyte, presenting an efficient and economical cathode for Zn–air flow batteries or Zn–air fuel cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abatteries 3acatalysts 3acathodes 3acobalt 3adurability 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aencapsulation 3afuel cells 3agraphene 3ananoparticles 3apyrolysis 3azinc1 aChen, Guang-Yi1 aLiu, Jia-Ang1 aZhang, Zhi-Peng1 aSun, Peng1 aZhang, Wen-Zhuo1 aNiu, Fu1 aZhang, Wan-Xi1 aLiang, Ji-Cai0 tRSC advances.g2016 Sept. 20, v. 6, no. 93 p.90069-90075dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra18733a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245011600166300001600282500002000298520175300318592002802071650001902099650001302118650001902131650001102150650001202161650001502173650002602188650001902214650001902233650001102252650001702263650001702280700002202297700002002319773015102339856007802490852000902568655001202577IND60587954620180301000000.0180103e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058795462DNAL7 a10.1002/jpln.2016002042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMason-Jones, Kyle10aMineralization of “non‐metabolizable” glucose analogues in soil: potential chemosensory mimics of glucose  ap. 165-168.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGlucose is widely used to study the dynamics of easily available organics in soil. Pure culture studies have revealed that many microorganisms can sense and respond to glucose through chemosensory mechanisms that are not directly reliant on energy catabolism. However, the rapid mineralization of glucose by microorganisms makes it difficult to disentangle its energy effects from such non‐catabolic interactions. “Non‐metabolizable” glucose analogues have proven useful in mechanistic studies of glucose in pure culture, but have never been applied to complex microbial communities in soil. We sought to determine how their mineralization in soil differs from that of glucose, and whether they have potential as a new approach for investigating chemosensory mechanisms in soil microbiology. We incubated soil from an agricultural Haplic Luvisol under controlled conditions for 24 d and monitored CO₂ efflux after addition of (1) glucose, and three “non‐metabolizable” glucose analogues: (2) 2‐deoxyglucose (DG), (3) α‐methylglucoside (αMG), and (4) 3‐O‐methyl‐glucose (OMG), at three concentration levels, along with a control. All three analogues did in fact produce a large increase in soil CO₂ efflux, but the dynamics of their mineralization differed from the rapid degradation seen for glucose. At medium and high concentrations, CO₂ efflux peaked between 2.5 and 4 d after amendment with DG and αMG, and was delayed by about one week for OMG. The markedly different patterns of mineralization between glucose and OMG offer a new tool for investigating the behavior of glucose in soil. By using OMG as a glucose model, chemosensory mechanisms could be studied with limited interference from energy catabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2-deoxyglucose 3aLuvisols 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3aglucose 3ametabolism 3amicrobial communities 3amicroorganisms 3amineralization 3amodels 3asoil biology 3asoil ecology1 aGilmullina, Aliia1 aKuzyakov, Yakov0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2017 Apr., v. 180, no. 2 p.165-168dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl64178x1436-87307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.2016002043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02328naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140242007200157245008400229300001600313520105600329592002801385650001901413650001301432650001101445650001101456650001301467650001301480650001501493650001101508650002001519650001401539650000901553650001901562650001401581650001901595650001001614651001201624651001001636700002001646773013201666856007501798852000901873655001201882IND60439181020210608000000.0210608e200007  xx |||||o|||||||||||ger||7 aIND6043918102DNAL7 a10.1007/BF024622392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHampe, Arndt10aNahrungssuche und Vergesellschaftung frugivorer Zug- und Brutvögel10aForaging and flocking behaviour of migrating and resident frugivorous songbirds  ap. 300-308.  aMigrating birds that arrive at unknown stopover sites have to satisfy greater nutritive demands in restricted time and simultanously run a higher predation risk than residents which are familiar with the area. Foraging behaviour of resident and migrant frugivores feeding on fruits of Alder Buckthorn (Frangula alnus) was studied in Germany and Spain. German trees ripen their fruits during the autumn migration period, Spanish ones during the breeding and early postbreeding season. In both areas fruits were mainly eaten bySylvia warblers, Robin (Erithacus rubecula) and thrushes (Turdus sp.). At the stopover site birds spent less time in the tree, consumed more fruits per visit and therefore foraged more efficiently. In both areas birds clearly synchronized foraging bouts and formed intra- and interspecific assemblages, which were more frequent in migrants than in residents on the interspecific level. The influence of nutritive demands and predator avoidance upon the foraging behaviour and its consequences for seed dispersal are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFrangula alnus 3aTurdidae 3aTurdus 3aautumn 3abreeding 3aforaging 3afrugivores 3afruits 3amigratory birds 3apredation 3arisk 3aseed dispersal 3asongbirds 3astopover sites 3atrees 3aGermany 3aSpain1 aBairlein, Franz0 tJournal für Ornithologie.g2000 July, v. 141, no. 3 p.300-308dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949854x0021-83757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF024622393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02263naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245009400170300001600264520096700280592002801247650001501275650002501290650001401315650001101329650002001340650001001360650002501370653001601395653002901411653002801440653001601468653003501484653002301519700001901542700001801561700001901579700001701598700001801615773010101633856008601734852000901820655001201829IND60561837120221122220600.0170719e20170315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056183712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2016.12.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Benming10aCalibration methodology for energy management system of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle  ap. 240-248.  aThis paper presents a new analytical calibration method for energy management strategy designed for a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. This method improves the actual calibration efficiency to reach a compromise among the conflicting calibration requirements (e.g. emissions and economy). A comprehensive evaluating indicator covering emissions and economic performance is constructed by using a radar chart method. A radial basis functions (RBFs) neural network model is proposed to establish a precise model among control parameters and the comprehensive evaluation indicator. The optimal Latin hypercube design is introduced to obtain the experimental data to train the RBFs neural network model. And multi-island genetic algorithm is used to solve the optimization model. Finally, an offline calibration example is conducted. Results validate the effectiveness of the proposed calibration approach in improving vehicle performance and calibration efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aeconomic performance 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aneural networks 3aradar 3avehicles (equipment) 0aCalibration 0aEnergy management system 0aHybrid electric vehicle 0aRadar chart 0aOptimal Latin hypercube design 0aRBF neural network1 aWang, Qingnian1 aZeng, Xiaohua1 aGong, Yinsheng1 aSong, Dafeng1 aWang, Junnian0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2017 Mar. 15, v. 136 p.240-248dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.12.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245011700190300002000307520143000327592002801757650001301785650001901798650001601817650001101833650001301844650001801857650001401875650002601889650001201915650001001927650001201937650001301949650002201962650000701984650001801991650001402009650001602023651001402039700002302053700002202076700002202098700002202120700002402142773013802166856008102304852000902385655001202394IND60119098020221122052853.0141130e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011909802DNAL7 a250236572pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-014-3311-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález, Paola S.10aChromium (VI) remediation by a native strain: effect of environmental conditions and removal mechanisms involved  ap. 13551-13559.  aA native bacterial strain with high capability for Cr (VI) removal was isolated from tannery sediments located in Elena (Córdoba Province, Argentina). The strain was characterized by amplification of 16S rRNA gene and identified as Serratia sp. C8. It was able to efficiently remove different Cr (VI) concentrations in a wide range of pHs and temperatures. The addition of different carbon sources as well as initial inoculum concentration were analyzed, demonstrating that Serratia sp. C8 could reduce 80 % of 20 mg/L Cr (VI) in a medium containing glucose 1 g/L, at pH 6–7 and 28 °C as optimal conditions, using 5 % inoculum concentration. The mechanisms involved in Cr (VI) removal were also evaluated. The strain was capable of biosorpting around 7.5–8.5 % of 20 mg/L Cr on its cell surface and to reduce Cr (VI). In addition, approximately a 54 and 46 % of total Cr was detected in the biomass and in the culture medium, respectively, and in the culture medium, Cr (III) was the predominant species. In conclusion, Serratia sp. C8 removed Cr (VI) and the mechanisms involved in decreasing order of contribution were as follows: reduction catalyzed by intracellular enzymes, accumulation into the cells, and biosorption to the microbial biomass. This strain could be a suitable microorganism for Cr (VI) bioremediation of tannery sediments and effluents or even for other environments contaminated with Cr.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSerratia 3abioremediation 3abiosorption 3acarbon 3achromium 3aculture media 3aeffluents 3aenvironmental factors 3aenzymes 3agenes 3aglucose 3ainoculum 3amicrobial biomass 3apH 3aribosomal RNA 3asediments 3atemperature 3aArgentina1 aAmbrosio, Laura F.1 aPaisio, Cintia E.1 aTalano, Melina A.1 aMedina, María I.1 aAgostini, Elizabeth0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2014 Dec., v. 21, no. 23 p.13551-13559dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-3311-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245008900166300001800255500001900273500000900292520165700301592002801958650002401986650001102010650002202021650001702043650001402060650001402074650001202088650001402100650001402114650002502128650001202153650001802165650001002183650002102193650001602214650000902230650001402239650001002253650001002263700002302273700001802296700002502314773012302339856008102462852000902543655001202552IND60665238120221118150332.0191228e200211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066523812DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2002.18632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorrison, L.

Hybrids  ap. 1863-1872.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aThe ability of the weedy species jointed goatgrass (Aegilops cylindrica Host) to form seed-bearing hybrids with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) raises questions concerning the potential movement of herbicide-resistance genes from commercial wheat cultivars into the weed population. As a preliminary step for future gene-flow risk assessments, a study of jointed goatgrass × wheat hybrids collected from infested wheat fields in 1998 and 1999 was undertaken in Oregon. Jointed goatgrass accessions representing the range of variation in its worldwide distribution also were included in this study. The high molecular weight (HMW) glutenins, a group of wheat endosperm storage proteins, were used as genetic markers for characterizing this material. In the Oregon jointed goatgrass accessions, the seed protein analysis identified F₁ hybrid seed that was formed at a rate of 0 to 8% on a per field basis. The HMW glutenin patterns in the backcross seed threshed from Oregon hybrids showed a higher proportion of seeds formed from pollination by wheat than by jointed goatgrass. Analysis of the roots for remains of the maternal seed or spikelet indicated that most hybrid plants were of the F₁ generation and that either jointed goatgrass or wheat could be the female parent. These analyses suggested a hybridization dynamics in which jointed goatgrass serves as the predominant F₁ female parent and wheat as the predominant backcross male parent. Development of introgressed jointed goatgrass forms carrying wheat genes would be dependent on the presence of a continuous hybrid zone located near or within a persistent jointed goatgrass population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAegilops cylindrica 3aOregon 3aTriticum aestivum 3abackcrossing 3acultivars 3aendosperm 3afemales 3agene flow 3aglutenins 3aherbicide resistance 3ahybrids 3aintrogression 3amales 3amolecular weight 3apollination 3arisk 3aspikelets 3aweeds 3awheat1 aRiera-Lizarazu, O.1 aCrémieux, L.1 aMallory-Smith, C.

Numerical models for FCBPBSs and NBPBSs were established to investigate the relationship between the compression force and structural parameter (monofilament diameter and braid-pin number). The simulation and experimental results after calculating the compression force derived from both experiment and simulation results are in good agreement with each other, indicating that the simulation results can provide a useful reference for the investigation of biliary stents. The stress distributions for FCBPBSs and NBPBSs were studied, and the plastic dissipation analysis and plastic strain of FCBPBSs were obtained via simulation of compression of the film layer of the FCBPBSs. The film layer of FCBPBSs contributes greatly to the differences in mechanical properties, such as stress distribution, plastic dissipation and plastic strain, between FCBPBSs and NBPBSs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3afabrics 3afinite element analysis 3ahumans 3amathematical models 3amechanical properties 3atextile fibers 0afully covered biodegradable polydioxanone biliary stents 0auncovered biodegradable polydioxanone biliary stents 0acompression behaviors 0aplastic strain 0afinite element method1 aZhang, Peihua0 tTextile research journal.g, v. 87, no. 14 p.1772-1783dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175166585173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245008200172520122300254592002801477650002301505650002301528650001401551650001301565650001401578650001101592650001501603653001301618653001301631653002701644653001401671653003401685700002901719773011501748856008501863852000901948655001201957IND60736764620221119214311.0220606e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073676462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2021.1048962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaltezos, Stavros10aNovel approach for Monte Carlo simulation of the new COVID-19 spread dynamics  aA Monte Carlo simulation in a novel approach is used for studying the problem of the outbreak and spread dynamics of the new COVID-19 pandemic in this work. In particular, our goal was to generate epidemiological data based on natural mechanism of transmission of this disease assuming random interactions of a large-finite number of individuals in very short distance ranges. In the simulation we also take into account the stochastic character of the individuals in a finite population and given densities of people. On the other hand, we include in the simulation the appropriate statistical distributions for the parameters characterizing this disease. An important outcome of our work, besides the generated epidemic curves, is the methodology of determining the effective reproductive number during the main part of the daily new cases of the epidemic. Since this quantity constitutes a fundamental parameter of the SIR-based epidemic models, we also studied how it is affected by small variations of the incubation time and the crucial distance distributions, and furthermore, by the degree of quarantine measures.

Surface functionalization of the scaffolds is often utilized to realize this goal. Polydopamine (PDA) has been extensively studied for promoted cell adhesion and proliferation. Norepinephrine, sharing a similar structure with dopamine, polymerizes slower and forms an even and ultrasmooth surface coating on almost all substrates. However, the effects of polynorepinephrine (PNE) on stem cell adhesion and proliferation have barely been studied. In this study, we compared the biocompatibility and cell adhesion properties of mussel inspired PDA and PNE surface coatings on poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) fibers for human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cell derived mesenchymal stem cells (hiPS-MSCs). The surface modification of PDA and PNE on PCL fibers was characterized by environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESME), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and contact angle measurement. The biocompatibility of the PDA and PNE coatings with hMSCs and hiPS-MSCs was measured using lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, live dead cell staining and cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) assays. The results show that both PDA and PNE successfully formed a surface coating on the PCL fiber, which dramatically increased the hydrophilicity. The PNE coating showed a much thinner and smoother surface while the PDA coating formed uneven aggregates among the fibers. The biocompatibility analysis and cell proliferation results suggest that the PNE coating is more biocompatible with both hiPS-MSCs and hMSCs than the PDA coating. The PNE coating preferentially promoted cell proliferation for hiPS-MSCs but not for hMSCs, while PDA decreased the cell proliferation of hiPS-MSCs on the PCL fibers. These results suggest that the effect of the PDA and PNE surface coatings on cell proliferation can be cell-dependent. The surface roughness of the PDA coating can negatively affect cell adhesion and proliferation. Different mechanisms of interaction of the PDA and PNE coatings might affect cell adhesion and proliferation, and this needs to be carefully investigated before their application in specific cell type based tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abeta-galactosidase 3abiocompatibility 3acell adhesion 3acell proliferation 3acoatings 3acontact angle 3adopamine 3ahumans 3ahydrophilicity 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3amussels 3anorepinephrine 3apolymerization 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astaining 3astem cells 3asurface roughness 3atissue engineering1 aLi, Yanfang1 aLiu, Ying1 aChen, Chunying1 aChen, Menglin0 tRSC advances.g2016 June 23, v. 6, no. 65 p.60206-60214dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra11173d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008800167300001600255520139000271592002801661596008801689650001701777650003201794650001001826650003301836650001601869650001401885650001801899650001801917651001001935651001201945651001001957651001801967700001701985773012502002856008202127852000902209655001202218IND60637230020221119122732.0190416e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063723002DNAL7 a10.1007/s11557-019-01477-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Pan Meng10aTwo new taxa of the Auriscalpium vulgare species complex with substrate preferences  ap. 641-652.  aBasidiomes of the cone-inhabiting Auriscalpium species, usually regarded as A. vulgare Gray, are widely distributed across the Northern Hemisphere and easily recognized because of their unique macro-morphology. However, phylogenetic diversity patterns among different geographic populations and different substrates are completely unknown. In this study, samples of A. vulgare s.l. in different areas of China were studied phylogenetically, morphologically, and ecologically. For comparison, European collections of A. vulgare were included. Our phylogenetic analyses, inferred from partial nucleotide sequences including the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) 1 and 2 with the 5.8S nrDNA, the large subunit of nuclear ribosomal RNA (nrLSU), and the region between the conserved domain 6 and 7 of the gene for the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2), indicated that three phylogenetic species can be recognized, which correspond well with morphological and ecological evidence. Therefore, three species, having distinct substrate preferences, are documented here, namely the well-known A. vulgare, and the newly described species A. orientale and A. microsporum. Auriscalpium vulgare is widely distributed throughout the northern temperate Eurasia and North America, while the new species have been known mainly from subtropical East Asia and northeastern India to date.  aPublisher supplied data  aXDB31010000cStrategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences 3aAuriscalpium 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3aChina 3aEurasia 3aIndia 3aNorth America1 aYang, Zhu L.0 tMycological progress.g2019 May, v. 18, no. 5 p.641-652dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000124x1617-416X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11557-019-01477-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01892naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005100094040001800145100002200163245009500185300001400280500001900294500000900313520078500322592002801107650001301135650001301148650001601161650001301177650001201190650001601202650001501218650001201233650001101245650001601256700002001272773011901292856009801411852000901509655001201518IND60665238320221118150336.0191122e198001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066523832DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1980.0011183X002000010016x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuarin, Camilo L.10aEffect of Three Ploidy Levels on Meiosis and Mode of Reproduction in Paspalum hexastachyum  ap. 69-75.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aChromosome behavior, mode of reproduction, and fertility characteristics were studied in diploid (2n = 12) and colchicine-induced tetraploid and hexaploid Paspalum hexastachyum Parodi.

Although many researchers have focused their work on the endocrine changes related to this disease, evidence indicates that intraovarian components play an important role in follicular persistence. Activin, inhibin, and follistatin participate as intraovarian regulatory molecules involved in follicular cell proliferation, differentiation, steroidogenesis, oocyte maturation, and corpus luteum function. Given the importance of these factors in folliculogenesis, we examined the expression and immunolocalization of activin/inhibin βA-subunit, inhibin α-subunit, and follistatin in the ovaries of healthy estrus-synchronized cows and in those of cows with spontaneous or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-induced COD. We also studied inhibin B (α βB) levels in serum and follicular fluid. We found an increased expression of the βA-subunit of activin A/inhibin A, the α-subunit of inhibin, and follistatin in granulosa cells of spontaneous follicular cysts by immunohistochemistry, and decreased concentrations of inhibin B (α βB) in the follicular fluid of spontaneous follicular cysts. These results, together with those previously obtained, indicate that the expression of the components of the activin–inhibin–follistatin system is altered. This could lead to multiple alterations in important functions in the ovary like the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic factors, follicular proliferation/apoptosis, and steroidogenesis, which may contribute to the follicular persistence and endocrine changes found in cattle with COD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3ablood serum 3acell proliferation 3acorpus luteum 3acorticotropin 3acows 3adairy cattle 3afollicular development 3afollicular fluid 3afollistatin 3agranulosa cells 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainhibin 3aoocytes 3aovarian cysts 3apathogenesis 3aresearchers 3asteroidogenesis 0aOvary 0aCysts 0aCattle 0aActivin, βA-subunit 0aInhibin, α-Subunit 0aFollistatin1 aMatiller, Valentina1 aDíaz, Pablo U.1 aOrtega, Hugo H.1 aRey, Florencia1 aRodríguez, Fernanda M.1 aSilva, Manuel A.1 aSalvetti, Natalia R.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2014 Aug., v. 148, no. 3-4 p.97-108dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2014.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03604naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011400169300001600283520199700299592002802296650002202324650001102346650001702357650001002374650002302384650001002407650001202417650002802429650002002457650001002477650001502487650001202502650002202514650001502536650001102551650001802562650000902580650000802589650001102597650001202608650001402620651001302634653001802647653001302665653002202678653001202700653001202712653001202724700002202736700001702758700002202775773012502797856008302922852000903005655001203014IND60525459020221122094038.0190318e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052545902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2015.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHancock, Mark H.14aThe effect of harvest method on cereal stubble use by seed-eating birds in a High Nature Value farming system  ap. 119-124.  aBiodiverse areas of traditional low-intensity agriculture in Europe, or ‘High Nature Value’ (HNV) farmland, are supported by European policy and government subsidies. However, HNV areas have declined in extent, contributing to biodiversity decline. If some traditional practices in HNV farmland could be modernised without reducing natural values, this could improve the economic viability of HNV farms, increasing their resilience to economic pressures. Here we compare one traditional and two modernised cereal harvesting methods on machair, an HNV farmed landscape typical of the Scottish islands, focussing on the value of post-harvest stubbles to wintering birds. Following traditional practice, all cereals were mixed species crops comprised of local varieties of small oats, barley and rye. Grain abundance and seed-eating bird use of stubbles was compared across 16 rounds of visits to 15 fields, five under each of three harvest methods: traditional reaper-binder (machinery from 1950–60s), combine-harvesters (1970–80s) and arable silage (1990–2000s). The two forms of harvest modernisation (combine harvester, arable silage) produced stubbles that differed markedly in bird use. Skylark and bunting occurrence, and grain abundance, were 1.7–19 times higher on stubbles following combine harvesting, than on those following arable silage. Unexpectedly, combine-harvester stubbles had similar levels of bird use to those following traditional reaper-binder harvest. Our results suggest that harvesting on machair could be modernised using (older model) combine-harvesters in place of traditional methods, with little impact on stubble value for birds, maintaining this aspect of high nature value. Conversely, modernisation involving more cereals harvested as arable silage, under current practice, is likely to reduce stubble quality for seed-eating birds. Future work could test whether delayed cutting of arable silage might create stubbles of greater value for birds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3abarley 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3acombine harvesters 3acrops 3acutting 3aeconomic sustainability 3afarming systems 3afarms 3aharvesting 3aislands 3aissues and policy 3alandscapes 3amodels 3amodernization 3aoats 3arye 3asilage 3astubble 3asubsidies 3aScotland 0aArable silage 0aBuntings 0aCombine-harvester 0aFinches 0aMachair 0aSkylark1 aDuffield, Stephen1 aBoyle, Jamie1 aWilson, Jeremy D.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 219 p.119-124dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2015.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008400170300001400254520143100268592002801699650001501727650001501742650001801757650001801775650000901793650001201802650002401814650001301838650001601851653001601867653001801883653001501901653001401916653001301930700002201943773011501965856008502080852000902165655001202174IND60566916920221118012222.0170414e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056691692DNAL7 a10.1080/07924259.2017.12877792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Leah R.10aTissue and spine regeneration in the temperate sea urchin Psammechinus miliaris  ap. 90-96.  aThe tissue regenerative capabilities of echinoderms are well known at the morphogenic level, yet significant knowledge gaps remain concerning the molecular control of these processes. This pilot study assayed two pharmacological agents (vincristine sulphate and DAPT) injected directly into the body cavity of specimens of the temperate echinoid Psammechinus miliaris which had had their spines and tube feet deliberately amputated. Vincristine sulphate, which is a generalised mitotic inhibitor, was used as a positive control, whereas DAPT is a y -secretase inhibitor known to block sea urchin embryo development and suppress echinoid regeneration by interfering with Notch signalling pathways. Significant differences in regeneration rate became apparent in both treatments 29 days post amputation with both inhibitors slowing regeneration of tube feet (0.6 μg/g vincristine sulphate by 44.4% relative to controls; 4 μg/g DAPT by 55.6% relative to controls) and spines (0.6 μg/g vincristine sulphate by 53.3% relative to controls; 4 μg/g DAPT by 66.7% relative to controls). Vincristine sulphate was more clearly dose-dependent than DAPT. This initial inhibition-based approach allows inferences to be made concerning possible molecular pathways controlling regeneration within P. miliaris and adds further support to the hypothesis that Notch signalling plays a major role in regulating regeneration in echinoids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinoidea 3aamputation 3adose response 3aembryogenesis 3afeet 3amitosis 3asignal transduction 3asulfates 3avincristine 0aDevelopment 0amorphogenesis 0aechinoderm 0ainhibitor 0aregrowth1 aCaldwell, Gary S.0 tInvertebrate Reproduction & Development.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 61, no. 2 p.90-96dTaylor & Francisx2157-02727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07924259.2017.12877793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03092naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245017500159520164100334592002801975650002402003650001002027650001102037650001702048650002302065650001702088650001502105650001402120650002202134650001102156650001702167650001702184650002702201650000902228650002202237700001702259700001902276700001302295700001502308700002002323700001902343700001902362700002002381773012102401856007902522852000902601655001202610IND60791074620221120195148.0220826e20220821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079107462DNAL7 a10.3390/plants111621752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Shuyi 12aA Comparison of Three Types of “Vineyard Management” and Their Effects on the Structure of Plasmopara viticola Populations and Epidemic Dynamics of Grape Downy Mildew  aGrape downy mildew (GDM) is a destructive grapevine disease caused by Plasmopara viticola that occurs worldwide. In this study, we determined the characteristics of GDM epidemics and the grapevine canopy micro-climate in open-field, fungicide-spray, and rain-shelter plots during two constitutive years (2016 and 2017). It was found that rain shelter can significantly delay the disease occurrence by 28 and 21 days, reduce the epidemic phase by 28 and 21 days, and decrease the final disease index by 82% and 83%. Furthermore, it can block precipitation, reduce the relative humidity by 11% and 8%, and reduce the leaf wetness duration by 85% and 76% compared with open-field cultivation. A total of 3861, 783, and 1145 lesions were collected from the open-field, fungicide-managed, and rain-shelter plots, respectively, for analyses of the genetic diversity, population differentiation, and epidemic mode with seven microsatellite markers. In terms of genetic diversity, the Nei’s diversity index ranged from 0.569 to 0.680 and Shannon’s information index ranged from 0.958 to 1.226, showing high levels of diversity across populations. Similar to fungicide management, a rain shelter can significantly reduce the population’s genetic diversity. Low pairwise FST values (0.003–0.047) and high gene flow (Nm = 1.548–20.699) were observed among the three populations each year. In addition, most of the genetic variation occurred within populations. The epidemic mode of GDM in the open-field, fungicide-managed, and rain-shelter cultivation showed moderate, low, and high levels of clonality, respectively, in the case study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmopara viticola 3aVitis 3acanopy 3acase studies 3adisease occurrence 3adowny mildew 3afungicides 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3agrapes 3aleaf wetness 3amicroclimate 3amicrosatellite repeats 3arain 3arelative humidity1 aLi, Baihong 1 aGuan, Tianshu 1 aLiu, Li 1 aWang, Hui 1 aLiu, Changyuan 1 aZang, Chaoqun 1 aHuang, Yuqian 1 aLiang, Chunhao 0 tPlants.g2022 Aug. 21, v. 11, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111621753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001400141245010700155300001600262520155500278592002801833653001001861653002601871653001601897653001501913700002101928700003201949700001801981700001501999700001802014700001902032773012402051856007602175852000902251655001202260IND60681608120221119183746.0200226e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068160812DNAL7 a10.3920/BM2015.00562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, H.K.10aProbiotic supplementation influences faecal short chain fatty acids in infants at high risk for eczema  ap. 783-790.  aThe composition of the gut microbiota plays a role in the development of allergies. Based on the immunomodulating capacities of bacteria, various studies have investigated the potential role for probiotics in the prevention of childhood eczema. In a previous study we have shown that significantly less children developed eczema after probiotic supplementation (Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis W52 and Lactococcus lactis W58, Ecologic®Panda) at three months of age as compared to controls. Here, metabolites in faecal samples of these 3-month old children were measured by ¹H-nuclear magnetic resonance to investigate possible gut metabolic alterations. Lower amounts of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), succinate, phenylalanine and alanine were found in faecal samples of children later developing eczema, whereas the amounts of glucose, galactose, lactate and lactose were higher compared to the children not developing eczema. Although these differences were already present at the age of 3 months, eczema did not develop in the majority of children before the age of 1 year. Supplementation of multispecies probiotics seems to induce higher levels of lactate and SCFAs, and lower levels of lactose and succinate when compared with the placebo group. This might explain the temporary preventive effect of probiotics on the development of eczema. These results highlight the role bacterial metabolites may play in development of the immune system, even before clinical manifestations of allergic disease arise.  aPublisher supplied data 0aatopy 0aintestinal microbiota 0ametabolites 0aprobiotics1 aRutten, N.B.M.M.1 aBesseling-van der Vaart, I.1 aNiers, L.E.M.1 aChoi, Y.H.1 aRijkers, G.T.1 avan Hemert, S.0 tBeneficial microbes.g2015 Dec. 1, v. 6, no. 6 p.783-790dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:6303x1876-28917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/BM2015.00563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03721naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245006400206500001900270520224300289592002802532650001902560650001702579650002302596650001302619650001202632650002902644650001402673650001702687650002202704650002902726650001102755650001402766650001302780650001302793650001502806650002602821650001702847653001802864653001302882653001302895653001902908653002102927700002102948700002102969700002202990773010003012856008203112852000903194655001203203IND60736765220221119214319.0210619e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073676522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hal.2021.1020372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDreher, Theo W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4224-739X10aComparative genomics of the ADA clade within the Nostocales  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe ADA clade of Nostocales cyanobacteria, a group that is prominent in current harmful algal bloom events, now includes over 40 genome sequences with the recent addition of sixteen novel sequenced genomes (Dreher et al., Harmful Algae, 2021). Fourteen genomes are complete (closed), enabling highly detailed assessments of gene content and genome architecture. ADA genomes contain 5 rRNA operons, genes expected to support a photoautotrophic and diazotrophic lifestyle, and a varied array of genes for the synthesis of bioactive secondary metabolites. Genes for the production of the taste-and-odor compound geosmin and the four major classes of cyanotoxins — anatoxin-a, cylindrospermopsin, microcystin and saxitoxin — are represented in members of the ADA clade. Notably, the gene array for the synthesis of cylindrospermopsin by Dolichospermum sp. DET69 was located on a plasmid, raising the possibility of facile horizontal transmission. However, genes supporting independent conjugative transfer of this plasmid are lacking. Further, analysis of genomic loci containing this and other cyanotoxin gene arrays shows evidence that these arrays have long-term stability and do not appear to be genomic islands easily capable of horizontal transmission to other cells. There is considerable diversity in the gene complements of individual ADA genomes, including the variable presence of physiologically important genes: genomes in three species-level subclades lack the gas vesicle genes that facilitate a planktonic lifestyle, and, surprisingly, the genome of Cuspidothrix issatschenkoi CHARLIE-1, a reported diazotroph, lacks the genes for nitrogen fixation. Notably, phylogenetically related genomes possess limited synteny, indicating a prominent role for chromosome rearrangements during ADA strain evolution. The genomes contain abundant insertion sequences and repetitive transposase genes, which could be the main drivers of genome rearrangement through active transposition and homologous recombination. No prophages were found, and no evidence of viral infection was observed in the bloom population samples from which the genomes discussed here were derived. Phages thus seem to have a limited influence on ADA evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDolichospermum 3aalgal blooms 3acylindrospermopsin 3agenomics 3ageosmin 3ahomologous recombination 3alifestyle 3amicrocystins 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3aoperon 3aphylogeny 3aplankton 3aplasmids 3asaxitoxins 3asecondary metabolites 3atransposases 0aAphanizomenon 0aAnabaena 0aMobilome 0aGenome synteny 0aCyanotoxin genes1 aDavis, Edward W.1 aMueller, Ryan S.1 aOtten, Timothy G.0 tHarmful algae.g2021 Apr., v. 104 p.102037-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3946763x1568-98837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2021.1020373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001600141245014400157300001600301520210200317592002802419653002502447653002202472653003002494700001802524700001702542700003302559773012402592856007602716852000902792655001202801IND60681608220221119183536.0200226e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068160822DNAL7 a10.3920/BM2015.00612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBolla, P.A.10aKefir-isolated bacteria and yeasts inhibit Shigella flexneri invasion and modulate pro-inflammatory response on intestinal epithelial cells  ap. 103-110.  aThe aim of this work was to evaluate the ability of a kefir-isolated microbial mixture containing three bacterial and two yeast strains (MM) to protect intestinal epithelial cells against Shigella flexneri invasion, as well as to analyse the effect on pro-inflammatory response elicited by this pathogen. A significant decrease in S. flexneri strain 72 invasion was observed on both HT-29 and Caco-2 cells pre-incubated with MM. Pre-incubation with the individual strains Saccharomyces cerevisiae CIDCA 8112 or Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis CIDCA 8221 also reduced the internalisation of S. flexneri into HT-29 cells although in a lesser extent than MM. Interestingly, Lactobacillus plantarum CIDCA 83114 exerted a protective effect on the invasion of Caco-2 and HT-29 cells by S. flexneri. Regarding the pro-inflammatory response on HT-29 cells, S. flexneri infection induced a significant activation of the expression of interleukin 8 (IL-8), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) encoding genes (P<0.05), whereas incubation of cells with MM did not induce the expression of any of the mediators assessed. Interestingly, pre-incubation of HT-29 monolayer with MM produced an inhibition of S. flexneri-induced IL-8, CCL20 and TNF-α mRNA expression. In order to gain insight on the effect of MM (or the individual strains) on this pro-inflammatory response, a series of experiments using a HT-29-NF-κB-hrGFP reporter system were performed. Pre-incubation of HT-29-NF-κB-hrGFP cells with MM significantly dampened Shigella-induced activation. Our results showed that the contribution of yeast strain Kluyveromyces marxianus CIDCA 8154 seems to be crucial in the observed effect. In conclusion, results presented in this study demonstrate that pre-treatment with a microbial mixture containing bacteria and yeasts isolated from kefir, resulted in inhibition of S. flexneri internalisation into human intestinal epithelial cells, along with the inhibition of the signalling via NF-κB that in turn led to the attenuation of the inflammatory response.  aPublisher supplied data 0akefir microorganisms 0aShigella flexneri 0apro-inflammatory response1 aAbraham, A.G.1 aPérez, P.F.1 ade los Angeles Serradell, M.0 tBeneficial microbes.g2016 Feb. 1, v. 7, no. 1 p.103-110dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:6303x1876-28917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/BM2015.00613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03229naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009100169300001400260520131700274592002801591650001101619650002401630650002701654650002401681650002501705650002101730650001001751650001001761650002001771650001801791650001201809650001801821650001101839650001101850650001401861650001601875650002301891650001401914653000901928653001001937653000701947653000701954653000801961653000801969653000801977653001001985653002401995653001302019653001302032653002702045653002402072653002002096653001902116653001302135653002302148653001502171653002402186653001402210653001402224700002202238700002002260700002002280773011602300856008202416852000902498655001202507IND60563377920221119123932.0190318e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056337792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2017.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMikonranta, Lauri10aLepidopteran species have a variety of defence strategies against bacterial infections  ap. 88-96.  aThe insect immune system has versatile ways of coping with microbial insults. Currently, innate immune priming has been described in several invertebrates, and the first insights into its mechanistic basis have been described. Here we studied infections with two different strains of Serratia marcescens bacteria in two different Lepidopteran hosts. The results reveal fundamental differences between the two hosts, a well-known model organism Galleria mellonella and a non-model species Arctia plantaginis. They differ in their strategies for resisting oral infections; priming their defences against a recurring sepsis; and upregulating immunity related genes as a response to the specific pathogen strains. The two bacterial strains (an environmental isolate and an entomopathogenic isolate) differ in their virulence, use of extracellular proteases, survival in the larval gut, and in the immune response they evoke in the hosts. This study explores the potential mechanistic explanations for both host and pathogen specific characters that significantly affect the outcome of Gram-negative bacterial infection in Lepidopteran larvae. The results highlight the need to pay greater attention to the differences between model and non-model hosts, and closely related pathogen strains, in immunological studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArctia 3aGalleria mellonella 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aSerratia marcescens 3abacterial infections 3adigestive system 3agenes 3ahosts 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3ainsects 3ainvertebrates 3alarvae 3amodels 3apathogens 3aproteinases 3asepsis (infection) 3avirulence 0aAMPs 0aPGRPs 0aPO 0aOD 0aROS 0aENV 0aENT 0a6-Tox 0aBacterial infection 0aCecropin 0aDefensin 0aExtracellular protease 0aGalleria mellonella 0aGene expression 0aImmune priming 0aImmunity 0aArctia plantaginis 0aResistance 0aSerratia marcescens 0aTolerance 0aVirulence1 aDickel, Franziska1 aMappes, Johanna1 aFreitak, Dalial0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2017 Mar., v. 144 p.88-96dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2017.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01675naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005100094040001800145100001600163245014200179300001600321500001900337500000900356520061100365592002800976650003001004650001401034650001201048650002201060650001101082650001101093700001701104773012101121856009801242852000901340655001201349IND60665238920221118150331.0191122e196709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066523892DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1967.0011183X000700050032x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaul, C.

They have been neglected for many years and changes produced by climatic change will greatly affect them. Thus, nowadays they constitute an endangered ecosystem due to their characteristics and to human pressures. These habitats support a high biological richness with species adapted to extreme conditions. Assuming that hydroperiod is the main factor structuring aquatic assemblages in this type of ecosystem, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of the dry period on the faunal composition and the natural succession process of macroinvertebrate assemblages in two temporary ponds and to analyze the differences between two periods, before and after the dry period. A total of 7225 individuals belonging to 93 macroinvertebrate taxa (Nematoda, Hirudinea, Oligochaeta, Mollusca, Crustacea, Acari, Insecta) were collected. The most abundant and richest group were insects. Cluster and Non-Metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling (NMDS) analyses showed the clustering of the samples in two groups, before and after the dry period, as we had expected. Thus, there was a change in faunal composition in both ponds, corresponding to a successional process. According to the SIMPER analysis, the most contributive taxa in both ponds were mostly insects and crustaceans. Regarding feeding traits, predators and shredders were the dominant groups. However, there was a change in the trophic structure of the assemblages between the two periods. Most taxa resist the drying season with resting eggs, cocoons or simply by flying to more permanent freshwater bodies. Although the two studied ponds are temporary habitats, they support a different faunal composition hosting species that are endemic or rare at regional or national level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcari 3aCrustacea 3aHirudinea 3aInsecta 3aMollusca 3aNematoda 3aOligochaeta 3aclimate change 3acocoons 3adry season 3aecosystems 3aeggs 3afauna 3aflight 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3ainsects 3amacroinvertebrates 3aponds 3apredators 3aspecies diversity 3aSpain 0aTemporary ponds 0adry period 0asuccession 0amacroinvertebrates 0atraits 0aNW Spain1 aBENETTI, Cesar J.1 aGARRIDO, Josefina0 tJournal of limnology.g2015 Mar. 02, v. 74, no. 3dPAGEPress Publications, Pavia, Italyx1723-86337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2015.10603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02216naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014700164300001600311520099300327592002801320650001801348650002501366650001801391650001501409650001801424650002101442650001201463650002001475650002001495650002101515650001501536650000701551650002301558650002001581700002301601773010301624856008201727852000901809655001201818IND60091540220221122200537.0141103e20120115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009154022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2011.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Anish10aMultienzyme microbiosensor based on electropolymerized o-phenylenediamine for simultaneous in vitro determination of acetylcholine and choline  ap. 433-438.  aThe electrochemical biosensors based on poly(o-phenylenediamine) (PoPD) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline oxidase (ChO) enzymes were fabricated on carbon fibre (CF) substrate. The electropolymerized PoPD was used to reduce the interfering substances. The electrode assembly was completed by depositing functionalized carbon nano tubes (FCNTs) and Nafion (Naf). Amperometric detection of acetylcholine (ACh) and choline (Ch) were realized at an applied potential of +750mV vs Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl). At pH 7.4, the final assembly, Naf–FCNTs/AChE–ChO₍₁₀:₁₎/PoPD/CFEₗᵢₚ, was observed to have high sensitivity towards Ch (6.3±0.3μAmM⁻¹) and ACh (5.8±0.3μAmM⁻¹), linear range for Ch (KM=0.52±0.03mM) and ACh (KM=0.59±0.07mM), and for Ch the highest ascorbic acid blocking capacity (97.2±2 1mM AA). It had a response time of <5s and with 0.045μM limit of detection. Studies on different ratio (ACh/Ch) revealed that 10:1, gave best overall response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcholine 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aascorbic acid 3abiosensors 3acarbon fibers 3acarbon nanotubes 3acholine 3acholine oxidase 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3apH 3apotassium chloride 3asilver chloride1 aGhani, Sulaiman Ab0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2012 Jan. 15, v. 31, no. 1 p.433-438dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2011.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012900174300001600303520092200319592002801241650001701269650001001286650001901296650001101315650001501326650001201341650002301353650001001376651001001386653001701396653002401413653002501437653002801462653002601490653003701516700001501553700002801568773012501596856008501721852000901806655001201815IND60566917520221118012236.0170414e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056691752DNAL7 a10.1080/08974438.2016.12665692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTemperini, Valerio10aConsumers’ Trust in Food Quality and Willingness to Pay More for National Parks’ Brands: Preliminary Evidence From Italy  ap. 120-138.  aIn Italy, national parks allow the use of their brand logo and name on the labels of food products produced by firms located within the national parks. However, no empirical research has yet investigated the impact of national park brands on consumers’ attitudes and behaviors. Hence, this empirical study explores the factors that influence consumer trust in food quality and their willingness to pay premium prices for the national park brands. Results from a survey involving a sample of 227 Italian consumers suggest that women and younger consumers trust more and are more willing to pay for national park brands. The origin of food products associated with national parks, naturalness of foods, food quality certifications and branding, and the environment in which the packaged foods originate influence consumer confidence and buying behavior. Implications for food marketers and policymakers are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood quality 3afoods 3anational parks 3aprices 3apurchasing 3asurveys 3awillingness to pay 3awomen 3aItaly 0aFood quality 0anational park brand 0anaturalness of foods 0aorigin of food products 0atrust in food quality 0awillingness to pay premium price1 aLimbu, Yam1 aJayachandran, Chinnappa0 tJournal of international food & agribusiness marketing.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 29, no. 2 p.120-138dRoutledgex1528-69837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08974438.2016.12665693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245009800163300001800261520133100279592002801610650004401638650003701682650001401719650002201733650001401755650001201769650001801781650002201799650002601821650004401847650001401891650001901905650001001924650003301934650001901967653001001986653002401996653002302020653002202043653002102065700001802086700001702104700001702121700001702138700001802155700001702173773011302190856008002303852000902383655001202392IND60616441820221121050555.0181016e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061644182DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175166593802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhaoling10aCharacterization and control of oxidized cellulose in ramie fibers during oxidative degumming  ap. 1828-1840.  aOxidative degumming with hydrogen peroxide provides an efficient pathway and new alternative for natural fiber extraction. In this work, the oxidized cellulose introduced into ramie fibers during the oxidative degumming process was systematically characterized in terms of x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The differences of chemical components, chemical shift, surface structure and surface morphology were analyzed and compared within oxidized cellulose fibers with different oxidation degrees. In addition, the relationship between oxidized cellulose contents and mechanical properties of degummed fibers were further discussed. The results show that the number of oxidized groups increases with increasing oxidation. In addition, the greater presence of oxidized cellulose contributes to a larger loss of tenacity, breaking elongation, flexibility and degree of polymerization in degummed fibers. This study could offer useful information in better understanding the reaction characteristics of oxidative degumming and better control of degummed fiber quality. The contents of oxidized cellulose in ramie fibers could be an effective indicating factor to demonstrate oxidative degumming efficiency and fiber properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acellulose 3acellulosic fibers 3adegumming 3afabrics 3afiber quality 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amechanical properties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3apolymerization 3aramie 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atextile fibers 0aramie 0aoxidative degumming 0aoxidized cellulose 0ahydrogen peroxide 0afiber properties1 aMeng, Chaoran1 aZhou, Jiajia1 aLi, Zhengfan1 aDing, Jinhua1 aLiu, Fengming1 aYu, Chongwen0 tTextile research journal.g, v. 87, no. 15 p.1828-1840dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175166593803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245010700172500001900279520138800298592002801686650001701714650000901731650001101740650001901751650001101770650001401781650001401795650001501809650002401824650000901848650002501857650001201882650001101894653003501905653001401940653001601954653001401970653005701984653001702041700006102058700001802119773009802137856008702235852000902322655001202331IND60727612520221119161310.0210312e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072761252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1165172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Ahmed I.10aForecasting underheating in dwellings to detect excess winter mortality risks using time series models  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAdvanced forecasting of impending low temperatures in dwellings could play a transformative role in predicting energy poverty in real-time, thereby helping to prevent excess winter morbidity and mortality. A novel recursive time series model combining AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs was developed to provide multi-step ahead predictions of the wintertime internal temperatures of homes. A stepwise regression approach was adopted to automate the optimal model selection process based on the minimisation of the Akaike Information Criterion. The model was validated using three case study homes located in Loughborough, UK. Prediction intervals, at the 95% probability level, were used to define a credible interval for the forecasted temperatures at different time horizons during periods of cold weather. The AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs model proved capable of producing reliable forecasts for 1, 3 and 6 h ahead, achieving Mean Absolute Errors below 1.38 °C for these horizons. The results showed that this model consistently outperformed the more complex AutoRegressive Moving Average with eXogenous inputs model. The study provides the first evidence of the potential for using time series forecasting as part of a high-resolution indoor Winter Early Warning Response System which could be used to identify homes at imminent risk of cold-related health impacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acold 3aenergy 3aenergy poverty 3amodels 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3atime series analysis 3aweather 3awinter 0aWinter temperature forecasting 0aARX model 0aARMAX model 0aCold home 0aindoor Winter Early Warning Response System (iWEWRS) 0aFuel poverty1 aMcLeod, Robert S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7204-62681 aGustin, Matej0 tApplied energy.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 286 p.116517-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1165173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011100165300001600276520150700292592002801799650003501827650001601862650001601878650001501894650002001909650001901929650001701948650001301965650003801978650001302016650001802029650001102047650001902058650002002077650002502097650002602122650001302148650001102161650002302172650001002195650001202205700001502217700001902232700001802251700002002269700001302289700001802302773010302320856008202423852000902505655001202514IND60091540320221122200604.0141103e20120115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009154032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2011.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLü, Junhua,10aSensing HIV related protein using epitope imprinted hydrophilic polymer coated quartz crystal microbalance  ap. 439-444.  aWe have developed a biomimetic sensor for the detection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) related protein (glycoprotein 41, gp41) based on epitope imprinting technique. gp41 is the transmembrane protein of HIV-1 and plays an important role in membrane fusion between viruses and infected cells. It is an important index for determining the extent of HIV-1 disease progression and the efficacy of therapeutic intervention. In this work, dopamine was used as the functional monomer and polymerized on the surface of quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) chip in the presence of template, a synthetic peptide with 35 amino acid residues, analogous to residues 579–613 of the gp41. This process resulted in grafting a hydrophilic molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) film on the QCM chip. QCM measurement showed that the resulting MIP film not only had a great affinity towards the template peptide, but also could bind the corresponding gp41 protein specifically. The dissociation constant (Kd) of MIP for the template peptide was calculated to be 3.17nM through Scatchard analysis, which was similar to those of monoclonal antibodies. Direct detection of the gp41 was achieved quantitatively using the resulting MIP-based biomimetic sensor. The detection limit of gp41 was 2ng/mL, which was comparable to the reported ELISA method. In addition, the practical analytical performance of the sensor was examined by evaluating the detection of gp41 in human urine samples with satisfactory results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aamino acids 3abiomimetics 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3adisease course 3adissociation 3adopamine 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepitopes 3aglycoproteins 3ahumans 3ahydrophilicity 3amembrane fusion 3amolecular imprinting 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apolymers 3aquartz 3asynthetic peptides 3aurine 3aviruses1 aZhang, Yan1 aTang, Shui-Fen1 aFang, Zhi-Bin1 aYang, Huang-Hao1 aChen, Xi1 aChen, Guo-Nan0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2012 Jan. 15, v. 31, no. 1 p.439-444dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2011.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245018700167300001100354520123500365592002801600650002201628650001201650650001101662650001901673650001801692650002501710650001301735650001101748650001401759650001801773650000901791650002101800650001701821651001501838700002501853700002301878700001501901700002301916700002001939773012801959856008202087852000902169655001202178IND60637230820221119122826.0190510e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063723082DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-019-2862-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUtebayev, Maral10aGenetic polymorphism of glutenin subunits with high molecular weight and their role in grain and dough qualities of spring bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) from Northern Kazakhstan  ap. 71.  aHigh-molecular weight glutenin (HMWG) subunits are an important component of the gluten protein complex in cereal grains and can influence the baking properties of wheat. The study of polymorphism of glutenin makes it possible to isolate preferred genotypes with higher grain quality. To determine the allelic state of the Glu-1 loci controlling HMWG in 122 spring bread wheat varieties from Northern Kazakhstan, an SDS-based analysis was performed. The highest frequencies (in percentage) were detected in the alleles Glu-A1b (56.1), Glu-A1c (42.4), Glu-B1c (85.0), Glu-D1a (50.6) and Glu-D1d (46.9). A technological and baking evaluation of 33 varieties and 40 prospective selection lines on samples of bread wheat with known allelic compositions at the Glu-1 loci was carried out. Associations between HMWG and several technological traits were established: component 2* (allele Glu-A1b) with gluten content and P/L ratio; 7 + 9 components (allele Glu-B1c) with valorimetric index; and components 2 + 12 (allele Glu-D1a) with the ratio P/L. In some cases, discrepancies between the predicted baking qualities based on HMWG subunits and the results of traditional technological and baking evaluations have been revealed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aalleles 3abaking 3abaking quality 3adough quality 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenotype 3agluten 3aglutenins 3agrain quality 3aloci 3amolecular weight 3aspring wheat 3aKazakhstan1 aDashkevich, Svetlana1 aKunanbayev, Kairat1 aBome, Nina1 aSharipova, Botagoz1 aShavrukov, Yuri0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2019 May, v. 41, no. 5 p.71-71dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl33879x0137-58817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-019-2862-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245017400178300001400352520163100366592002801997650000902025650001802034650003102052650001802083650003302101650001702134650001102151650001402162650001402176650001702190653002702207653002802234653003902262700001802301700002002319773010502339856008602444852000902530655001202539IND50060244620221119155805.0190319e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006024462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2012.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYilmaz, Mustafa Tahsin10aMathematical approach for two component modeling of salep–starch mixtures using central composite rotatable design: Part I. Physicochemical and steady shear properties  ap. 49-60.  aA 2-factor-5-level central composite rotatable design (CCRD) of response surface methodology (RSM) was used to model linear, interaction and quadratic effects of some processing variables (salep and each starch type, the composition variables) on the response variables; physicochemical characteristics (pH, brix and turbidity) and steady shear rheological properties (apparent viscosity η, consistency coefficient K, shear stress σ and flow-behavior index n) of salep–starch mixtures (SSM); namely, salep–corn starch mixture (SCSM), salep–wheat starch mixture (SWSM) and salep–potato starch mixture (SPSM). The linear, interaction and quadratic effects of the processing variables were also modeled to develop predictive models for the tested properties to optimize the effect of these variables (salep and each starch type) using ridge analysis involved with RSM. It was concluded that salep and all starch types increased the apparent viscosity (η), shear stress (σ) and consistency coefficient (K) values; decreased the flow-behavior index (n) values of SSM samples. Salep was observed to vastly increase the viscosity of mixture samples when mixed with corn, wheat or potato starches. However, potato starch exhibited very different performance as compared to the other starches in terms of the physicochemical and steady shear rheological properties. The ridge analysis used to optimize these effects revealed that maximum η (0.84, 0.46 and 1.38 Pa s), and K (16.64, 6.48 and 28.86 Pa sn) values for the SCSM, SWSM and SPSM samples, respectively would occur at salep = 0.54% and starch = 2.83% w/w.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3alinear models 3aphysicochemical properties 3apotato starch 3aresponse surface methodology 3ashear stress 3astarch 3aturbidity 3aviscosity 3awheat starch 0aSalep–starch mixture 0aSteady shear properties 0aCentral composite rotatable design1 aKaraman, Safa1 aKayacier, Ahmed0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2013 May, v. 31, no. 1 p.49-60dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2012.09.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008700163300001500250500001400265520141800279592002801697650001501725650001401740650001701754650002001771650001301791650001201804650001001816650003001826650001001856650001401866650001401880650001401894650001301908651001001921653001701931653001301948653002601961700001301987700002502000700002002025773009502045856008202140852000902222655001202231IND60698692820221120075757.0210303e20181130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069869282DNAL7 a10.3897/mycokeys.42.296342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Xinlei10aTaxonomic circumscription of melanconis-like fungi causing canker disease in China  ap. 89-124.  aNAL-light  aMelanconis-like species comprise latent fungal pathogens with a wide range of woody hosts. Taxonomy of these pathogens is difficult due to their uninformative descriptions and similar asexual morphology. Based on molecular phylogenies, many species of this group were placed in various families of Diaporthales. In this study, eight species of melanconis-like fungi were isolated from Betula albosinensis , B. platyphylla (Betulaceae), Cornus controversa (Cornaceae), Corylus mandshurica (Betulaceae) and Juglans regia (Juglandaceae) in China. These species were phylogenetically placed in three families of Diaporhthales, i.e. Juglanconis juglandina , J. oblonga (Juglanconidaceae), Melanconiella betulicola sp. nov., M. corylina sp. nov. (Melanconiellaceae), Melanconis betulae, Ms. itoana, Ms. stilbostoma (Melanconidaceae) and one new genus, Sheathospora (Melanconiellaceae). Sheathospora is proposed to accommodate Melanconiella cornuta with conical and discrete pycnidia with aseptate, hyaline, cylindrical to ellipsoidal conidia with distinct hyaline sheath on branches of Cornus controversa. Combined analyses of ITS, LSU, CAL, RPB2 and TEF1-α sequence data were used to construct the molecular phylogeny. Additionally, we provided separate phylogenetic trees for three families (Juglanconidaceae, Melanconidaceae and Melanconiellaceae) to show the species distribution of melanconis-like fungi in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetulaceae 3aCornaceae 3aJuglandaceae 3aMelanconidaceae 3abranches 3aconidia 3afungi 3ageographical distribution 3ahosts 3anew genus 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3apycnidia 3aChina 0aDiaporthales 0ataxonomy 0awood-inhabiting fungi1 aDu, Zhuo1 aBezerra, Jadson D.P.1 aTian, Chengming0 tMycoKeys.g2018 Nov. 30, v. 42 p.89-124dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2143x1314-40497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/mycokeys.42.296343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02049naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245006700184300001600251520096400267592002801231650001601259650001701275650000901292650001701301650001101318650001301329650002301342653001101365653001301376653001701389653002401406653000801430700001801438773012501456856008501581852000901666655001201675IND60566917920221118012314.0170414e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056691792DNAL7 a10.1080/08974438.2017.13036572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez-de-Ibarreta, Carlos10aIs It Worth Getting Labeled? The Case of MSC-Certified Seafood  ap. 197-215.  aResearch has examined consumers’ attitudes toward ecolabels, but there is a lack of research examining whether niche ecolabels give a competitive advantage in consumer markets. The authors aim to fill this gap by exploring the four conditions of market success (evidence of price premiums, market share, access to retailers, and elasticities) established in the literature. Three varieties of MSC-certified fish are studied. Differences are observed across the three varieties that lead to the following conclusions: MSC-labeled products do not systematically sell at a premium; price has an inelastic effect on the demand of certified national brands, but increased distribution has a very elastic effect on demand; and MSC-labeled products do not experience seasonal effects. The consumer market is responding favorably to the label, but ecolabeled fish is in an introductory stage. Price premiums vary; the retailer’s brand is playing a prominent role.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecolabeling 3aelasticities 3afish 3amarket share 3aprices 3aseafoods 3aseasonal variation 0aDemand 0aecolabel 0aelasticities 0amarketing advantage 0aMSC1 aValor, Carmen0 tJournal of international food & agribusiness marketing.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 29, no. 2 p.197-215dRoutledgex1528-69837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08974438.2017.13036573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245014300159520143100302592002801733650002601761650001001787650001201797650002901809650001401838650002101852650002801873650002901901650001601930650001601946650001801962650001701980650002601997650000802023653002702031653003102058700001802089700001902107700001502126773011802141856008202259852000902341655001202350IND60749111820221121233414.0220103e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074911182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2021.1018872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lei10aGreen waste composting with bean dregs, tea residue, and biochar: Effects on organic matter degradation, humification and compost maturity  aThe effects of bean dregs (BD), tea residue (TR), and biochar (BC) as additives on the organic matter (OM) degradation, humification, and maturity of green waste (GW) composting was examined. A 30-day aerobic composting study was conducted using six combinations of GW, BD, TR, and BC [GW, GW＋BD, GW＋TR, GW＋BD＋TR, GW＋BD＋BC, GW＋BD＋TR＋BC]. The results showed that the additive treatments promoted OM degradation. The OM degradation of the additive groups was 28.75%–51.81% higher than that of the control group (GW as the control), and the degradation of hemicellulose and cellulose was 9.48%–25.39% and 10.12%–21.19% higher, respectively. Meanwhile, the synthesis of humic substances (HS) was significantly better than that of the control treatment. Bacterial community analysis showed that optimized composting increased bacterial community diversity. In addition, the amended composting enhanced maturity indices, including the C/N ratio, cation exchange capacity (CEC), germination index (GI), and electrical conductivity (EC). Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) suggested that the GI and CEC were positively correlated with HS but negatively correlated with the OM concentration. The evaluations of OM degradation, humification, bacterial dynamics, and maturity indicated that the GW＋BD＋TR＋BC treatment was the best for improving GW composting and achieved an optimal maturity and stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacterial communities 3abeans 3abiochar 3acation exchange capacity 3acellulose 3acompost maturity 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenvironmental technology 3agermination 3agreen waste 3ahemicellulose 3ahumification 3amultivariate analysis 3atea 0aGreen waste composting 0aOrganic matter degradation1 aGuo, Xiaoping1 aZhao, Tingning1 aLi, Tianyu0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2021 Nov., v. 24 p.101887-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2021.1018873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002300180245008800203300001800291506007600309520172400385592002802109506003702137650001802174650001202192650001402204650001102218650002202229650001302251650004402264650000702308650002002315700002202335700001902357700002302376773010402399856007502503852000902578655001202587IND60531638920221207051255.0160724e20140930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053163892DNAL7 a10.1021/bi50053932doi7 aPMC41795982pmcid7 a251846312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColvin, Michael
T.10aProton Association Constants of His 37 in the Influenza-A M218–60 Dimer-of-Dimers  ap. 5987-5994.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe membrane protein M2 from influenza-A forms a single-pass transmembrane helix that assembles in lipid membrane as homotetramers whose primary function is to act as a proton transporter for viral acidification. A single residue, histidine 37 (His 37), is known to be responsible for selectivity and plays an integral role in the protein’s function. We report pH-dependent ¹⁵N MAS NMR spectra of His 37 within the influenza-A proton conduction domain of M2, M2₁₈–₆₀, which has been previously shown to be a fully functional construct and was recently determined to adopt a dimer-of-dimers structure in lipids. By extracting the ratio of [His]/[HisH⁺] as a function of pH, we obtained two doubly degenerate proton disassociation constants, 7.63 ± 0.15 and 4.52 ± 0.15, despite a possible maximum of four. We also report the ¹HNε chemical shifts at pH 6.5 recorded at 60 kHz MAS in a CP-based ¹H–¹⁵N spectrum. We were unable to detect resonances indicative of direct proton sharing among His 37 side chains when the tetramer is in the +2 state. In the neutral state, His 37 is exclusively in the τ tautomer, indicating that the δ nitrogen is protonated solely as a function of pH. We also found that the plot of [HisH⁺]/[His] as a function of pH is qualitatively similar to previously reported proton conduction rates, indicating that proton conduction rate is proportional to the level of histidine protonation within the channel. Two-dimensional ¹³C–¹³C and ¹³C–¹⁵N correlations suggest that at low pH multiple conformations are populated as the spectra broaden and eventually disappear as the acidity is increased. A second highly resolved state at low pH was not observed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacidification 3aacidity 3ahistidine 3alipids 3amembrane proteins 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3astable isotopes1 aAndreas, Loren B.1 aChou, James J.1 aGriffin, Robert G.0 tBiochemistry.g2014 Sept. 30, v. 53, no. 38 p.5987-5994dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi50053933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012900159300002000288520147800308592002801786650002401814650001501838650002201853650002301875650001101898650001401909650002401923650002301947650001401970650001901984650002502003650002002028650002102048650001302069700001702082700001702099700001402116700001302130700001502143773012402158856007402282852000902356655001202365IND60640866020221122231414.0190505e20160712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064086602DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra11198j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Huanhuan10aPreparation of broccoli-like ferromagnetic cobalt microstructures with superior coercivity via an aqueous reduction strategy  ap. 66152-66160.  aControlled synthesis of novel hierarchical cobalt (Co) microstructures with extraordinary magnetic performances is a promising strategy for the development of magnetic metals for industrial purposes. Unlike the majority of experiments necessitating organic solvents at high temperatures or pressures, here broccoli-like Co microstructures were successfully prepared in aqueous solution under ambient temperature with the assistance of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) for the first time. The synthetic process was associated with the chemical reduction of Co with pure water as solvent, hydrazine hydrate as reductant, and no complexant, nucleator, or external magnetic force was employed. The Co spheroids with broccoli shape were constructed by several beads with the length ranging from 0.67 μm to 1.22 μm, and they slightly self-assembled into a necklace with adjacent Co spheroids via spontaneous magnetic dipole–dipole attraction. The results indicated that the temperature, and the concentration of PVP and NaOH played an imperative role in the morphology and size of the ultrafine Co micro-aggregates in the present approach. More importantly, the broccoli-like Co entities exhibited a decreased saturation magnetization of 25.6 emu g⁻¹ but an enhanced coercivity of 499.2 Oe mainly due to its anisotropic structure and smaller size, and could hold great potential for technological applications such as high-density data storage, and permanent magnetic materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aanisotropy 3aaqueous solutions 3achemical reduction 3acobalt 3ahydrazine 3ainformation storage 3amagnetic materials 3amagnetism 3amicrostructure 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3areducing agents 3asodium hydroxide 3asolvents1 aFu, Zhiqiang1 aChen, Keling1 aLong, Qin1 aDeng, Yi1 aXie, Kenan0 tRSC advances.g2016 July 12, v. 6, no. 70 p.66152-66160dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra11198j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009000162300001400252500001400266520120800280592002801488650001901516650001501535650000901550650001401559650001501573650001001588650001601598650002101614650001601635650001001651650001401661650001601675650001601691650001201707651001001719651001301729653002101742653001501763700003101778700003001809700001801839700002101857700001701878700001601895700001701911700001801928773009301946856008202039852000902121655001202130IND60698693020221120085520.0210303e20181204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069869302DNAL7 a10.3897/mycokeys.43.250812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Xiaoya10aEndophytic Colletotrichum species from Dendrobium spp. in China and Northern Thailand  ap. 23-57.  aNAL-light  aSpecies of Colletotrichum are commonly found in many plant hosts as pathogens, endophytes and occasionally saprobes.

The taxa were identified using morphological characterisation and phylogenetic analyses of ITS, GAPDH, ACT and ß–tubulin sequence data. This is the first time to identify endophytic fungi from Dendrobium orchids using the above method. The known species, Colletotrichum boninense, C. camelliae-japonicae, C. fructicola, C. jiangxiense and C. orchidophilum were identified as fungal endophytes of Dendrobium spp., along with the new species, C. cariniferi, C. chiangraiense, C. doitungense, C. parallelophorum and C. watphraense, which are introduced in this paper. One strain is recorded as an unidentified species. Corn meal agar is recommended as a good sporulation medium for Colletotrichum species. This is the first report of fungal endophytes associated with Dendrobium cariniferum and D. harveyanum. Colletotrichum camelliae-japonicae, C. jiangxiense, and C. orchidophilum are new host records for Thailand.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColletotrichum 3aDendrobium 3aagar 3acorn meal 3aendophytes 3afungi 3ahost plants 3anew host records 3anew species 3apaper 3apathogens 3asaprophytes 3asporulation 3astrains 3aChina 3aThailand 0aEndophytic fungi 0amulti-loci1 aNontachaiyapoom, Sureeporn1 aJayawardena, Ruvishika S.1 ayde, Kevin D.1 aGentekaki, Eleni1 aZhou, Sixuan1 aQian, Yixin1 aWen, Tingchi1 aKang, Jichuan0 tMycoKeys.g2018 Dec. 4, v. 43 p.23-57dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2143x1314-40497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/mycokeys.43.250813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01655naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005100094040001800145100001400163245008800177300001600265500001900281500000900300520066300309592002800972650002101000650001801021650001201039650000901051650001001060650001101070650002101081773012001102856009801222852000901320655001201329IND60665239420221118150011.0191122e196807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066523942DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1968.0011183X000800040005x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshri, A.10aMorphology and Inheritance of Sterile Brachytic Dwarfs in Peanuts, Arachis hypogaea  ap. 413-415.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aVarious morphological manifestations of brachytic dwarfs in peanuts, Anachis hypogaea L., and their inheritance have been studied. It was concluded that two duplicate genes control this trait, although a third locus was indicated in one cross. Apparently modifiers were also involved. These genes cause marked shortening of the internodes, petioles, flowers and floral organs and other deviations. The plants are male sterile, having no pollen. They are also female sterile, or are unable to support embryo development. The trait demonstrates how undesirable recessive alleles can accumulate in self-pollinating amphiploid species, containing duplicate loci.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArachis hypogaea 3aembryogenesis 3afemales 3aloci 3amales 3apollen 3aself-pollination0 tCrop science.g1968 July, v. 8, no. 4 p.413-415dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1968.0011183X000800040005x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002000150245007600170300001600246520103600262592002801298650003001326650001301356650001701369650001201386650002301398650001401421650002001435650001501455650002301470700001901493700002101512700002101533700001801554700001301572700001901585700001701604700001601621700002101637773008901658856008601747852000901833655001201842IND4465507420221120175156.0141111e20120515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446550742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.11.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Bing-Hung10aAnti-allergic activity of grapeseed extract (GSE) on RBL-2H3 mast cells  ap. 968-974.  aGrapeseed extract (GSE) is a rich source of natural phenolic compounds and possesses various pharmacological activities, including antioxidant, anticarcinogenic and anti-inflammatory properties. However, effects of GSE on immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated allergic responses still remain elusive. In the present study, the effects of GSE on activation and degranulation of RBL-2H3 mast cells were investigated. GSE pretreatments (20–100μg/ml) reduced IgE-antigen mediated release of β-hexosaminidase and histamine in RBL-2H3 cells. Additionally, GSE reversibly inhibited expression of FcεRI on RBL-2H3 cells. GSE treatments caused a significant elevation of intracellular cAMP levels, whereas the Ca²⁺ influx upon antigen stimulation was inhibited. Suppression on FcεRI expression together with decreased calcium uptake and increased cAMP level might be involved in attenuated degranulation of mast cells by GSE treatment. Our results suggest a possible pharmaceutical application of GSE in treating type I allergic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aantigens 3aantioxidants 3acalcium 3agrape seed extract 3ahistamine 3aimmunoglobulins 3amast cells 3aphenolic compounds1 aHung, Mei-Huei1 aChen, Jeff Yi-Fu1 aChang, Hsueh-Wei1 aYu, Meng-Lung1 aWan, Lei1 aTsai, Fuu-Jen,1 aWang, Zibin,1 aFu, Tzu-Fun1 aChiu, Chien-Chih0 tFood chemistry.g2012 May 15, v. 132, no. 2 p.968-974dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.11.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245012900128300001600257520182800273592002802101650002202129650002402151650001802175650001102193650001302204650002502217650001502242650002702257650001302284650001902297650001502316650001702331650002502348650001202373651001702385653002502402653003302427653001502460653001702475653001802492700002002510700001902530700001402549700001702563700002202580700001702602773011802619852000902737655001202746IND60563378520221119123342.0170215e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056337852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKröbel, R.10aNitrogen and phosphorus effects on water use efficiency of spring wheat grown in a semi-arid region of the Canadian prairies  ap. 573-587.  aKröbel, R., Campbell, C.

Nitrogen and phosphorus effects on water use efficiency of spring wheat grown in a semi-arid region of the Canadian prairies. Can. J. Soil Sci. 92: 573-587. Water use efficiency (WUE) has often been analyzed for semiarid environments, but fallow-containing cropping systems were assessed inappropriately. Further, these short-term studies are unlikely to correctly assess weather variability impacts in such environments. We assessed the impact of fertilizer N and P on water use efficiency (WUE) and precipitation use efficiency (PUE) of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) from a 39-yr long-term crop rotation study in semi-arid southwestern Saskatchewan. In the rotation experiment, continuous wheat (Cont W) with N+P or P fertilizer only, and fallow-wheat-wheat (F-W-W) with N+P, P only, or N only were studied. We calculated WUE using: (i) Yield (Y)/[water use (WU)/potential water use (PET)]; (ii) Y/WU; (iii) Y/WU with a fallow phase element added; and (iv) Y/harvest-to-harvest precipitation (PUE). The WUEs in the rotation experiment were generally greater for treatments with N+P fertilizer, and greatest after an increase of N application coupled with favourable soil water conditions in the final decades of this study. In cases (i) and (ii), WUE for F-W-W was greater than for the Cont W-treatment. In case (iii), the WUEs were 5.7, 4.5, 3.9, 3.6, and 3.6 kg ha⁻¹ mm⁻¹ water for Cont W (N+P), Cont W (P), F-W-W (N+P), F-W-W (P), and F-W-W (N), respectively. For PUE [case (iv)] the values were 4.0, 3.1, 3.4, 3.0, and 2.9, respectively. We concluded that case (ii) was most appropriate for continuous cropping and case (iii) for systems including fallow, while case (iv) was usable in general.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3acontinuous cropping 3acrop rotation 3afallow 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aprairies 3asemiarid zones 3asoil water 3aspring wheat 3awater use efficiency 3aweather 3aSaskatchewan 0aWater use efficiency 0aprecipitation use efficiency 0afertilizer 0aspring wheat 0asummer fallow1 aCampbell, C.

It was found that the ground-state structure of [MnL(O₂)(H₂O)]²⁺ possesses a typical bent end-on binding mode (Mn–O–O angle at around 130° and dioxygen bond length at ∼1.32 Å) within a sextet state (S = 5/2) irrespective of calculated methodologies. The experimently proposed linear end-on structure (Mn–O–O angle at ∼180°) and the side-on structure (Mn–O–O angle ∼75°) are shown to be transition-state structures in the process of dioxygen flipping from one bent-end-on structure to another. By the inclusion of water solvation effect via both the explicit water-cluster model ([MnL(O₂)(H₂O)]²⁺–nH₂O, n = 1, 4, 6, 8) and implicit CPCM solvation model, a good correlation was concluded: the more additional waters and the more contracted Oₑ square benefit the larger Mn–O–O angle, indicating a water solvation effect and a ligand size effect. Inspired by the relationship of linear end-on mode with bent end-on mode and the consistence of the projected dioxygen bond length of [MnL(O₂)(H₂O)]²⁺–8H₂O in the CPCM model along the Mn–O bond direction (dO₁–O₂(p) = 1.240 Å) with the experimental dioxygen bond length (1.249 Å), we concluded that the linear Mn–O–O arrangement fitted by experimentalists should be a result of the flipping motion of dioxygen rotating about the Mn–O bond in solid-state structures of the [MnL(O₂)(H₂O)](PF₆)₂ complex based on analyses of the crystallographic data. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses show the sextet [MnL(O₂)(H₂O)]²⁺–nH₂O (n = 0, 1, 4, 6, 8) have a Mn(iii)-superoxo nature, consistent with experimental observations. The differences in the bonding structures of the three binding modes were discussed by the second-order perturbation energies ΔEᵢ→ⱼ from the superoxo lone pair (LP) orbitals to Mn(iii) 3d orbitals in β electron space. It can also give clues about the instability of the linear end-on binding mode and the increased Mn–O–O angle in the presence of water solvents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3achemical bonding 3adensity functional theory 3ageometry 3aligands 3amanganese 3amodels 3aoxygen 3asolvents 3azwitterions1 aWang, Hui-Fang1 aLang, Jian-Ping0 tRSC advances.g2016 Aug. 30, v. 6, no. 85 p.81517-81526dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra11199h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03379naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245011700203500001900320520171200339592002802051650001502079650001702094650001702111650001502128650001302143650001702156650002302173650002602196650001702222650001602239650002202255650001902277651001402296653002702310653002102337653001902358653002502377653001802402653001902420700002402439700001902463700002002482700002302502700001902525700001602544700001802560700001702578700002202595773011602617856008302733852000902816655001202825IND60736766120221119214411.0210610e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073676612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2021.1271762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirk, Holly1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8724-321010aBuilding biodiversity into the urban fabric: A case study in applying Biodiversity Sensitive Urban Design (BSUD)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBiodiversity within cities is fundamental for human health and well-being, and delivers a wide range of critical ecosystem services. However, biodiversity is often viewed as an afterthought or final addition once an urban development nears completion. As such, provisions for biodiversity are typically tokenistic and do not achieve the experience of everyday nature that people need. Considering biodiversity requirements at the start of an urban development allows for strategic, intentional design with biodiversity enhancement in mind. Biodiversity Sensitive Urban Design (BSUD) is a protocol that aims to create urban areas that deliver on-site benefit to native species and ecosystems through the provision of essential habitat and food resources. Here we present a case study demonstrating how BSUD methods can be used to (a) encourage successful outcomes for nature, (b) improve the aesthetics and liveability of the urban form, and (c) engage stakeholders in a process that supports other aspects of urban design including park and streetscape design. Fishermans Bend (Melbourne) is the largest urban renewal project in Australia, and one of the first of this scale to explicitly include biodiversity targets. We outline the methods used to co-create biodiversity objectives with diverse stakeholders, and how these, combined with a quantitative analysis of their potential biodiversity impact, were translated into clear design and planning recommendations. We critically reflect on the success of this method for 1) communicating and facilitating provisions for biodiversity across different stakeholders and 2) providing clear messaging around biodiversity across different planning disciplines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3aecosystems 3ahabitats 3ahuman health 3aindigenous species 3aquantitative analysis 3astakeholders 3aurban areas 3aurban development 3aurban forestry 3aAustralia 0aNature-based solutions 0aNature in cities 0aUrban greening 0aGreen infrastructure 0aUrban ecology 0aUrban planning1 aGarrard, Georgia E.1 aCroeser, Thami1 aBackstrom, Anna1 aBerthon, Katherine1 aFurlong, Casey1 aHurley, Joe1 aThomas, Freya1 aWebb, Anissa1 aBekessy, Sarah A.0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2021 July, v. 62 p.127176-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2021.1271763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02001naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245008500173300001400258520100200272592002801274650001001302650000901312650001101321650001201332650001301344653002101357653001501378653002001393653002601413700002301439700001801462773011101480856005101591852000901642655001201651IND50088343820221119040606.0140414e20110329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008834382DNAL7 a10.1080/10871209.2011.5512882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNurse, Gretchen A.10aNew Implications for Wildlife Loss Evaluation: The Role of Subjective Predictors  ap. 87-99.  aThe quantification and evaluation of environmental losses has been a topic of interest for several years. Research has focused on cause of loss as a primary factor influencing loss assessment, but has neglected less objective influences. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three different conditions of cause of the wildlife loss (human, natural, ambiguous) with type of animal (mammal, bird, fish) and proximity of animal (local, international) also manipulated. Participants rated the value of each loss to themselves and society as a whole. They also rated three subjective predictors: similarity of the animal, familiarity with the animal, and ability to relate to the animal. Both subjective and objective factors affected loss assessment with cause of loss not being influential at the individual or societal level of assessment. Similarity, familiarity, and ability to relate were all significant predictors of value in at least some combinations of animal species and proximity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3afish 3ahumans 3asociety 3awildlife 0aanthropomorphism 0aattraction 0aloss assessment 0anatural resource loss1 aBenfield, Jacob A.1 aBell, Paul A.0 tHuman dimensions of wildlife.g2011 Mar. 29, v. 16, no. 2 p.87-99dTaylor & Francis Groupx1533-158X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10871209.2011.551288  aDNAL 7aarticle03920naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245010200161520215900263592002802422650003402450650002202484650002302506650001702529650001102546650001002557650001402567650001902581650001502600650001602615650001902631650002102650650001102671650002102682650002702703650002802730650002102758650002602779650002302805650001502828650001702843650001502860653001802875653001102893653002102904653001902925653001702944653001502961700001602976700001602992700001603008700001303024700001703037700001703054700001603071773011603087856008203203852000903285655001203294IND60698592020221120084153.0210428e20201005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069859202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2020.1130382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Cong10aFarfarae Flos: A review of botany, traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology  aFarfarae Flos (FF; dried flower buds of Tussilago farfara L.), a widely used traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), is also known as “Kuandonghua” (Chinese: 款冬花). It has a wide range of pharmacological effects and has long been used to treat various respiratory conditions including cough, asthma, and acute or chronic bronchitis.This study reviews the current advances in the research on the botany, ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology of Farfarae Flos. Prospects for future investigation and application of this herb are also discussed.Information on FF was collected from both published materials (such as ancient and modern books, Ph.D. and M. Sc. dissertations, monographs on medicinal plants, and pharmacopoeia) and electronic databases (such as CNKI, SciFinder, WanFang data, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Taylor&Francis, ACS Publications, Wiley, Springer, Europe PMC, EBSCOhost, J-STAGE, and Google Scholar).Approximately 175 chemical compounds, including terpenoids, organic acids, flavonoids, alkaloids, chromones, volatile oils, and other compounds, have been isolated from FF. This TCM has been reported to produce pharmacological effects on the respiratory, cardiovascular, and digestive systems, and exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective activities. FF is safe in the traditional dose range, but the potential toxicity due to the emergence of pyrrolidine alkaloids needs to be paid more attention.FF is a commonly used TCM with pharmacological activities mainly on the respiratory system. This study suggests that the further expansion of the pharmacological effect of FF and in-depth study of its prescription need to be concerned about. The investigations of the role of more active substances and the pharmacokinetics of the hepatotoxic components of FF will help to maximize the therapeutic potential and promote its popularization and application. Meanwhile, it is important to pay attention to pursue research on the similarities and differences between the leaves and the flower buds to find their respective advantages and make rational use of T. farfara L. resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aTussilago farfara 3aactive ingredients 3aantioxidants 3aasthma 3acough 3adatabases 3aessential oils 3aflavonoids 3aflower buds 3ahepatotoxicity 3aherbal medicines 3aleaves 3amedicinal plants 3aneuroprotective effect 3aorganic acids and salts 3apharmacokinetics 3apyrrolidine alkaloids 3arespiratory system 3aterpenoids 3atherapeutics 3atoxicology 0aFarfarae flos 0aBotany 0aTraditional uses 0aPhytochemistry 0aPharmacology 0aToxicology1 aWu, Hongwei1 aWang, Lixia1 aLuo, Hanyan1 aLu, Yaqi1 aZhang, Qiong1 aTang, Liying1 aWang, Zhuju0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2020 Oct. 05, v. 260 p.113038-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2020.1130383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03548naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245023600210300001600446500001900462520182300481592002802304650002702332650002402359650001402383650001702397650001302414650001402427650002002441650001102461650003002472650001402502650001602516650000902532650001102541650002702552650001802579650001602597650001702613700001802630700006102648700001902709700005202728700006302780773012002843856008202963852000903045655001203054IND60718372220221119075030.0201124e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071837222DNAL7 a10.1007/s11130-020-00840-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Shelby L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9161-320210aEquol, a Blood–Brain Barrier Permeable Gut Microbial Metabolite of Dietary Isoflavone Daidzein, Exhibits Neuroprotective Effects against Neurotoxins Induced Toxicity in Human Neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y Cells and Caenorhabditis elegans  ap. 512-517.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEmerging data support that plant food based isoflavones have ameliorating effects on a variety of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson’s disease (PD). Our previous investigation revealed that dietary isoflavones including genistein (GEN), daidzein (DAI), and equol (EQL; a gut microbial metabolite of DAI) showed promising blood–brain barrier permeability and anti-neuroinflammatory activity in murine microglial BV2 cells. However, the neuroprotective effects of EQL against neurotoxins induced toxicity in PD related models remains unclear. Herein, EQL, along with GEN and DAI, were evaluated for their cytoprotective effect in a non-contact co-culture model with LPS-BV2-conditioned media and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, their neuroprotective effects against PD related neurotoxins including 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP⁺) induced cytotoxicity were evaluated in SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, EQL was evaluated for its neuroprotective effects against MPP⁺ induced neurotoxicity using in vivo PD model including Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan assay. DAI (10 μM) and EQL (10 and 20 μM) showed cytoprotective effects by decreasing LPS-BV2-conditioned media induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells by 29.2, 32.4 and 27.2%, respectively. EQL (10 and 20 μM) also showed neuroprotective effects by decreasing 6-OHDA and MPP⁺ induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells by 30.6–34.5 and 17.9–18.9%, respectively. Additionally, data from the in vivo assay supported EQL’s neuroprotective effect as it increases survival of C. elegans exposed to MPP⁺ from 72 to 108 h. Our findings support a growing body of evidence of the neuroprotective effects of dietary isoflavones and further studies are warranted to elucidate their mechanisms of action.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3ablood-brain barrier 3acoculture 3acytotoxicity 3adaidzein 3agenistein 3ahuman nutrition 3ahumans 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alongevity 3ametabolites 3amice 3amodels 3aneuroprotective effect 3aneurotoxicity 3aneurotoxins 3apermeability1 aPark, Hyun Y.1 aVattem, Dhiraj A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9025-56881 aGrammas, Paula1 aMa, Hang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7565-68891 aSeeram, Navindra P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7064-29040 tPlant foods for human nutrition.g2020 Dec., v. 75, no. 4 p.512-517dSpringer USwJournal:jnl42388x0921-96687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11130-020-00840-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01912naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009700168300001400265520079700279592002801076650002101104650001501125650003901140650001501179650002201194650001401216650001601230650001401246650001801260650000901278650001701287653001301304700002101317700001801338773008001356856008101436852000901517655001201526IND60638255920221120073653.0190427s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063825592DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-900016152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakagami, Hiroki10aShrinkage of Tracheid Cells With Desorption Visualized by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy  ap. 29-37.  aConfocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was applied as a new method of visualizing the shrinkage of wood and its anisotropy. Control of relative humidity and temperature in a specialized environment chamber made it possible to acquire transverse images of tracheids of Akamatsu (Pinus densiflora) from the saturated condition to the dried condition. The shrinkage of tracheid cells was also determined by measuring the tangential diameter of tracheid and lumen, the radial diameter of tracheid and lumen, and the thickness of tangential and radial walls. Moreover, this technique makes it possible to discuss the relationship between moisture content and tracheid cell shape. We found the CLSM technique to be an effective method for visualizing shrinkage of tracheid cells with desorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus densiflora 3aanisotropy 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3adesorption 3arelative humidity 3ashrinkage 3atemperature 3atracheids 3awater content 3awood 3awood anatomy 0atracheid1 aMatsumura, Junji1 aOda, Kazuyuki0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 28, no. 1 p.29-37dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900016153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005700140245012500197300001800322500001100340520114900351592002801500650002501528650003601553650002201589650001501611650001701626650001401643650001601657650002101673650001901694650001701713650001501730650001601745700001901761700005301780700002401833773015201857856007402009852000902083655001202092IND60746333220221122213606.0210731e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074633322DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.150442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Rajan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9766-838910aMillets as potential nutri‐cereals: a review of nutrient composition, phytochemical profile and techno‐functionality  ap. 3703-3718.  aREVIEW  aMillets are sustainable drought‐resistant crops capable of surviving a wide range of climatic conditions. They are small‐seeded grains rich in proteins, minerals and bioactive compounds inducing several health benefits and provide protection against chronic and degenerative modern lifestyle disorders. Hypoglycaemic profile and bioactive composition are the key elements for the popularity of millets as functional ingredients for the development of novel food products of commercial importance. Despite numerous health benefits and agro‐economic potential, millets have lost their popularity due to coarse nature and are underutilised in developed countries. Food scientists and nutritionists are characterising and valorising millets to enhance their use for food applications. The present article reviews research investigations about nutritional composition (macro‐ and micro‐nutrients), biologically active components (phenolic acid, flavonoids, phytosterols and related antioxidant potential) and techno‐functionality of millets. Pharmacological impact and their utilisation in value‐added products have also been included.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3achemical constituents of plants 3adrought tolerance 3aflavonoids 3afood science 3alifestyle 3anovel foods 3anutrient content 3aphenolic acids 3aphytosterols 3atechnology 3avalue added1 aSharma, Savita1 aDar, B.N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4120-36161 aBalajīta Siṅgha,0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2021 Aug., v. 56, no. 8 p.3703-3718dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41365x0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.150443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03313naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002400191245008000215300001600295506007600311520171800387592002802105506003702133650003602170650002202206650001702228650001902245650002302264650001602287650002202303650001002325650002202335650001102357650001002368650001902378650001302397650002002410650002602430650001602456650001202472650002202484700002102506700002302527700001902550700001902569773010202588856008402690852000902774655001202783IND60089985320221207141724.0141102e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008998532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2011.04.0132doi7 aPMC32535292pmcid7 a216016532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzentpetery, Zsofia10aGenetic and functional studies of phosphatidyl-inositol 4-kinase type IIIα  ap. 476-483.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPhosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type IIIa (PI4KIIIα) is one of four mammalian PI 4-kinases that catalyzes the first committed step in polyphosphoinositide synthesis. PI4KIIIα has been linked to regulation of ER exit sites and to the synthesis of plasma membrane phosphoinositides and recent studies have also revealed its importance in replication of the Hepatitis C virus in liver. Two isoforms of the mammalian PI4KIIIα have been described and annotated in GenBank: a larger, ~230kDa (isoform 2) and a shorter splice variant containing only the ~97kDa C-terminus that includes the catalytic domain (isoform 1). However, Northern analysis of human tissues and cancer cells showed only a single transcript of ~7.5kb with the exception of the proerythroleukemia line K562, which contained significantly higher level of the 7.5kb transcript along with smaller ones of 2.4, 3.5 and 4.2kb size. Bioinformatic analysis also confirmed the high copy number of PI4KIIIα transcript in K562 cells along with several genes located in the same region in Chr22, including two pseudogenes that cover most exons coding for isoform 1, consistent with chromosome amplification. A panel of polyclonal antibodies raised against peptides within the C-terminal half of PI4KIIIα failed to detect the shorter isoform 1 either in COS-7 cells or K562 cells. Moreover, expression of a cDNA encoding isoform 1 yielded a protein of ~97kDa that showed no catalytic activity and failed to rescue hepatitis C virus replication. These data draw attention to PI4KIIIα as one of the genes found in Chr22q11, a region affected by chromosomal instability, but do not substantiate the existence of a functionally relevant short form of PI4KIIIα.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a1-phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase 3aHepatitis C virus 3aactive sites 3abioinformatics 3acatalytic activity 3achromosomes 3acomplementary DNA 3aexons 3agenetic databases 3ahumans 3aliver 3aneoplasm cells 3apeptides 3aplasma membrane 3apolyclonal antibodies 3apseudogenes 3atissues 3avirus replication1 aSzakacs, Gergely1 aBojjireddy, Naveen1 aTai, Andrew W.1 aBalla, Tamás,0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2011 , v. 1811, no. 7-8 p.476-483dElsevier B.V.x1388-19817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2011.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02171naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009300172300001600265520104200281592002801323650001301351650002701364650001001391650002001401650002001421650000901441650001201450650001301462651001401475653001401489653002001503653002101523653002001544653001601564700002201580773011101602856005101713852000901764655001201773IND50088344120221119040546.0140414e20110501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008834412DNAL7 a10.1080/10871209.2011.5595292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCornicelli, Louis10aAssessing Deer Hunter Attitudes Toward Regulatory Change Using Self-Selected Respondents  ap. 174-182.  aState wildlife agencies are charged with managing wildlife populations of harvestable species. Opinions regarding how species should be managed differ dramatically and decisions are often made without comprehensive data. There is interest among deer hunters in Minnesota to change harvest regulations that benefit mature bucks. Beginning in 2005, research focused on the biological and social implications of changing deer regulations. We used data collected via random surveys, public input meetings, and an Internet survey to assist with the decision-making process. We observed demographic differences among respondents for the three data collection methods; however, the attitudinal differences were “minimal” (i.e., Cramér's V ≈ .1). We believe that a structured public input process, even if self-selected, can help inform decision-makers. Agencies that use public input meetings should reevaluate their public input process to include an Internet component if there are adequate baseline data available to make comparisons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aattitudes and opinions 3abucks 3adata collection 3adecision making 3adeer 3asurveys 3awildlife 3aMinnesota 0aattitudes 0adeer management 0aInternet surveys 0anon-random data 0aregulations1 aGrund, Marrett D.0 tHuman dimensions of wildlife.g2011 May 1, v. 16, no. 3 p.174-182dTaylor & Francis Groupx1533-158X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10871209.2011.559529  aDNAL 7aarticle01509naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001700162245007200179300001600251500000900267520039200276592002800668650002100696650001000717650001100727650001100738650000900749650001400758650001400772650001500786650001500801650001400816650000900830650001100839650000900850700002400859773012200883856009701005852000901102655001201111IND60663381420221118064411.0191122e195803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066338142DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1958.00021962005000030005x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChichilo, P.10aTrace Elements in Agricultural Limestones of Atlantic Coast Regions  ap. 131-135.  aepub  aSynopsisCompared to amounts of elements removed from the soil by cropping or to amounts added to soils to correct deficiencies many limestones of the Atlantic Coast Regions contain important amounts of magnesium, iron, manganese, molybdenum, sulfur and zinc at ordinary application rates.

The fabrication method consisted of contact-printing a solution of PDMS and hexane (10:1.5 w/w) onto chromatographic paper using custom-designed rubber stamps containing the patterns of μPADs. After penetrating the paper (∼30s), the PDMS is cured to form hydrophobic barriers. Under optimized conditions, hydrophobic barriers and hydrophilic channels with dimensions down to 949±88μm and 771±90μm (n=5), respectively, were obtained. This resolution is well-suitable for most applications in analytical chemistry. Chemical compatibility studies revealed that the PDMS barriers were able to contain some organic solvents, including acetonitrile and methanol, and aqueous solutions of some surfactants. This find is particularly interesting given that acetonitrile and methanol are the most used solvents in chromatographic separations, non-aqueous capillary electrophoresis and electroanalysis, as well as aqueous solutions of surfactants are suitable mediums for cell lyses assays. The utility of the technique was evaluated in the fabrication of paper-based electrochemical devices (PEDs) with pencil-drawn electrodes for experiments in static cyclic voltammetry and flow injection analysis (FIA) with amperometric detection, in both aqueous and organic mediums.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aanalytical chemistry 3aaqueous solutions 3acapillary electrophoresis 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aflow injection analysis 3ahexane 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amethanol 3apaper 3apaper chromatography 3arubber 3asolvents 3asurfactants 0aPaper-based analytical devices 0aMicrofluidic devices 0aContact-printing 0aPaper-based electrochemical devices 0aElectrochemical detection 0aPencil-drawn electrodes1 aDossi, Nicolò1 aPiccin, Evandro0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 Feb. 09, v. 858 p.82-90dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2014.11.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03317naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245005000164300001600214500002000230500000900250520192900259592002802188596010002216596007502316596005302391596005202444650002202496650001602518650001602534650002602550650001702576651001002593700002002603700001702623700002802640700001402668773013302682856008302815852000902898655001202907IND60663381520221118064429.0220803e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066338152DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2017.07.04172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Shuang10aWinter Wheat Yield Gaps and Patterns in China  ap. 319-330.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aCORE IDEAS: Based on yield gap analysis, wheat yield can be improved significantly in China.Both actual and potential wheat yields showed considerable spatial variability.Winter wheat yields increased in 53% of the counties in China.Nearly half of the counties experienced impaired wheat yields.Declining solar radiation and increasing temperature reduce wheat yield. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield stagnation has been reported in some regions of the world. China is the largest producer of wheat across the globe, but the pattern of its wheat yield stagnation remains poorly addressed. Here, our goal is to examine the temporal trends and spatial patterns of wheat yields along with possible causes based on a comprehensive assessment of winter wheat yield throughout China over the 31‐yr period from 1980 to 2010. Combined with the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) wheat model, we assessed the winter wheat yield gaps and patterns in 1414 counties and at five physiogeographic regional scales across China to ascertain the driving factors of yield variations. Wheat yields increased in 53% of the 1414 counties, but the remaining counties experienced yields that never improved, stagnated, or collapsed from 1980 to 2010. The yield gap analysis showed that actual yields represented only 59% of the national average yield potential, indicating a substantial opportunity to improve winter wheat yields. Relatively larger yield gaps were observed in the northern China Plain (NC, 47%) and in southwestern China (SW, 45%). Although the yield gaps in these regions were accompanied by significantly progressive uptrends of actual yields, our results suggest that agronomic management could be further improved. Moreover, underperforming regions could potentially benefit from new investments and strategies to reliably increase actual yields and reverse trends in stagnation in winter wheat performance.  aPublisher supplied data  a2012BAD20B04cMinistry of Science and Technology of China (National Key Technology R&D Program)  a2016YFD0300101cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a17-326-JcKansas Agricultural Experiment Station  cUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aTriticum aestivum 3acrop models 3agrain yield 3aproduction technology 3awinter wheat 3aChina1 aYang, Xiaoguang1 aLin, Xiaomao1 aSassenrath, Gretchen F.1 aLi, Kenan0 tAgronomy journal.g2018 Jan., v. 110, no. 1 p.319-330dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2017.07.04173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008200158300002000240520151700260592002801777650001301805650001901818650001101837650002001848700001801868700001801886700001401904773014401918856007402062852000902136655001202145IND60744760820221119110914.0210716e20210714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074476082DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta02789a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Myungkyu10aUnlocking veiled oxygen redox in Na-based earth-abundant binary layered oxide  ap. 15179-15187.  aOxygen-redox reactions (ORRs) in Na-based transition metal (TM) layered oxides have attracted a great deal of attention as a means of overcoming the intrinsic low energy density of the cathodes of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), because their activities occur above ≈4.0 V versus Na⁺/Na and deliver extra capacity beyond the TM-based redox contribution. Intriguingly, Mn-based binary-layered oxides (e.g., Na₁₋ₓ[Mn₁₋yNiy]O₂), have recently been re-examined to elucidate the ORR involvement that had been assigned to the Ni³⁺/Ni⁴⁺ redox couple. Accordingly, Na₁₋ₓ[Mn₁/₂Fe₁/₂]O₂, a representative abundant cathode, was reinvestigated in detail using first-principles calculations to unlock veiled ORRs upon charging. First, the charge variations of Mn, Fe, and O showed that a typical Mn³⁺/Mn⁴⁺ cationic redox is a principal factor in charge compensation for 0.25 ≤ x ≤ 0.5 in Na₁₋ₓ[Mn₁/₂Fe₁/₂]O₂, whereas a dominant ORR contributes to the charge compensation with the partial Fe redox for a value above x = 0.5. Second, the ORR is selective depending on the oxygen site coordinates with Fe-rich (2Fe–O–Mn) or Mn-rich (Fe–O–2Mn) environments. Third, the Fe–O chemical bonding features reveal that the Jahn–Teller distortion determines the priority of the oxygen redox reaction ≈4.0 V. Along these lines, our findings provide insights into directions in utilizing the veiled oxygen redox reaction of Naₓ[Mn₁₋yFey]O₂ binary oxides.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3aenergy density 3aoxygen 3aredox reactions1 aKim, Hyungjun1 aCho, Maenghyo1 aKim, Duho0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2021 July 14, v. 9, no. 27 p.15179-15187dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta02789a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02033naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245012200207500001900329520076500348592002801113650001101141650002301152650001901175650002201194650001101216650002201227653002401249653002001273653001201293653002501305653001901330700003501349700006801384773011601452856008201568852000901650655001201659IND60709522720221120165851.0201223e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070952272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2020.1077792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYaqoob, Asim Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2727-394410aDevelopment and modification of materials to build cost-effective anodes for microbial fuel cells (MFCs): An overview  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMicrobial fuel cells (MFCs) are innovative bioelectrochemical approaches for natural conversion of waste resources into energy based on the metabolic activities of inoculated bacteria which served as biocatalysts.

Recently, N-palmitoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) has been reported to function as an anorectic hormone secreted from the gut and acting on the brain (Gillum et al., [5]). In the current study, two of our laboratories independently investigated whether NAPE metabolites may be involved in mediating the anorectic action of NAPE i.p. injected in mice. Thus, the anorectic activity of a non-hydrolysable NAPE analogue, having ether bonds instead of ester bonds at sn1 and sn2 was compared with that of NAPE in molar equivalent doses. Furthermore, the anorectic effect of NAPE in NAPE-hydrolysing phospholipase D knockout animals was investigated. As negative controls, the NAPE precursor phosphatidylethanolamine and the related phospholipids phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidic acid were also tested. All compounds except one were found to inhibit food intake, raising the possibility that the effect of NAPE is non-specific.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3acell membranes 3adigestive system 3afood intake 3ametabolites 3amice 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphospholipase D1 aTsuboi, Kazuhito1 aMadsen, Andreas Nygaard1 aHolst, Birgitte1 aDiep, Thi Ai1 aNakao, Michiyasu1 aTokumura, Akira1 aBurns, Matthew P.1 aDeutsch, Dale G.1 aUeda, Natsuo1 aHansen, Harald Severin0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2011 Sept., v. 1811, no. 9 p.508-512dElsevier B.V.x1388-19817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2011.06.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03397naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245015300163300001600316520198000332592002802312650002502340650001102365650001602376650001202392650001602404650002202420650001702442650001402459650001602473650004102489650001402530650001102544650001902555650001102574650002202585650001602607651001002623700001602633700001902649700001802668700002102686773012902707856008202836852000902918655001202927IND60549228220221118160330.0160907e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054922822DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-04-14-0361-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Bing10aEffects of Temperature, Wetness Duration, and Moisture on the Conidial Germination, Infection, and Disease Incubation Period of Glomerella cingulata  ap. 249-256.  aGlomerella leaf spot (GLS) caused by Glomerella cingulata is a newly emergent disease that results in severe defoliation and fruit spots. Currently, GLS is not effectively controlled in China due to a lack of understanding of its epidemiology. Therefore, the effects of temperature, wetness duration, and moisture on conidial germination, infection, and the disease incubation period of GLS were examined by inoculating cv. Gala apple leaves with a conidial suspension and performing in vitro germination assays. Conidia could germinate and form appressoria at temperatures ranging from 5 to 35°C, with an optimum temperature of 27.6°C. The germination of conidia required free water or a nearly saturated relative humidity, with only a few conidia germinating and forming appressoria when the RH was less than 99%. The conidial germination dynamics at 10, 25, and 30°C were well represented by three logistic models. The infection of cv. Gala apple leaves by conidia occurred at temperatures ranging from 15 to 35°C. The minimum wetness duration required for infection by conidia at different temperatures was described using a polynomial equation, and the lowest minimum wetness duration was 2.76 h, which occurred at 27.6°C according to the polynomial. Successful infection by conidia was represented by the number of lesions per leaf, which increased with extended wetness durations at the conidial infection stage for six tested temperatures, with the exception of 10°C, when the minimum wetness durations were satisfied. The associations of successfully infected conidia with wetness duration at temperatures of 15, 20, 25, and 30°C were described by four logistic models. Conidia infections developed into visible lesions at temperatures ranging from 15 to 30°C, and the shortest incubation period of 2 days was observed at 25°C. These data and models can be used to construct forecasting models and develop effective control systems for Glomerella leaf spot.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlomerella cingulata 3aapples 3aappressoria 3aconidia 3adefoliation 3aemerging diseases 3aepidemiology 3aequations 3agermination 3ainfectious disease incubation period 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3alogit analysis 3amodels 3arelative humidity 3atemperature 3aChina1 aLi, Bao-Hua1 aDong, Xiang-Li1 aWang, Cai-Xia1 aZhang, Zhen-Fang0 tPlant disease.g2015 Feb., v. 99, no. 2 p.249-256dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-04-14-0361-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02557naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245018000165300001600345500001900361520114600380592002801526596007501554650001801629650002901647650001401676650001601690650001901706650002001725650001101745650001801756650001101774650001501785650002101800700001701821700001901838700001401857700005301871773012001924856008202044852000902126655001202135IND60718372720221119075033.0201124e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071837272DNAL7 a10.1007/s11130-020-00845-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Dianzhi10aIn Vitro Starch Digestibility and Estimated Glycemic Index of Mung Bean (Vigna radiata L.) as Affected by Endogenous Proteins and Lipids, and Exogenous Heat-Processing Methods  ap. 547-552.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro starch digestibility and estimated glycemic index (eGI) of mung bean (Vigna radiata L.) as affected by endogenous proteins and lipids, and exogenous heat-processing methods. Results showed that the in vitro starch digestibility and eGI were significantly increased after the removal of protein, lipid, or both (P < 0.05). Moreover, the effects of endogenous proteins and lipids on the in vitro starch digestibility and eGI of mung bean followed the order: both protein and lipid removal > protein removal > lipid removal. In addition, heat-processing could make the slowly digestible starch and resistant starch convert to the rapidly digestible starch. The effects of different exogenous heat-processing methods on in vitro starch digestibility and eGI in the present study showed the following order: germination combined with cooking > high-pressure cooking > extrusion cooking > ordinary cooking. This study provided a crucial reference for the human with potential hyperglycemia to choose mung bean treated with ordinary cooking and without further protein and/or lipid removal.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0401202cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3aVigna radiata 3adigestible carbohydrates 3aextrusion 3agermination 3aglycemic index 3ahuman nutrition 3ahumans 3ahyperglycemia 3alipids 3amung beans 3aresistant starch1 aZhao, Qingyu1 aYousaf, Laraib1 aXue, Yong1 aShen, Qun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2154-61040 tPlant foods for human nutrition.g2020 Dec., v. 75, no. 4 p.547-552dSpringer USwJournal:jnl42388x0921-96687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11130-020-00845-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03292naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245015800175300001600333520176400349592002802113650002102141650001302162650001602175650001502191650001602206650002502222650001002247650002202257650001302279650001302292650001402305650001402319650002502333650001902358650000902377650001702386650001302403650002602416651001002442651001102452700002102463700002102484700002002505700001902525700002602544773011102570856008402681852000902765655001202774IND60549228320221118160254.0160907e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054922832DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-04-14-0373-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKonstantinou, Sotirios10aPopulation Structure, Fungicide Resistance Profile, and sdhB Mutation Frequency of Botrytis cinerea from Strawberry and Greenhouse-Grown Tomato in Greece  ap. 240-248.  aBotrytis cinerea is a pathogen with high genetic variability that has also shown high risk for fungicide resistance development. In total, 1,169 isolates obtained from strawberry (n = 297) and tomato (n = 872) in five geographic regions of Greece were tested for their sensitivity to several botryticides. A high frequency of isolates with multiple resistance to carbendazim, cyprodinil, pyraclostrobin, and boscalid was found in isolates from strawberry. In the isolates from tomato, the predominant phenotype was that of dual resistance to carbendazim and cyprodinil in the Crete island, of single resistance to carbendazim in the region of Preveza, and of sensitive isolates in the region of Kyparissia. None of the tested isolates was found to be fludioxonil resistant. High frequencies of boscalid-resistant phenotypes were observed in the strawberry isolates, while boscalid-resistance frequency in the tomato isolates was lower. H272R was the predominant sdhB mutation, associated with resistance to boscalid, in all the sampled isolates, while other sdhB mutations were found at low frequencies. B. cinerea group S, identified by the presence of a 21-bp insertion in the transcription factor mrr1 gene, was predominant within the tomato isolates obtained from all three sampled regions, with frequencies ranging from 62 to 75% of the isolates; whereas, within strawberry isolates, B. cinerea was predominant, with frequencies of 75 to 95%. Correlations of isolate genotype and fungicide resistance profile showed that B. cinerea sensu stricto isolates were more prone to the development of resistance to boscalid compared with the Botrytis group S isolates, which may explain the observed predominance of B. cinerea sensu stricto in strawberry fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aboscalid 3acarbendazim 3acyprodinil 3afludioxonil 3afungicide resistance 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3amutation 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3apopulation structure 3apyraclostrobin 3arisk 3astrawberries 3atomatoes 3atranscription factors 3aCrete 3aGreece1 aVeloukas, Thomas1 aLeroch, Michaela1 aMenexes, George1 aHahn, Matthias1 aKaraoglanidis, George0 tPlant disease.g2015 Feb., v. 99, no. 2 p.240-248dThe American Phytopathological Societyx0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FPDIS-04-14-0373-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012000164500001900284520157100303592002801874650001601902650001301918650001701931650002201948650002101970650001801991650001802009650001302027650001502040650001302055653002802068653001202096653002602108653002202134700001802156700001902174700001502193700001302208700005402221700005502275773011602330856008202446852000902528655001202537IND60709522920221120165859.0201223e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070952292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2020.1077812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Shuhong10a15α-hydroxylation of D-ethylgonendione by Penicillium raistrickii in deep eutectic solvents DESs containing system  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPenicillium raistrickii-mediated 15α-hydroxylation of D-ethylgonendione is a key step for industrial production of gestodene. However, the process efficiency is limited due to the poor solubility of the steroid in aqueous water system. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are promising solvents applied widely in biocatalysis. Here we systematically investigated the biotransformation performance of P.raistrickii in 14 different DESs containing system. DESs with different HBD exhibited different effects on the biotransformation, and no production was found in organic acid based DESs, whereas improved biotransformation efficiency in the presence of DESs with alcohol was observed. DESs also showed synergetic effects on steroid hydroxylation when compared with that in aqueous solutions of the deep eutectic solvent ([ChCl][Gly], 1:2), its components (glycol and choline chloride), and the mixture of them, respectively. Of all the DES tested, [ChCl][Gly] was successfully applied in steroid hydroxylation, and the substrate bioconversion (72 h) enhanced to 82% in the system containing 4% DES, 2 g/L substrate and 17.5 gdw/L mycelium, which is much higher than that without DESs (33%). DES with alcohol as HBD especially [ChCl][Gly] showed better biocompability toward P.raistrickii, and their beneficial effect on mass transfer of the substrate was also observed. Results obtained in this study suggested that [ChCl][Gly] is the most potential in D-ethylgonendione hydroxylation mediated by P. raistrickii, broadening their applications in steroid production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPenicillium 3aalcohols 3abiocatalysis 3abiotransformation 3acholine chloride 3ahydroxylation 3amass transfer 3amycelium 3asolubility 3asolvents 0aPenicillium raistrickii 0asteroid 0adeep eutectic solvent 0aD-ethylgonendione1 aWang, Xiaorui1 aZhang, Zhaohui1 aWang, Shan1 aLi, Kang1 aLu, Fuping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0610-88271 aQin, Huimin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2588-36340 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 164 p.107781-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12044x1369-703X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2020.1077813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008700166500002200253520168400275592002801959653001501987653002002002653001602022653001502038653001902053653000902072653001102081653000902092653001202101653001002113653001402123653000802137700002302145773010902168856008202277852000902359655001202368IND60669768220221118005314.0190923e20190913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066976822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2019.1081072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNauser, Thomas10aFast reaction of carbon free radicals with flavonoids and other aromatic compounds  aPre-press version  aMany theoretical and experimental studies have shown that the principal initial biological targets of free radicals are nucleic acids, lipids and proteins. The reaction normally generates carbon-centered radicals which can propagate molecular damage either directly or after formation of new reactive species following reaction with oxygen. Overall damage prevention is therefore best achieved by repair of the carbon radicals before they initiate further reactions. Recent studies have shown that the repair cannot be achieved by normal levels of the endogenous antioxidants glutathione, ascorbate or urate. Since their concentrations are well regulated and cannot be enhanced by oral intake, we have investigated the effectiveness of flavonoids and other polyphenols as potential carbon radical repair agents, because their levels in vivo can be significantly enhanced by diet. Pulse radiolysis measurements of the rate constants of repair of amino acid radicals by several polyphenols showed reversible formation of radical-polyphenol adducts 100–1000 times faster than previously reported for the bimolecular stoichiometric reactions of flavonoids i.e. with rate constants in the order of 1010 M−1s−1. Adduct formation depended only on the presence of a carbon-centered radical and an aromatic moiety in the reactants, without the involvement of redox reactions at the phenolic groups. Formation of adducts lowered the reactivity of the radicals. Our results suggest that flavonoids, polyphenols and many of their metabolites can effectively reduce the damaging potential of carbon radicals at concentrations achievable in vivo by diets rich in fruits and vegetables.  aPublisher supplied data 0aC-radicals 0aRadical adducts 0aPolyphenols 0aFlavonoids 0aRate constants 0aR● 0aROO● 0aROOH 0aHAsc─ 0aN3● 0aBr2●‒ 0aHSA1 aGebicki, Janusz M.0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2019 Sept. 13, dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2019.1081073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02287naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002500137245010300162300001800265520115900283592002801442650001501470650001601485650002101501650002201522650001101544650001601555650001401571650001301585650001101598650001601609651001301625651001901638651001301657700002001670700002101690773009801711856007101809852000901880655001201889IND60518545420221119065435.0160418e197111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051854542DNAL7 a10.2307/19338222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKochsiek, Kenneth A.10aSpecies Diversity of Net Zooplankton and Physiochemical Conditions in Keystone Reservoir, Oklahoma  ap. 1119-1125.  aNet zooplankton collections and physiochemical measurements were made monthly in four stations each in the Cimarron River and Arkansas River arms and one station at the dam of Keystone Reservoir, Oklahoma, from June 21, 1967, to June 24, 1968. Conductivity was considerably greater in the Cimarron Arm than in the Arkansas arm or the dam, while turbidity, alkalinity, and zooplankton density were generally higher in the Arkansas arm. Variation among stations in temperature and dissolved oxygen was slight. A total of 44 taxa of zooplankton were collected. Shannon's formula was used to evaluate species diversity (d) of zooplankton. Variance values of d indicated only a slight gain in precision by increasing the sample size to above 400 individuals. Mean annual species diversity was slightly lower in the Cimarron Arm than in the Arkansas Arm. Diversity values decreased slightly through early winter and decreased abruptly and reached minimum values in late winter and early spring. Coefficients of correlation between physiochemical parameters and species diversity unadjusted for month and station effect were compared with adjusted coefficients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalinity 3acorrelation 3adissolved oxygen 3aspecies diversity 3aspring 3atemperature 3aturbidity 3avariance 3awinter 3azooplankton 3aArkansas 3aArkansas River 3aOklahoma1 aWilhm, Jerry L.1 aMorrison, Robert0 tEcology.g1971 Nov., v. 52, no. 6 p.1119-1125dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19338223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013400166300001400300520112100314592002801435650001701463650001601480650001401496650002401510650001701534650003201551650002201583700002301605700002501628700002301653700002501676700002001701773009401721856008401815852000901899655001201908IND60112955620221120063817.0141111e20120413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011295562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaru, Naama10aDetermination of pharmaceutically related compounds by suppressed ion chromatography: III. Role of electrolytic suppressor design  ap. 71-77.  aFor the hyphenation of ion chromatography to nebulising detectors or mass spectrometry, suppression of the non-volatile ionic eluent to water is a required step to avoid elevated detector baselines. Presented here is a study of three new designs of electrolytic suppressors, incorporating high ion-exchange capacity screens and high ion-exchange capacity membranes in different thickness and compositions. These designs aim to minimise hydrophobic interactions of the suppressor with organic analytes and to provide higher compatibility with eluents containing acetonitrile. In comparison with a commercially available electrolytic suppressor and also a commercially available chemical suppressor, the new high-capacity suppressor showed superior performance, exhibiting minimal interactions with a test set of analytes under the examined conditions. This led to the attainment of high recoveries of the analytes after suppression (93–99% recovery) and significantly reduced band broadening during suppression. The new suppressor has been shown to perform well under both isocratic and gradient elution conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aatomization 3adetectors 3ahydrophobic bonding 3aion exchange 3aion exchange chromatography 3amass spectrometry1 aDicinoski, Greg W.1 aHanna-Brown, Melissa1 aSrinivasan, Kannan1 aPohl, Christopher A.1 aHaddad, Paul R.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 Apr. 13, v. 1233 p.71-77dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002300149245009800172300001600270520155400286592002801840650001401868650002801882650001001910650001101920650001601931650002101947650001901968650002401987650001502011650001002026650001102036650001602047650001202063650001602075650001502091700001902106700001902125700001702144700002302161773009402184856008502278852000902363655001202372IND4466820220221123032551.0141110e20120124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446682022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.11.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCallum, James L.10aQuantifying groundwater flows to streams using differential flow gaugings and water chemistry  ap. 118-132.  aWhile estimates of net groundwater inflow to streams (inflow minus outflow) can be made using differential flow gauging, the inclusion of water chemistry (tracer) measurements allows both inflow and outflow to be separately quantified. In this paper we assess how the estimates of net and gross groundwater inflows are affected by the choice of tracer at three contrasting field sites. Groundwater flows are first estimated with differential flow gauging and then with the sequential addition of natural tracer data – electrical conductivity, chloride concentration and radon activity measurements. The final analysis is where an injected tracer experiment is also conducted to constrain the gas transfer velocity for radon. Groundwater inflow rates were estimated by calibrating a numerical model which simulated flows and concentrations of tracers in the river. Although both the total groundwater inflow along the study reach and the spatial distribution of inflow depended on the data used for the model calibration, the difference between the estimates was less than the prediction error. The analysis also showed that prediction error for groundwater inflow decreases as additional tracers are included in the analysis. The magnitude of the error reduction is related to the properties of the specific catchment. Generally, for a tracer to reduce uncertainty substantially the concentration of the tracer in groundwater must be well defined, and the contrast between the concentration of the tracer in groundwater and the river must be high.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorides 3aelectrical conductivity 3agases 3agauges 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3ahydrochemistry 3amathematical models 3aprediction 3aradon 3arivers 3astream flow 3astreams 3auncertainty 3awatersheds1 aCook, Peter G.1 aBerhane, Dawit1 aRumpf, Chris1 aMcMahon, Gerard A.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2012 Jan. 24, v. 416-417 p.118-132dElsevier B.V.x0022-16947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.11.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009300167300001600260520192000276592002802196650000902224650001502233650002002248650001402268650002402282650002602306650002502332650001902357650001502376651001802391700001402409773011102423856008402534852000902618655001202627IND60549228620221118160242.0160907e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054922862DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-04-14-0415-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVincelli, Paul10aInfluence of Open Alleys in Field Trials Assessing Yield Effects from Fungicides in Corn  ap. 263-266.  aIncluding open alleys at ends of plots is a common practice when field-testing foliar fungicides used in corn production. Open alleys facilitate movement of workers and equipment between plots during spray application. Open alleys affect crop yield estimates in small plots typically used in replicated, randomized experimental designs, because of reduced interplant competition. However, no published research has tested whether the alley effect interacts with fungicide to bias the assessment of the agronomic effects of the latter. We tested this hypothesis over 2 years by evaluating yield with and without application of Headline AMP (containing pyraclostrobin and metconazole) plus nonionic surfactant applied once at VT/R1 in 7.6-m plots separated on their ends by 1.5-m alleys free of aboveground vegetation. In each plot, data were collected from seven subplots, each measuring 1.09 m of row-length and running parallel to the long axis of the plot. Consistent with previous reports, yields of subplots were substantially higher toward plot ends than in the central areas of plots. Surprisingly, a significant (P < 0.10) fungicide × subplot interaction was observed in both experiments, indicating that the yield response from fungicide depended on subplot position within the plot. However, yield differences due to fungicide were trivial when comparing regression-based yield estimates from all seven subplot positions to those obtained from only the centermost three subplot positions. Our study does not lend support to the hypothesis that the open-alley design creates a meaningful bias in assessment of treatment effects due to foliar fungicides in corn. However, additional research on this question is warranted, given the complexities of comparing results in large-scale plots vs. small plots, the limitations of our study, and the widespread use of fungicides on field corn in the United States.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3acrop yield 3adata collection 3aequipment 3aexperimental design 3afield experimentation 3anonionic surfactants 3apyraclostrobin 3avegetation 3aUnited States1 aLee, Chad0 tPlant disease.g2015 Feb., v. 99, no. 2 p.263-266dThe American Phytopathological Societyx0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FPDIS-04-14-0415-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01948naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007000166300001800236500001900254520099400273592002801267650001601295650001401311650001801325650001001343650001701353650002501370650002001395773012901415856008101544852000901625655001201634IND60718373220221119074655.0201124e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071837322DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954201100582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrylova, E.

Some taxa have a semideterminate stem growth habit. In different crops preference can be given to cultivars with different stem growth habits. Because of this, among angiosperms for this trait, pronounced homologous series in hereditary variability are observed. The review considers molecular genetic mechanisms controlling the stem growth habit in dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants, which underlie phenotypic variation. Data on the known homologs of the Arabidopsis TFL1 gene are presented. Comparison of modern data on the genetic control of stem growth habit in the representatives of different taxa of angiosperms points to the evolutionary conservation of molecular genetic mechanisms controlling the initiation of flowering, as well as to the conserved functionality of the genes involved in this process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3acultivars 3adomestication 3agenes 3agrowth habit 3aphenotypic variation 3astem elongation0 tRussian journal of genetics.g2020 Nov., v. 56, no. 11 p.1308-1322dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl4138153x1022-79547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10227954201100583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02387naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245004800158520136900206592002801575650001201603650001601615650002201631650001801653650001201671650002101683650001201704650002101716650001501737650001401752650001401766650001701780700002101797773012301818856007501941852000902016655001202025IND60792710320221122143358.0220908e20220827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079271032DNAL7 a10.3390/nu141735422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Sherry 10aInsulin-Lowering Diets in Metastatic Cancer  aHyperinsulinemia is an independent risk factor for cancer mortality. Insulin-lowering dietary strategies such as calorie restriction (CR), low-carbohydrate or ketogenic diets (KD), and intermittent fasting (IF) are aimed at reducing systemic stores of nutrients utilized by cancer cells, attenuating insulin-related growth signaling, and improving obesity-related metabolic parameters. In this narrative review, we searched the published literature for studies that tested various insulin-lowering diets in metastatic cancer in preclinical and clinical settings. A total of 23 studies were identified. Of these, 14 were preclinical studies of dietary strategies that demonstrated improvements in insulin levels, inhibition of metastasis, and/or reduction in metastatic disease burden in animal models. The remaining nine clinical studies tested carbohydrate restriction, KD, or IF strategies which appear to be safe and feasible in patients with metastatic cancer. These approaches have also been shown to improve serum insulin and other metabolic parameters. Though promising, the anti-cancer efficacy of these interventions, such as impact on tumor response, disease-specific-, and overall survival, have not yet been conclusively demonstrated. Studies that are adequately powered to evaluate whether insulin-lowering diets improve cancer outcomes are warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3ablood serum 3aburden of disease 3acarbohydrates 3afasting 3ahyperinsulinemia 3ainsulin 3alow calorie diet 3ametastasis 3amortality 3aneoplasms 3arisk factors1 aIyengar, Neil M.0 tNutrients.g2022 Aug. 27, v. 14, no. 17dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141735423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05249naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245007400163300001200237520347500249592002803724650002103752650002203773650000803795650001303803650001203816650001303828650000903841650001603850650001803866650001503884650002003899650001403919650001203933650001603945650001803961650001203979650001503991650001604006650003304022650001104055650002204066650001304088650001404101650001204115650001604127650003004143650001304173650001004186650002304196650001004219650000904229650001004238650001204248650001204260651001004272700001604282700001404298700001504312700001504327773012904342856008304471852000904554655001204563IND60549228820221118160338.0160907e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054922882DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-05-14-0468-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, M. L.10aFirst Report of Aspergillus niger Causing Root Rot of Peanut in China  ap. 284.  aPeanut (Arachis hypogaea) is one of the most important oil crops and food legumes worldwide. China sows approximately 3.5 million hectares each year and produces 40% of the world's peanuts. Fungal diseases are among the main biotic stresses affecting peanut production. Root rot is a serious disease caused by several fungi. Pythium spp., Fusarium spp., and Rhizopus spp. are some of the root rot fungi that have been reported in China. In 2012 and 2013, root rot symptoms were observed in several fields in Laixi District, Qingdao City, Shandong Province, China. The first symptoms appeared in July. Initial symptoms of the disease were brown spots on the stem base and root. Affected plants were stunted, with leaf chlorosis, reduced growth, or sudden wilting. As disease progressed, the infected tissues showed brown discoloration and rot, and abundant dark brown and black powdery spores were visible on the surfaces of affected parts. Eventually, affected plants collapsed and died. To isolate the causal organism, roots and stems were cut into sections, which were surface-disinfected with 70% ethanol solution (v/v) for 20 s, soaked in 0.1% mercuric chloride solution for 50 s, rinsed with sterilized water three times, dried, placed on Czapek's Dox agar supplemented with chloramphenicol (100 μg/ml), and incubated at 28°C for 7 days. Fungal colonies were white initially and then covered with a dense layer of dark brown or black conidial heads. The conidial head was radiate; vesicles were nearly spherical and covered with irregular metulae and phialides. Conidia were globose or subglobose (3.0 to 5.5 μm in diameter), dark brown to black, with rough cell walls. Total genomic DNA was extracted from mycelia using the EasyPure Genomic DNA Kit (TransGEN, Beijing, China). The rDNA-ITS region was amplified using PCR with the universal fungal primers ITS1 and ITS4 (2). The purified products were separately sequenced in both directions using the same primer pair. The sequences (GenBank Accession No. KJ848716) obtained were 99% similar to the ITS sequence of isolates of Aspergillus niger. This, together with the morphological characters (1) described above, suggested that the microorganism we had isolated was A. niger. Koch's postulates were completed in the laboratory by inoculating peanut. Thirty Huayu20 peanut seeds were placed in a 500-ml sterile pot with 300 g of autoclaved soil. Twenty days after seedling emergence, 15 peanut plants were wounded with a needle and inoculated with 5 ml of conidia suspension (10⁶ ml⁻¹). The same number of peanuts were similarly wounded and inoculated with 5 ml of sterile distilled water to serve as controls in the same pot. All peanuts were kept in a randomized complete block design at 30°C under a 12-h photoperiod. After 7 days, disease symptoms similar to those observed in the field appeared in all inoculated but not in non-inoculated peanuts. The tests were repeated three times in the greenhouse. Koch's postulates were satisfied after re-isolating the A. niger from inoculated peanuts using the method described above. To our knowledge, this is the first report of A. niger causing root rot in peanut in China.References: (1) M. A. Klich. Page 12 in: Identification of Common Aspergillus Species.

Oak regeneration has been shown to respond positively to open canopies and prescribed burning. In 2008, a severe tornado damaged previously established study plots in a xeric oak and pine (Pinus spp.) forest in northern Mississippi. Some damaged and undamaged plots were treated with prescribed fire in 2010. Additional plots were established in damaged areas, and these plots were salvage-logged. Species composition and growth of saplings were measured to assess the impact of tornado damage and the treatments on oak regeneration. Tornado damage increased overall sapling densities, especially oaks, resulting in increased representation by upland oak species. In burned plots, oak saplings resisted damage and recovered from prescribed fire better than mesophytic saplings. Sapling densities, especially those of oaks, were lower in salvage-logged areas than in damaged areas that were not logged, resulting in greater dominance by saplings of mesophytic species. Results suggest that, on poor soils, oak regeneration requires damaged or thinned canopies and benefits from prescribed burning two years after canopy disturbance. In contrast, natural regeneration of oaks may be incompatible with salvage-logging, especially in areas that receive severe damage from wind.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer rubrum 3aLiquidambar styraciflua 3aPinus 3aQuercus 3acanopy 3acoastal plains 3aconiferous forests 3aforest ecosystems 3ahighlands 3anatural regeneration 3aoverstory 3aprescribed burning 3asalvage logging 3asaplings 3asavannas 3asoil 3aspecies diversity 3astorm damage 3aunderstory 3awind 3awoodlands 3aMississippi 0aprescribed fire 0asalvage logging 0asapling recruitment 0atornado damage1 aBrewer, J.

Both theoretical and statistical examination of experimental data supports a square root transformation of lignin to predict microfibril angle. The experimental material used came from 10 longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) trees. Klason lignin (n=70), microfibril angle (n=70), and extractives (n=100) were measured and reported at different ring numbers and heights. All three traits were strongly influenced by ring age from pith while microfibril angle and extractives exhibited more of a height effect than lignin. As such, the multivariate response of the three traits were different in the axial direction than the radial direction supporting that care needs to be taken when defining juvenile wood within the tree. The root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC) for microfibril angle of the theoretical model (RMSEC = 9.8) was almost as low as the least squares regression model (RMSEC = 9.35). Microfibril angle calibrations were also built from NIR absorbance and showed a strong likeness to theoretical and experimental models (RMSEC = 9.0). As a result, theoretical and experimental work provided evidence that lignin content played a significant role in how NIR absorbance relates to microfibril angle. Additionally, the large variation in extractives content coupled with sampling procedure proved important when developing NIR based calibration equations for lignin and microfibril angle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus palustris 3aabsorbance 3aacid insoluble lignin 3aequations 3ajuvenile wood 3aleast squares 3alignin 3apith 3aprediction 3atheoretical models 3atrees 0aNIR 0apolymer 0aextractives 0amicrofibril angle 0agrowth rate1 aSo, Chi L.1 aGroom, Leslie H.1 aShupe, Todd F.1 aStine, Michael1 aWikaira, Jan0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 28, no. 2 p.189-210dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900016333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002300191245013100214300001600345506007600361520147800437592002801915506003701943650002901980650002402009650002002033650001402053650001502067650001102082650002102093650001002114650001202124650003302136650002102169650001202190650001502202650001802217650002102235650001102256773010502267856008402372852000902456655001202465IND60089986420221207140144.0141102e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008998642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2011.07.0042doi7 aPMC31611772pmcid7 a217829732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAthenstaedt, Karin10aYALI0E32769g (DGA1) and YALI0E16797g (LRO1) encode major triacylglycerol synthases of the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica  ap. 587-596.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica has an outstanding capacity to produce and store triacylglycerols resembling adipocytes of higher eukaryotes. Here, the identification of two genes YALI0E32769g (DGA1) and YALI0E16797g (LRO1) encoding major triacylglycerol synthases of Yarrowia lipolytica is reported. Heterologous expression of either DGA1 or LRO1 in a mutant of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae defective in triacylglycerol synthesis restores the formation of this neutral lipid. Whereas Dga1p requires acyl-CoA as a substrate for acylation of diacylglycerol, Lro1p is an acyl-CoA independent triacylglycerol synthase using phospholipids as acyl-donor. Growth of Yarrowia lipolytica strains deleted of DGA1 and/or LRO1 on glucose containing medium significantly decreases triacylglycerol accumulation. Most interestingly, when oleic acid serves as the carbon source the ratio of triacylglycerol accumulation in mutants to wild-type is significantly increased in strains defective in DGA1 but not in lro1Δ. In vitro experiments revealed that under these conditions an additional acyl-CoA dependent triacylglycerol synthase contributes to triacylglycerol synthesis in the respective mutants. Taken together, evidence is provided that Yarrowia lipolytica contains at least four triacylglycerol synthases, namely Lro1p, Dga1p and two additional triacylglycerol synthases whereof one is acyl-CoA dependent and specifically induced upon growth on oleic acid.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aYarrowia lipolytica 3aacyl coenzyme A 3aacylation 3aadipocytes 3acarbon 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3aglucose 3aheterologous gene expression 3ain vitro studies 3amutants 3aoleic acid 3aphospholipids 3atriacylglycerols 3ayeasts0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2011 Oct., v. 1811, no. 10 p.587-596dElsevier B.V.x1388-19817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2011.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03125naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245007600168300001800244500000900262520173800271592002802009650001602037650001302053650002302066650001102089650000902100650001102109650001902120650001602139650001902155650002302174650002202197650004302219650004002262650002902302650002002331650001302351650001202364650002202376650002302398651000902421773013602430856008002566852000902646655001202655IND60663382520221118064350.0191122e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066338252DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2013.03102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHatfield, Jerry L.10aRadiation Use Efficiency: Evaluation of Cropping and Management Systems  ap. 1820-1827.  aepub  aCapture of solar radiation by plant canopies and conversion of this energy into biomass or grain has been described as radiation use efficiency. Radiation use efficiency (RUE) has been developed as a function of biomass accumulation and intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (IPAR) by the canopy and evaluated under conditions not limiting to plant growth. This study was designed to evaluate RUE across a number of corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] experiments in central Iowa with various tillage and management inputs to determine how RUE changed as a function of agronomic management. In these studies, IPAR was derived through the use of a normalized difference vegetation index, which is a surrogate for the photosynthetically active radiation canopy interception term, and total canopy biomass was measured at five times during the growing season from the early vegetative stage through maturity. Grain yields were obtained from each plot with both hand- harvested and combine samples. Values for RUE showed a linear relationship between biomass and IPAR for the entire growing season, with the better fit when the relationship was confined to the vegetative development period. There were differences among years, with management and tillage systems affecting RUE values through the differences in biomass or grain yield. Grain yield relationships to IPAR showed more variation than total biomass, with yearly differences evident in the amount of IPAR during the grain-filling period suggesting that the length of the grain-filling period is a dominant factor in grain yield. Application of RUE to field-scale observations will provide a method of assessing where crop productivity is limited.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aZea mays 3abiomass production 3acanopy 3acorn 3aenergy 3afilling period 3agrain yield 3agrowing season 3amanagement systems 3amanual harvesting 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aradiation use efficiency 3asolar radiation 3asoybeans 3atillage 3avegetative growth 3awater interception 3aIowa0 tAgronomy journal.g2014 Sept., v. 106, no. 5 p.1820-1827dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2013.03103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009400156300002000250520155300270592002801823650001501851650001001866650002301876650003001899650001301929650001401942650001301956650001401969700001901983700001602002700001702018700001602035700001302051700001102064700001502075700001602090773014402106856007402250852000902324655001202333IND60744761620221119111956.0210716e20210714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074476162DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta03099j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Yanan10aNitrogen and boron coordinated single-atom catalysts for low-temperature CO/NO oxidations  ap. 15329-15345.  aIn order to explore the intrinsic properties of single-atom (SA) catalysts, the different kinds of coordinated atoms (typically Bₓ and Ny) within graphene (BₓNy–graphene, x + y = 1–3) can be used to regulate the stability and electronic structure of center metal SAs (BₓNy–graphene-SAs) by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is found that the SA Co anchored at single vacancy graphene (SV-graphene–Co), B₁–graphene–Co and N₁–graphene–Co configurations exhibit higher stability than others. The amount of charge transfer between coordinated BₓNy and nearest-neighbor carbon atoms can effectively modulate the adsorption stabilities, electronic structures and magnetic properties of central Co atom and reactive gases. Compared to the SV-graphene–Co sheet, the formation of BₓNy–graphene sheets can promote the adsorption capabilities for NO and CO; further, the NO and CO oxidation reactions through the Eley–Rideal (ER) and Langmuir–Hinshelwood (LH) mechanisms are comparably investigated. Among these different ratios of coordinated BₓNy atoms, the B₁–graphene–Co, N₁–graphene–Co and B₁N₁–graphene–Co sheets exhibit good stability and show excellent catalytic activity (<0.5 eV). Therefore, theoretical calculations can provide an in-depth understanding of the structure–performance relationship between coordinated B/N atoms and intrinsic activity of SA catalysts (SACs), which is essential for the precise design of graphene-based SACs and their potential applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aboron 3acatalytic activity 3adensity functional theory 3agraphene 3amagnetism 3anitrogen 3aoxidation1 aChen, Weiguang1 aShi, Jinlei1 aWang, Zhiwen1 aCui, Yingqi1 aTeng, Da1 aLi, Yi1 aFeng, Zhen1 aDai, Xianqi0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2021 July 14, v. 9, no. 27 p.15329-15345dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta03099j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03388naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012300164300001400287520207500301592002802376650002502404650001102429650001902440650002602459650000902485650001002494650001502504650001602519650002902535650002102564653003802585653001202623653001702635653003402652653001602686700001602702700001402718700001502732700001502747773009002762856008102852852000902933655001202942IND60544755320221116150058.0160901e20150126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054475532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2014.11.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaufmann, A.10aReliability of veterinary drug residue confirmation: High resolution mass spectrometry versus tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 54-67.  aConfirmation of suspected residues has been a long time domain of tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (QqQ). The currently most widely used confirmation strategy relies on the use of two selected reaction monitoring signals (SRM). The details of this confirmation procedure are described in detail in the Commission Decision 93/256/EC (CD). On the other hand, high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) is nowadays increasingly used for trace analysis. Yet its utility for confirmatory purposes has not been well explored and utilized, since established confirmation strategies like the CD do not yet include rules for modern HRMS technologies.It is the focus of this paper to evaluate the likelihood of false positive and false negative confirmation results, when using a variety of HRMS based measurement modes as compared to conventional QqQ mass spectrometry. The experimental strategy relies on the chromatographic separation of a complex blank sample (bovine liver extract) and the subsequent monitoring of a number of dummy transitions respectively dummy accurate masses. The term “dummy” refers to precursor and derived product ions (based on a realistic neutral loss) whose elemental compositions (CxHyNzOdCle) were produced by a random number generator. Monitoring a large number of such hypothetical SRM’s, or accurate masses inevitably produces a number of mass traces containing chromatographic peaks (false detects) which are caused by eluting matrix compounds. The number and intensity of these peaks were recorded and standardized to permit a comparison among the two employed MS technologies. QqQ performance (compounds which happen to produce a response in two SRM traces at identical retention time) was compared with a number of different HRMS1 and HRMS2 detection based modes. A HRMS confirmation criterion based on two full scans (an unfragmented and an all ion fragmented) was proposed. Compared to the CD criteria, a significantly lower probability of false positive and false negative findings is obtained by utilizing this criterion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3acattle 3achromatography 3aelemental composition 3aions 3aliver 3amonitoring 3aprobability 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aveterinary drugs 0aHigh Resolution mass spectrometry 0aResidue 0aConfirmation 0aCommission Decision 93/256/EC 0aFood safety1 aButcher, P.1 aMaden, K.1 aWalker, S.1 aWidmer, M.0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 Jan. 26, v. 856 p.54-67dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2014.11.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012200157300001800279500002000297520116600317592002801483596007101511596005901582650002601641650001801667650002501685650001701710650002101727650001501748650001901763650001701782650001501799650002801814650002101842650002101863650000701884650001401891650001501905700001801920700001401938700001801952700001801970700001401988700001202002700001702014700005602031773015202087856007402239852000902313655001202322IND60746334220221122122552.0210731e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074633422DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.150412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Qingsong10aCharacterisation of a novel laminarinase from Microbulbifer sp.

The β‐1,3‐glucanase in marine bacteria can be employed as a tool to digest laminarin in the cell wall of brown algae. Here, we cloned, expressed and characterised a β‐1,3‐glucanase (laminarinase), MaLamNA, from the previously characterised marine bacterium Microbulbifer sp. ALW1, phylogenetically distinct from the glycoside hydrolase families of characterised laminarinases. The recombinant laminarinase was heterologously expressed and purified from Pichia pastoris GS115 cells with a molecular mass of 57.3 kDa. MaLamNA exerted its hydrolytic activity specifically against laminarin, with the highest activity at 45 °C and pH 4.5–5.5, respectively, and demonstrated high stability against extreme acidic and alkaline pH exposure. The addition of reducing agent dithiothreitol could significantly enhance the activity of MaLamNA. The hydrolytic products of laminarin by MaLamNA exhibited more effective antioxidant activities than the undigested laminarin. These characteristics of MaLamNA provide clues to its industrial application for laminarin bioresource development.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020J01679cNatural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China  a41976124cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aKomagataella pastoris 3aMicrobulbifer 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aaquatic bacteria 3acell walls 3adithiothreitol 3afood science 3aglycosides 3aindustrial applications 3amolecular weight 3aoligosaccharides 3apH 3aphylogeny 3atechnology1 aYin, Xiaoqian1 aLi, Hebin1 aWang, Xinghua1 aJiang, Zedong1 aLi, Lijun1 aNi, Hui1 aLi, Qingbiao1 aZhu, Yanbing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2771-12350 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2021 Aug., v. 56, no. 8 p.4129-4138dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41365x0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.150413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245016400156520149300320592002801813650001901841650002401860650001201884650000901896650002001905650001901925650001501944650002101959650002401980650001502004700002002019700001902039700002302058700002402081700002102105773012302126856007502249852000902324655001202333IND60792710520221122143447.0220908e20220827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079271052DNAL7 a10.3390/nu141735442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyu, Weida 10aAssociations of Nutrition-Related, Physical, and Social Factors and Their Combinations with Sarcopenia in Community-Dwelling Older Adults: Kashiwa Cohort Study  aBackground: Sarcopenia is a major cause of frailty, which relates to nutrition-related, physical, and social factors. In this study, we aimed to discuss the cross-sectional association of sarcopenia with the above three factors both individually and comprehensively. Methods: Overall, 1257 older adults (≥65 years old) participated in this study. Sarcopenia was determined via the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 criteria. The independent variables for nutrition-related, physical, and social factors and especially their criteria for health condition were defined separately. Binomial logistic regression analysis was carried out to testify the associations of sarcopenia with three factors individually and in combination. Results: The mean age was 74.6 (±5.5), and women were 47.7%. Sarcopenia prevalence was 7.5%. Participants who did not meet the criteria of nutritional health, physical fitness, or social robustness independently had significant associations with a higher adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of sarcopenia or its indices of lower grip strength, muscle mass, or gait speed. In comparison to participants meeting three criteria, those who met two, one, or none showed (marginally) significant association with increased aOR for sarcopenia (aOR (95% confidence interval)): two: 1.97 (0.84–4.64); one: 2.35 (1.00–5.23); none: 5.52 (2.30–13.23). Conclusions: Comprehensive countermeasures with the above three factors are indispensable for sarcopenia prevention.  aPublisher supplied data 3acohort studies 3aconfidence interval 3aelderly 3agait 3amuscle strength 3amuscle tissues 3aodds ratio 3aphysical fitness 3aregression analysis 3asarcopenia1 aTanaka, Tomoki 1 aSon, Bo-Kyung 1 aYoshizawa, Yasuyo 1 aAkishita, Masahiro 1 aIijima, Katsuya 0 tNutrients.g2022 Aug. 27, v. 14, no. 17dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141735443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02100naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014700156300002000303520106600323592002801389650001101417650001101428650001501439650001001454650002401464650001501488650001501503650001101518700001801529773014401547856007401691852000901765655001201774IND60744761720221119112106.0210716e20210714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074476172DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta03164c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Yanlong10aIn situ growth of MOF-derived ultrafine molybdenum carbide nanoparticles supported on Ni foam as efficient hydrogen-evolution electrocatalysts  ap. 15246-15253.  aThe design of a universal synthetic strategy for long-term durable transition metal carbide catalysts with a controllable nanostructure and sufficient active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction is challenging. Herein, the in situ growth of Mo-containing MOFs was achieved on three-dimensional (3D) nickel foam (NF) through the conversion of pre-deposited bimetal hydroxide/oxide nanosheets (Mo and Co). After pyrolysis, ultrafine Mo carbide nanoparticles encapsulated in cobalt and nitrogen-doped carbon layers were obtained. The ultrafine metal carbide nanoparticles favored the exposure of active sites, the in situ growth enhanced the binding between catalysts and substrate, and the cobalt and nitrogen-doped carbon layer facilitated charge transfer. The MoₓC electrode showed a current of 10 mA cm⁻² at an overpotential of 33.5 mV under alkaline conditions, which was 6 mV lower than that of the 20% Pt/C/NF electrode. The WₓC electrode was also prepared. This work highlights a novel universal strategy to synthesize metal carbide electrodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acobalt 3aelectrodes 3afoams 3ahydrogen production 3amolybdenum 3ananosheets 3anickel1 aGong, Jian Ru0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2021 July 14, v. 9, no. 27 p.15246-15253dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta03164c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03833naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245011800163300001400281500001500295520206700310592002802377650001202405650001902417650001702436650001602453650003102469650001802500650001502518650001602533650001602549650001302565650001302578650001102591650001502602650002302617650001102640650000902651650001902660650003602679650002302715650001902738650002302757650002202780650001502802650001702817650002402834651001802858653002902876653001802905653002502923653003002948653002602978700002403004773010403028856007803132852000903210655001203219IND60129138020221123015032.0151124e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012913802DNAL7 a10.3375/043.033.01082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanders, Suzanne14aThe Forests of Isle Royale National Park: Can We Preserve This Pristine Wilderness in the Face of Climate Change?  ap. 66-77.  a2019-12-04  aIsle Royale National Park (IRNP) is an archipelago in west central Lake Superior. In 2010, the National Park Service Great Lakes Inventory and Monitoring Network initiated a long-term monitoring program at IRNP with the goals being to: (1) determine the current forest structure, (2) assess how succession and climate change will impact species assemblages, and (3) develop realistic management targets related to climate change impacts on IRNP forests. Five forest types were identified, with three of these (sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.)/birch, eastern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis L), and balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.)) being climax types with little likelihood of succeeding into any other type over the next two to three decades. Two forest types (white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss),/trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), and paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.)) were in a state of transition. The long-term (> 50 year) successional pathways of all five forest types will be influenced by climate change, species' migration abilities, and disease. Many dominant species currently on the island, including balsam fir, black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) Britton, Sterns & Poggenb.), and white spruce, are expected to become extirpated, while the abundance of other common species, including paper birch and trembling aspen, is expected to decline. The 21 km distance between the mainland and the islands will prohibit timely immigration of new species onto the island in the face of climate change. Immigration will likely be led by avian-dispersed species (Prunus spp., exotic Lonicera spp., and Rhamnus cathartica, another exotic species) with dispersal of other taxa relying on stochastic events or human transport. Managers should consider assisted migration to ensure that species assemblages remain congruent; otherwise, stable ecosystems dominated by a few non-native taxa may result. This is especially relevant on the eastern side of the island where balsam fir forests dominate in shallow, bedrock-derived soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aislands 3aAbies balsamea 3aPicea glauca 3ainventories 3aU.S. National Park Service 3aPicea mariana 3aecosystems 3anew species 3aimmigration 3aLonicera 3amanagers 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3aintroduced species 3aPrunus 3asoil 3aclimate change 3aAcer saccharum subsp. saccharum 3aRhamnus cathartica 3anational parks 3aThuja occidentalis 3aBetula papyrifera 3awilderness 3aforest types 3aPopulus tremuloides 3aLake Superior 0anorthern hardwood forest 0aboreal forest 0along-term monitoring 0aIsle Royale National Park 0aNational Park Service1 aGrochowski, Jessica0 tNatural areas journal.g2013 Jan., v. 33, no. 1 p.66-77dNatural Areas Associationx0885-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3375%2F043.033.01083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03278naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001800171245016000189300001600349520180000365592002802165650002602193650002302219650001002242650001102252650002302263650001402286650001202300650002102312650001102333650005202344650000902396650004502405650002602450653001302476653004002489653001802529653002602547653001402573700001902587773011802606856008702724852000902811655001202820IND60112341520221119075428.0190318e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011234152DNAL7 a231232582pmid7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2012.10.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, Seiji10aBehavioral phase shift in nymphs of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria: Special attention to attraction/avoidance behaviors and the role of serotonin  ap. 101-112.  aSchistocerca gregaria exhibits a phase-specific behavior in response to crowding. Nymphs occurring at low population densities (solitarious phase) tend to avoid one another, whereas those occurring at high population densities (gregarious phase) are attracted to one another. This study examined how this attraction/avoidance behavior changed after isolation or crowding. The behavior of the test nymphs was assessed by determining their positioning with respect to a stimulus cup, which contained 12 gregarious nymphs, placed at one end of an elliptical arena and an empty cup placed at the opposite end. Gregarious (crowd-reared) nymphs were most frequently observed close to the stimulus cup, whereas solitarious (isolated-reared) nymphs tended to avoid it. This tendency was easily changed by exposing the nymphs to isolation or crowding. However, contrary to a previously reported conclusion that behavioral gregarization occurs in 4–8h of crowding, the nymphs required at least 3days to achieve a significant change in the attraction/avoidance behavior in either direction, from solitarious to gregarious or the converse. The discrepancies between the present study and previous studies appear to result from the different behaviors observed. The present study focused on the attraction/avoidance behavior that is most likely the most important element in the gregarization and solitarization processes, whereas other studies used a mixture of various activity-related behaviors. No evidence was obtained for a trans-generational accumulation in the attraction/avoidance behaviors. Serotonin, a biogenic amine that is suggested by others to be involved in behavioral phase changes in S. gregaria, had no influence on this behavior or body color when injected into the solitarious nymphs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchistocerca gregaria 3aavoidance behavior 3acolor 3anymphs 3apopulation density 3aserotonin 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aFemale 2aGrasshoppersxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aMale 2aNymphxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aSerotoninxmetabolism 0aCrowding 0aDensity-dependent phase polyphenism 0aGregarization 0aSchistocerca gregaria 0aSerotonin1 aNishide, Yudai0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2013 Jan., v. 59, no. 1 p.101-112dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45772x0022-19107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2012.10.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02135naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245012900175300001600304520103400320592002801354650000901382650001301391650001901404650001201423651001001435653001501445653002701460653002101487653002401508653002701532700002101559700002001580773011301600856005101713852000901764655001201773IND50088345620221119040624.0140414e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008834562DNAL7 a10.1080/10871209.2011.5637712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiordano, Anthony J.10aAssessing the Credibility of Jaguarundi (Puma yagouaroundi) Observations Using Diagnostic Criteria and Witness Qualification  ap. 360-367.  aDespite its legal protection, the jaguarundi's (Puma yagouaroundi) status in the United States is currently unknown. Historical accounts indicate jaguarundis previously occupied habitats in extreme southern Texas. Although sightings continue to occur in the United States, none have been confirmed, and it is unclear if jaguarundis are still resident. Since the mid-1970s, however, evidence in the form of first-hand observations is suggestive of the presence of jaguarundis in Big Bend National Park. We assessed the credibility of 79 alleged jaguarundi records spanning three decades using a combination of diagnostic criteria and witness credibility. Based on this discriminatory process, we found “strong support” for 40 of these records, and believe a resident, low-density population of jaguarundis may exist in Big Bend. While not as irrefutable as physical evidence, objective reviews of species records may have merit as a tool to help evaluate whether the investment of more rigorous survey techniques is warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPuma 3ahabitats 3anational parks 3asurveys 3aTexas 0ajaguarundi 0aBig Bend National Park 0asighting records 0adiagnostic criteria 0aperipheral populations1 aCarrera, Rogelio1 aBallard, Warren0 tHuman dimensions of wildlife.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 16, no. 5 p.360-367dTaylor & Francis Groupx1533-158X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10871209.2011.563771  aDNAL 7aarticle01852naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002600142245012100168300001400289520066800303592002800971650002100999650002701020650000901047650001101056650001201067650002101079650001001100650001101110650001601121651003101137653001901168653002101187653001901208653001901227700002201246773009901268856007801367852000901445655001201454IND60129138120221123015054.0151124s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012913812DNAL7 a10.3375/043.033.01092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastellano, Steven M.10aWhite-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus) Disperse Seeds of the Invasive Shrub, Amur Honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii)  ap. 78-80.  aWhite-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman) are known to disperse seeds of a hybrid complex of invasive honeysuckle shrubs in northeastern United States. We investigated whether they also disperse seeds of Amur honeysuckle, Lonicera maackii, a problematic invasive shrub in the Midwestern and eastern U.S. We found that deer ingest ripe fruit and void intact seeds of L. maackii. Based on tetrazolium tests, most (68%) of these voided seeds are viable, but the proportion viable was significantly lower than that for seeds taken directly from ripe fruits. White-tailed deer are potentially important in the long-distance dispersal of this invasive shrub.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLonicera maackii 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3adeer 3afruits 3ahybrids 3ainvasive species 3aseeds 3ashrubs 3atetrazolium 3aNortheastern United States 0ainvasive plant 0aLonicera maackii 0aseed dispersal 0aseed viability1 aGorchov, David L.0 tNatural areas journal.g2013, v. 33, no. 1 p.78-80dNatural Areas Associationx0885-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3375%2F043.033.01093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245016100166300001600327520162700343592002801970650001601998650001002014650002502024650002002049650002502069650002102094650001802115650001002133650001402143650001202157650001002169650001402179651001002193700001902203700002102222700001802243700002102261700001602282700002102298700002702319700002102346700002202367700002302389700002402412700002002436700001602456700002002472700001802492773012902510856008202639852000902721655001202730IND60549229120221118161018.0160907e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054922912DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-06-14-0581-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKusumoto, Dai10aComparison of Sapwood Discoloration in Fagaceae Trees After Inoculation with Isolates of Raffaelea quercivora, Cause of Mass Mortality of Japanese Oak Trees  ap. 225-230.  aThe mass mortality of oak trees has been prevalent in Japan since the late 1980s. The fungus Raffaelea quercivora is transmitted by an ambrosia beetle, Platypus quercivorus, which causes mortality. The beetle is able to bore galleries into the sapwood of most Fagaceae trees in Japan; however, the level of mortality caused by R. quercivora and P. quercivorus differs greatly among tree species. Previous studies by our research group have demonstrated that the virulence of R. quercivora differs among isolates when inoculated into Quercus serrata logs. However, interactions between the virulence of R. quercivora isolates and the susceptibility of other fagaceous species have yet to be elucidated. In this study, we inoculated the fresh logs of 11 fagaceous species with isolates of low and high virulence, and measured the tangential widths of discolored sapwoods 3 weeks after inoculation. Although the discoloration widths of Q. crispula sapwood were similar among all isolates, those of Q. serrata and Q. acutissima tended to increase with the more virulent isolates. Sapwood discoloration in Q. glauca, Q. acuta, Q. salicina, Lethocarpus edulis, and Castanopsis sieboldii was greatly increased by highly virulent isolates. Discoloration in Fagus japonica was not influenced by any of the isolates. The logs of Q. crispula and Q. serrata but not Q. glauca were significantly more discolored by a low-virulence isolate compared with standing trees. The various virulent isolates induced unique sapwood discoloration characteristics in each species, which may explain species-specific differences in mortality rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastanopsis 3aFagus 3aPlatypus quercivorus 3aQuercus serrata 3aRaffaelea quercivora 3aambrosia beetles 3adiscoloration 3afungi 3amortality 3asapwood 3atrees 3avirulence 3aJapan1 aMasuya, Hayato1 aHirao, Toshihide1 aGoto, Hideaki1 aHamaguchi, Keiko1 aChou, Wen-I1 aWiwat Suasa-ard,1 aBuranapanichpan, Sawai1 aUraichuen, Sopon1 aKern-asa, Oraphan1 aSanguansub, Sunisa1 aPanmongkol, Aumporn1 aPham, Quang Thu1 aKahono, Sih1 aSudiana, I Made1 aKamata, Naoto0 tPlant disease.g2015 Feb., v. 99, no. 2 p.225-230dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-06-14-0581-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03721naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011100158520211100269592002802380650001202408650001702420650001002437650003102447650001402478650001502492650002002507650001402527650001802541650001402559650001802573650001002591650001602601650001502617650001102632650001702643650001802660650001402678650002402692650001302716700001702729700002302746700002502769700002402794700001802818700002102836700002002857700002402877700002402901700002302925773012302948856007503071852000903146655001203155IND60792710720221122093014.0220908e20220828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079271072DNAL7 a10.3390/nu141735472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Chengyin 10aProgressive Metabolic Abnormalities Associated with the Development of Neonatal Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia  aObjective: To assess the longitudinal metabolic patterns during the evolution of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) development. Methods: A case-control dataset of preterm infants (<32-week gestation) was obtained from a multicenter database, including 355 BPD cases and 395 controls. A total of 72 amino acid (AA) and acylcarnitine (AC) variables, along with infants’ calorie intake and growth outcomes, were measured on day of life 1, 7, 28, and 42. Logistic regression, clustering methods, and random forest statistical modeling were utilized to identify metabolic variables significantly associated with BPD development and to investigate their longitudinal patterns that are associated with BPD development. Results: A panel of 27 metabolic variables were observed to be longitudinally associated with BPD development. The involved metabolites increased from 1 predominant different AC by day 7 to 19 associated AA and AC compounds by day 28 and 16 metabolic features by day 42. Citrulline, alanine, glutamate, tyrosine, propionylcarnitine, free carnitine, acetylcarnitine, hydroxybutyrylcarnitine, and most median-chain ACs (C₅:C₁₀) were the most associated metabolites down-regulated in BPD babies over the early days of life, whereas phenylalanine, methionine, and hydroxypalmitoylcarnitine were observed to be up-regulated in BPD babies. Most calorie intake and growth outcomes revealed similar longitudinal patterns between BPD cases and controls over the first 6 weeks of life, after gestational adjustment. When combining with birth weight, the derived metabolic-based discriminative model observed some differences between those with and without BPD development, with c-statistics of 0.869 and 0.841 at day 7 and 28 of life on the test data. Conclusions: The metabolic panel we describe identified some metabolic differences in the blood associated with BPD pathogenesis. Further work is needed to determine whether these compounds could facilitate the monitoring and/or investigation of early-life metabolic status in the lung and other tissues for the prevention and management of BPD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine 3abirth weight 3ablood 3abronchopulmonary dysplasia 3acarnitine 3acitrulline 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aenergy intake 3aevolution 3aglutamic acid 3alungs 3ametabolites 3amethionine 3amodels 3apathogenesis 3aphenylalanine 3apregnancy 3aregression analysis 3atyrosine1 aWu, Jinghua 1 aReiss, Jonathan D.1 aSinclair, Tiffany J.1 aStevenson, David K.1 aShaw, Gary M.1 aChace, Donald H.1 aClark, Reese H.1 aPrince, Lawrence S.1 aLing, Xuefeng Bruce1 aSylvester, Karl G.0 tNutrients.g2022 Aug. 28, v. 14, no. 17dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141735473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02421naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245010400166300001600270520097800286592002801264650002201292650002001314650002801334650001801362650002501380650001001405650002201415650001401437650003001451650003001481650004501511650000901556653001301565653000901578653002201587653002701609653002301636700001601659700001501675700001501690700001401705700001701719773010901736856008501845852000901930655001201939IND60515402020221122113220.0160315e20160503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051540202DNAL7 a10.1080/09540105.2015.10869782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Kunhua10aIdentification of tuna species (Thunnini tribe) by PCR-RFLP analysis of mitochondrial DNA fragments  ap. 301-313.  aTunas are highly priced and the Atlantic bluefin tuna is most endangered trade fish in the world. For effective fishery management and protection of consumers’ rights, it is important to develop a molecular method to identify the species of tuna products. In this study, the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique was developed to identify 10 tuna or tuna-like species. Primers were designed to amplify six mitochondrial DNA fragments from each specimen, and three restriction enzymes including Afa I, Dde I, and Alu I were used to analyze the short length fragments produced from ATPase and control region (CR) genes. Besides these, the phylogenetic relationships among tested fish species were analyzed based on phylogenetic trees constructed using the amplified COI and CR sequences. The results indicated that the developed PCR-RFLP really provided a useful and academic technique to identify high-priced tuna species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aThunnus thynnus 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3afish industry 3afisheries management 3agenes 3amitochondrial DNA 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction endonucleases 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3atuna 0aPCR-RFLP 0atuna 0amitochondrial DNA 0aspecies identification 0aphylogenetic study1 aFeng, Junli1 aMa, Xuting1 aWang, Xiao1 aZhou, Dan1 aDai, Zhiyuan0 tFood and agricultural immunology.g2016 May 3, v. 27, no. 3 p.301-313dTaylor & Francisx1465-34437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09540105.2015.10869783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02336naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245012500168500002900293520097400322592002801296650002201324650001401346650002201360650000801382650001601390650001101406650001001417653002401427653005201451653001601503653001801519653002301537653004101560700001901601700001501620700001901635700002001654700002001674773011101694856008801805852000901893655001201902IND60698593420221121002152.0201202e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069859342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.1103582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHori, Miki12aA novel identification method using perceptual degree of concordance of occlusal surfaces calculated by a Python program  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aOne of the important issues during the response to a mass disaster is the identification of victims. In this study, we verified the use of the occlusal morphology of molars for individual identification. The aim of this study was to establish a simple new method for identifying individuals from molar data. Using Python, we developed programming that included the perceptual Hash (pHash) function and the Hamming distance (HD) between antemortem data (AMD) and postmortem data (PMD). The AMD comprised 2,215 dental models. The PMD were selected from the AMD set and comprised 17 models from the same individual with changes over time. As a result, 16 PMD models (over 90%) were ranked in the top 5%. Although identification using only a single molar is difficult, there is the possibility of narrowing down victims’ identity with high accuracy through verification using multiple teeth. This system is expected to be useful as a very simple method of identification.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3adisasters 3aforensic sciences 3aham 3amethodology 3amodels 3ateeth 0aOcclusal morphology 0aConcordance detection of morphological features 0aProgramming 0aHash function 0aForensic dentistry 0aDisaster victim identification (DVI)1 aHori, Tadasuke1 aOhno, Yuzo1 aTsuruta, Shozo1 aIwase, Haruhiko1 aKawai, Tatsushi0 tForensic science international.g2020 Aug., v. 313 p.110358-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.1103583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245012000161300001400281520116100295592002801456650001901484650001501503650002501518650001101543650002001554650001401574650001101588650001401599650001501613650002001628650001701648650002501665650001001690650001701700653002301717653001401740653002601754653002201780700001501802700001501817700001301832700001801845700001801863700002001881700002201901773009001923856008102013852000902094655001202103IND60544755620221116150017.0160901e20150126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054475562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2014.11.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBian, Wei10aDoped zinc sulfide quantum dots based phosphorescence turn-off/on probe for detecting histidine in biological fluid  ap. 82-89.  aWe report a turn-on phosphorescence probe for detection of histidine based on Co2+-adsorbed N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) capped Mn: ZnS quantum dots (QDs) which is directly synthesized by the hydrothermal method. The phosphorescence of NAC-Mn: ZnS QDs is effectively quenched by Co2+ attributing to the adsorption of Co2+ onto the surface of QDs with a concomitant in suppressing the recombination process of hole and electron of QDs. The phosphorescence of Co2+-adsorbed NAC-Mn: ZnS QDs can be recovered by binding of Co2+ with histidine. The quenching and regeneration of the phosphorescence of NAC-Mn: ZnS QDs have been studied in detail. The as-prepared QDs-based probe is applied to determine histidine with a linear range of 1.25–30μM and a detection limit of 0.74μM. The relative standard deviation for eleven repeat detections of 20μM histidine is 0.65%. Co2+-adsorbed NAC-Mn: ZnS QDs show high sensitivity and good selectivity to histidine over other amino acids, metal ions and co-existing substances.

Recent pipeline techniques have used minimum disturbance and revegetation via natural recovery. The goal of this research was to evaluate natural recovery in rough fescue (Festuca hallii (Vasey) Piper) grassland in central Alberta, Canada. Plant species cover was evaluated, comparing pipeline right-of-way disturbances to undisturbed controls. Pipeline construction methods were assessed to determine which would be most successful in returning native grassland species. Pipelines with the most intense disturbances were dominated by wheatgrasses, with abundant bare ground and sparse moss and lichen cover; whereas those with the least intense disturbances had cover similar to native grassland. Results confirmed the importance of minimum disturbance in grasslands. Retaining grassland sod through plow-in pipeline construction and keeping disturbance as narrow as possible is critical to successful recovery. Rough fescue appears to recover better with plow-in pipeline construction than with seeding, most likely from intact sod. Therefore, narrow trenching with plow-in techniques is recommended for grasslands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFestuca hallii 3agrasslands 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3aland restoration 3alichens 3amosses and liverworts 3apipelines 3asowing 3atopsoil 3atrenching 3aAlberta 0aFestuca hallii 0agrasslands 0aminimum disturbance 0anatural recovery 0apipeline construction 0arough fescue1 aNaeth, M.

To facilitate research on these lipid mediators, we have developed a targeted high-throughput mass spectrometric based methodology to monitor and quantitate both eicosanoids and NAEs, and can be analyzed separately or together in series. Each methodology utilizes scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (sMRM) pairs in conjunction with a 25min reverse-phase HPLC separation. The eicosanoid methodology monitors 141 unique metabolites and quantitative amounts can be determined for over 100 of these metabolites against standards. The analysis covers eicosanoids generated from cycloxygenase, lipoxygenase, cytochrome P450 enzymes, and those generated from non-enzymatic pathways. The NAE analysis monitors 36 metabolites and quantitative amounts can be determined for 33 of these metabolites against standards. The NAE method contains metabolites derived from saturated fatty acids, unsaturated fatty acids, and eicosanoids. The lower limit of detection for eicosanoids ranges from 0.1pg to 1pg, while NAEs ranges from 0.1pg to 1000pg. The rationale and design of the methodology is discussed.

BODIPY-ATP can interact with Tween 20-AuNPs through the coordination between the adenine group of BODIPY-ATP and Au atoms on the NP surface, thereby causing the fluorescence quenching of BODIPY-ATP through the nanometal surface energy transfer (NSET) effect. When adenosine attaches to the NP surface, the attached adenosine exhibits additional electrostatic attraction to BODIPY-ATP. As a result, the presence of adenosine enhances the efficiency of AuNPs in fluorescence quenching of BODIPY-ATP. The AuNP-induced fluorescence quenching of BODIPY-ATP progressively increased with an increase in the concentration of adenosine; the detection limit at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 for adenosine was determined to be 60nM. The selectivity of the proposed system was more than 1000-fold for adenosine over any adenosine analogs and other nucleotides. The proposed system combined with a phenylboronic acid-containing column was successfully applied to the determination of adenosine in urine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenine 3aadenosine 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aanalytical chemistry 3aboron 3adetection limit 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3agold 3ananogold 3aurine 0aAdenosine 0aFluorescence 0aSensor 0aNanoparticles1 aShih, Ya-Chen1 aTseng, Wei-Lung0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 857 p.64-70dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2014.11.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002600148245008500174300001600259520126700275592002801542650000901570650001701579650001001596650002401606650002501630650001301655650001801668650001201686650001601698650002501714650001501739700002701754773009001781856008401871852000901955655001201964IND4472889020221120053401.0150808e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447288902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2012.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGriffiths, Richard A.10aTrends in conservation biology: Progress or procrastination in a new millennium?  ap. 153-158.  aSince the 1990s the number of papers published by four mainstream conservation journals (Conservation Biology, Biological Conservation, Biodiversity and Conservation and Oryx) has increased by 133%. The main subject areas of research have not changed over time, with population biology, habitat change, community ecology and species conservation remaining the most popular topics. Equally, mammals, birds, invertebrates and plants have remained the most popular taxa, and – surprisingly – the number of papers dealing with general or global issues or using molecular approaches has remained low. Although collaboration increased over time, most conservation biology is still conducted by researchers working in developed countries. Most research published from developing countries in the 1990s did not have a local researcher as co-author. This trend has now been reversed, although there is only marginal evidence of an increase in collaboration between authors from developed and developing countries. Although conservation science has undergone dramatic technological changes as we have moved into the new millennium, published research remains rooted within the cultural traditions of developed countries, with a continuing emphasis on charismatic taxa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryx 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3adeveloped countries 3adeveloping countries 3ahabitats 3ainvertebrates 3amammals 3aresearchers 3atechnological change 3atraditions1 aDos Santos, Marcileida0 tBiological conservation.g2012 Sept., v. 153 p.153-158dElsevier Ltdx0006-32077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2012.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04098naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245007900167300001800246520211500264592002802379596008602407596008902493596008902582596007302671596007302744650001902817650001702836650001202853650002602865650001202891650001902903650001502922650002102937650001202958650001202970650001602982650001902998650001403017650001803031650001503049650001903064650001403083650002103097650001803118650002303136700002603159700002003185700003303205700006603238773013703304856008203441852000903523655001203532IND60637227920221119103214.0190416e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063722792DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-019-02259-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaoune, Hafida10aBioremediation of petroleum-contaminated soils using Streptomyces sp. Hlh1  ap. 2222-2230.  aPURPOSE: Bioremediation using microorganisms is a promising strategy to remediate soil with petroleum hydrocarbons. Streptomyces sp. Hlh1, an endophytic strain, has previously demonstrated the ability to degrade crude petroleum in liquid culture. To apply this strain at field scale, it is necessary to test its ability to colonize the soil, compete with native microbiota, and remove the petroleum hydrocarbons under unfavorable conditions. Herein, a study was conducted to evaluate the performance of Streptomyces sp. Hlh1 to remove crude petroleum from contaminated sterilized and non-sterilized soils. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Soils samples, contaminated with 2%, 5%, and 10% of petroleum, were inoculated with Streptomyces sp. Hlh1, and incubated at 30 °C for 4 weeks. At the end of bioremediation assays, the pollutant concentrations were determined by Gas chromatography flame ionization detector and the degradation rates were also calculated. The survival of the strain in the soil was estimated and the toxicity of metabolites was evaluated on Lactuca sativa. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Streptomyces sp. Hlh1 was able to grow and remove total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), n-alkanes, and aromatic hydrocarbons found in soil samples. In sterilized soil samples, Streptomyces sp. Hlh1 removed up to 40% of TPH at an initial concentration of 10%. Whereas, the maximum TPH removal reached was 55% in non-sterilized soil at an initial concentration of 2%. In addition, it was observed that the degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons was more active than n-alkanes. The strain grew well and produced high biomass in contaminated soil. Lettuce seedling was found to be the adequate bioindicator to assess the toxicity of petroleum end products. Streptomyces sp. Hlh1 performed a successful bioremediation, which was confirmed through the phytotoxicity test. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows the first insight of the contribution of free endophytic actinobacterial strain in the bioremediation of petroleum-contaminated soil; therefore, it suggests that Streptomyces sp. Hl1 can be usefully exploited at field scale.  aPublisher supplied data  aPU-E 22920160100012COcConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient?ficas y T?cnicas  aD504cSecretar?a de Ciencia, Arte y Tecnolog?a, Universidad Nacional de Tucuman (AR)  aD626cSecretar?a de Ciencia, Arte y Tecnolog?a, Universidad Nacional de Tucuman (AR)  aPICT 2013 0141cFondo para la Investigaci?n Cient?fica y Tecnol?gica  aPICT 2016 0493cFondo para la Investigaci?n Cient?fica y Tecnol?gica 3aLactuca sativa 3aStreptomyces 3aalkanes 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3abiomass 3abioremediation 3aendophytes 3aflame ionization 3alettuce 3aliquids 3ametabolites 3amicroorganisms 3apetroleum 3aphytotoxicity 3apollutants 3apolluted soils 3aseedlings 3asoil remediation 3asoil sampling 3asoil sterilization1 aAparicio, Juan Daniel1 aPucci, Graciela1 aOuld El Hadj-Khelil, Aminata1 aPolti, Marta Alejandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0184-01510 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2019 May, v. 19, no. 5 p.2222-2230dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949862x1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-019-02259-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010900171520134000280592002801620650001301648650001201661650001801673650001401691650001701705650002001722650003801742650001101780650001101791650001501802650002401817650001901841651001001860700002201870700001801892700002401910700002201934700002001956700002401976773012302000856008202123852000902205655001202214IND60791072320221123033332.0220826e20220810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079107232DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110809012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrara, Gianmarco 10aSerological Evidence of Q Fever among Dairy Cattle and Buffalo Populations in the Campania Region, Italy  aDue to its economic impact on livestock and its zoonotic effect, Q fever is a public and animal health problem. Information on this infection in Italy is presently supported by reports of reproductive problems in livestock farms and is, therefore, insufficient to properly understand the impact of the disease. This study aimed to describe for the first time the seroprevalence of Q fever in dairy cows and water buffalos in the Campania region (Southern Italy). A total of 424 dairy cattle and 214 water buffalo were tested using a commercial indirect ELISA kit. An overall seroprevalence of 11.7% confirmed the wide distribution of C. burnetii in this region. Several factors were positively associated with higher seroprevalence, such as species (higher in cattle than in water buffalo), age, and coexistence with other ruminant species. The final model of logistic regression included only age (older) and species (cattle), which were positively associated with the presence of Q fever antibodies. Our findings support the widespread presence of Coxiella burnettii in Campania and show a seroprevalence similar to that observed in previous studies in other Italian regions and European countries. Since human cases are typically linked to contact with infected ruminants, there is a need to improve surveillance for this infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoxiella 3aQ fever 3aanimal health 3abuffaloes 3adairy cattle 3aeconomic impact 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahumans 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aregression analysis 3aseroprevalence 3aItaly1 aColitti, Barbara 1 aPagnini, Ugo 1 aD’Angelo, Danila 1 aIovane, Giuseppe 1 aRosati, Sergio 1 aMontagnaro, Serena 0 tPathogens.g2022 Aug. 10, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110809013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011000168300001600278520087500294536034901169592002801518596001201546650001301558650004401571650002201615650001501637650002501652650001201677650001601689650001101705650002801716650001801744650003301762650002201795650002101817650001101838650001801849651001301867653001801880653002201898653002601920653002101946653001501967653001201982700001801994700001502012700001702027700001502044773012802059856008602187852000902273655001202282IND60566915020221118012154.0220311e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056691502DNAL7 a10.1080/09670262.2016.12484982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJumaidin, R.10aCharacteristics of Eucheuma cottonii waste from East Malaysia: physical, thermal and chemical composition  ap. 200-207.  aThe aim of this paper was to examine the characteristics of Eucheuma cottonii waste in order to analyse its potential as renewable material. The morphology of Eucheuma cottonii (raw and wastes) was investigated through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the thermal behaviour through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and the physical properties through FT-IR, XRD, gas pycnometer, particle size analyser, water absorption and moisture content analysis. The chemical compositions were determined by using acid detergent fibre (ADF), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent lignin (ADL) analysis. It was found that Eucheuma cottonii wastes have better thermal stability, higher crude fibre content, lower moisture content and similar density to the raw Eucheuma cottonii, which suggests that these biomass wastes have good potential as renewable filler material.  aThe authors would like to thank Universiti Putra Malaysia for the financial support provided through University Putra Malaysia Grant scheme (project code GP-IPS/2015/9457200) as well as Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka and the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for providing the scholarship award to the principal author in this project.  aPublisher supplied data  a9457200 3aEucheuma 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3aacid detergent fiber 3abiomass 3acrude fiber 3alignin 3aneutral detergent fiber 3aparticle size 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3awastes 3awater content 3aMalaysia 0aBiomass waste 0aEucheuma cottonii 0aKappaphycus alvarezii 0amarine red algae 0aRhodophyta 0aseaweed1 aSapuan, S.

In this study, the objective was to describe the ultrastructure of components of sperm pathways, especially the epididymis and vas deferens, during sexual development of agoutis kept in captivity. Segments of the vas deferens and epididymis of 8 agouti males at different stages of sexual development (prepubescent, prepubertal, pubescent, and adult) were fixed in glutaraldehyde. The following laboratory procedures were performed: histology following the standard protocol for semithin cut (toluidine blue), and transmission electron microscopy. This was a pioneer study in which it was observed that the epididymis of agoutis is composed of principal, basal, halogen, apical, and clean cells. During prepubescent and prepubertal stages, clean cells were observed in addition to principal, basal, and halogen cells. Once puberty was reached, apical cells were also present, and clean cells were no longer visible. This epithelial change during sexual development is possibly due to physiological functions. The interaction between these cells supports this, and age probably influenced the change. With regard to the vas deferens, this study was also a pioneer to note that before pubescence there were two muscle layers, differing from older animals, which had three muscle layers. This may be due to lack of sperm transit in younger animals. We concluded that the pseudostratified stereociliated epithelium of the epididymis and vas deferens of agoutis kept in captivity undergo morphological and functional changes during sexual development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDasyprocta 3aadults 3acaptive animals 3aepididymis 3aepithelium 3aglutaraldehyde 3ahistology 3amales 3amuscles 3aprotein sources 3apuberty 3arodents 3aspermatozoa 3atoluidine blue 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrastructure 0aUltrastructure 0aSperm 0aDasyprocta 0aPubescent 0aSexual development1 aOliveira, M.F.1 aSantos, P.R.S.1 aAssis Neto, A.C.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2014 Oct., v. 149, no. 3-4 p.273-280dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2014.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03573naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245012800167300001500295500001400310520189100324592002802215650001602243650001802259650002702277650001702304650001402321650001902335650001902354650002602373650001502399650002602414650002902440650001702469650001302486650001202499650001502511650001702526650001102543650001302554650001302567650001402580650001502594650002002609650001002629650001702639653001202656653001602668653001502684700001702699700002502716700002202741700002502763773009402788856008002882852000902962655001202971IND60698690320221120085513.0210303e20130423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069869032DNAL7 a10.3897/mycokeys.6.48142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMáguas, Cristina10aCarbon-Water-Nitrogen relationships between lichens and the atmosphere: Tools to understand metabolism and ecosystem change  ap. 95-106.  aNAL-light  aDue to the close linking between the biosphere and atmosphere, there are clear impacts of changes in climate, atmospheric deposition of nutrients/pollutants and land use (Global Changes) on the terrestrial biosphere. Lichens, with a direct dependence on atmospheric conditions, are much more affected by their immediate microclimate than by the ecosystem’s prevailing macroclimate. In contrast to higher plants, poikilohydric organisms have different mechanisms of water and CO₂ exchange. The application of stable isotopes to the understanding of the mechanisms that are fundamental to lichen gas exchange and water uptake is a promising tool for the evaluation of lichen response to environmental changes. Indeed, lichens have been shown to be influenced by a large number of natural and anthropogenic environmental factors, serving as ecological indicators. Thus, we may use these organisms to model the impact of key global change drivers, such as nitrogen deposition and biodiversity changes, at local scale. Particularly useful is the application of the Lichen Diversity Value (LDV) in order to evaluate the impact of global drivers. Moreover, it has been shown that these indices, associated with main photobiont types, green-algae (LDVch) or cyanobacteria (LDVcyh), and/or nitrophilous versus oligotrophic species, were good candidates as ecological indicators. Besides mapping with high spatial resolution the effects of climate alterations, lichen functional groups could also be used as an early-warning system in order to detect the first effects of climate change in ecosystems before sudden shifts occur on other components that may be less sensitive. Clearly, lichens possess the adequate traits to be used as powerful indicators of complex interactions between atmosphere and biosphere, and thus can generate potentially interesting models for global change drivers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorophyta 3aCyanobacteria 3aatmospheric deposition 3abiodiversity 3abiosphere 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aearly warning systems 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental indicators 3agas exchange 3aland use 3alichens 3ametabolism 3amicroclimate 3amodels 3amoieties 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3apollutants 3astable isotopes 3awater 3awater uptake 0aEcology 0aPhotobionts 0aPhysiology1 aPinho, Pedro1 aBranquinho, Cristina1 aBritta Hartard, 1 a Michael Lakatos, 0 tMycoKeys.g2013 Apr. 23, v. 6 p.95-106dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2143x1314-40497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/mycokeys.6.48143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245017100168300001300339500001400352520135700366592002801723650001801751650001701769650002301786650001401809650001001823650002101833650000901854650001601863650002501879650001401904650001901918653001901937653000801956653001601964653003001980653002002010653002902030653001402059700003302073700002702106700002202133700002402155700002502179700002402204773009002228856008002318852000902398655001202407IND60698690420221120175804.0210303e20130509xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069869042DNAL7 a10.3897/mycokeys.7.45082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeavitt, Steven D.10aDNA barcode identification of lichen-forming fungal species in the Rhizoplaca melanophthalma species-complex (Lecanorales, Lecanoraceae), including five new species  ap. 1-22.  aNAL-light  aRecent studies using sequence data from multiple loci and coalescent-based species delimitation have revealed several species-level lineages within the phenotypically circumscribed taxon Rhizoplaca melanophthalma sensu lato. Here, we formally describe five new species within this group, Rhizoplaca occulta, Rhizoplaca parilis, Rhizoplaca polymorpha, Rhizoplaca porterii, and Rhizoplaca shushanii, using support from the coalescent-based species delimitation method implemented in the program Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography (BPP) as the diagnostic feature distinguishing new species. We provide a reference DNA sequence database using the ITS marker as a DNA barcode for identifying species within this complex. We also assessed intraspecific genetic distances within the six Rhizoplaca melanophthalma sensu lato species. While intraspecific genetic distances within the five new species were less than or equal to the lowest interspecific pairwise comparison values, an overlap in genetic distances within the Rhizoplaca melanophthalma sensu stricto clade suggests the potential for additional phenotypically cryptic lineages within this broadly distributed lineage. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential for accurately identifying species within the Rhizoplaca melanophthalma group by using molecular-based identification methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA barcoding 3aLecanoraceae 3acryptic speciation 3adatabases 3afungi 3agenetic distance 3aloci 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 0aBio-monitoring 0aBPP 0acoalescence 0acosmopolitan distribution 0acryptic species 0amolecular identification 0asymbiosis1 aFernández-Mendoza, Fernando1 aPérez-Ortega, Sergio,1 aSohrabi, Mohammad1 aDivakar, Pradeep K.1 aLumbsch, H.

Due to the paucity of research on knowledge about monkeypox in Saudi Arabia, this study aimed to evaluate the general population’s knowledge of monkeypox in a sample of the country. A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted from 25 May 2022 to 15 July 2022. Participants’ knowledge about monkeypox on a 23-item scale and socio-demographic characteristics were gathered in the survey. Pearson’s Chi-square test was used to compare knowledge level (categorized into high and low) and explanatory variables. Out of 480, only 48% of the respondents had high knowledge (mean score > 14). Participants’ age, marital status, residential region, living in the urban area, education level, employment status, being a healthcare worker, income, and smoking status were significantly associated with the level of knowledge about monkeypox (p < 0.01). Overall, social media (75.0%) was the most frequently reported source from where participants obtained monkeypox-related information followed by TV and radio (45.6%), family or friend (15.6%), and healthcare provider (13.8%). We found that overall knowledge of monkeypox infection was slightly poor among the Saudi population. These findings highlight the urgent need for public education on monkeypox to promote awareness and engage the public ahead of the outbreak.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3achi-square distribution 3across-sectional studies 3aeducational status 3aemployment 3ahealth care workers 3ahumans 3aincome 3amarital status 3aradio 3asurveys 3aurban areas 3aSaudi Arabia1 aAlzahrani, Faris 1 aAlarifi, Abdullah M.1 aAlgethami, Mohammed R.1 aAlhumam, Maathir Naser1 aAyied, Hatim Abdullah Mohammed1 aAwan, Ahmed Zuhier1 aAlmutairi, Abdullah Faisal1 aBamakhrama, Saeed Abdullah1 aAlmushari, Budur Saad1 aSah, Ranjit 0 tPathogens.g2022 Aug. 11, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110809043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01840naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245005700158300001600215520096400231592002801195653002501223653001801248653002501266653001601291700001801307700001501325773012501340856007601465852000901541655001201550IND60681605720221119183731.0200226e20151015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068160572DNAL7 a10.3920/BM2014.01672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGungor, O.E.10aProbiotics: can they be used to improve oral health?  ap. 647-656.  aThe role of probiotic bacteria in improving human health has been an attractive subject for researchers since the beginning of the 20ᵗʰ century. They have been used to control gastro-intestinal infections, to promote immunity and to prevent various diseases (allergies, urogenital infections, etc.). However, the use of beneficial bacteria in the field of dentistry has only recently gained interest. Investigation of the effects of probiotic bacteria on oral health has become an important research subject. These studies are still in the early stages, however results show that probiotic bacteria are effective against tooth caries, periodontal disease, oral mucosal lesions and oral malodour. This review provides information on the effects of probiotics – well-known for their effects on general health, and therefore more widely used in healthcare – on oral and dental health, in order to promote their use/prescription by physicians and patients.  aPublisher supplied data 0alactic acid bacteria 0aLactobacillus 0aStreptococcus mutans 0aoral cavity1 aKirzioglu, Z.1 aKivanc, M.0 tBeneficial microbes.g2015 Oct. 15, v. 6, no. 5 p.647-656dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:6303x1876-28917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/BM2014.01673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245007600159300001800235520125200253592002801505650001701533650001201550650001501562650002201577650001701599650002301616650001001639650001801649650001201667650001101679650001801690650001401708700001601722700001801738700002001756700002401776700002401800700002801824700002601852700002301878773010401901856007502005852000902080655001202089IND60531636220221119053740.0160724e20140916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053163622DNAL7 a10.1021/bi50047342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunlap, Tori B.10aStoichiometry of the Calcineurin Regulatory Domain–Calmodulin Complex  ap. 5779-5790.  aCalcineurin is an essential serine/threonine phosphatase that plays vital roles in neuronal development and function, heart growth, and immune system activation. Calcineurin is unique in that it is the only phosphatase known to be activated by calmodulin in response to increasing intracellular calcium concentrations. Calcium-loaded calmodulin binds to the regulatory domain of calcineurin, resulting in a conformational change that removes an autoinhibitory domain from the active site of the phosphatase. We have determined a 1.95 Å crystal structure of calmodulin bound to a peptide corresponding to its binding region from calcineurin. In contrast to previous structures of this complex, our structure has a stoichiometry of 1:1 and has the canonical collapsed, wraparound conformation observed for many calmodulin–substrate complexes. In addition, we have used size-exclusion chromatography and time-resolved fluorescence to probe the stoichiometry of binding of calmodulin to a construct corresponding to almost the entire regulatory domain from calcineurin, again finding a 1:1 complex. Taken in sum, our data strongly suggest that a single calmodulin protein is necessary and sufficient to bind to and activate each calcineurin enzyme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acalcium 3acalmodulin 3acrystal structure 3afluorescence 3agel chromatography 3aheart 3aimmune system 3aneurons 3aserine 3astoichiometry 3athreonine1 aGuo, Hou-Fu1 aCook, Erik C.1 aHolbrook, Emily1 aRumi-Masante, Julie1 aLester, Terrence E.1 aColbert, Christopher L.1 aVander

Additionally, we compared the effects of microorganisms alone versus microorganisms plus invertebrates on the decomposition process. The experiment was performed using two mesh litter bags (45 µm for microbial activity only and 2 mm for microbial and invertebrate activity) during two distinct periods: the dry season, September to November of 2003, and the rainy season, January to February of 2004 in the Campelo Lake (Northern of Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil). The KTₛ, calculated using a single exponential model, were higher in the 45 µm mesh bags in the dry season and in the 2 mm mesh in the rainy season (dry KT: 45 µm=0.0384, 2 mm=0.0355; rainy KT: 45 µm=0.0483, 2 mm=0.0666), when higher temperatures (rainy season ~30°C; dry season ~25°C) were observed. The half-life of the E. densa detritus ranged from 14 to 27 days. The action of microorganisms was the main process causing the decomposition of E. densa in the Campelo Lake, as shown by the decomposition rate of the 45 µm mesh bags. However, invertebrates were important for the fragmentation, catabolism and leaching processes within the detritus contained in the 2 mm litter bags, accelerating its degradation, especially during the rainy season. The accelerated loss of chemical compounds such as nitrogen, carbon and phosphorus in the remaining detritus throughout the decomposition process stresses the importance of the decomposition process for the rapid nutrient cycling in the Campelo Lake and for the maintenance of high primary productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEgeria densa 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abags 3abiogeochemical cycles 3adry season 3ahalf life 3ainvertebrates 3alakes 3aleaching 3amacrophytes 3ametabolism 3amicrobial activity 3amicroorganisms 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aquantitative analysis 3atemperature 3awet season 3aBrazil 0aSubmerged macrophyte 0alitter bags 0anutrient cycle 0ashallow lake1 aFONSECA, Mateus N.1 aESTEVES, Bruno S.1 aCHAGAS, Gustavo G.0 tJournal of limnology.g2014 Oct. 22, v. 74, no. 2dPAGEPress Publications, Pavia, Italyx1723-86337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2014.10133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03488naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245010600176300001300282520179700295592002802092650001502120650002002135650001202155650002202167650002002189650001402209650001302223650000902236650001302245650000902258650001902267650002002286650001702306650001102323650002502334650001902359651001002378653002102388653001802409653002502427653001902452653001402471653003302485700001902518700002102537700002102558700002102579700002202600700002302622700001802645700002102663773012202684856008302806852000902889655001202898IND60525457720221122124358.0190318e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052545772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2015.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrara, Rossana Monica10aDynamics of ammonia volatilisation measured by eddy covariance during slurry spreading in north Italy  ap. 1-13.  aAmmonia (NH3) emissions have been quantified during slurry spreading in two experimental trials in two intensively managed agricultural fields in northern Italy, during spring 2009 and 2011. NH3 fluxes have been measured by Eddy covariance (EC) method from the slurry application to the soil incorporation until the end of the emission phenomenon.The EC system was equipped with a fast sensor for NH3 concentration measurements based on Tunable Infrared Laser Differential Absorption Spectrometry (QC-TILDAS). NH3 volatilisation has been monitored in continuous for both experimental trials, confirming the rapidity of the NH3 losses when slurry is spread to the field. Within 24h from the application the volatilisation suddenly decreases, stopping after soil incorporation occurred 24 and 30h from the spreading for the two experimental trials. The maximum NH3 emission levels were 138.3 and 243.5μgm−2s−1 and the total losses of NH4-N were 19.4% and 28.5%, determined 7 days after the spreading for the first and the second trial, respectively. EC measurements have been compared to the emissions estimated by a backward Lagrangian stochastic model, resulting consistent for dynamic and quantitative emitted. To explain the differences between the losses in the two experiments, the relationship between emission and meteorological conditions has been investigated. In particular, rain during the 2009 trial caused a significant reduction in emissions, whereas high air temperatures enhanced the emission phenomenon in the 2011 trial. The results shown that for improving nitrogen efficiency, slurry incorporation has to be performed in times closer from spreading than 24h, under weather conditions which limit NH3 emissions (such as cloudy with low solar radiation and temperature).  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aair temperature 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3aeddy covariance 3aemissions 3anitrogen 3arain 3aslurries 3asoil 3asoil treatment 3asolar radiation 3aspectroscopy 3aspring 3astochastic processes 3avolatilization 3aItaly 0aEmission factors 0aIncorporation 0aClosed-path analyser 0aWPL correction 0aQC-TILDAS 0aInverse dispersion modelling1 aCarozzi, Marco1 aDi Tommasi, Paul1 aNelson, David D.1 aFratini, Gerardo1 aBertolini, Teresa1 aMagliulo, Vincenzo1 aAcutis, Marco1 aRana, Gianfranco0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 219 p.1-13dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2015.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245006800168500001900236520116200255592002801417650001801445650001201463650001301475650001701488650000901505650002001514650001601534650002001550650002301570653001601593653002001609653002001629653001201649653003101661653000801692653000801700653000801708653000801716653000801724653000801732700002001740700002001760700002301780700002901803773011901832856008401951852000902035655001202044IND60727610220221119161432.0210212e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072761022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2020.1298292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLink, Camille14aThe role of cellular iron deficiency in controlling iron export  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIron export via the transport protein ferroportin (Fpn) plays a critical role in the regulation of dietary iron absorption and iron recycling in macrophages. Fpn plasma membrane expression is controlled by the hepatic iron-regulated hormone hepcidin in response to high iron availability and inflammation. Hepcidin binds to the central cavity of the Fpn transporter to block iron export either directly or by inducing Fpn internalization and lysosomal degradation. Here, we investigated whether iron deficiency affects Fpn protein turnover.We ectopically expressed Fpn in HeLa cells and used cycloheximide chase experiments to study basal and hepcidin-induced Fpn degradation under extracellular and intracellular iron deficiency.We show that iron deficiency does not affect basal Fpn turnover but causes a significant delay in hepcidin-induced degradation when cytosolic iron levels are low. These data have important mechanistic implications supporting the hypothesis that iron export is required for efficient targeting of Fpn by hepcidin. Additionally, we show that Fpn degradation is not involved in protecting cells from intracellular iron deficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3acycloheximide 3aexports 3ahepcidin 3ainflammation 3airon 3airon absorption 3amacrophages 3aplasma membrane 3atransport proteins 0aFerroportin 0aIron metabolism 0aIron deficiency 0aSLC40A1 0aLigand-induced degradation 0aFpn 0aMFS 0aCHX 0aHep 0aDFI 0aDFO1 aKnopf, Julia D.1 aMarques, Oriana1 aLemberg, Marius K.1 aMuckenthaler, Martina U.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2021 Mar., v. 1865, no. 3 p.129829-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2020.1298293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245010700157300001800264520158200282592002801864650001201892650001501904650004401919650001301963650001601976700002201992773010402014856007502118852000902193655001202202IND60531636520221119053838.0160724e20140916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053163652DNAL7 a10.1021/bi500679c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoang, Joshua10aConformational Selection and Functional Dynamics of Calmodulin: A 19F Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Study  ap. 5727-5736.  aCalcium-bound calmodulin (CaM-4Ca²⁺) is innately promiscuous with regard to its protein interaction network within the cell. A key facet of the interaction process involves conformational selection. In the absence of a binding peptide, CaM-4Ca²⁺ adopts an equilibrium between a native state (N) and a weakly populated near-native peptide-bound-like state (I), whose lifetime is on the order of 1.5 ms at 37 °C, based on ¹⁹F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG) relaxation dispersion measurements. This peptide-bound-like state of CaM-4Ca²⁺ is entropically stabilized (ΔS = 280 ± 35 J mol–¹ K–¹) relative to the native state, water-depleted, and likely parental to specific bound states. Solvent depletion, conformational selection, and flexibility of the peptide-bound-like state may be important in priming the protein for binding. At higher temperatures, the exchange rate, kₑₓ, appears to markedly slow, suggesting the onset of misfolded or off-pathway states, which retards interconversion between N and I. ¹⁹F NMR CPMG relaxation dispersion experiments with both CaM-4Ca²⁺ and the separate N-terminal and C-terminal domains reveal the cooperative role of the two domains in the binding process and the flexibility of the N-terminal domain in facilitating binding. Thus, when calcium binds, calmodulin establishes its interaction with a multitude of protein binding partners, through a combination of conformational selection to a state that is parental to the peptide-bound state and, finally, induced fit.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acalmodulin 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aProsser, R.

In this regard, the assessment of the contribution of microalgae to the transformation of heavy metal compounds and the detoxification of the natural environment is very important and necessary. This paper presents an investigation of the effect of different concentrations of cadmium Cd²⁺ and chromium Cr₂O₇²⁻ ions on the survival and ultrastructure of microalgae cells of Parachlorella kessleri Bh-2 and its ability to accumulate these metals in order to determine its bioremediational potential against these metals. It was determined that the culture of Parachlorella kessleri Bh-2 is resistant to concentrations of cadmium (0.3 mg l⁻¹) and chromium (30 mg l⁻¹) ions. It was found that heavy metals in these concentrations are actively transported through the cell membrane and accumulate in the cytoplasm of cells, causing an increase in the number of vacuoles with electron-dense deposits, granulation of the cytoplasm and an increase in the number of starch grains in the microalgae cells. Analysis of the content of total polysaccharides showed a noticeable increase in the concentration of polysaccharides by of exposure to concentrations of Cd (II) - 0,3 mg l⁻¹ and Cr (VI) - 30 mg l⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParachlorella kessleri 3abioremediation 3acadmium 3acell membranes 3achromium 3aheavy metals 3ametabolites 3amicroalgae 3aresearch 3aultrastructure 3awastewater 3axenobiotics 0aEDTA 0aGSH 0aHMs 0aMPC 0aml 0amln 0aMTs 0aPCs 0aBioaccumulation1 aSadvakasova, Assemgul K.1 aMustapayeva, Zhuldyz O.1 aKokociński, Mikołaj1 aZayadan, Bolatkhan K.1 aWojciechowicz, Maria Katarzyna1 aBalouch, Huma1 aAkmukhanova, Nurziya R.1 aAlwasel, Saleh1 aAllakhverdiev, Suleyman I.0 tAlgal research.g2021 Nov., v. 59 p.102463-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2021.1024633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245018400172300001600356520121800372536037901590592002801969596002101997596001502018650001402033650001602047650002502063650001402088650001302102650001802115650001902133651002102152653001202173653001502185653001402200653002802214653001302242653001902255700001802274700001802292700002202310773012802332856008602460852000902546655001202555IND60566915620221118012212.0220311e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056691562DNAL7 a10.1080/09670262.2016.12747882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoppenrath, Mona10aUltrastructure and molecular phylogenetic position of a new marine sand-dwelling dinoflagellate from British Columbia, Canada: Pseudadenoides polypyrenoides sp. nov.

Although both genera share morphological similarities, they have not formed sister taxa in previous molecular phylogenetic analyses. We discovered and characterized a new species of Pseudadenoides, P. polypyrenoides sp. nov., at both the ultrastructural and molecular phylogenetic levels. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of SSU and LSU rDNA sequences demonstrated a close relationship between P. polypyrenoides sp. nov. and Pseudadenoides kofoidii, and Adenoides and Pseudadenoides formed sister taxa in phylogenetic trees inferred from LSU rDNA sequences. Comparisons of morphological traits, such as the apical pore complex (APC), demonstrated similarities between Adenoides, Pseudadenoides and several planktonic genera (e.g. Heterocapsa, Azadinium and Amphidoma). Molecular phylogenetic analyses of SSU and LSU rDNA sequences also demonstrated an undescribed species within Adenoides.  aThis work was supported by a scholarship to MH from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (grant Ho3267/1-1) and by grants to BSL from the National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC 2014-05258) and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, Program in Integrated Microbial Biodiversity.

As several sediment cores were taken, the interest in analysing the pore water at the same time and at the same positions forced us to develop a cost- and time saving method for the placement of dialysis pore water samplers (DPS). General prerequisites were the ability to place several DPS per day, within a flexible depth range of up to 40 m and with a low cost budget. To meet these requirements, a DPS placing system (DPSPS) was developed, which would allow the precise placement of DPS in water with a depth of up to 40 m and assessing the biases of on-board measurements and possible methodological improvements. The DPSPS was transported to Brazil and tested in a measurement campaign for 10 days. The measurements were carried out during two campaigns in December 2012 and March 2013 in the Capivari Reservoir north-east of Curitiba in the State of Paraná. The system worked properly and several DPS could be placed from a 5 m class aluminium boat. The placement was performed with high accuracy regarding the positioning as well as the penetration depth of the DPS. After the recovery of the DPS, the possible biases during sampling were analysed. Possible back-diffusion was investigated, taking oxygen concentration as one representative parameter for estimation of the sample behaviour. Laboratory as well as field results showed that special care has to be taken to minimize the influence of diffusion processes during post-recovery sampling. The results also suggested that the used membranes are affected by clogging which is likely to influence the diffusion times of various ions and gases. It can be stated that the DPSPS was developed successfully as the demands in terms of handling as well as monitoring efficiency and sample quality were met. With this deployment and measurement technique, a valuable part in the assessment of greenhouse gas emissions from surface water bodies could be achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aboats 3adialysis 3agases 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aions 3amonitoring 3aoxygen 3asamplers 3asediments 3asurface water 3asurveys 3aBrazil 0aPlacement system 0asediment peeper 0apore water 0adiffusion 0aDPS1 aGAUGER, Friedrich1 aHÖLZLWIMMER, Sebastian1 aFuchs, Stephan,0 tJournal of limnology.g2014 Dec. 02, v. 74, no. 2dPAGEPress Publications, Pavia, Italyx1723-86337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2014.10543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02820naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245021900155300001800374500002000392520135500412592002801767650001801795650001201813650002301825650001201848650001001860650002201870650001601892650000901908650001801917650002201935650001001957650002301967650002101990650003002011650001302041650001802054650001802072650001202090650001402102700001702116700001402133773010902147856007302256852000902329655001202338IND60580118020221121081532.0170909e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058011802DNAL7 a10.1111/asj.127712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLan, Ruixia10aEffects of xylanase supplementation on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, blood parameters, fecal microbiota, fecal score and fecal noxious gas emission of weaning pigs fed corn‐soybean meal‐based diet  ap. 1398-1405.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study was conducted to evaluate the effects of xylanase supplementation on nutrient digestibility, growth performance, blood parameters, fecal microflora shedding, fecal score and fecal noxious gas emission of weaning pigs fed corn‐soybean meal based diet. A total of 150 weaning pigs with an average initial body weight (BW) of 7.85 ± 0.93 kg were randomly allocated to three treatments based on BW and sex (10 replicate pens with five pigs, two gilts and three barrows) were used in this 42‐day trial. Dietary treatments were: (1) CON, basal diet; (2) X1, basal diet +0.005% xylanase; (2) X2, basal diet +0.01% xylanase. The xylanase supplementation linearly increased (P < 0.05) average daily gain (ADG), and gain : feed ratio (G:F) from days 29 to 42 and the in overall period, dry matter, nitrogen and energy digestibility, and fecal Lactobacilli counts, and linearly decreased (P < 0.05) blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration, fecal NH₃ and H₂S emission. Additionally, at weeks 5 and 6, there was a linear decrease in fecal score with xylanase supplementation. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of xylanase improved growth performance, nutrient digestibility, shifted microbiota by increasing fecal Lactobacillus counts, decreased BUN concentration, fecal score, and fecal NH₃ and H₂S emission in weaning pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus 3aammonia 3aaverage daily gain 3abarrows 3ablood 3ablood composition 3abody weight 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adigestible energy 3agilts 3agrowth performance 3ahydrogen sulfide 3aintestinal microorganisms 3anitrogen 3aswine feeding 3aurea nitrogen 3aweaning 3axylanases1 aLi, Tianshui1 aKim, Inho0 tAnimal science journal =.g2017 Sept., v. 88, no. 9 p.1398-1405dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1344-39417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/asj.127713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245008600165300001400251520123400265592002801499650001101527650001701538650001701555650001501572653002601587653001501613653003201628653002501660653002101685700001501706700001501721700001201736700001501748773010301763856008601866852000901952655001201961IND60563376420221119123856.0190318e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056337642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.01.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Feng10aUnified pipe network method for simulation of water flow in fractured porous rock  ap. 80-96.  aRock masses are often conceptualized as dual-permeability media containing fractures or fracture networks with high permeability and porous matrix that is less permeable. In order to overcome the difficulties in simulating fluid flow in a highly discontinuous dual-permeability medium, an effective unified pipe network method is developed, which discretizes the dual-permeability rock mass into a virtual pipe network system. It includes fracture pipe networks and matrix pipe networks. They are constructed separately based on equivalent flow models in a representative area or volume by taking the advantage of the orthogonality of the mesh partition. Numerical examples of fluid flow in 2-D and 3-D domain including porous media and fractured porous media are presented to demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and effectiveness of the proposed unified pipe network method. Results show that the developed method has good performance even with highly distorted mesh. Water recharge into the fractured rock mass with complex fracture network is studied. It has been found in this case that the effect of aperture change on the water recharge rate is more significant in the early stage compared to the fracture density change.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3apermeability 3aporous media 3awater flow 0aFractured porous rock 0aWater flow 0aUnified pipe network method 0aNumerical simulation 0aFracture network1 aMa, Guowei1 aWang, Yang1 aLi, Tuo1 aZhu, Hehua0 tJournal of hydrology.g2017 Apr., v. 547 p.80-96dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.01.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03387naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001800180245016800198300001800366506007600384520181400460592002802274506003702302650003302339650001102372650001802383650001802401650001902419650002002438650001202458650001802470650002002488650001802508650002402526700001602550700002402566700001702590700001802607700001602625700001902641700002302660700001502683773011102698856007502809852000902884655001202893IND60529651720221207083402.0160717e20140715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052965172DNAL7 a10.1021/ac500876p2doi7 aPMC42158482pmcid7 a249412202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Weiming10aGlycoform Analysis of Recombinant and Human Immunodeficiency Virus Envelope Protein gp120 via Higher Energy Collisional Dissociation and Spectral-Aligning Strategy  ap. 6959-6967.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEnvelope protein gp120 of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is armored with a dense glycan shield, which plays critical roles in envelope folding, immune-evasion, infectivity, and immunogenicity. Site-specific glycosylation profiling of recombinant gp120 is very challenging. Therefore, glycoproteomic analysis of native viral gp120 is still formidable to date. This challenge promoted us to employ a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer to identify low abundant glycopeptides from virion-associated gp120. To search the HCD-MS data for glycopeptides, a novel spectral-aligning strategy was developed. This strategy depends on the observation that glycopeptides and the corresponding deglycosylated peptides share very similar MS/MS pattern in terms of b- and y-ions that do not contain the site of glycosylation. Moreover, glycopeptides with an identical peptide backbone show nearly resembling spectra regardless of the attached glycan structures. For the recombinant gp120, this “copy–paste” spectral pattern of glycopeptides facilitated identification of 2224 spectra using only 18 spectral templates, and after precursor mass correction, 1268 (57%) spectra were assigned to 460 unique glycopeptides accommodating 19 N-linked and one O-linked glycosylation sites (glycosites). Strikingly, we were able to observe five N- and one O-linked glycosites in native gp120. We further revealed that except for Asn276 in the C2 region, glycans were processed to contain both high mannose and hybrid/complex glycans; an additional four N-linked glycosites were decorated with high mannose type. Core 1 O-linked glycan Gal₁GalNAc₁ was seen for the O-linked glycosite at Thr499. This direct observation of site-specific glycosylation of virion-derived gp120 has implications in HIV glycobiology and vaccine design.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aenergy 3aglycopeptides 3aglycosylation 3aimmune evasion 3aimmune response 3amannose 3apathogenicity 3apolysaccharides 3aspectrometers 3avaccine development1 aShah, Punit1 aToghi Eshghi, Shadi1 aYang, Shuang1 aSun, Shisheng1 aAo, Minghui1 aRubin, Abigail1 aJackson, J.

The sortase are cysteine transpeptidases that catalyzes the covalent attachment of surface protein to the cell wall peptidoglycan. Among the reported six classes of sortases, each distinct class of sortase plays a unique biological role in anchoring a variety of surface proteins to the peptidoglycan of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria. Sortases not only exhibit virulence and pathogenesis properties to host cells, but also possess a significant role in gut retention and immunomodulation in probiotic microbes. The two main distinct functions are to attach proteins directly to the cell wall or assemble pili on the microbial surface. This review provides a compendium of the distribution of different classes of sortases present in both pathogenic and non-pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria and also the noteworthy role played by them in bacterial cell wall assembly which enables each microbe to effectively interact with its environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell walls 3achemical bonding 3acysteine 3adigestive system 3afimbriae 3aimmunomodulation 3apathogenesis 3apeptidoglycans 3aprobiotics 3asurface proteins 3avirulence 0aSortase 0aCell wall 0aGram-positive 0aPathogenic 0aNon-pathogenic1 aBajaj, Harsha1 aMadhavan Nampoothiri, Kesavan0 tCell surface.g2021 Dec., v. 7 p.100055-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:26762x2468-23307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcsw.2021.1000553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245018100156300001800337520148100355592002801836650001601864650001101880650002001891650001701911650002101928650001801949650001301967650001801980700001301998700001702011700001602028700001702044700001702061700001602078700001702094700001802111700001202129700001602141773011102157856007502268852000902343655001202352IND60529651920221121000735.0160717e20140715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052965192DNAL7 a10.1021/ac500955r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Fengzhou10aConcatemeric dsDNA-Templated Copper Nanoparticles Strategy with Improved Sensitivity and Stability Based on Rolling Circle Replication and Its Application in MicroRNA Detection  ap. 6976-6982.  aDNA-templated copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) have emerged as promising fluorescent probes for biochemical assays, but the reported monomeric CuNPs remain problematic because of weak fluorescence and poor stability. To solve this problem, a novel concatemeric dsDNA-templated CuNPs (dsDNA-CuNPs) strategy was proposed by introducing the rolling circle replication (RCR) technique into CuNPs synthesis. In this strategy, a short oligonucleotide primer could trigger RCR and be further converted to a long concatemeric dsDNA scaffold through hybridization. After the addition of copper ions and ascorbate, concatemeric dsDNA-CuNPs could effectively form and emit intense fluorescence in the range of 500–650 nm under a 340 nm excitation. In comparison with monomeric dsDNA-CuNPs, the sensitivity of concatemeric dsDNA-CuNPs was greatly improved with ∼10 000 folds amplification. And their fluorescence signal was detected to reserve ∼60% at 2.5 h after formation, revealing ∼2 times enhanced stability. On the basis of these advantages, microRNA let-7d was selected as the model target to testify this strategy as a versatile assay platform. By directly using let-7d as the primer in RCR, the simple, low-cost, and selective microRNA detection was successfully achieved with a good linearity between 10 and 400 pM and a detection limit of 10 pM. The concatemeric dsDNA-CuNPs strategy might be widely adapted to various analytes that can directly or indirectly induce RCR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA primers 3acopper 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahybridization 3amicroRNA 3ananoparticles1 aShi, Hui1 aHe, Xiaoxiao1 aWang, Kemin1 aHe, Dinggeng1 aGuo, Qiuping1 aQing, Zhihe1 aYan, Lv’an1 aYe, Xiaosheng1 aLi, Duo1 aTang, Jinlu0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 July 15, v. 86, no. 14 p.6976-6982dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac500955r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013000169300001800299520121900317592002801536650000801564650002101572650001901593650001901612650001001631650001101641650001901652650002101671650002501692650001401717653001701731653001801748653002201766653001301788653002901801653001701830700002301847700001801870700001901888773012001907856008502027852000902112655001202121IND60559776320221120100519.0180829e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055977632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2016.11.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCogoi, Susanna10aCritical role of hnRNP A1 in activating KRAS transcription in pancreatic cancer cells: A molecular mechanism involving G4 DNA  ap. 1389-1398.  aKRAS is one of the most mutated genes in human cancer. Its crucial role in the tumourigenesis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has been widely demonstrated. As this deadly cancer does not sufficiently respond to conventional chemotherapies, it is important to increase our knowledge of pancreatic cancer biology, in particular how oncogenic KRAS is regulated. The promoter of KRAS contains a GA-element composed of runs of guanines that fold into a G4 structure. This unusual DNA conformation is recognized by several nuclear proteins, including MAZ and hnRNP A1. Recent data have revealed that KRAS is interconnected to ILK and hnRNP A1 in a circuitry that enables pancreatic cancer cells to maintain an aggressive phenotype. The present review illustrates recent advances on how KRAS is regulated in pancreatic cancer cells, focusing on the formation of G4 structures in the KRAS promoter and their interaction with hnRNP A1. The newly discovered KRAS-ILK-hnRNP A1 regulatory loop is discussed, emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic target for PDAC-specific molecules.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled "G-quadruplex" Guest Editor: Dr. Concetta Giancola and Dr. Daniela Montesarchio.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA conformation 3aadenocarcinoma 3acarcinogenesis 3agenes 3ahumans 3aneoplasm cells 3anuclear proteins 3apancreatic neoplasms 3aphenotype 0aG-quadruplex 0aKRAS oncogene 0aPancreatic cancer 0ahnRNP A1 0aTranscription regulation 0aG4 unfolding1 aRapozzi, Valentina1 aCauci, Sabina1 aXodo, Luigi E.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2017 May, v. 1861, no. 5 p.1389-1398dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2016.11.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100002200151245014500173300001600318520173300334592002802067650001102095650001702106650001202123650001902135650001202154650001502166650002102181651001302202651000902215651001102224700002002235700001702255773009902272856008702371852000902458655001202467IND4475480620221121110314.0141111e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447548062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimon, Gregory L.10aWin-win scenarios at the climate–development interface: Challenges and opportunities for stove replacement programs through carbon finance  ap. 275-287.  aAchieving win-win outcomes in environment–development programs is a laudable goal, but frequently difficult to realize. In this paper we review the possibilities for win-win climate and development outcomes in programs that distribute improved cookstoves with the use of carbon finance. We show that improved cookstove technologies form an important, if asymmetrical, environment–development interface, and illustrate the mutually supported local (development) and global (climate change) benefits of continued improved stoves use—where success in one program area is directly tied to benefits in the other. We also describe how program results are highly contextual and that, in practice, there are a number of challenges to achieving effective ‘win-win’ outcomes—including cultural, financial, governance and technological barriers. While carbon finance provides an opportunity to fund scaleable and enforceable stove programs, it may also introduce mutually supported impediments—where progress towards one set of program objectives, directly compromises progress towards other objectives. Drawing on development debates for improved cookstove use, scientific reports on stove-based greenhouse gas reductions, and preexisting case studies of carbon and non-carbon financed cookstoves in Peru, Uganda and Cambodia, we conclude that the challenge for future carbon financed improved cookstove projects will be to leverage inherent symbioses between climate and development arenas in order to overcome mutually supported impediments. Achieving substantive win-win conditions will require further scholarly and practical engagement to tackle the many outstanding challenges and uncertainties reviewed in this essay.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3afunding 3agovernance 3agreenhouse gases 3aCambodia 3aPeru 3aUganda1 aBumpus, Adam G.1 aMann, Philip0 tGlobal environmental change.g2012 Feb., v. 22, no. 1 p.275-287dElsevier Ltdx0959-37807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02255naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012600169300001400295500001500309520105000324592002801374650001301402650001501415650001001430650001401440650001401454650001401468653001801482653001601500653001301516653001401529653003401543653001801577700002301595700002401618773012101642856008501763852000901848655001201857IND60543331320221123031914.0190410e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054333132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2015.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSytwala, Sonja10aLysozyme- and chitinase activity in latex bearing plants of genus Euphorbia – A contribution to plant defense mechanism  ap. 35-40.  a2019-12-06  aOccurrence of latices in plants is widespread, there are 40 families of plants characterized to establish lactiferous structures.

A lot of plants constitute so-called pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, to overcome stressful conditions. In our investigation we are focused on latex bearing plants of Euphorbiaceae Juss., and investigated the appearance of chitinase- and lysozyme activity in particular. The present outcomes represent a comprehensive study, relating to the occurrence of lysozyme and chitinase activity of genus Euphorbia at the first time. 110 different species of genus Euphorbia L. were tested, and the appearance of chitinase and lysozyme were determined in different quantities. The appearance itself, and the physicochemical properties of latices indicate an efficient interaction for plant defense against pathogen attack.  aPublisher supplied data 3alysozyme 3astickiness 3alatex 3aEuphorbia 3apathogens 3achitinase 0aPlant defense 0aPlant latex 0aLysozyme 0aChitinase 0apathogenesis-related proteins 0aEuphorbiaceae1 aGünther, Florian,1 aMelzig, Matthias F.0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2015 Oct., v. 95 p.35-40dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2015.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245015500176520141200331592002801743650002601771650001501797650002501812650001701837650001701854650001901871650001801890650001801908650001801926650000701944650001801951650001201969650001201981650002301993650001402016650001902030650001102049653002502060653002502085653001702110653001102127653000902138700002502147700002402172700001702196700003202213700003102245773009502276856008302371852000902454655001202463IND60787555620221119170032.0220921e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078755562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbio.2022.1019492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohsin, Aliah Zannierah10aPhysicochemical characteristics, GABA content, antimicrobial and antioxidant capacities of yogurt from Murrah buffalo milk with different fat contents  aThis study aimed to prepare yogurt from Murrah buffalo milk with high GABA content and low fat content while keeping the physicochemical characteristics, antimicrobial effects, and antioxidant capacity within acceptable levels.

However, the fat content significantly affected the viscosity, particle size, and texture profile analysis of the yogurt. The GABA content was significantly higher in the 0.2% fat yogurt (61.57 ± 3.22 mmol L⁻¹) compared to the 3.5% fat yogurt (43.64 ± 1.99 mmol L-¹) and 6.5% fat yogurt (27.84 ± 2.64 mmol L⁻¹). Glutamic acid and proline were the most abundant amino acids in the yogurt. In contrast, saturated fatty acids (butyric, lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic, and oleic) and linoleic acid were abundant. Yogurt with 3.5% fat showed significantly high antioxidant capacity and antimicrobial effects on E. coli O157 and Salmonella sp. Based on the results, fat content significantly affects the rheological properties, GABA content, and antioxidant and antimicrobial capacities of yogurt. In the future, 3.5% fat should be chosen as the optimized formula for large-scale yogurt production from Murrah buffalo milk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aSalmonella 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abuffalo milk 3acell viability 3aglutamic acid 3alinoleic acid 3alipid content 3apH 3aparticle size 3aproline 3atexture 3atitratable acidity 3aviscosity 3awater activity 3ayogurt 0aAntimicrobial effect 0aAntioxidant capacity 0aBuffalo milk 0aYogurt 0aGABA1 aMarzlan, Anis Asyila1 aMuhialdin, Belal J.1 aWai, Lew Kah1 aMohammed, Nameer Khairullah1 aMeor Hussin, Anis Shobirin0 tFood bioscience.g2022 Oct., v. 49 p.101949-dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2022.1019493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245012500163300001800288520153500306592002801841650001501869650001601884650002001900650001301920650001901933650001501952650001201967650001301979650003001992650002602022700002402048700002702072700002002099700002402119700002102143773011102164856007502275852000902350655001202359IND60529652020170413000000.0160717e20140715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052965202DNAL7 a10.1021/ac500986t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorsetnes, Silje
B.10aMultiplexing Determination of Small Cell Lung Cancer Biomarkers and Their Isovariants in Serum by Immunocapture LC-MS/MS  ap. 6983-6992.  aA multiplex method for the determination of the small cell lung cancer (SCLC) markers progastrin releasing peptide (ProGRP) and neuron specific enolase (NSE) is presented, which involves coextraction by immunoaffinity (IA) beads and codetermination by selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The performance was compared with two IA SRM methods which were recently validated for individual marker determination. The multiplexing method reduces sample volume, handling time per sample, and reagent consumption and shows good linearity, recovery, quantitative measurements, and sensitivity with lower limit of detection (LLOD) values of 7.2 pM (=90 pg/mL) and 4.5 pM (=210 pg/mL) and lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) values of 24 pM (=300 pg/mL) and 15 pM (=700 pg/mL), for total ProGRP and γ-NSE, respectively. The novel aspect of this approach is the multiplexing of ProGRP and NSE with the additional ability to perform fingerprinting by the selective determination of ProGRP isoform 1, ProGRP isoform 3, and total ProGRP, as well as the α- and the γ-subunit of NSE isoenzymes. Six serum samples from patients with SCLC were analyzed to demonstrate the methods feasibility to simultaneously differ between and individually quantify ProGRP, NSE, and their isoform and isoenzyme variants, respectively. Both the presence of and variation between all the isoforms and isoenzymes, as well as covarying results with the conventional immunometric assays for total ProGRP and γ-NSE, were seen in the analyses of patient serum samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3aisozymes 3alung neoplasms 3amonitoring 3aneurons 3apatients 3aphosphopyruvate hydratase 3aquantitative analysis1 aLevernæs, Maren S.1 aBroughton, Marianne N.1 aPaus, Elisabeth1 aHalvorsen, Trine G.1 aReubsaet, Léon,0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 July 15, v. 86, no. 14 p.6983-6992dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac500986t3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02018naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245016600173520078200339592002801121650001501149650001301164650001901177650002401196650001801220653001401238653003001252653002501282653002301307653001701330700002701347700002401374700002701398700002301425773010201448856008501550852000901635655001201644IND60774034420221118233355.0220531e20220608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077403442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2022.1537972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMamedov, Vakhid A.12aA concise synthesis of indolin-2-ones via direct acid-catalyzed intramolecular Friedel-Crafts alkylation of 3-chloro-N-(substituted)-2-oxo-N,3-diarylpropanamides  a3-Chloro-2-oxo-N,3-diarylpropanamides, readily obtained from aromatic aldehydes and dichloroacetic acid anilides under Darzens condensation conditions or isomerization of 2-chloro-N,3-diaryloxirane-2-carboxamides, proved to be excellent starting compounds for the synthesis 3-chloro(aryl)methyl)-3-hydroxyindolin-2-ones with the formation of a new C(sp²)–C(sp²)- bond via intramolecular Friedel-Crafts alkylation.

We hypothesize that university participants in either or both of these areas will exhibit greater collaboration with industry than researchers in other areas. We explore this hypothesis for 454 faculty members who conducted research that was patented during the period 1994–1999. Because our data include patents, publications, and funding at the individual level, we are able to examine the industry interaction of faculty who participated in the nanotechnology and biotechnology revolutions, as well as the interaction of faculty contributing to other areas of patentable science. We examine a variety of linkages, including sponsored research, consulting, publication with firm employees and measures of the potential for cross-campus collaboration. The results are striking in that they show significant differences in collaborative behavior across patent types and across the major program areas biological sciences, physical sciences and engineering. The results are consistent with a greater degree of tacit knowledge within the new methods of inventing. We also find significant differences in the embryonic nature and importance of patents across areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aengineering 3aBiological Sciences 3apatents 3aindustry 3ahuman resources 3ananotechnology 3abiotechnology 3amethodology 3auniversities 3acooperative research 3auniversity research 3aresearchers 3aresearch support 0anew methods1 aThursby, Marie0 tJournal of technology transfer.g2011 Dec., v. 36, no. 6 p.605-623dSpringer-Verlagx0892-99127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10961-011-9213-z  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01389naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011000170520034800280592002800628653002100656653003400677653001300711653001800724653002000742700001300762700002000775700001400795700001500809700001800824700001400842773010100856856008500957852000901042655001201051IND60774034520221118233318.0220523e20220525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077403452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2022.1538072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Rongxiang10aCobalt-catalyzed decarboxylative oxyalkylation of styrenes with α-cyanoacid: Access to γ‑ketonitriles  aA cobalt-catalyzed decarboxylative oxyalkylation of styrenes with α-cyanoacid has been established, leading to a variety of γ‑ketonitriles in moderate yields. α-Cyanoacid was applied as the nitrile sources.

The objective of this study was to characterize growth, antioxidant activity and lipid peroxidation of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) exposed to short-term WL and SM. ‘Silver Dollar’ (turf-type cultivar), ‘PI418714’ (wild accession), ‘Kangaroo Valley’ (forage-type cultivar) and ‘PI231569’ (unknown status) varying in growth habits and leaf texture were subjected to 7 d of WL and SM in a growth chamber. Plant height was unaffected by WL but was significantly reduced by SM for all grasses except PI418714. The SM treatment caused greater reductions in leaf chlorophyll and total carotenoid concentrations. Substantial declines in water-soluble carbohydrate concentrations were found in the shoots and roots under SM, particularly in Kangaroo Valley and PI231569, two relatively fast-growing genotypes. Significant increases in malondialdehyde concentrations were noted in the shoots and roots of all genotypes exposed to WL and SM, but to a greater extent in Kangaroo Valley and PI231569 under SM. Shoot activities of catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) increased under SM, more pronounced in Silver Dollar and PI418714, two relatively slow-growing genotypes. Waterlogging or SM stresses decreased root activities of superoxide dismutase, CAT, POD and ascorbate peroxidase, especially for Kangaroo Valley and PI231569. The results indicated that maintenance of antioxidant activity and carbohydrate and minimization of lipid peroxidation could contribute to better waterlogging or submergence tolerance of perennial ryegrasses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium perenne 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acarotenoids 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3acultivars 3aflooded conditions 3aforage 3agenotype 3agrasses 3agrowth chambers 3alawns and turf 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3aperennials 3aperoxidase 3aroots 3ashoots 3asubmergence 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atexture 0aAntioxidant metabolism 0aLolium perenne 0aFast and slow growing 0aWater excess 0aWater-soluble carbohydrate 0aAPX 0aCAT 0aChl 0aHT 0aMDA 0aPOD 0aSM 0aSOD 0aWL 0aWSC 0aCar1 aJiang, Yiwei0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2015 Oct., v. 95 p.57-64dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2015.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245015000177300001800327520144000345592002801785650001701813650001401830650001101844650000901855650001401864650001501878650001701893650001001910650001501920650002301935650001601958650001401974650001801988651001402006700002202020700001502042700001302057700001702070700001702087773011102104856008102215852000902296655001202305IND60548065220221121065628.0170721e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054806522DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-016-5115-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖzer, A.

Myxobolus parvus has been reported from mainly mugilid fishes from different localities including the Black Sea. Leaping mullet Liza saliens collected by fishermen off Sinop coasts of the Black Sea in the period between September 2014 and December 2015 was investigated for myxosporean parasites using conventional methods. M. parvus Schulman, 1962 was the only Myxobolus species identified and it was found in the gills, gall bladder, kidney tubules, and inside several cysts located on the lower jaw of examined fish in the present study. Morphometric data and all details of parasitic infection were determined and presented in tables and illustrated in figures. Molecular characterization was also conducted to reveal its position within Myxosporea. Two M. parvus samples from gills and kidney showed the same haplotype and appeared in the same sub-lineage with marine Myxobolus species. The closest haplotypes to M. parvus were Triactinomyxon sp. and Endocapsa sp. which are the actinosporeans forms of unknown myxozoan species. These data are the first in molecular characterization of M. parvus, its occurrence in lower jaw of leaping mullet along with its infection prevalence values off the Turkish Black Sea coasts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLiza saliens 3aMyxobolus 3acoasts 3afish 3afishermen 3afreshwater 3agall bladder 3agills 3ahaplotypes 3amarine environment 3amorphometry 3aparasites 3arenal tubules 3aBlack Sea1 aGürkanlı, C.

The physiological functions of laccases are diverse: participation in the formation of pigments and the formation of fruiting bodies of fungi, detoxification of phenols, catalysis of the oxidation of non-phenolic lignin units (C4-esterified) to radicals. Laccase activity increases due to the introduction of Cu2+, Mg2+ and Na+, but is strongly inhibited by Fe2+, Ag+, l-cysteine, dithiothreitol and NaN3. In the lower soil layers, the activity of laccase shows a significant increase when supplied with mineral N, the addition of compost leads to increased activity in the surface layer. The prospects for the practical use of oxidases increased after the discovery of the possibility of enhancing their action using redox mediators, which are substrates of these enzymes, during the oxidation of which highly redox potential and chemically active products are formed. Biocatalytic systems created by nano-technologies (bacterial nanocellulose, carbon nanotubes, magnetic nanoflowers etc.) increase the reaction efficiency by increasing the surface area and loading capacity, and reducing the mass transfer resistance. The effectiveness of immobilization is highly dependent on the process conditions, the properties of the enzyme and the material of the carrier. In particular, a clear correlation was established between the redox potential of the substrate and the efficiency of homogeneous catalysis. Of particular note is the effect of laccase on soil emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Participating in the polymerization of soluble phenols, they thereby contribute to humification, forming stable humic fractions that bind soil carbon. The data presented indicate that soil laccase is an important factor in the functionality of soil, but they need to be studied in more detail in order to understand the mechanisms that regulate their activity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaminophenols 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalytic activity 3acellulose 3acomposts 3acysteine 3adiamines 3adithiothreitol 3agreenhouses 3ahumification 3airon 3alaccase 3alignin 3amagnetism 3amass transfer 3ananoflowers 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apolyamines 3apolymerization 3apolyphenols 3aredox potential 3asoil 3asoil carbon 3asurface area 0aenzymatic activity 0aimmobilization 0agreenhouse gas emissions0 tÌntrodukcìâ roslin.g2019, v. 84dNAS of Ukraine, M.M.

During infection, microsporidia discharge a long and hollow polar tube, which delivers the sporoplasm into host cells. Polar tube protein 1 was the major component on the polar tube. Previously, we expressed the polar tube protein 1 from Nosema bombycis (NbPTP1) intercellularly in Drosophila S2 cells. Here, the microsporidian protein was expressed in Lepidopteran Sf9 cells. During heterologous expression, NbPTP1 protein was secreted and glycosylated. Microsporidian proliferation decreased in NbPTP1-expressing Sf9 cells. This confirms that NbPTP1 protein can interact with the host cell membrane receptor protein to facilitate microsporidian invasion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aLepidoptera 3aNosema bombycis 3acell membranes 3aglycosylation 3aheterologous gene expression 3aindustry 3asericulture 3aChina 0aPolar tube protein 1 0aMicrosporidia 0aHeterologous expression 0aGlycoprotein 0aProliferation1 aTan, Yaoyao1 aYu, Bin1 aPan, Guoqing1 aZhou, Zeyang0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2020 May, v. 172 p.107350-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2020.1073503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01401naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010000158300002000258520042200278592002800700650001300728650001100741650002000752650001200772650001800784650001300802650001300815700002100828700001900849773012400868856007400992852000901066655001201075IND60669100720221118014112.0190920e20150702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066910072DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra11905g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Fangfang10aDimeric resorcinarene salt capsules with very tight encapsulation of anions and guest molecules  ap. 57912-57916.  aCrystallization of N-cyclohexyl ammonium resorcinarene triflate from methanol results in a dimeric capsule capable of trapping two triflate anions and two methanol molecules within a 341 Å³ cavity while with 1,4-dioxane as a guest it forms a new larger dimeric capsule with volume of 679 Å³ encapsulating four 1,4-dioxane and four water molecules, resulting in packing coefficients of 0.75 and 0.67, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aanions 3acrystallization 3adioxane 3aencapsulation 3amethanol 3atrapping1 aBeyeh, N.

Tail biting is associated with reduced performance in the bitten pig, but it is not clear whether problems with tail biting are reflected in general farm performance figures. Farm advisory services aim to improve farm productivity which could be associated with improvements in pig welfare. Record keeping forms an integral part of such advisory services. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of record keeping in the Teagasc eProfit Monitor (ePM herds) on the prevalence of tail lesion severity scores in Irish slaughter pigs. In addition, we investigated associations between the prevalence of tail lesion scores and production parameters at farm level in ePM herds. Pigs were observed after scalding/dehairing and tail lesion score (0 to 4), sex and farm identification were recorded. Tail lesion scores were collapsed into none/mild lesions (score ⩽1), moderate lesions (score 2) and severe lesions (score ⩾3). The effect of record keeping (ePM herd) on the different tail lesion outcomes was analysed at batch level using the events/trials structure in generalized linear mixed models (PROC GLIMMIX). Spearman’s rank correlations were calculated between average tail lesion score of a batch and production parameters. A total of 13 133 pigs were assessed from 73 batches coming from 61 farms. In all, 23 farms were identified as ePM herds. The average prevalence of moderate tail lesions was 26.8% and of severe tail lesions was 3.4% in a batch. Batches coming from ePM herds had a lower prevalence of moderate tail lesions than non-ePM herds (P<0.001). Average tail lesion score was negatively associated with age (P<0.05) and weight (P<0.05) at sale/transfer of weaners, and tended to be positively associated with the number of finishing days (P=0.06). In addition, the prevalence of severe tail lesions was negatively associated with average daily gain in weaners (P<0.05) and tended to do so with average daily gain in finishers (P=0.08). This study provides the first indication that record keeping through an advisory service may help to lower the risk of tail biting, which is associated with improved farm performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3aaverage daily gain 3adehairing 3afarms 3afinishing 3aherds 3ameat inspection 3amodels 3apig carcasses 3arisk 3ascalding 3aslaughter 3aswine 3aswine feeding 3atail 3atail biting 3aweanlings 0atail lesions 0apigs 0arecord keeping 0afarm performance1 aTeixeira, D.

The C₃-symmetrical BF₂dk complex (1) formed a self-complementary interlocked dimer (1)₂ with increasing concentration in CHCl₃ as revealed by NMR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. A remarkable luminescence color change from blue to yellow was observed in response to the formation of interlocked dimers. Electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding between negative convexes (BF₂ moiety) and positive concaves (three protons aligned on each arm) principally contribute to the dimerization, whereas the formation of interlocked dimers was accompanied by conformational changes of constituent molecules which interrupted further association. Consequently, casting of the chloroform solution of interlocked dimers on solid supports gave uniform thin films without uneven crystallization.

These accessions originate from different latitudes and have different life strategies, both of which are known to be influenced by light and temperature. We showed that both accessions grew better in high‐light and at a lower temperature (16°C) than in low light and at 23°C. Interestingly, Sha had a lower chlorophyll content but more efficient non‐photochemical quenching than Lov‐5. Sha, also showed a higher expression of vitamin E biosynthetic genes. We did not observe any difference in the antioxidant prenyllipid level under these conditions. Our results suggest that the mechanisms that keep the plastoquinone (PQ)‐pool in more oxidized state could play a role in the adaptation of these accessions to their local climatic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aantioxidants 3achlorophyll 3aclimatic factors 3agenes 3alatitude 3aplant growth 3atemperature 3avitamin E 3aSweden 3aTajikistan1 aNowicka, Beatrycze1 aGabruk, Michał1 aGlińska, Sława1 aMichlewska, Sylwia1 aDłużewska, Jolanta1 aSawicka, Anna1 aKruk, Jerzy1 aLaitinen, Roosa0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2015 June, v. 154, no. 2 p.194-209dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.122783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02098naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245012400172520076500296592002801061650002701089650002301116650002701139650002001166650001601186650002601202650001101228650001001239650002501249650001301274650001101287651001801298653000901316653001701325700002501342700002001367700002201387700001901409700002801428773011701456856008201573852000901655655001201664IND60686858320221118070114.0200412e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068685832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2020.1073542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerretta, Marcelo F.10aSusceptibility of agricultural pests of regional importance in South America to a Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1Ia protein  aBacillus thuringiensis toxins of the Cry1I class have dual specificity for insects in the orders Coleoptera and Lepidoptera.

There were an estimated 1.4 million TB deaths in 2015 and an additional 0.4 million deaths resulting from TB among individuals with HIV. Drug-discovery for its cure is very slow in comparison with the causative organism’s fast pace of mutations conferring drug resistance. Moreover, the field of drug-discovery of anti-TB drugs is constantly being challenged by the drug resistant strains of Mtb. Several molecules/inhibitors are being tested across the pharmaceutical industry and research centres for their suitability as drug candidate. It takes immense effort, high costs and a whole lot of screening to bring a single molecule to the clinics for patient cure. In last 60 years, hundreds of molecules have been patented for their probable use to develop drug for treatment of TB. However, only one drug has been successfully approved that is bedaquiline (1-(6-bromo-2 -methoxy-quinolin-3-yl)-4-dimethylamino-2-naphtalen-1-yl-1-phenyl-butan-2-ol). This is a brief review about bedaquiline (BDQ), the only drug in last 45 years approved for curing drug-resistant pulmonary TB, its development, action mechanism and development of resistance against it.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3adrug resistance 3adrugs 3amutation 3apathogens 3apatients 3apharmaceutical industry 3ascreening 3atuberculosis1 aKumari, Rashmi1 aLal, Rup0 tIndian journal of microbiology.g2017 Dec., v. 57, no. 4 p.371-377dSpringer Indiax0046-89917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12088-017-0674-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03615naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245018900170300001600359520177900375592002802154650001302182650003802195650002602233650003002259650002102289650001602310650001902326650001802345650001902363650000902382650001702391650000902408650001102417650001402428650001302442650002402455650001702479650001302496650001302509650001802522650002702540651001102567651001302578653002202591653001902613653003102632653002702663653000802690653001302698700002302711700002402734700002002758700002002778773010802798856008602906852000902992655001203001IND50059489220221119163448.0190319e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005948922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2012.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan, Sook Wah10aComparative study on the physicochemical properties of κ-carrageenan extracted from Kappaphycus alvarezii (doty) doty ex Silva in Tawau, Sabah, Malaysia and commercial κ-carrageenans  ap. 581-588.  aκ-Carrageenan is a linear, sulphated polysaccharide that is widely used in the food industry as a gelling agent due to its lack of toxicity and biocompatibility. In this study, the physicochemical properties of κ-carrageenan (TA150) derived from Kappaphycus alvarezii (formerly Eucheuma cottonii) in Tawau, Sabah were investigated and compared to commercial κ-carrageenan (SeaKem CM611, Gelcarin GP812, Gelcarin GP911 NF, and Grindsted® carrageenan CL220). TA150 exhibited the lowest lightness but highest yellowness, with L∗ and b∗ values reported as 82.69 and 17.16, respectively. The rupture strength of κ-carrageenan increased significantly with increasing concentration (p < 0.05). The water losses from κ-carrageenan gel increased with increasing storage times. TA150 lost the most water within 10 days of storage time. The water-holding capacity (WHC) of κ-carrageenan gel was reported to be excellent (>90%) under all storage temperatures (25 °C, 4 °C and −18 °C). The moisture content, ash, acid-insoluble matter, and sulphate levels of κ-carrageenan samples were reported as 3.65–11.41%, 17.75–33.18%, 0.22–3.74%, and 12.00–19.71%, respectively. These samples were low in fat, protein, and crude fibre contents. The potassium content in κ-carrageenan was highest in Gelcarin GP812 (100.42 g/kg), followed by Grindsted® carrageenan CL220 (61.92 g/kg), TA150 (54.60 g/kg), Gelcarin GP911 NF (40.90 g/kg) and SeaKem CM611 (15.76 g/kg). No heavy metals were detected in TA150 and the other commercial κ-carrageenan samples except for lead. However, the concentration of lead detected in the κ-carrageenan samples fell within the acceptable ranges (<5 mg/kg) set by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA).  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucheuma 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aKappaphycus alvarezii 3aWorld Health Organization 3abiocompatibility 3acarrageenan 3afood additives 3afood industry 3agelling agents 3agels 3aheavy metals 3alead 3alipids 3apotassium 3aproteins 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3asulfates 3atoxicity 3awater content 3awater holding capacity 3aBorneo 3aMalaysia 0aEucheuma cottonii 0aκ-Carrageenan 0aPhysicochemical properties 0aWater-holding capacity 0aAsh 0aMinerals1 aMirhosseini, Hamed1 aTaip, Farah Saleena1 aLing, Tau Chuan1 aTan, Chin-Ping,0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2013 Mar., v. 30, no. 2 p.581-588dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2012.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245016400163300001600327520134100343592002801684650002401712650001901736650002101755650002001776650003101796650001001827650003401837650003701871650002901908650001801937700001601955700001901971773010501990856008102095852000902176655001202185IND60501323420221117224210.0160222e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6050132342DNAL7 a10.1007/s13258-015-0360-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jiaying10aUsing digital gene expression profile to detect representational difference of Chlamys farreri genes after laboratory exposure to persistent organic pollutants  ap. 263-274.  aChlamys farreri (C. farreri), as an economic species of marine bivalves, can tolerate manifold anthropogenic stressors including persistent organic pollutants (POPs) stress. A systematic study of transcriptome after POPs exposure may provide insights into the mechanism of acquired pollution tolerance. In this study, we compared C. farreri transcriptome by reanalyzing DGE (digital gene expression) data from previous study. Our results revealed a toxicant-dependent pattern of global transcriptional responses, with 108, 126 and 138 DEGs regulated by BaP, TBBPA and PAHs cocktail (mixed by benzo(a)pyrene, benz(a)anthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene and chrysene with the ratio of 5:3:1:1) exposure, respectively. Among these DEGs, 219 were commonly regulated by all pollutants, whereas the minority of differences were condition-specific. In addition, we performed the first hierarchical cluster analysis of the common transcripts throughout three types of contaminants stress ulteriorly, leading to new discoveries of genes’ association information with dynamical gene expression data of C. farreri, which goes beyond the focus on individuals. It revealed a cascade of gene expression patterns in the response of C. farreri to different environmental stresses and may be beneficial for further analysis of novel environmental metrics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzumapecten farreri 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3acluster analysis 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3apersistent organic pollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome1 aPan, Luqing1 aMiao, Jingjing0 tGenes & genomics.g2016 Mar., v. 38, no. 3 p.263-274dThe Genetics Society of Koreax1976-95717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13258-015-0360-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245006200153300001600215520122600231592002801457650002201485650002301507650002501530650001401555650001901569650001101588650001401599650002401613650001401637650002001651650002201671650002401693650001801717700001601735773010101751856007201852852000901924655001201933IND60693070520221116224252.0200504e20100301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069307052DNAL7 a10.4155/bfs.10.42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXin, Jiayu10aTest methods for the determination of biodiesel stability  ap. 275-289.  aBiodiesel, which is defined as mono alkyl esters derived from renewable resources such as vegetable oils and animal fats through transesterification, is an alternative fuel for diesel engines. One of the major drawbacks associated with practical applications is its relatively poor stability compared with petroleum-based diesel. Stabilization of biodiesel is a complex issue including oxidation stability, thermal stability and storage stability. During deterioration of biodiesel, changes of many chemical and physical properties take place and can be monitored by analytical methods. In order to find the relationship between fuel properties and stability during use, several studies have been carried out in this decade, which impelled the establishment of standard analytical methods and special specifications. However, there is still no effective method to determine the storage stability and thermal stability of biodiesel that can cover all oxidation characteristics. In this review, we introduce the methods for stability determination and present comparisons between them. The aim of this article is to present the development and implementation of the stability test method in research and application fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative fuels 3aanalytical methods 3aanimal fats and oils 3abiodiesel 3adiesel engines 3aesters 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stability 3apetroleum 3astorage quality 3athermal stability 3atransesterification 3avegetable oil1 aSaka, Shiro0 tBiofuels.g2010 Mar. 1, v. 1, no. 2 p.275-289dFuture Science LtdwJournal:2219x1759-72777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4155/bfs.10.43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02150naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006700168300001600235520096100251592002801212650002501240650002601265650002201291650002001313650001501333650001701348650001401365650001101379650001301390650003301403650001601436653001901452653001901471653001501490653001601505653001401521653002101535773008201556856008101638852000901719655001201728IND60637629920221117231705.0190421s1993    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063762992DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-900013062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWayne Wilcox, W.10aComparative Morphology of Early Stages of Brown-Rot Wood Decay  ap. 127-138.  aEarly stages of decay by two brown-rot fungi in two woods were studied by light and scanning electron microscopy. The earliest diagnostic feature to appear was hyphae in the earlywood lumina. The earliest effect on cell walls was the loss of birefringence in the earlywood; Poria placenta (syn. Postia placenta) caused this loss at the earliest stage of decay observed, in both Douglas-fir and white fir, while Gloeophyllum trabeum caused significant weight loss before loss of birefringence was visible. Attack on the latewood progressed from the earlywood, and was different in pattern among the wood/fungus combinations. Hyphal and bore hole diameter increased throughout the early progression of decay and would be useful in evaluating the stage of decay, if the starting diameter of hyphae could be determined. Separation between cells was not observed until moderate stages of decay and, therefore, was not useful in diagnosing early stages of decay.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGloeophyllum trabeum 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aRhodonia placenta 3abrown-rot fungi 3acell walls 3adecayed wood 3aearlywood 3ahyphae 3alatewood 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aweight loss 0aPoria placenta 0aAbies concolor 0awood decay 0aearly decay 0adiagnosis 0alight microscopy0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 14, no. 2 p.127-138dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900013063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03540naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245012500201500002000326520126600346592002801612596005001640596004201690596007301732596007401805596016001879596016002039596006302199596014102262650001102403650001902414650002502433650001002458650001202468650001002480650002002490650002202510650001302532650001002545650003302555650001402588650003102602650001802633650001102651650001002662651001202672651002602684700002602710700001802736700002202754773011602776856007302892852000902965655001202974IND60631157020221119122803.0190219e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063115702DNAL7 a10.1111/efp.124912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZlatković, Milica1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4514-398010aGenetic uniformity characterizes the invasive spread of Neofusicoccum parvum and Diplodia sapinea in the Western Balkans  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn the past decade, trees and shrubs in the Western Balkans region have been damaged by canker and die‐back disease caused by Botryosphaeriaceae species. These pathogens include Neofusicoccum parvum and Diplodia sapinea. In this study, we determine genetic diversity and structure between populations of N. parvum and D. sapinea from Serbia and Montenegro (Western Balkans) using DNA sequence data of the internal transcribed spacer rDNA, translation elongation factor 1‐alpha, β‐tubulin‐2 and microsatellite markers. The relationship of both pathogens was compared for populations from the Continental (CR) and Mediterranean (MR) regions and for isolates of D. sapinea from Cedrus spp. and Pinus spp. Neofusicoccum parvum and D. sapinea were shown to have a low gene and genotypic diversity across the regions and hosts. All genotypes of D. sapinea found on Pinus spp. were also present on Cedrus spp. The CR and MR populations of both species were found to be only slightly separated from one another by a geographical barrier. Low genetic diversity and dominance of N. parvum and D. sapinea on non‐native trees suggests that these species have most likely been introduced into Western Balkans, possibly through the movement of infected plants.  aPublisher supplied data  cTree Protection Co-operative Programme (TPCP)  cUniversity of Pretoria (South Africa)  aTR37008cMinistry of Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia  aIII43007cMinistry of Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia  aFP1002-180612-018564cEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) Action Pathway Evaluation and Pest Risk Management In Transport (PERMIT FP1002)  aFP1002-080714-044952cEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) Action Pathway Evaluation and Pest Risk Management In Transport (PERMIT FP1002)  aTD1209-020315-053196cCOST action ALIEN Challenge (TD1209)  aFP1401-100715-062902cCOST action A global network of nurseries as early warning system against alien tree pests (Global Warning FP1401) 3aCedrus 3aDiplodia pinea 3aNeofusicoccum parvum 3aPinus 3adieback 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ahosts 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3apathogens 3apeptide elongation factors 3aribosomal DNA 3ashrubs 3atrees 3aBalkans 3aSerbia and Montenegro1 aWingfield, Michael J.1 aJami, Fahimeh1 aSlippers, Bernard0 tForest pathology.g2019 Feb., v. 49, no. 1 p.e12491-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl60333x1437-47817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/efp.124913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02255naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245014400159520129200303592002801595650002001623650001301643650001001656650001501666650001001681650001501691650002501706700002101731773012001752856007201872852000901944655001201953IND60648676920221122113114.0190701e20160906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064867692DNAL7 a10.3390/f70901982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoenig, Kristina10aFull-Waveform Airborne Laser Scanning in Vegetation Studies—A Review of Point Cloud and Waveform Features for Tree Species Classification  aIn recent years, small-footprint full-waveform airborne laser scanning has become readily available and established for vegetation studies in the fields of forestry, agriculture and urban studies. Independent of the field of application and the derived final product, each study uses features to classify a target object and to assess its characteristics (e.g., tree species). These laser scanning features describe an observable characteristic of the returned laser signal (e.g., signal amplitude) or a quantity of an object (e.g., height-width ratio of the tree crown). In particular, studies dealing with tree species classification apply a variety of such features as input. However, an extensive overview, categorization and comparison of features from full-waveform airborne laser scanning and how they relate to specific tree species are still missing. This review identifies frequently used full-waveform airborne laser scanning-based point cloud and waveform features for tree species classification and compares the applied features and their characteristics for specific tree species detection. Furthermore, limiting and influencing factors on feature characteristics and tree classification are discussed with respect to vegetation structure, data acquisition and processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aforestry 3alidar 3atree crown 3atrees 3avegetation 3avegetation structure1 aHöfle, Bernhard0 tForests.g2016 Sept. 06, v. 7, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f70901983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005800155245015200213300001600365520157100381592002801952650001301980650002501993650001602018650002202034650001502056650002202071650001302093650002002106650001402126650001702140650001502157650003702172650001802209650001802227650001102245650001602256650001202272650001102284651001002295653001202305653001502317653000902332653001002341653002102351653002002372700002302392700002002415700005902435700005802494700002102552773009102573856009002664852000902754655001202763IND60632900320221120095518.0191214e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063290032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiorio, Chiara1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7821-739810aDirect target and non-target analysis of urban aerosol sample extracts using atmospheric pressure photoionisation high-resolution mass spectrometry  ap. 786-795.  aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous atmospheric pollutants of high concern for public health. In the atmosphere they undergo oxidation, mainly through reactions with ·OH and NOx to produce nitro- and oxygenated (oxy-) derivatives. In this study, we developed a new method for the detection of particle-bound PAHs, nitro-PAHs and oxy-PAHs using direct infusion into an atmospheric pressure photoionisation high-resolution mass spectrometer (APPI-HRMS). Method optimisation was done by testing different source temperatures, gas flow rates, mobile phases and dopants. Samples were extracted with methanol, concentrated by evaporation and directly infused in the APPI source after adding toluene as dopant. Acquisition was performed in both polarity modes. The method was applied to target analysis of seasonal PM2.5 samples from an urban background site in Padua (Italy), in the Po Valley, in which a series of PAHs, nitro- and oxy-PAHs were detected. APPI-HRMS was then used for non-target analysis of seasonal PM2.5 samples and results compared with nano-electrospray ionisation (nanoESI) HRMS. The results showed that, when samples were characterised by highly oxidised organic compounds, including S-containing compounds, like in summer samples, APPI did not bring any additional information with respect to nanoESI in negative polarity (nanoESI(-)). Conversely, for winter samples, APPI(-) could detect a series of aromatic and poly-aromatic compounds, mainly oxidised and nitrogenated aromatics, that were not otherwise detected with nanoESI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aatmospheric pressure 3aevaporation 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3amethanol 3anitrogen oxides 3aoxidation 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apublic health 3aspectrometers 3asummer 3atemperature 3atoluene 3awinter 3aItaly 0aAPPI-MS 0aNanoESI-MS 0aHRMS 0aPM2.5 0aUrban background 0aPAH derivatives1 aBortolini, Claudio1 aKourtchev, Ivan1 aTapparo, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8928-705X1 aBogialli, Sara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9152-36021 aKalberer, Markus0 tChemosphere.g2019 June, v. 224 p.786-795dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01586naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002400188245008500212300001600297506007600313520049500389592002800884506003700912650000900949650002600958650002600984650003701010700001901047773010401066856008101170852000901251655001201260IND60585186420221207052154.0171105e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058518642DNAL7 a10.1007/s12088-017-0683-z2doi7 aPMC56714382pmcid7 a291516532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlanagan, J.

Insularis Nakai  ap. 139-151.  aThe distribution of guaiacyl and syringyl lignins in the secondary xylem tissues of normal and compression wood of Buxus microphylla var. insularis Nakai was examined by visible light (VL) microspectrophotometry coupled with the Mäule and Wiesner colour reactions and by UV -microspectrophotometry, and compared with normal wood of Betula ermani Cham. Buxus formed compression wood on the lower side of the leaning sterns, and the secondary walls of the vessels and fibre-tracheids showed excessive lignification, resembling the S₂ (L) layer of compression wood tracheids in gymnosperms.In normal wood of both species, the Mäule colour reaction indicated that in Betula the secondary walls of fibres contain larger amounts of syringyl units in the lignins than other tissues, and that in Buxus the secondary walls of fibre-tracheids contain both syringyl and guaiacyl units. The vessel walls of both speeies contained higher amounts of guaiacyl units. Heterogeneity of the syringyl-Jignin distribution was found in the secondary walls of Buxus fibre-tracheids.In compression wood of Buxus, on the other hand, the spectra of the secondary walls of the vessels and fibretracheids after the Mäule reaction showed low absorbances compared with the normal wood, whereas, after the Wiesner reaction, their secondary walls gave high absorbances. In addition, the UV -absorption maximum of the secondary fibre walls shifted from 274 nm to 279 nrn, and the UV -absorbances of the vessei and fibre-tracheid walls greatly increased in compression wood. The results obtained in the present study demonstrated that in normal Buxus wood the secondary walls of the vessels and fibre-tracheids contain both guaiacyl and syringyl units, though the syringyl unit is a rninor constituent in the vessel walls, and that both cell types increase their contents of guaiacyl units, especially in the outer parts of the secondary walls during their changes from normal wood to compression wood. The present study also suggested that the Wiesner reaction may be used for examining the content of lignin and the proportion of guaiacyl to syringyl units in lignins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3aBuxus microphylla 3aBuxus sinica var. insularis 3acolor 3acompression wood 3alight 3alignification 3alignin 3alignin content 3atracheids 3awood 0aBetula ermani 0aguaiacyl lignin 0asyringyl lignin 0aultraviolet microspectrophotometry 0aMäule reaction 0aWiesner reaction1 aWatanabe, Naomi1 aYokota, Sbinso1 aIdei, Tosbinaga0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 14, no. 2 p.139-151dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900013073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03257naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003900147245021800186300001600404500001500420520155800435592002801993650002402021650001402045650002402059650000902083650001402092650002402106650002002130650001602150650001602166650001602182650002102198650001202219650001402231650001402245650001802259650002202277650002402299650002902323650002002352650002202372650004302394650002002437653002302457700003702480700001502517773010502532856008102637852000902718655001202727IND60501323620221117224037.0160222e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6050132362DNAL7 a10.1007/s13258-015-0369-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElvitigala, Don Anushka Sandaruwan10aCharacterization of a nucleotide-oligomerization domain (NOD) like receptor C5 (NLRC5) subfamily member from black rockfish (Sebastes schlegelii), portraying its transcriptional responses against immune stimulants  ap. 303-310.  a2019-12-06  aNucleotide-oligomerization domain like receptors (NLRs) are recently identified group of pattern recognition receptors which involve in sensing broad range of pathogen associated molecular patterns or damage associated molecular patterns to trigger corresponding immune responses in host cells. In this study, we identified and characterized a NLRC5 family member from a previously established black rockfish cDNA database, designating as ‘RfNLRC5’. The complete open reading frame of RfNLRC5 consists of 5808 bp which encodes for a protein of 1936 amino acids with the predicted molecular mass of 213 kDa. Intriguingly, RfNLRC5 harbored only two typical domain signatures of NLR superfamily, namely NACHT domain and LRRs. However, it was phylogenetically closely related to the telostan counterparts. As expected, RfNLRC5 shared significant sequence compatibility with its teleostan counterparts, eminently with that of large yellow croaker. As detected by our qPCR assay, RfNLRC5 was universally distributed in tissues examined, albeit with different levels. Therein, more pronounced expression levels were detected in blood cells and spleen tissues. After treating the naïve fish with immune stimulants; lipopolysaccharides and Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), RfNLRC5 mRNA expression in blood cells and spleen tissues was found to modulate significantly with notable inductive responses. Collectively, our results in this study hint a potential role of RfNLRC5 in host innate immune responses against bacterial or viral infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3alipopolysaccharides 3aphylogeny 3aSebastes schlegelii 3afish 3areceptors 3aopen reading frames 3agene expression 3aamino acids 3ablood cells 3asplenocytes 3amolecular weight 3atissues 3adatabases 3apathogens 3amessenger RNA 3acomplementary DNA 3aLarimichthys crocea 3atranscription (genetics) 3aimmune response 3aSebastes melanops 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3ainnate immunity 0aSebastes schlegeli1 aThulasitha, William Shanthakumar1 aLee, Jehee0 tGenes & genomics.g2016 Mar., v. 38, no. 3 p.303-310dThe Genetics Society of Koreax1976-95717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13258-015-0369-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245009700161500002000258520125000278592002801528596004601556650000801602650002701610650001301637650002501650650001901675650002201694650001301716650001401729650002701743650001301770650001401783650002501797650001501822650001601837650001401853650001201867651001101879651001001890651002901900700006001929700002601989700005902015700001702074700001802091700002102109700006502130773011602195856007302311852000902384655001202393IND60631157220221119122654.0190219e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063115722DNAL7 a10.1111/efp.124772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVitale, Salvatore10aCharacterization of Phytophthora cinnamomi from common walnut in Southern Europe environment  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aForty‐eight isolates of Phytophthora cinnamomi obtained from common walnut were analysed according to their variability in growth at different temperatures, virulence, sensitivity to metalaxyl and in genomic DNA. Isolates were obtained from commercial common walnut orchards located in northern Italy and in southern France. Inter‐simple sequence repeat (ISSR) were analysed for the 49 isolates, 43 of which were Italian, 6 French; an isolate of the same species obtained from Viburnum spp. was used as an outgroup. ANOVA on phenotypic characters showed a significant impact of the geographic location of the orchard on isolate variability in terms of reaction to temperatures and aggressiveness. In turn, clustering obtained with UPGMA analysis on genetic data was almost exclusively dependant on isolate variability, nevertheless the 48 isolates seem to share a common variability that differentiates the group from the isolate from Viburnum spp. Correlation between phenotypic and genetic traits was not statistically significant. In conclusion, phenotypic variability like virulence seemed to be conditioned from geographic origin while the genetic variability of P. cinnamomi isolates from walnut was associated to the single genotype.  aPublisher supplied data  cItalian Ministry of Agriculture (MiPAAFT) 3aDNA 3aPhytophthora cinnamomi 3aViburnum 3aanalysis of variance 3agenetic traits 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ametalaxyl 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aorchards 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3aprovenance 3atemperature 3avirulence 3awalnuts 3aFrance 3aItaly 3aSouthern European region1 aScotton, Michele1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0221-08751 aVettraino, Anna Maria1 aVannini, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4318-90881 aHaegi, Anita1 aLuongo, Laura1 aScarpari, Marzia1 aBelisario, Alessandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8912-76380 tForest pathology.g2019 Feb., v. 49, no. 1 p.e12477-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl60333x1437-47817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/efp.124773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01915naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245005400171300001800225520088400243592002801127650002301155650001701178650001401195650001601209653001901225653001601244653001601260653002501276653002201301700002001323700001701343700002201360773008101382856008101463852000901544655001201553IND60551471720221119062221.0161018e20150422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055147172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2015.02.0922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawashima, Hidehisa10aFurther study on synthesis of the cyclobakuchiols  ap. 2387-2392.  aTwo results are described.

This study quantified the ecosystem services and disservices of mangroves as written by colonial explorers from 1823–1883 through a literature survey of 96 expedition reports and studies. Ecosystem disservices were most commonly discussed (60%), with settlers considering mangroves as reservoirs of diseases such as malaria, with wide-ranging implications, such as the global drainage of wetlands in the 19th–20th centuries. Multiple ecosystem services were discussed, especially provisioning services for export, representing colonial views of new lands as ripe for economic use. Interestingly, regulating services of mangroves such as erosion control and sediment accretion that are a focus of much contemporary research were recognized as early as 1865. This study shows that the ecosystem service paradigm has a long history in mangroves. We should not underestimate mangrove ecosystem disservices, and how contemporary perceptions of mangroves may be influenced by such historical viewpoints. Archival materials provide a rich resource to study human-environment interactions, and how they change through time.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrainage 3aecosystem services 3aerosion control 3aexports 3ahabitats 3amalaria 3amangrove forests 3asediments 3asurveys 3awetlands0 tForests.g2016 Aug. 24, v. 7, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f70901833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245014500169520122000314592002801534650002001562650002501582650002101607650002201628650002201650650001101672650001101683650002201694650001201716650002201728650001001750650002001760650001001780650001001790653001001800653001101810653001401821653002701835653002301862700001601885700001901901700002201920773011701942856008302059852000902142655001202151IND60686858920221118070129.0200614e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068685892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2020.1016022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeorgousakis, C.10aGone with the weed: Population growth of Sitophilus oryzae and Rhyzopertha dominica in wheat and barley containing seeds of Silybum marianum  aIn the present study we examined the effect of seeds of the weed Silybum marianum (L.)

(Coleoptera: Bostryhidae) and Sitophilus oryzae (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). The evaluation took place on 7 different quantitative combinations of the weed, i.e. 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100% of the total amount of the grain mass. All combinations were kept under constant conditions of 25 οC and 65% relative humidity (r.h.) for 65 days. After this interval, adult progeny production was counted, and classified as dead or alive. In general, progeny production was higher on wheat than on barley for R. dominica, but the reverse was recorded for S. oryzae. No progeny production was recorded for either species when S. marianum containment was 100%. Moreover, for both species, the decrease of the percentage of S. marianum caused an increase in progeny production, but this decrease was not linear. The study concludes that R. dominica and S. oryzae cannot develop on S. marianum seeds, but they can develop in mixtures of these seeds with grains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3aRhyzopertha dominica 3aSilybum marianum 3aSitophilus oryzae 3aTriticum aestivum 3aadults 3abarley 3apopulation growth 3aprogeny 3arelative humidity 3aseeds 3astorage insects 3aweeds 3awheat 0aWheat 0aBarley 0aWeed seed 0aStored product beetles 0aProgeny production1 aSakka, M.K.1 aKarkanis, A.C.1 aAthanassiou, C.G.0 tJournal of stored products research.g2020 May, v. 87 p.101602-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45775x0022-474X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2020.1016023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245011500166300001800281520157900299592002801878650001301906650002601919650002201945650001901967650001901986650001502005650002002020650001302040650002902053650001902082700002302101700001702124700001802141700001902159700001802178773009202196856007802288852000902366655001202375IND60133136320221119193732.0150518e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013313632DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2014003912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemircan, Yağmur10aLabel‐free detection of multidrug resistance in K562 cells through isolated 3D‐electrode dielectrophoresis  ap. 1149-1157.  aDielectrophoresis (DEP), a technique used to separate particles based on different sizes and/or dielectric properties under nonuniform electric field, is a promising method to be applied in label‐free, rapid, and effective cell manipulation and separation. In this study, a microelectromechanical systems‐based, isolated 3D‐electrode DEP device has been designed and implemented for the label‐free detection of multidrug resistance in K562 leukemia cells, based on the differences in their cytoplasmic conductivities. Cells were hydrodynamically focused to the 3D‐electrode arrays, placed on the side walls of the microchannel, through V‐shaped parylene‐C obstacles. 3D‐electrodes extruded along the z‐direction provide uniformly distributed DEP force through channel depth. Cell suspension containing resistant and sensitive cancer cells with 1:100 ratio was continuously flown through the channel at a rate of 10 μL/min. Detection was realized at 48.64 MHz, the cross‐over frequency of sensitive K562 cells, at which sensitive cells flow with the fluid, while the resistant ones are trapped by positive DEP force. Device can be operated at considerably low voltages (<9 Vₚₚ). This is achieved by means of a very thin (0.5 μm) parylene coating on electrodes, providing the advantages offered by the isolation of electrodes from the sample, while the working voltage can still be kept low. Results prove that the presented DEP device can provide an efficient platform for the detection of multidrug resistance in leukemia, in a label‐free manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3adielectric properties 3adielectrophoresis 3aelectric field 3aelectric power 3aelectrodes 3aelectrophoresis 3aleukemia 3amultiple drug resistance 3aneoplasm cells1 aKoyuncuoğlu, Aziz1 aErdem, Murat1 aÖzgür, Ebru1 aGündüz, Ufuk1 aKülah, Haluk0 tElectrophoresis.g2015 May, v. 36, no. 9-10 p.1149-1157dVerlag Chemiex0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2014003913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02574naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012600170520118100296592002801477650001901505650002701524650003101551650001201582650001201594650001801606650001601624650001801640650001101658650001201669650000901681650002001690653002701710653001801737653001501755653000901770653001801779700001701797700001601814700002201830700002401852700001701876773012101893856008102014852000902095655001202104IND60686859020221118065937.0200509e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068685902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1091142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKyere, Emmanuel O.10aBiofilm formation of Listeria monocytogenes in hydroponic and soil grown lettuce leaf extracts on stainless steel coupons  aFoodborne outbreaks associated with fresh produce due to human pathogenic bacteria have become a global concern. In this study, we investigated the ability of three fresh produce associated L. monocytogenes strains: PFR O8A06 (coleslaw isolate), PFR O8A07 and O8A08 (cabbage isolates) to survive and form biofilms on stainless steel coupons in extracts of lettuce leaves obtained from soil and hydroponic systems at 4 °C and 10 °C. There was no significant difference (p < 0.05) between the hydroponic and soil grown leaf extracts in terms of L. monocytogenes survival, growth and biofilm formation. The biofilm formation of L. monocytogenes on stainless steel for both soil and hydroponic leaf extracts at 10 °C increased from 3 log to 6.4–7.2 log CFU/cm². At 4 °C, the biofilm formation of all three strains for both soil and hydroponic leaf extracts increased to 4.3–4.8 log CFU/cm². These findings suggest that lettuce leaf extracts support the survival, growth and biofilm formation of L. monocytogenes on stainless steel irrespective of the growth system used and this might be a potential cause for recurring contamination in the processing environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactuca sativa 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3abiofilm 3acabbage 3afresh produce 3ahydroponics 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3alettuce 3asoil 3astainless steel 0aListeria monocytogenes 0aFresh produce 0aHydroponic 0aSoil 0aLettuce juice1 aFoong, Grace1 aPalmer, Jon1 aWargent, Jason J.1 aFletcher, Graham C.1 aFlint, Steve0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 May, v. 126 p.109114-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1091143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003000153245016500183500001900348520106900367592002801436650002301464650000801487650005201495650001301547650001601560650001401576650001301590650000901603650001601612650001201628651001101640653001301651653001601664653002101680653002901701700002201730700003101752700003601783700003101819700001801850700002801868700001501896700002001911700003901931700001901970700003701989700003302026700003302059700002702092700003002119700002702149700001802176700003102194700002802225700002502253700002502278700003102303700002802334773011902362856008802481852000902569655001202578IND60713224820221122220736.0210219e20210420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071322482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1426452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbrahão, Jônatas Santos10aDetection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on public surfaces in a densely populated urban area of Brazil: A potential tool for monitoring the circulation of infected patients  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe world is experiencing the worst global health crisis in recent decades since December/2019 due to a new pandemic coronavirus. The COVID-19 disease, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in more than 30 million cases and 950 thousand deaths worldwide as of September 21, 2020. Determining the extent of the virus on public surfaces is critical for understanding the potential risk of infection in these areas. In this study, we investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on public surfaces in a densely populated urban area in Brazil. Forty-nine of 933 samples tested positive (5.25%) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, including samples collected from distinct material surfaces, including metal and concrete, and distinct places, mainly around hospital care units and public squares. Our data indicated the contamination of public surfaces by SARS-CoV-2, suggesting the circulation of infected patients and the risk of infection for the population. Constant monitoring of the virus in urban areas is required as a strategy to fight the pandemic and prevent further infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aRNA 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aconcrete 3aenvironment 3ahospitals 3apandemic 3arisk 3aurban areas 3aviruses 3aBrazil 0aCOVID-19 0aCoronavirus 0aGenome detection 0aEnvironment surveillance1 aSacchetto, Lívia1 aRezende, Izabela Maurício1 aRodrigues, Rodrigo Araújo Lima1 aCrispim, Ana Paula Correia1 aMoura, César1 aMendonça, Diogo Correa1 aReis, Erik1 aSouza, Fernanda1 aOliveira, Gabriela Fernanda Garcia1 aDomingos, Iago1 ade Miranda Boratto, Paulo Victor1 aSilva, Pedro Henrique Bastos1 aQueiroz, Victoria Fulgêncio1 aMachado, Talita Bastos1 aAndrade, Luis Adan Flores1 aLourenço, Karine Lima1 aSilva, Thaís1 aOliveira, Graziele Pereira1 ade Souza Alves, Viviane1 aAlves, Pedro Augusto1 aKroon, Erna Geessien1 ade Souza Trindade, Giliane1 aDrumond, Betânia Paiva0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Apr. 20, v. 766 p.142645-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1426453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02364naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245014000173300001600313520089300329592002801222650001501250650001101265650001501276650001601291650001701307650001801324650001501342650002501357650002101382650002001403653001701423653001401440653001601454653002901470700005901499700001801558700001401576700001301590700001401603700001401617700001301631700001901644700001701663773009101680856009001771852000901861655001201870IND60632900920221120084339.0191214e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063290092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Fangyuan10aEffects of phosphate on the dispersion stability and coagulation/flocculation/sedimentation removal efficiency of anatase nanoparticles  ap. 580-587.  aThis study investigates the behavior and fate of TiO2 NPs in conventional water treatment (coagulation/flocculation/sedimentation) under the influence of waterborne phosphate, focusing on the phosphate uptake rate, surface interactions, and dispersion stability and removal efficiency of TiO2 NPs. The adsorption of HPO42− ions on TiO2 NPs (i.e., surface complexation in solution) causes displacement of carbonate species. Moreover, adsorption experiments indicates that complexation of inorganic anions on the surfaces of TiO2 NPs can occur rapidly, within a 5 min time frame. This study confirmed that phosphate would affect the surface charge of the TiO2 NPs; thus, the bridging effect during coagulation may also be hindered by phosphate becoming attached to TiO2 NP surfaces. This information will contribute to nanotechnology-related water safety and water treatment technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanions 3acarbonates 3acoagulation 3aflocculation 3ananoparticles 3aphosphates 3asurface interactions 3atitanium dioxide 3awater treatment 0aWater safety 0aPhosphate 0aCoagulation 0aRemoval of nanoparticles1 aZhang, Chunpeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6497-56571 aZhao, Tianrui1 aZu, Yilin1 aWu, Xuan1 aLi, Bowen1 aXing, Xin1 aNiu, Jia1 aChen, Xiaochen1 aQin, Chuanyu0 tChemosphere.g2019 June, v. 224 p.580-587dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01805naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010200159300001800261520057600279592002800855650002200883650002300905650002000928650002100948650002400969650001300993700002001006700002501026700002401051700002101075700002401096700002101120700001701141700001301158700002001171773013301191856007401324852000901398655001201407IND60639039120221118073948.0190501e20170307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063903912DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc08848a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hsiu-Wen10aSynthesis and structure of synthetically pure and deuterated amorphous (basic) calcium carbonates  ap. 2942-2945.  aIt is generally believed that H₂O and OH⁻ are the key species stabilizing and controlling amorphous calcium carbonate “polyamorph” forms, and may in turn control the ultimate crystallization products during synthesis and in natural systems.

(V. negundo) which acted as a reductant and stabilizer simultaneously. The as prepared samples are characterized using UV-visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Also artificial neural network (ANN) model was presented for synthesized silver nanoparticles in V. negundo L. extract. The aim was to predict size of silver nanoparticles produced as a function of the weight percentage of V. negundo L. extract, reaction of temperature, stirring time and molar concentration of AgNO₃. The fast Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) optimization technique was employed for training of ANN model. The optimized ANN was as a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network with two hidden layers and 10 neurons. Therefore ANN is found out to be an efficient tool to model the complicated chemical field. This model is capable for predicting the size of nanoparticles for a wide range of conditions with a mean square error 0.4576 and a regression of about 0.998. Based on the presented model it is possible to design an effective green method for obtain silver nanoparticles, while minimum received materials are used and minimum size of nanoparticles will be obtained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitex negundo 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaqueous solutions 3abiosynthesis 3amixing 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3areducing agents 3asilver nitrate 3astabilizers 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aYusof, Rubiyah1 aShameli, Kamyar0 tRSC advances.g2015 Oct. 14, v. 5, no. 106 p.87277-87285dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra11940e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03413naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100002400170245012200194300001800316520200800334592002802342650001602370650002002386650000902406650002102415650000902436650001102445650002402456650001802480650001202498650003702510650002102547650003002568650004902598700002402647700002102671700002302692700002302715700002102738773011202759856008702871852000902958655001202967IND4466791520221119164001.0141112e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446679152DNAL7 a217822112pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.06.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReinardy, Helena C.10aUptake, depuration, and radiation dose estimation in zebrafish exposed to radionuclides via aqueous or dietary routes  ap. 3771-3779.  aUnderstanding uptake and depuration of radionuclides in organisms is necessary to relate exposure to radiation dose and ultimately to biological effects. We investigated uptake and depuration of a mixture of radionuclides to link bioaccumulation with radiation dose in zebrafish, Danio rerio. Adult zebrafish were exposed to radionuclides (⁵⁴Mn, ⁶⁰Co, ⁶⁵Zn, ⁷⁵Se, ¹⁰⁹Cd, ¹¹⁰ᵐAg, ¹³⁴Cs and ²⁴¹Am) at tracer levels (<200Bqg⁻¹) for 14d, either via water or diet. Radioactivity concentrations were measured in whole body and excised gonads of exposed fish during uptake (14d) and depuration phases (47d and 42d for aqueous and dietary exposures respectively), and dose rates were modelled from activity concentrations in whole body and exposure medium (water or diet). After 14-day aqueous exposure, radionuclides were detected in decreasing activity concentrations: ⁷⁵Se>⁶⁵Zn>¹⁰⁹Cd>¹¹⁰ᵐAg>⁵⁴Mn>⁶⁰Co>²⁴¹Am>¹³⁴Cs (range: 175–8Bqg¹). After dietary exposure the order of radionuclide activity concentration in tissues (Bqg⁻¹) was: ⁶⁵Zn>⁶⁰Co>⁷⁵Se>¹⁰⁹Cd>¹¹⁰ᵐAg>²⁴¹Am>⁵⁴Mn>¹³⁴Cs (range: 91–1Bqg⁻¹). Aqueous exposure resulted in higher whole body activity concentrations for all radionuclides except ⁶⁰Co. Route of exposure did not appear to influence activity concentrations in gonads, except for ⁵⁴Mn, ⁶⁵Zn, and ⁷⁵Se, which had higher activity concentrations in gonads following aqueous exposure. Highest gonad activity concentrations (Bqg⁻¹) were for ⁷⁵Se (211), ¹⁰⁹Cd (142), and ⁶⁵Zn (117), and highest dose rates (μGyh⁻¹) were from ²⁴¹Am (aqueous, 1050; diet 242). This study links radionuclide bioaccumulation data obtained in laboratory experiments with radiation dose determined by application of a dosimetry modelling tool, an approach that will enable better linkages to be made between exposure, dose, and effects of radionuclides in organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3abioaccumulation 3adiet 3adietary exposure 3afish 3agonads 3alabeling techniques 3aradionuclides 2aAnimals 2aEnvironmental Exposurexanalysis 2aRadiation Dosage 2aRadioisotopesxmetabolism 2aZebrafishxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism.1 aTeyssie, Jean-Louis1 aJeffree, Ross A.1 aCopplestone, David1 aHenry, Theodore B.1 aJha, Awadhesh N.0 tScience of the total environment.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 409, no. 19 p.3771-3779dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.06.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01997naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100001900185245011500204300001800319506007600337520078200413592002801195506003701223650001301260650002201273650001101295650000901306650001901315650003901334650002601373700002001399700002501419773009201444856007801536852000901614655001201623IND60133136620221207092904.0150518e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013313662DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2015000942doi7 aPMC46726892pmcid7 a257820902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLing, Wei‐Li10aFast reversible single‐step method for enhanced band contrast of polyacrylamide gels for automated detection  ap. 1224-1227.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStaining SDS‐PAGE is commonly used in protein analysis for many downstream characterization processes. Although staining and destaining protocols can be adjusted, they can be laborious, and faint bands often become false negatives. Similarly, these faint bands hinder automated software band detections that are necessary for quantitative analyses. To overcome these problems, we describe a single‐step rapid and reversible method to increase (up to 500%) band contrast in stained gels. Through the use of alcohols, we improved band detection and facilitated gel storage by drying the gels into compact white sheets. This method is suitable for all stained SDS‐PAGE gels, including gradient gels and is shown to improve automated band detection by enhanced band contrast.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalcohols 3acomputer software 3adrying 3agels 3apolyacrylamide 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aquantitative analysis1 aLua, Wai‐Heng1 aGan, Samuel Ken‐En0 tElectrophoresis.g2015 May, v. 36, no. 9-10 p.1224-1227dVerlag Chemiex0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2015000943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01612naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008200167300001600249520074800265592002801013650002001041650001401061650001001075650001201085651001201097653001201109653001701121773008201138856008101220852000901301655001201310IND60637630920221117232810.0190421s1993    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063763092DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-900013232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabos, Károly,10aTyloses Formation and the State of Health of Quercus Petraea Trees in Hungary  ap. 239-243.  aIn a 76-year-old sound and in a 77-year-old diseased trunk of Quercus petraea the number of earlywood vessels with and without tyloses were counted along a 1 cm tangential segment of the annual rings, in four directions at four heights (0.16, 1.35, 12.0, 24.0 m). At all heights of the sound stem, the percentage of earlywood vessels sealed by tyloses is low (2.57-4.13-5.94%). In the diseased stem, the percentage of earlywood vessels sealed by tyloses is higher (7.40- 13.08-19.86%) than it is in the sound stem. This demonstrates a decreased hydraulic capacity in the diseased stem. In both trees, the percentage of earlywood vessels sealed by tyloses increased from the stump (at 0.16 m trunk height = 5.02 %) upwards (at 12.0 m = 12.58%).  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus petraea 3aearlywood 3atrees 3atyloses 3aHungary 0asapwood 0atree decline0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 14, no. 3 p.239-243dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900013233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010600164520089300270592002801163650002801191650002601219650001601245650002501261650000901286650001501295650003101310650001001341650002201351650002101373650000701394650001201401650001501413650002001428650002901448653001801477653003001495653002501525653001601550700001701566700001401583700002101597700001401618700001801632773012101650856008101771852000901852655001201861IND60686859320221118065951.0200509e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068685932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1092782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Xiangna10aProbiotic characteristics of Lactobacillus plantarum AR113 and its molecular mechanism of antioxidant  aLactobacillus plantarum AR113, a strain isolated from Chinese traditional pickle, was evaluated for its survival capacity under different stress conditions such as low pH, high bile, high osmotic pressure and antibiotics, and its probiotic characteristics were measured subsequently.

Comparison of the fungal complexes showed them to differ by species composition; only two species—P. palitans and P. solitum—were in the species lists of both groups. The identified secondary metabolites in the investigated strains belonged to diketopiperazine (group of roquefortines, rugulosuvin B), benzodiazepine (anacin, cyclopenins), quinoline alkaloids (viridicatins), clavine ergot alkaloids (α-cyclopiazonic acid, festuclavine, fumigaclavines), polycyclic indole alkaloids (communesin B, chaetoglobosin A), amino acid derivatives (N-acetyltryptamine, chrysogins, penicillin G), polyketides (citreoviridin A, mycophenolic acid), and terpenes (andrastins, phomenone). Strains isolated from anthropogenically altered habitats produced a more complete and characteristic profile of exometabolites, as compared with strains isolated from undisturbed habitats. It is only from contaminated soils there were isolated fungi that produced more structurally diverse secondary metabolites pertaining to polycyclic indole alkaloids and terpenoids. The fungi isolated from contaminated samples can be used in biodegradation of oil spills and bioremediation of the environment, and also as producers of promising biologically active compounds.  aPublisher supplied data  a15-29-02629-ofi_m and 16-04-01050-a.cno 3aPenicillium 3aamino acids 3abenzodiazepines 3abenzylpenicillin 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3adiketopiperazines 3aergot 3afungi 3alakes 3aoils 3apermafrost 3apetroleum 3apolyketides 3aquinoline 3aroquefortine 3asecondary metabolites 3aspecies diversity 3aterpenoids 3aAntarctic region1 aKochkina, G.

MS medium with 3.0 mg l⁻¹ BA (6-benzyladenine) was optimum for shoot bud induction. For shoot multiplication, mother explants were transferred repeatedly on medium containing low concentration of BA (0.75 mg l⁻¹). Number of shoots was increased up to two passages and decreased thereafter. Shoot multiplication was further enhanced on MS medium containing 0.25 mg l⁻¹ each of BA and Kin (Kinetin) with 0.1 mg l⁻¹ of NAA (α-naphthalene acetic acid). Addition of 0.004 mg l⁻¹ TDZ (thidiazuron) increased the rate of shoot multiplication and 21.81 ± 1.26 shoots per culture vessel were obtained. In vitro regenerated shoots were rooted under ex vitro conditions treated with 400 mg l⁻¹ IBA (indole-3-butyric acid) for 7 min on sterile soilrite. After successful hardening in greenhouse, ex vitro rooted plants were transferred to the field conditions with ≈85% of survival rate. Micromorphological changes were observed on leaf surface i.e. development of vein density and trichomes and stomatal appearance, when plants were subjected to environmental conditions.

The overall elucidation and the examination of these complex processes require multistep laboratory approaches in order to obtain results which will not only detect particular stage but also indicate the mechanisms lying upon this process. Such results will be reliable because they will cover multidirectional methods and approaches. The analysis of currently available results already provided with the conclusion that often single omics approach does not correspond with other expected information and may bring misinterpretations. That is why the integration of several “omics” is useful for searching entire explanations and answers as well as appropriate interpretation of obtained complex results. The hypothesis was stated that “from transcriptomics can not be concluded to proteomics”. This review focuses on the reasons for the integration of transcriptomic, proteomic and other—omics analysis. Moreover it also describes the examples of clinical meanings and mentions some methods used in these approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell communication 3ametabolism 3aproteomics 3atranscriptomics 3atranslation (genetics)1 aChrobak, Lukasz1 aKowalczyk, Krzysztof1 aKankofer, Marta1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3053-07420 tMolecular biology reports.g2019 June, v. 46, no. 3 p.3597-3606dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-019-04793-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245010100206300001600307506007600323520146900399592002801868506003701896650001001933650002201943650001101965650001101976650001901987650001302006650001202019650001302031650001702044650001302061650002202074650001302096650001302109650001202122650001002134650001702144650001902161650001102180700003602191700001902227700002202246700001802268700001502286700001802301773011602319856008102435852000902516655001202525IND60585187520221207052142.0171105e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058518752DNAL7 a10.1007/s12298-017-0463-62doi7 aPMC56714452pmcid7 a291586412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Rakesh10aDevelopment of an efficient and reproducible regeneration system in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)  ap. 945-954.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe availability of reproducible regeneration system through tissue culture is a major bottleneck in wheat improvement program. The present study has considered to develop an efficient callus induction and regeneration system using mature and immature embryos as explants in recently released agronomically superior spring wheat varieties. An efficient sterilization process was standardized using 0.1% HgCl₂ and 70% ethanol for both seeds and embryos. The maximum possible combinations of plant growth regulators (PGRs) were evaluated for their effect on different wheat regeneration processes through tissue culture starting from callus to root induction. Picloram is found as an effective auxin with 87.63–98.67% callus induction efficiency in both explants. Supplementation of CuSO₄ along with 2,4-D, zeatin in regeneration medium significantly enhanced the multiple shoot induction. The shoot development was achieved using full strength Murashige and Skoog’s (MS) medium and root induction using half MS medium without PGRs. The optimized medium and method has resulted up to 100% regeneration irrespective of the genotype used with high reproducibility. Thus, the standardized regeneration system can be used in the regeneration of healthy plants from embryos rescued from interspecies crosses, transgenic production, induced mutation breeding and recently developed genome editing techniques for the procreation of wheat plants having novel traits.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a2,4-D 3aTriticum aestivum 3aauxins 3acallus 3acopper sulfate 3acrossing 3aethanol 3aexplants 3agene editing 3agenotype 3amercuric chloride 3amutation 3apicloram 3arooting 3aseeds 3aspring wheat 3atissue culture 3azeatin1 aMamrutha, Harohalli Masthigowda1 aAmandeep Kaur,1 aVenkatesh, Karnam1 aGrewal, Anita1 aKumar, Raj1 aTiwari, Vinod0 tPhysiology and molecular biology of plants.g2017 Oct., v. 23, no. 4 p.945-954dSpringer Indiax0971-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12298-017-0463-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004200113040001800155100001800173245007500191300001400266520132800280592002801608650001501636650001301651650003301664650001301697650001801710650001301728650001301741650001801754650002001772650002501792650001701817650001901834650001001853650002101863650000801884650001701892650000901909650001201918650001201930650001001942650007201952650003102024650001102055650001102066650000902077650004902086650001702135650003602152650002202188651001802210700001802228700002302246773009902269856005502368852000902423655001202432IND50059029520221119163842.0121011e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005902952DNAL7 a222212142pmid7 a10.1111/j.1753-4887.2011.00451.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanu, Jameela10aAlternative therapies for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis  ap. 22-40.  aOsteoporosis is a medical condition that affects millions of men and women. People with this condition have low bone mass, which places them at increased risk for bone fracture after minor trauma. The surgeries and treatments required to repair and heal bone fractures involve long recovery periods and can be expensive. Because osteoporosis occurs frequently in the elderly, the financial burden it places on society is likely to be large. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has approved several drugs for use in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. However, all of the currently available agents have severe side effects that limit their efficacy and underscore the urgent need for new treatment options. One promising approach is the development of alternative (nonpharmaceutical) strategies for bone maintenance, as well as for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. This review examines the currently available nonpharmaceutical alternatives that have been evaluated in in vitro and in vivo studies. Certain plants from the following families have shown the greatest benefits on bone: Alliceae, Asteraceae, Thecaceae, Fabaceae, Oleaceae, Rosaceae, Ranunculaceae, Vitaceae, Zingiberaceae. The present review discusses the most promising findings from studies of these plant families.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsteraceae 3aFabaceae 3aFood and Drug Administration 3aOleaceae 3aRanunculaceae 3aRosaceae 3aVitaceae 3aZingiberaceae 3aadverse effects 3aalternative medicine 3abone density 3abone fractures 3adrugs 3ain vitro studies 3amen 3aosteoporosis 3arisk 3asociety 3asurgery 3awomen 2aBone Density Conservation Agentsxadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aBone and Bonesxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aOsteoporosisxprevention & controlxtherapy. 2aPhytotherapy 2aPlant Extractsxtherapeutic use 2aTreatment Outcome 3aUnited States1 aVarela, Erika1 aFernandes, Gabriel0 tNutrition reviews.g2012 Jan., v. 70, no. 1 p.22-40dBlackwell Publishing Incx0029-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1753-4887.2011.00451.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02877naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100001500168245009700183300001400280520118900294592002801483650002601511650002201537650001701559650001501576650002401591650001201615650002201627650001401649650002401663650001301687650001601700650001801716650001101734650002801745650002301773650002701796650002201823650002401845650004701869650001501916650002601931650001601957650001701973650001101990651001002001700001602011700001702027700001502044700001302059700001802072773010302090856008502193852000902278655001202287IND4473125320221118060139.0141111e20120915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447312532DNAL7 a225620072pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2012.03.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ting10aEffect of hydrothermal treatment on the levels of selected indigenous microbes in food waste  ap. 17-21.  aThe ability of hydrothermal treatment to reduce or eliminate selected indicator organisms in food waste was assessed in this study. Raw food waste collected from student canteens at Tsinghua University was heat-treated under hydrothermal conditions at 90–140 °C for 10–40 min. Hydrothermal inactivation analyses were carried out on four types of indigenous microbes used as indicators of hygiene: molds and yeasts (MY), total coliforms (TC), total aerobic counts (TAC) and Staphylococcus aureus (SA). Significant reductions in the levels of indigenous microbes in food waste were achieved during the ramping and holding periods of the hydrothermal treatment, and the microbial inactivation effect increased with increasing temperature, increasing time and increasing pressure. Due to the typical properties of food waste, hydrothermal treatment at 120 °C–0.3 MPa for at least 40 min was sufficient to achieve complete sterilization of the food waste. The results showed that hydrothermal treatment could significantly reduce the levels of indigenous microbes and is a potential advanced technique for the sterilization of food waste with a high moisture content in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3acoliform bacteria 3afood quality 3afood waste 3ahot water treatment 3ahygiene 3aindicator species 3araw foods 3aschool food service 3astudents 3atemperature 3awater content 3ayeasts 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aEnterobacteriaceae 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Microbiology 2aMicrobial Viability 2aRefuse Disposalxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aSalmonella 2aStaphylococcus aureus 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 2aYeasts 3aChina1 aJin, Yiying1 aLiu, Fuqiang1 aMeng, Xiao1 aLi, Huan1 aNie, Yongfeng0 tJournal of environmental management.g2012 Sept. 15, v. 106 p.17-21dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2012.03.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245013200159300001800291520147200309592002801781650000801809650001501817650002101832650001501853650003801868650001301906650001701919650001001936650002101946650001201967650001501979650001801994650001702012650002602029650003002055700002102085700001802106700002002124700002102144700001802165773011102183856007502294852000902369655001202378IND60529649720170413000000.0160717e20140715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052964972DNAL7 a10.1021/ac402001q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHöbel, Sabrina12aA Novel Method for the Assessment of Targeted PEI-Based Nanoparticle Binding Based on a Static Surface Plasmon Resonance System  ap. 6827-6835.  aThe delivery of nucleic acids is a major hurdle in gene therapy or therapeutic gene knockdown, and the development of intelligent and safe nanoparticles as carrier systems is thus under intense investigation. The introduction of ligands for their targeted delivery is of major interest. Here, we describe a novel approach for the analysis of the binding properties of antibody-functionalized nanoparticles, using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in a static cuvette system. By chemical coupling of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-specific antibody cetuximab to poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) via a PEG-spacer and subsequent DNA or siRNA complexation, we generated targeted nanoplexes with low surface charge. Antibody-mediated uptake into EGFR overexpressing cells was observed. SPR measurements with use of a novel, protein A-based sandwich system for the immobilization of the target receptor in its correct steric orientation allowed the analysis of the specific PEI-PEG-cetuximab binding to EGFR and the determination of binding affinities. Importantly, our cuvette-based SPR assay system was also suitable for the monitoring of ligand-mediated nanoparticle binding, without convection or shear stress. We conclude that our SPR sandwich system allows the precise analysis of the binding of ligand-functionalized nanoparticles in real-time, and we thus establish SPR for the in vitro evaluation of ligand modifications for generating targeted nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aantibodies 3abinding capacity 3aconvection 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3aethylene 3agene therapy 3agenes 3ain vitro studies 3aligands 3amonitoring 3ananoparticles 3ashear stress 3asmall interfering RNA 3asurface plasmon resonance1 aVornicescu, Doru1 aBauer, Marius1 aFischer, Dagmar1 aKeusgen, Michael1 aAigner, Achim0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 July 15, v. 86, no. 14 p.6827-6835dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac402001q3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02174naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011000167520101500277592002801292650001101320650002001331650001701351650001501368650001501383653001801398653001601416653002801432653002301460700001701483700001801500700001801518700001301536700001301549700001201562700001501574773009201589856008601681852000901767655001201776IND60774031620221118233547.0220606e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077403162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2022.1234612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Shuang12aA regenerable and reducing false-positive fluorescent switch for detection of β-amyloid 1−42 oligomers  aThe conventional fluorescence analysis methods for disease identification are vulnerable to the restriction with false-positive. Here, a fluorescent switch with high efficiency and regeneration by the black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets-regulated was developed to overcome false-positive issue in the assay of β-amyloid₁₋₄₂ oligomers (Aβ) process. The Aβ was rapidly recognized using the fluorescent emitter‐nitrogen-doped carbon nanodots (N-CDs) under the regulation of BP nanosheets, while the N-CDs alone cannot recognize Aβ without the introduction of BP. The fluorescence analysis methods exhibited a wide sensing range of 0.25–15.0 ng/mL and a low detection limit of 83 pg/mL for Aβ analysis, which was superior to the reported fluorescence analysis method. Further, BP nanosheets were recycled, demonstrating the fluorescent switch with highly efficient, stable, and regenerable. This provides a new idea for developing high-efficiency and high-precision fluorescence detection platform.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3ananosheets 3aphosphorus 0aBP nanosheets 0aRegenerable 0aReducing false-positive 0aFluorescent switch1 aLi, Shunling1 aTang, Congkui1 aBai, Xiongfei1 aRan, Xin1 aQu, Qing1 aLi, Lei1 aYang, Long0 tTalanta.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 246 p.123461-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2022.1234613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03035naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002900145245011300174300001600287500000900303520174700312592002802059650001902087650001302106650002602119650001202145650002402157650001702181650001502198650001802213650002202231650001102253650001402264650001902278650001602297700001902313773021602332856008002548852000902628655001202637IND60665966020221117233746.0191028e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066596602DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2013.12.05032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoghadam, Fatemeh Sanaei10aEffects of Warming and Nutrient Enrichment on How Grazing Pressure Affects Leaf Litter–Colonizing Bacteria  ap. 851-858.  aepub  aIn view of current scenarios of global environmental change, we investigated the effects of warming and nutrient addition (N and P) on the impact of detritivores on density and community composition of leaf litter–colonizing bacteria in a freshwater environment. Within 10 d, detritivorous amphipods (Gammarus pulex) reduced bacterial numbers at 10°C and to a lesser degree at 15°C. However, the detritivore-induced decrease in bacterial numbers was compensated for by nutrient addition. After 31 d of incubation, amphipods reduced bacterial numbers only at 15°C, and nutrient addition did not counteract detritivore effects. Similarly, changes in bacterial numbers in response to nutrient addition were more pronounced at low temperature within 10 d, whereas nutrient effects were stronger at high temperature after 31 d of incubation. Thus, warming without detritivores did not affect bacterial numbers under low-nutrient conditions (10 d). When detritivores were present, warming increased bacterial density significantly just under high-nutrient conditions (P < 0.05). After 31 d of incubation, warming did not affect bacterial density in detritivore-free controls in both nutrient conditions and did not affect bacterial density in both nutrient conditions in the presence of detritivores. Warming exhibited a significant effect on the composition of litter-associated bacterial communities irrespective of nutrient load (P < 0.05), whereas nutrients had less consistent effects. We conclude that warming, and to a lesser degree nutrient enrichment, may have influence on grazer-induced changes in bacterial biofilm composition, whereas nutrient enrichment may mostly interfere with those processes that depend on bacterial density.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGammarus pulex 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abiofilm 3acommunity structure 3adetritivores 3afreshwater 3aglobal change 3agrazing intensity 3aleaves 3anutrients 3apollution load 3atemperature1 aZimmer, Martin0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2014 May, v. 43, no. 3 p.851-858dThe American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2013.12.05033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005000151245013700201520166800338592002802006650000802034650001502042650001402057650002602071650003802097650001102135650002102146653001602167653001002183653001102193653001102204653001502215653001402230653002502244700005302269700001902322773009202341856008602433852000902519655001202528IND60774031720221118233512.0220606e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077403172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2022.1234692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2226-591812aA simple and versatile CRISPR/Cas12a-based immunosensing platform: Towards attomolar level sensitivity for small protein diagnostics  aRecent advances in CRISPR/Cas biosensing have led to impressive performance in sensitivity, specificity, and speed for nucleic acid detection. However, the remarkable advantages (such as universality, ultralow, attomolar detection limits) of CRISPR/Cas biosensing systems are limited in testing non-nucleic acid targets. Herein, by synthesizing a functional hybrid conjugate of antibody and single strand DNA oligonucleotide, we had successfully demonstrated the capability to integrate CRISPR/Cas12a-based signal amplification into different types of immunoassay schemes without the need for any additional recognition molecule or molecular synthesis during the detection process, thus providing a simple but generally applicable approach to improve the conventional immunoassays with attomolar sensitivity for small protein detections, referred as the CRISPR-based Universal Immunoassay Signal Enhancer (CRUISE). CRUISE is capable of being integrated into various immunoassays either through the primary antibody or the secondary antibody, with sensitivity down to 1 fg mL⁻¹ (∼50 aM) and 6 logs of linear range for detecting cytokines, such as IFN-γ and EGFR, under 3–4 h. It has a 10³ times higher sensitivity compared to a commercial IFN-γ ELISA kit, but uses the same experimental scheme. The same 1 fg mL⁻¹ sensitivity along with 6 logs of linear range was realized for IFN-γ detection in human plasma samples. We are expecting that our CRUISE provides an alternative but simple, user-friendly and effective strategy for those who rely on the use of immunoassays, while struggling with the limits of their sensitivity or detection ranges.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aantibodies 3acytokines 3adiagnostic techniques 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahumans 3aoligonucleotides 0aImmunoassay 0aELISA 0aCRISPR 0aCas12a 0aAntibodies 0aUniversal 0aSignal amplification1 aDeng, Fei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5606-02781 aGoldys, Ewa M.0 tTalanta.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 246 p.123469-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2022.1234693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03580naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245012200161300001500283520160500298592002801903650002401931650002001955650001601975650001801991650002802009650001802037650003002055650001902085650002302104650001202127650001402139650002302153650001002176650002102186650001002207650002002217650002302237650001102260650002502271650001402296650001502310650003202325650001502357650001702372650004102389650001602430650001602446650001802462650001302480650001002493650001002503650002202513650001102535650001702546650000902563650001902572650001102591651001002602700001802612700002202630700002802652773010302680856007802783852000902861655001202870IND60132543120221117224455.0150505e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013254312DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2013002272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSunar, Kiran10aBiocontrol efficacy and plant growth promoting activity of Bacillus altitudinis isolated from Darjeeling hills, India  ap. 91-104.  aA total of 18 bacterial isolates were obtained from the rhizosphere of Sechium edule growing in the lower foothills of Darjeeling, India. The bacterial isolates were tested for PGPR traits in vitro such as phosphate solubilization, HCN, siderophore, IAA, chitinase, protease production as well as inhibition of pthytopathogens. Of all the bacterial isolates, one bacterium designated as BRHS/S‐73 was found to possess all the tested characters which was identified on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis as Bacillus altitudinis and was selected for in vivo studies. A significant improvement in growth measured in terms of increase in root length, shoot length, and increase in root and shoot biomass was observed when seeds of Vigna radiata, Cicer arietinum, and Glycine max were bacterized prior to sowing in field condition. Besides, the bacterium could also solubilize soil phosphate. Apart form growth promotion, root rot disease of Vigna radiata caused by Thanatephorus cucumeris was also significantly reduced by 74% when the bacterium was applied to the rhizosphere prior to pathogen challenge. The biocontrol efficacy of the bacterium was found to be 66.6% even after 30 days of pathogen inoculation. Activities of key defense related enzymes such as phenylalanine ammonia lyase, peroxidase, β‐1,3‐glucanase, and chitinase in both roots and leaves of treated plants were also enhanced. Results clearly suggest that B. altitudinis (BRHS/S‐73) is a potential PGPR which can be used as efficient microorganism for enhancement of plant growth and suppression of fungal disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aCicer arietinum 3aGlycine max 3aSechium edule 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3aVigna radiata 3abeneficial microorganisms 3abeta-glucanase 3abiological control 3abiomass 3achitinase 3afungal antagonists 3afungi 3agrowth promotion 3ahills 3ain vivo studies 3aindole acetic acid 3aleaves 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3aperoxidase 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3aphosphates 3aplant growth 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aproteinases 3arhizosphere 3aribosomal RNA 3aroot rot 3aroots 3aseeds 3asequence analysis 3ashoots 3asiderophores 3asoil 3asolubilization 3asowing 3aIndia1 aDey, Pannalal1 aChakraborty, Usha1 aChakraborty, Bishwanath0 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2015 Jan., v. 55, no. 1 p.91-104dAkademie-Verlagx0233-111X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2013002273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245011600179300001600295520168100311592002801992650000902020650001302029650002202042650002002064650001602084650001902100650002402119650001002143650001102153650001802164650002102182650001602203650001402219650001402233700002302247700002102270700002402291773012802315856008202443852000902525655001202534IND60089410020221122101659.0141102e20110624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008941002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.05.1272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdel-Bakky, Mohamed Sadek10aTissue factor dependent liver injury causes release of retinoid receptors (RXR-α and RAR-α) as lipid droplets  ap. 146-151.  aHepatic stellate cells (HSC) store retinoids and upon activation differentiate into myofibroblast-like cells, a process whereby they lose their retinoid-containing lipid droplets. We reported earlier, activation of tissue factor (TF) in our MCT/LPS hepatotoxicity model. We now report the involvement of TF in the release of retinoid receptors RAR-α and RXR-α as accumulated lipid droplet during monocrotaline/lipopolysaccharide (MCT/LPS)-liver injury. Constitutive expression of RAR-α was observed in HSCs and endothelial cells of bile duct and portal vein, while expression of RXR-α was observed in certain pericentral hepatocytes and HSCs. Administration of sub-toxic doses of MCT or LPS strongly increased TF and RXR-α but not RAR-α expressions in HSCs and hepatocytes. However MCT/LPS co-treatment showed insoluble droplets containing RAR-α and RXR-α in the vicinity of the necrotic areas. Blocking TF with TF antisense oligonucleotides (TF-AS ODN) led to normal hepatocyte expression of RXR-α and upregulated the expression of RAR-α in HSCs. This study shows clear evidence of in vivo release of RAR-α and RXR-α as insoluble lipid droplets in liver injury. It is possible that these insoluble droplets of RAR-α and RXR-α could be used as markers for liver injury in general and activation of HSCs in particular. RXR-α appears to be a more sensitive than RAR-α as it was affected by even the subtoxic doses of MCT or LPS. The fact that TF-AS treatment not only down-regulated TF but also obliterated the release of RAR-α and RXR-α as insoluble lipid droplets in hepatocytes points towards TF being an important regulatory molecule for RAR-α and RXR-α.  aPublisher supplied data 3abile 3adroplets 3aendothelial cells 3agene expression 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatotoxicity 3alipopolysaccharides 3aliver 3amodels 3amonocrotaline 3aoligonucleotides 3aportal vein 3areceptors 3aretinoids1 aHammad, Mohamed A.1 aWalker, Larry A.1 aAshfaq, Mohammad K.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 June 24, v. 410, no. 1 p.146-151dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.05.1273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01744naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011600160300001800276520072100294592002801015650001101043650002201054650001501076650002201091650001401113650001801127650002101145650000901166700001801175773014201193856007401335852000901409655001201418IND60668847520221120084702.0190920e20130312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066884752DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ta01312f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Zhensheng10aLayered titanate nanostructures and their derivatives as negative electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries  ap. 4403-4414.  aTi-based materials have been intensively investigated and considered as good potential negative electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high safety, superior rate capability and excellent cyclic stability.

The research purpose was to analyze the groundwater levels and to determine the effect of groundwater levels in relation to some soil chemical characters in tidal wetlands P17-5S Mulyasari village Delta Telang II Banyuasin. Indicators of potential land can be analyzed from parameters of variability of soil acidity, Al and Fe content, organic matter and phosphorus and nitrogen status of the soil. Managed limited area was the smallest unit of water management (tertiary plots). The decision was taken based on the dominant values of the hydro-physical and chemical characters. Input criteria design involved the nature of the soil, land use, and hydrology. The field study and analysis showed dominance in soil physical variability. Around 50% of hydraulic conductivity was classified rapid soil with soil acidity is relatively high, moderate nitrogen, low phosphorus, and moderate potassium. Based on these conditions, cropping pattern applied was rice-corn, rice-water melon, soil fertility can be improved through fertilization of N and P; increasing water gate in the tertiary plots, and the water management aimed to controlled drainage.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adrainage 3afarms 3agroundwater 3ahydraulic conductivity 3airrigation 3aland use 3amelons 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asoil fertility 3asoil pH 3avillages 3awater management 3awater table 3aIndonesia 0aVariability 0achemical characters 0atertiary plots 0atidal wetlands0 tSains Tanah: Jurnal Penelitian Ilmu Tanah dan Agroklimatologi.g2017 June, v. 14, no. 1 p.7-17dSebelas Maret UniversitywJournal:27757x2356-14247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.15608/stjssa.v14i1.6553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01982naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245007900162300001600241520086300257592002801120650001401148650002401162650001201186650001101198650001101209650001201220650001201232650001801244653001801262653001801280653001801298653002901316653000901345653001901354700001601373773010301389856008301492852000901575655001201584IND60479500120221119172142.0160122e20021101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047950012DNAL7 a10.1556/ABiol.53.2002.4.62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFehér, O.10aVisual event related potentials.

Sicyopterus lagocephalus is an amphidromous goby that has to change biome twice during its life cycle. The first biome shift occurs few hours after hatching in the river. The aim of the present study is to determine what external/environmental and internal/endocrine factors induce the transformation of freshwater prolarvae into marine larvae. First, we experimentally determined that the minimum salinity threshold inducing the transformation of all the prolarvae into marine larvae is 1.5, whereas a salinity of 0.2 induces the transformation of a few prolarvae. Similarly, an 18-h immersion in seawater before the return to freshwater is enough to induce the transformation of all the prolarvae into marine larvae, even though an immersion for 3 h can induce the transformation of a few prolarvae. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a simulated increase in the osmotic pressure of freshwater does not trigger the transformation of the prolarvae into marine larvae. Our study also reveals that among the various constituent salts of seawater, it is primarily NaCl and K⁺ that induce the transformation of the prolarvae, leading to the assumption that the membrane protein Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase is activated simultaneously with the prolarval transformation. Finally, we showed that thyroid hormones and cortisol are not involved in the prolarval transformation, leading to the conclusion that this first transformation in the life cycle of S. lagocephalus cannot be considered as a true metamorphosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSicyopterus lagocephalus 3acortisol 3aecosystems 3afish 3afreshwater 3ahatching 3alarvae 3ametamorphosis 3aontogeny 3aosmotic pressure 3apotassium 3arivers 3asalinity 3aseawater 3asodium chloride 3asodium-potassium-exchanging ATPase 3athyroid hormones1 aCausse, Romain1 aWerner, Ugo1 aTeichert, Nils1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8873-96131 aRousseau, Karine1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6634-79880 tAquatic ecology.g2020 Mar., v. 54, no. 1 p.163-180dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870034x1386-25887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-019-09734-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01836naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245010000167300001800267520077100285592002801056650002101084650000901105650002201114650001701136650002701153650003301180650001901213700002101232700002501253700002501278773011101303856007501414852000901489655001201498IND60529650120221120185748.0160717e20140715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052965012DNAL7 a10.1021/ac500021h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAppalaneni, Krishnaveni10aSingle Fiber Identification with Nondestructive Excitation–Emission Spectral Cluster Analysis  ap. 6774-6780.  aIdentification methods for single textile fibers are in demand for forensic applications, and nondestructive methods with minimal pretreatment have the greatest potential for utility. Excitation–emission luminescence data provide a three-dimensional matrix for comparison of single-fiber dyes, and these data are enhanced by principal component analysis and comparison of fibers using a statistical figure of merit. No dye extraction methods are required to sample the spectra from a single fiber. This approach has been applied to the analysis of single fibers to compare closely matched dye pairs, acid blue (AB) 25 and 41 and direct blue (DB) 1 and 53. In all cases, the accuracy of fiber identification was high and no false positive identifications were made.  aPublisher supplied data 3acluster analysis 3adyes 3aforensic sciences 3aluminescence 3anondestructive methods 3aprincipal component analysis 3atextile fibers1 aHeider, Emily

The excellent specific capacitance, energy and power densities (∼500 F g⁻¹, 44 W h kg⁻¹ and 31 kW kg⁻¹) coupled with long cycle life, excellent short response time, and low equivalent series resistance clearly indicate that this new material has great potential for the development of low-cost and ‘green’ aqueous AECs that operate at high energy and power densities. Interestingly, the energy density of the GO/CoTPyzPz//GOCB based AEC falls within the range usually observed for nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries (30–100 W h kg⁻¹), but more importantly, shows better power performance than NiMH batteries (0.25–1 kW kg⁻¹) widely used in hybrid vehicles such as Toyota Prius and Honda Insight.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acapacitance 3acobalt 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrides 3anickel 3asodium sulfate 3asoot 3avehicles (equipment)1 aOzoemena, Kenneth I.1 aJafta, Charl J.1 aKobayashi, Nagao1 aSong, Yang1 aTong, Dennis1 aChen, Shaowei1 aOyama, Munetaka0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2013 Jan. 29, v. 1, no. 8 p.2821-2826dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ta01325h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02984naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245014000200300002000340520143400360592002801794650001101822650001101833650001501844650001101859650002201870650001301892650002201905650001901927650003101946650001201977650001201989650001602001653002702017653001802044653002102062653002102083700001502104700001502119700001502134700001502149700005402164700005602218773014102274856007802415852000902493655001202502IND60685552420221119163431.0200304e20200212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068555242DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b220812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Cuiping1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1186-323410aBoost Anion Storage Capacity Using Conductive Polymer as a Pseudocapacitive Cathode for High-Energy and Flexible Lithium Ion Capacitors  ap. 10479-10489.  aCurrent lithium ion capacitors (LICs) have been severely plagued by the insufficient anion storage capacity of porous carbon. This work reports the exploration of conductive polyaniline (PANi) as an anion intercalation cathode to enhance the PF₆– storage via fast doping/undoping reactions. The PANi is electrodeposited on an electrospun carbon nanofiber (CNF) textile (denoted as PANi@CNF), which not only provides a robust support for PANi to increase its pseudocapacity but also renders a free-standing architecture for flexible devices. The PANi@CNF composite with a dominant capacitive storage characteristic reveals high specific capacities of 158.5 mAh gPANᵢ–¹ at 1 A g–¹ and 118.5 mAh gPANᵢ–¹ even at 20 A g–¹, which significantly surpasses state-of-the-art porous carbons. First-principle calculations revealed the coordination of PF₆– anions with −NH groups of PANi⁺ via F atoms through ion-dipole electrostatic interaction, which are accompanied by electron transfer. By pairing with CNF as an anode, a thin and flexible LIC was assembled, which achieves maximum energies of 106.5 Wh kg–¹ under 769.0 W kg–¹ and 64.5 Wh kg–¹ under a super high power of 15087.1 W kg–¹, together with an impressive cycling stability of 70.3% after 9000 cycles at 10 A g–¹. These findings provide a facile strategy for high-energy and flexible LICs via anion storage pseudocapacitive materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3aanodes 3acapacitors 3acarbon 3acarbon nanofibers 3acathodes 3aelectron transfer 3aelectroplating 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afabrics 3alithium 3apolyaniline 0alithium ion capacitors 0aanion storage 0aflexible devices 0acarbon nanofiber1 aTong, Jing1 aTang, Xiao1 aZhou, Dong1 aDuan, Huan1 aLi, Baohua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5559-57671 aWang, Guoxiu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4295-85780 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Feb. 12, v. 12, no. 9 p.10479-10489dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b220813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245011300165300001800278520167000296592002801966650001601994650001402010650002602024650003702050650001702087650001302104650001102117650003302128650002202161700002202183773011102205856007502316852000902391655001202400IND60529650220221120165132.0160717e20140715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052965022DNAL7 a10.1021/ac50006192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHodoroaba, Vasile-Dan10aGaining Improved Chemical Composition by Exploitation of Compton-to-Rayleigh Intensity Ratio in XRF Analysis  ap. 6858-6864.  aThe high specificity of the coherent (Rayleigh), as well as incoherent (Compton) X-ray scattering to the mean atomic number of a specimen to be analyzed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), is exploited to gain more information on the chemical composition. Concretely, the evaluation of the Compton-to-Rayleigh intensity ratio from XRF spectra and its relation to the average atomic number of reference materials via a calibration curve can reveal valuable information on the elemental composition complementary to that obtained from the reference-free XRF analysis. Particularly for matrices of lower mean atomic numbers, the sensitivity of the approach is so high that it can be easily distinguished between specimens of mean atomic numbers differing from each other by 0.1. Hence, the content of light elements which are “invisible” for XRF, particularly hydrogen, or of heavier impurities/additives in light materials can be calculated “by difference” from the scattering calibration curve. The excellent agreement between such an experimental, empirical calibration curve and a synthetically generated one, on the basis of a reliable physical model for the X-ray scattering, is also demonstrated. Thus, the feasibility of the approach for given experimental conditions and particular analytical questions can be tested prior to experiments with reference materials. For the present work a microfocus X-ray source attached on an SEM/EDX (scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) system was used so that the Compton-to-Rayleigh intensity ratio could be acquired with EDX spectral data for improved analysis of the elemental composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aadditives 3aelemental composition 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afluorescence 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspectral analysis1 aRackwitz, Vanessa0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 July 15, v. 86, no. 14 p.6858-6864dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac50006193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245014000161300001400301520154500315592002801860650002301888650002401911650002101935650002401956650001101980650002501991650002402016650002502040650001602065650001402081650004502095650000902140700002402149700002602173773010202199856007802301852000902379655001202388IND60132543620221117224447.0150505e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013254362DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2013008672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRai, Sandhya10aDynamics of soil diazotrophic community structure, diversity, and functioning during the cropping period of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum)  ap. 62-73.  aThe soil sampled at different growth stages along the cropping period of cotton were analyzed using various molecular tools: restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), terminal restriction length polymorphism (T‐RFLP), and cloning‐sequencing. The cluster analysis of the diazotrophic community structure of early sampled soil (0, 15, and 30 days) was found to be more closely related to each other than the later sampled one. Phylogenetic and diversity analysis of sequences obtained from the first (0 Day; C0) and last soil sample (180 day; C180) confirmed the data. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that C0 was having more unique sequences than C180 (presence of γ‐Proteobacteria exclusively in C0). A relatively higher richness of diazotrophic community sequences was observed in C0 (SACE: 30.76; SCₕₐₒ₁: 20.94) than C180 (SACE: 18.00; SCₕₐₒ₁: 18.00) while the evenness component of Shannon diversity index increased from C0 (0.97) to C180 (1.15). The impact of routine agricultural activities was more evident based on diazotrophic activity (measured by acetylene reduction assay) than its structure and diversity. The nitrogenase activity of C0 (1264.85 ± 35.7 ηmol of ethylene production g⁻¹dry soil h⁻¹) was statistically higher when compared to all other values (p < 0.05). There was no correlation found between diazotrophic community structure/diversity and N₂fixation rates. Thus, considerable functional redundancy of nifH was concluded to be existing at the experimental site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aacetylene reduction 3acluster analysis 3acommunity structure 3acotton 3adevelopmental stages 3aethylene production 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3anitrogenase 3aphylogeny 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asoil1 aSingh, Dileep Kumar1 aAnnapurna, Kannepalli0 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2015 Jan., v. 55, no. 1 p.62-73dAkademie-Verlagx0233-111X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2013008673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003600147245012800183506002800311520119400339592002801533506003701561650001001598650000901608651001201617653004201629653003601671653006101707700003901768773011001807856008201917852000901999655001202008IND60785683820221207053058.0190110e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078568382DNAL7 a10.15393/j4.art.2018.51232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMikalajevič, Mialik Aliaksandr10aCultural flora of the central part of the Belorussian Polesje: modern composition, botanical diversity, economic importance  aResource is Open Access  aIn the article, an assessment of the diversity of the cultural flora was carried out for a separate natural region of Belarus (central part of the Belorussian Polesje). Currently, 974 species of vascular plants are cultivated here in conditions of open soil. They are combined into 536 genera and 128 families. Among the cultivated species, 106 taxa are aboriginal, and 868 are adventitive with respect to the flora of the southern part of Belarus. These species have different ecological and biological properties, origin, time and method of drift into the territory under consideration, which explains their different economic significance and use. The most numerous (802 species) are now ornamental plants, the group of medicinal plants includes 266 species, food – 216, technical – 143, etc. A number of species have a negative economic significance: 121 taxa can exhibit the properties of weeds, and 66 – are poisonous to humans and animals. Modern trends in the development of the cultural flora of the central part of the Belorussian Polesje are manifested in the constant increase in the number of cultivated species due to the introduction of new (mainly ornamental) plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aflora 3asoil 3aBelarus 0aБелорусское Полесье 0aкультурная флора 0aхозяйственные группы растений1 aAliaksejevič, Zhytsianioŭ Leanid0 tHortus botanicus.g2018 Dec., v. 13, no. 1dPetrozavodsk State UniversitywJournal:27791x1994-38497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15393/j4.art.2018.51233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02153naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245009800162300001400260520097700274592002801251650001701279650001701296650002001313650001101333650001001344650002101354650002701375650002301402650001201425650001301437650002401450651001101474700001801485700001901503700001701522700001901539700001601558773010001574856004801674852000901722655001201731IND4465196320221118060128.0120727e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446519632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10333-011-0258-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, MingDaw,12aA spatial aggregation index for effective fallow decision in paddy irrigation demand planning  ap. 31-39.  aAs irrigation demands usually take the largest share of water supply, paddy fallow is considered as a drought relieving measure in some Asian paddy growing countries by transferring the water saved to the municipal and industrial sectors. But the relationship between fallow area and irrigation demand reduction is not necessarily linear, there may be more than dozens combinations of fallow farm that can meet the same amount of irrigation demand reduction requirement. The Joint Count Statistics (JCS), an index commonly used in spatial analysis to measure the spatial coherence among cells was modified as a spatial aggregation index for evaluating the irrigation demand reduction effectiveness from a spatial perspective. This Modified JCS is supposed to identify the degree of spatial aggregation by taking underlying irrigation network into considerations. The modified JCS was proved to be effective to identify better fallow pattern through a case study in Taiwan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3acase studies 3adecision making 3afallow 3afarms 3airrigation rates 3airrigation requirement 3airrigation systems 3apaddies 3aplanning 3apublic water supply 3aTaiwan1 aLin, Mei-Chun1 aLin, Chun-Hung1 aWang, Shifu,1 aWen, Tzai-Hung1 aXie, Xinyi,0 tPaddy and water environment.g2012 Mar., v. 10, no. 1 p.31-39dSpringer-Verlagx1611-24907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10333-011-0258-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02864naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005200150245018800202300001600390520116500406592002801571650001901599650002001618650002301638650002301661650001601684650001701700650001101717650001101728650002901739650001901768650002501787650001401812650003401826650001601860650002401876650002401900700001201924700001101936700001901947700001901966700002001985700001702005700001502022700005602037773017102093856008502264852000902349655001202358IND60765559520221117010021.0220130e20220103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076555952DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.1c009502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Qi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3563-056910aSalidroside Promotes Sensitization to Doxorubicin in Human Cancer Cells by Affecting the PI3K/Akt/HIF Signal Pathway and Inhibiting the Expression of Tumor-Resistance-Related Proteins  ap. 196-204.  aSalidroside (Sal), the major active constituent of Rhodiola rosea L., is considered as a potential pro-drug with various activities; however, its role in tumor therapy is not clear. Here, we demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that Sal enhanced the inhibitory activity of doxorubicin (DOX) in drug-resistant cancer cell lines. Our results showed that combination drug treatment (Sal and DOX) significantly decreased cell proliferation, migration, and motility. Besides biological validation, a luciferase-labeled animal tumor xenograft model and bioluminescence imaging (BLI) were applied for assessing the tumor progression. Sal combined with DOX inhibited the growth of HeLa-ADR-luc cells in vivo and downregulated the DOX-induced high expression of MDR1. Also, Sal downregulated the Bcl-2, MMP-2, MMP-9, PI3K, and AKT and upregulated BAX proteins. Sal demonstrated high safety and cardiac protection activity. We discovered that Sal enhances DOX sensitivity through the regulation of PI3K/Akt/HIF-1α and DOX-induced resistance pathways. Our results suggest that Sal could be a novel chemosensitization agent for the treatment of multi-drug-resistance tumors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodiola rosea 3abioluminescence 3acell proliferation 3achemosensitization 3adoxorubicin 3adrug therapy 3ahumans 3amodels 3amultiple drug resistance 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasm progression 3aneoplasms 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3asalidroside 3asignal transduction 3axenotransplantation1 aNie, Xu1 aLi, Li1 aLiu, Hui Fang,1 aPeng, Yang-Yao1 aZhou, Wang-Ting1 aHu, Xiao-Jia1 aXu, Xin-Yi1 aChen, Xue-Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3898-98920 tJournal of natural products.g2022 Jan. 03, v. 85, no. 1 p.196-204dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosywJournal:jnl11422x1520-60257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.1c009503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245014300181300001600324520119300340592002801533650002501561650002501586650002101611650001601632650001401648650001101662650001401673650002801687650001601715650001001731650001201741650001401753653002501767653001601792653001401808653001501822653001601837653000701853653001001860653001001870653001001880653000901890700003401899700002101933700002801954700002701982773012402009856008502133852000902218655001202227IND60543329720221118185315.0190410e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054332972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2015.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández, Ismaél Gatica10aMelatonin in Arabidopsis thaliana acts as plant growth regulator at low concentrations and preserves seed viability at high concentrations  ap. 191-196.  aSince the discovery of melatonin in plants, several roles have been described for different species, organs, and developmental stages. Arabidopsis thaliana, being a model plant species, is adequate to contribute to the elucidation of the role of melatonin in plants. In this work, melatonin was monitored daily by UHPLC-MS/MS in leaves, in order to study its diurnal accumulation as well as the effects of natural and artificial light treatments on its concentration. Furthermore, the effects of exogenous application of melatonin to assess its role in seed viability after heat stress and as a regulator of growth and development of vegetative tissues were evaluated. Our results indicate that melatonin contents in Arabidopsis were higher in plants growing under natural radiation when compared to those growing under artificial conditions, and its levels were not diurnally-regulated. Exogenous melatonin applications prolonged seed viability after heat stress conditions. In addition, melatonin applications retarded leaf senescence. Its effects as growth promoter were dose and tissue–dependent; stimulating root growth at low concentrations and decreasing leaf area at high doses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3adevelopmental stages 3agrowth promotion 3aheat stress 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3amelatonin 3aplant growth substances 3aroot growth 3aseeds 3atissues 3aviability 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0aGermination 0aMelatonin 0aSenescence 0aUHPLC-MS/MS 0aMT 0aMS/MS 0aUHPLC 0aFv/Fm 0aPSII1 aGomez, Federico José Vicente1 aCerutti, Soledad1 aArana, María Verónica1 aSilva, María Fernanda0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2015 Sept., v. 94 p.191-196dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2015.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02058naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245008500161300001400246520078300260592002801043650002201071650001201093650001501105650001801120650001001138650001301148650001201161650002501173650002301198650001801221650002701239650001101266700001901277700001801296700001701314700001701331700001801348700001301366700001601379773012601395856008201521852000901603655001201612IND60089410620221120204834.0141102e20110624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008941062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.05.1012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Juan10aHypoxia induces beta-amyloid in association with death of RGC-5 cells in culture  ap. 40-44.  aBeta-amyloid (Aβ) derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been associated with retinal degeneration in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and glaucoma. This study examined whether hypoxia exposure induces Aβ accumulation in RGC-5 cells. While levels of APP mRNA and protein significantly increased in the cells, elevated abundance of Aβ was also observed in cells and culture medium between 12 or 24 and 48h after 5% O₂ hypoxia treatment. Additionally, there is a close relationship between induction of APP and Aβ and intracellular accumulation of ROS along with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential followed by the death of RGC-5 cells in culture under hypoxia. These results suggest a possible involvement of APP and Aβ in the death of RGCs challenged by hypoxia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aamyloid 3acell death 3aculture media 3adeath 3aglaucoma 3ahypoxia 3amacular degeneration 3amembrane potential 3amessenger RNA 3amitochondrial membrane 3aoxygen1 aDong, Zhizhang1 aLiu, Bingqian1 aZhuo, Yehong1 aSun, Xuerong1 aYang, Zhikuan1 aGe, Jian1 aTan, Zhiqun0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 June 24, v. 410, no. 1 p.40-44dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.05.1013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010900159300001800268520117000286592002801456650002201484650003701506650001501543650002101558650002301579650001501602650002801617650002101645650001501666650001301681650000901694650001301703650001301716650003301729650003701762700001701799700001401816700001801830773014201848856007401990852000902064655001202073IND60668848220221120063535.0190920e20130212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066884822DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ta01351g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shiming10aFe–N doped carbon nanotube/graphene composite: facile synthesis and superior electrocatalytic activity  ap. 3302-3308.  aLow cost alternatives to the expensive and scarce Pt to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acid media are essential for the proton-exchange-membrane (PEM) fuel cells to become economically viable. Chemically doped nanocarbons are among the most promising candidates in this regard. We report the facile synthesis and superior electrocatalytic activity of an Fe–N doped nanocarbon composite of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown on/between graphene sheets. The structure and composition of the composite is characterized by using a variety of techniques including SEM, TEM, N₂ adsorption/desorption isotherms, XPS, XRD, and Mössbauer spectroscopy. It is shown that the in situ growth of CNTs in the presence of graphene sheets not only produces a tubes-on/between-sheets architecture that enhances the dispersion of CNTs and graphene sheets, but also leads to optimized doping and coordination of nitrogen and Fe which favour the ORR. The composite can catalyze the ORR much more efficiently than either of the single materials containing only CNTs or graphene synthesized under similar conditions, and similarly to Pt/C in both alkaline and acid media.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalytic activity 3adesorption 3aeconomic sustainability 3aelectrochemistry 3afuel cells 3agraphene 3airon 3anitrogen 3aplatinum 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aZhang, Heyou1 aLiu, Qing1 aChen, Shengli0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2013 Feb. 12, v. 1, no. 10 p.3302-3308dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ta01351g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04192naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245014200212500002200354520218600376592002802562650001602590650002702606650001302633650001402646650001402660650001202674650001702686650001102703650002002714653001202734653002902746653005102775653002002826653003402846700006002880700006002940700006503000700005703065700005603122700001803178700005403196700006303250700006103313700006103374773015903435856008303594852000903677655001203686IND60787554020221119170316.0220906e20220724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078755402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jand.2022.07.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShrodes, Jennifer C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3329-811X10aFeasibility of Cooking Matters for Diabetes: A 6-week Randomized, Controlled Cooking and Diabetes Self-Management Education Intervention  aPre-press version  aDiabetes self-management education and support is the cornerstone of diabetes care, yet <10% of adults with diabetes manage their condition successfully. Feasible interventions are needed urgently. Our aim was to assess the feasibility of a cooking intervention with food provision and diabetes self-management education and support. This was a waitlist-controlled, randomized trial. Thirteen adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who participated in Cooking Matters for Diabetes (CMFD) participated in 2 focus groups. CMFD was adapted from Cooking Matters and the American Diabetes Association’s diabetes self-management education and support intervention into a 6-week program with weekly lesson–aligned food provisions. Feasibility was evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively along the following 5 dimensions: demand, acceptability, implementation, practicality, and limited efficacy. Two coders extracted focus group themes with 100% agreement after iterative analysis, resulting in consensus. Administrative data were analyzed via descriptive statistics. Mean (SD) age of focus group participants was 57 (14) years; 85% identified as female; 39% identified as White; 46% identified as Black; and income ranged from <$5,000 per year (15%) to $100,000 or more per year (15%). Mean (SD) baseline hemoglobin A1c was 8.6% (1.2%). Mean attendance in CMFD was 5 of 6 classes (83%) among all participants. Demand was high based on attendance and reported intervention utilization and was highest among food insecure participants, who were more likely to report using the food provisions and recipes. Acceptability was also high; focus groups revealed the quality of instructors and interaction with peers as key intervention strengths. Participant ideas for implementation refinement included simplifying recipes, lengthening class sessions, and offering more food provision choices. Perceived effects of the intervention included lower hemoglobin A1c and body weight and improvements to health-related quality of life. The CMFD intervention was feasible according to the measured principles of demand, acceptability, implementation, practicality, and limited efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3adescriptive statistics 3adiabetes 3adietetics 3aeducation 3afemales 3afocus groups 3aincome 3aquality of life 0aCooking 0aType 2 diabetes mellitus 0aDiabetes self-management education and support 0aFood insecurity 0aSocial determinants of health1 aWilliams, Amaris1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0805-89981 aNolan, Timiya S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6700-31051 aRadabaugh, Jessica N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8867-35061 aBraun, Ashlea1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3538-66311 aKline, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6183-33031 aZhao, Songzhu1 aBrock, Guy1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5317-079X1 aGarner, Jennifer A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9735-294X1 aSpees, Colleen K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6293-28991 aJoseph, Joshua J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9169-82610 tJournal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.g2022 July 24, dElsevier Inc.aAcademy of Nutrition and DieteticswJournal:J000001156x2212-26727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2022.07.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245011800162300001600280500000900296520163000305592002801935650002001963650002101983650001802004650001302022650003302035650001902068650002402087650001502111650001502126650001502141650001502156650002202171650001702193650002602210650001802236650002102254650002102275650001802296650001602314650001602330700001502346700001702361700001902378700002002397773021702417856008002634852000902714655001202723IND60665967220221117233925.0191028e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066596722DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2014.04.01542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, T.

However, the impacts of these practices on water quality must be assessed to ensure environmental sustainability. We conducted a study to determine phosphorus (P) loss in tile drainage as affected by two types of soil conditioners (yard waste compost and swine manure compost) and water table management (free drainage and controlled drainage with subirrigation) in a clay loam soil under corn–soybean rotation in a 4-yr period from 1999 to 2003. Tile drainage flows were monitored and sampled on a year-round continuous basis using on-site auto-sampling systems. Water samples were analyzed for dissolved reactive P (DRP), particulate P (PP), and total P (TP). Substantially greater concentrations and losses of DRP, PP, and TP occurred with swine manure compost than with control and yard waste compost regardless of water table management. Compared with free drainage, controlled drainage with subirrigation was an effective way to reduce annual and cumulative losses of DRP, PP, and TP in tile drainage through reductions in flow volume and P concentration with control and yard waste compost but not with swine manure compost. Both DRP and TP concentrations in tile drainage were well above the water quality guideline for P, affirming that subsurface loss of P from fine-textured soils can be one critical source for freshwater eutrophication. Swine manure compost applied as a soil conditioner must be optimized by taking water quality impacts into consideration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay loam soils 3acomposted manure 3acrop rotation 3adrainage 3aenvironmental sustainability 3aeutrophication 3afine-textured soils 3afreshwater 3aguidelines 3aphosphorus 3apig manure 3asoil conditioners 3asoil texture 3asubsurface irrigation 3atile drainage 3atotal phosphorus 3awater management 3awater quality 3awater table 3ayard wastes1 aTan, C.

This has now been attempted for the Knysna estuarine bay in the Garden Route National Park, South Africa, an important site for one vulnerable and declining seagrass, Cape dwarf-eelgrass (Nanozostera capensis), and for several associated animals. Although spanning a salinity range of <5–35, the seagrass beds of this estuary contained a unitary fauna with local variation in frequency and abundance of the various species. Faunal biodiversity was highest along the main estuarine channel in the marine-influenced region and declined both upstream and into the sheltered peripheral zones, overall faunal abundance being inversely correlated with species diversity (though not with species richness). This pattern results in the beds around the 4 km shoreline of a single island near the mouth supporting 91 % of the total macrobenthic invertebrate species present in the system. This situation is discussed in relation to such data as are available from other comparable systems and to the conservation of estuarine seagrass faunal biodiversity. It is concluded that in general and with caveats for some individual species of concern where conservation resources are limited attention would most profitably be focused on the seagrass meadows of downstream estuarine areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aestuaries 3afauna 3agardens 3aislands 3anational parks 3asalinity 3aspecies diversity 3aSouth Africa0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2013 Feb., v. 22, no. 2 p.357-372dSpringer-Verlagx0960-31157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-012-0414-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010900169520136500278592002801643650002201671650001501693650001601708650002501724650002001749650003801769650000901807650001301816650002501829650001301854650001501867650003001882650001301912653001301925653001401938653003001952653001401982653001401996653002502010700001802035700002202053700001802075773010702093856008602200852000902286655001202295IND60774033020221118233438.0220606e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077403302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2022.1234842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aҪimen, Duygu10aMolecular imprinted nanoparticle assisted surface plasmon resonance biosensors for detection of thrombin  aIn this study, we designed a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensors based on molecular imprinting to detect low amounts of thrombin directly in a short time, both in thrombin aqueous solutions and in patient serum samples. For this purpose, the thrombin imprinted and non-imprinted SPR biosensors were prepared by integrating the synthesized thrombin imprinted and non-imprinted nanoparticles on the allyl mercaptan modified gold SPR chip surface. The kinetic studies were performed with a thrombin concentration range from 0.1 to 400 pM with a detection limit of approximately 0.017 pM in thrombin aqueous solution. Morever, the limit of detection was found to be 0.033 pM in patient serum samples. When the selectivity of the thrombin imprinted SPR biosensors was compared with the competing molecules as bovine serum albumin and lysozyme, it was showed that the thrombin was 4.58 times and 3.99 times more selective than the bovine serum albumin and lysozyme molecules, respectively. The shelf life and reusability of the designed SPR biosensor showed that there was a 12.93% decrease in the performance according to the kinetic analyzes that performed after 8 months. In addition, thrombin detection from the patient serum samples was performed using both SPR biosensor and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods, and were calculated recoveries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3abovine serum albumin 3adetection limit 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agold 3alysozyme 3amolecular imprinting 3apatients 3ashelf life 3asurface plasmon resonance 3athrombin 0aThrombin 0aBiosensor 0aSurface plasmon resonance 0aBiomarker 0aDetection 0aMolecular Imprinting1 aBereli, Nilay1 aGunaydin, Serdar,1 aDenizli, Adil0 tTalanta.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 246 p.123484-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2022.1234843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03672naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245019000165300001600355520194800371592002802319650002002347650002102367650002402388650002502412650002102437650002102458650001302479650001302492650001302505650000902518650001702527650001602544650001502560650001802575650001402593650002302607650001602630650001402646650002102660650003602681650001102717650002702728650001402755650001202769650002002781650002502801650001402826700001902840700002002859773013602879856008203015852000903097655001203106IND60681935820221120141152.0200121e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068193582DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-019-01738-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaeed, Taiba10aStudies on single and double layered biocompatible encapsulation of somatic embryos in Albizia lebbeck and genetic homogeneity appraisal among synseed derived lines through ISSR markers  ap. 431-445.  aEmbryogenic synseeds were prepared in Albizia lebbeck by encapsulating cotyledon stage somatic embryos derived from in vitro maintained embryogenic cultures in different types of Ca-alginate beads. The germination rate of somatic embryos was affected significantly by the bead type, matrix composition and germination substrate. A matrix made of 3% Na₂-alginate complexed with 100 mM CaCl₂·2H₂O for a hardening period of 20 min provided uniform encapsulation of somatic embryo. Among different types of synseeds, type IIA, wherein somatic embryos encapsulated in a single layer of Ca-alginate matrix composed of MS medium supplemented with 2 g L⁻¹ activated charcoal and 1.0 µM gibberellic acid (GA₃) as reconstituted endosperm, was found to be the most efficient type having maximum germination rates (88.6 ± 0.51%). Incorporation of GA₃ in the alginate beads stimulated greater germination of somatic embryos as against GA₃ supplementation in the germination substrate. Further, viability studies on short term cold (4 °C) storage of different types of embryogenic synseeds revealed that double layered synseeds (DLS) were found comparatively more robust to withstand longer storage durations than single layered synseeds as evident by greater germination rates of the former after 4–8 weeks of refrigerated storage. Also, the elevated levels of antioxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase) and leaf proline content in the plantlets derived from DLS reveals the possible role of alginate coatings in conferring alleviation to low temperature stress generated during different storage durations. Similar Inter simple sequence repeat profiles of embryogenic synseeds derived plantlets and mother tree nullifies the possible occurrence of somaclones, thereby establishing the efficacy of synseed technology for clonal propagation of A. lebbeck germplasm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlbizia lebbeck 3aactivated carbon 3aantioxidant enzymes 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acalcium alginate 3acalcium chloride 3acatalase 3acharcoal 3acoatings 3acold 3acold storage 3acold stress 3acotyledons 3aencapsulation 3aendosperm 3agenetic similarity 3agermination 3agermplasm 3agibberellic acid 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3aleaves 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aplantlets 3aproline 3asomatic embryos 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aviability1 aShahzad, Anwar1 aSharma, Shiwali0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2020 Feb., v. 140, no. 2 p.431-445dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl33513x0167-68577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-019-01738-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245011100176300001600287520134800303592002801651650002701679650002401706650001101730650001701741650002501758650001401783650001501797650001601812650001001828650001001838650001301848650001101861650002801872650001201900650001401912650001701926650001201943650001301955650001201968650001801980650002001998653003502018653001302053653001602066653004802082700001702130700001702147773015402164856008202318852000902400655001202409IND60652417820221122212923.0190712e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065241782DNAL7 a10.1017/S17427584180001762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuxton, Thos.q(Thomas),10aBioactivity of cardanol against the rust red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae)  ap. 353-361.  aCashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) is an economically important by-product obtained from the cashew nut Anacardium occidentale L. The liquid has been found to be versatile with a wide range of uses, including as a raw material in the polymer industry, in the development of drugs (antioxidants) and in pest control. One important chemical component of CNSL known for its bioactivity is cardanol. We isolated (8Z,11Z)-3-(8,11,14-pentadecatrienyl)phenol, a cardanol from CNSL, and determined its insecticidal and progeny growth and development inhibition activities against Tribolium castaneum Hebst. We used a bioassay-guided approach for the isolation. Exposure to cardanol produced 80% mortality of adult T. castaneum in the insecticidal bioassay. In the progeny growth and development inhibition bioassay, 46.7% of larvae were killed, and only 20.7% of adults emerged without deformities after the cardanol treatment. The amount of isolated cardanol from the 1 g equivalent/ml extracted CNSL was found to be 36.55 mg with LC₅₀ value of 47.88 mg/ml and 13.28 mg/ml against adult T. castaneum and its larvae, respectively. We conclude that cardanol can potentially be useful in managing stored product insect pests, especially T. castaneum, but with the prerequisite that one should take much care when handling and when applying the compound.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnacardium occidentale 3aTribolium castaneum 3aadults 3aantioxidants 3abioactive properties 3abioassays 3abyproducts 3acashew nuts 3adrugs 3ahulls 3aindustry 3alarvae 3alethal concentration 50 3aliquids 3amortality 3apest control 3aphenols 3apolymers 3aprogeny 3araw materials 3astorage insects 0acashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) 0acardanol 0abioactivity 0a(8Z,11Z)-3-(8,11,14-pentadecatrienyl)phenol1 aOwusu, E.

The fungus Trichoderma reesei is a prolific producer of cellulases and hemicellulases, and intensive research efforts are ongoing to further increase strain efficiency by maximizing enzyme production levels and optimizing the produced enzyme cocktail. With the genome sequencing of T. reesei QM6a cellulase research has entered a new era. Whole-genome comparisons of hyperproducing strains provide new insights into the mechanisms relevant for cellulase gene expression. The recent discovery that this fungus is also susceptible to sexual crossing opens new possibilities for strain improvement by combining beneficial properties or crossing out deleterious ones. In this review we outline new strategies, tools and recent developments based on genomic and proteomic approaches that are now available to gain better insights into the cellulolytic enzyme machinery of T. reesei.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichoderma reesei 3abioethanol 3acost effectiveness 3acrossing 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3afungi 3agene expression 3agenomics 3aphytomass 3aproteomics 3asequence analysis1 aSeiboth, Bernhard0 tBiofuels.g2010 Mar. 1, v. 1, no. 2 p.343-354dFuture Science LtdwJournal:2219x1759-72777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4155/bfs.10.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03063naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245010700174300001600281520155400297592002801851650002101879650001501900650003101915650001601946650002301962650002401985650001402009650001302023650001202036650000702048650003402055650003402089650002702123650001502150650001502165653000902180653000902189653002102198653002402219653001702243700001702260700002202277700001302299700005502312773009102367856009002458852000902548655001202557IND60632898920221118043732.0191214e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063289892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Pingping10aEfficient removal of perfluorinated compounds from water using a regenerable magnetic activated carbon  ap. 187-194.  aAdsorption by powder activated carbon (PAC) is recognized as an efficient method for the removal of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in water, while the poor separation of spent PAC makes it difficult for further regeneration, increasing the treatment cost significantly. In this study, an ultrafine magnetic activated carbon (MAC) consisting of Fe3O4 and PAC was prepared by ball milling to remove PFCs from water efficiently. Increasing the percentage of Fe3O4 and balling milling time decreased its adsorption capacity for perfluoroctane sulfonate (PFOS), whereas increased the magnetic separation property to some degree. The optimized MAC was prepared with a Fe3O4 to PAC mass ratio of 1:3 after ball milling for 2 h, and the adsorption equilibriums of all the four PFCs on the optimal MAC were reached within less than 2 h, with the adsorption capacities of 1.63, 0.90, 0.33 and 0.21 mmol/g for PFOS, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), respectively. Increasing the solution pH hindered the adsorption of PFOS significantly when the pH was less than the zero potential point (around 6) of the MAC, due to the decreased electrostatic attraction. The spent MAC could be easily separated with a magnet and regenerated by a small volume of methanol, and the regenerated MAC could be reused for more than 5 time and remain stable adsorption capacity for PFOS after 3 cycles. This study provides useful insights into the removal of PFCs by separable magnetic PAC in wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aelectrostatic interactions 3airon oxides 3amagnetic materials 3amagnetic separation 3amagnetism 3amethanol 3amilling 3apH 3aperfluorohexane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3asulfonates 3awastewater 0aPFCs 0aPFOS 0aRapid adsorption 0aMagnetic separation 0aRegeneration1 aFang, Xiaolu1 aMaimaiti, Ayiguli1 aYu, Gang1 aDeng, Shubo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2211-006X0 tChemosphere.g2019 June, v. 224 p.187-194dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03558naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001900167245012700186300001600313500001500329520154900344592002801893650001801921650002101939650001101960650001001971650001701981650001201998650002202010650001002032650001302042650002602055650002402081650002502105650001202130650004002142650007002182650010402252650001302356650004102369650003902410650003102449650002402480650001302504650003002517650004602547650003502593650001502628650001702643653002502660700002302685700002202708700001802730773010302748856008402851852000902935655001202944IND4470397620221119163829.0141111e20120914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447039762DNAL7 a225515912pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.03.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerez-Boto, D.10aDynamics of populations of Campylobacter jejuni in two grandparent broiler breeder farms: Persistent vs. transient strains  ap. 204-211.  a2019-12-06  aThe objectives of the study were to characterize and investigate the populations of Campylobacter jejuni in two grandparent broiler breeder farms over four years. Caecal as well as farm environmental samples were obtained. Campylobacter isolates were characterized by macrorestriction profile (SmaI and KpnI-PFGE) and PCR-RFLP of the flaA gene. Susceptibility tests against seven antimicrobials were also performed. Birds were negative for Campylobacter spp. when they came to these two production farms (20 weeks), and most of the flocks remained uncolonized until they were 23 weeks old. Eighteen genotypes were characterized, with one of them (genotype 2) appearing and persisting over the study period in the two farms. In general, the strains exhibited high genetic stability, and most of them could be seen as transient in the farms, being substituted by other strains when their flock was substituted. Only one environmental sampling was positive for C. jejuni. Two different genotypes were characterized; one of them was isolated from the birds of that farm two years before. The susceptibility data point to the idea of an environmental source or reservoir of this genotype. Regarding the susceptibility of the populations, as other studies have shown, quinolone resistance (alone or combined with other resistances) was the most frequent: 68.5%. Quinolone- and multidrug-resistant strains are a matter of concern in public health. In conclusion, this survey shows the complexity of the study of the colonization of farms by C. jejuni.  aPublisher supplied data 3apublic health 3abroiler breeders 3aflocks 3afarms 3agrandparents 3asurveys 3agenetic stability 3agenes 3agenotype 3aanti-infective agents 3apopulation dynamics 3aCampylobacter jejuni 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aCampylobacter Infectionsxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aCampylobacter jejunixclassificationxdrug effectsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aChickens 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterialxgenetics 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field 2aEnvironmental Microbiology 2aFlagellinxgenetics 2aGenotype 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aPoultry Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPrevalence 2aTime Factors 0aantimicrobial agents1 aGarcia-Peña, F.J.1 aAbad-Moreno, J.C.1 aEcheita, M.A.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2012 Sept. 14, v. 159, no. 1-2 p.204-211dElsevier B.V.x0378-11357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.03.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03502naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010300166300001800269520149900287592002801786596005901814596004101873596004701914596004801961596008502009596007002094650001202164650001402176650001302190650001002203650002102213650001602234650001502250650002502265650001602290650002002306650001802326650002102344650001602365650001402381650001802395650001002413650001302423650002202436650001502458650001702473650002302490650001002513700001702523700001602540700001702556700001502573700005502588700001702643773012402660856008302784852000902867655001202876IND60646012920221120234940.0201028e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064601292DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-019-04775-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Cuiling10aIsolation and characterization of a novel seed-specific promoter from peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.)  ap. 3183-3191.  aPeanut, whose seeds are ideal bioreactors for the production of recombinant proteins and/or nutrient metabolites, is one of the most important crop species worldwide. As important molecular tools, seed-specific promoters (SSPs) can direct the expression of foreign proteins specifically in seeds to avoid constitutive expression that can damage plants. However, few SSPs have been identified from this species. In this study, we isolated a novel SSP (we named it AHSSP2) from peanut. Several cis-acting elements commonly found in SSPs, including 3 copies of RYREPEAT elements, were dispersed throughout the 1970-bp sequence of AHSSP2. The sequence was then substituted in place of the 35S promoter sequence in a pBI121 plasmid, which was subsequently transformed into Arabidopsis. Beta-glucuronidase (GUS) staining showed that AHSSP2 can drive GUS gene expression in the mature seeds of transgenic Arabidopsis, excluding within the testa. The cotyledons and hypocotyls of the germinating seeds of transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings also exhibited GUS activity, even after the seedlings became adult plants. No GUS activity was detected in nontransformed Arabidopsis at any stage. These results strongly suggested that AHSSP2 could drive the expression of foreign genes in a seed-specific manner. This study enriched SSP resources, and the results showed that AHSSP2 could be potentially utilized in peanut and other crop species to improve seed quality, such as modifications to seed oil content.  aPublisher supplied data  a31601336cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  ats201712080cTaishan Scholar funding  a2017LZN033cShandong elite variety project  a2017LZGC003cShandong elite variety project  a2016YQN17cYouth Science Foundation of Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences  a2016KF09cOpening Project of State Key Laboratory of Crop Biology 3apeanuts 3aseedlings 3aplasmids 3agenes 3apromoter regions 3ametabolites 3ahypocotyls 3arecombinant proteins 3abioreactors 3agene expression 3amature plants 3aArachis hypogaea 3aArabidopsis 3aseed oils 3alipid content 3atesta 3astaining 3atransgenic plants 3acotyledons 3aseed quality 3abeta-glucuronidase 3acrops1 aLi, Chunjuan1 aYan, Caixia1 aZhao, Xiaobo1 aWang, Juan1 aSun, Quanxi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4075-19551 aShan, Shihua0 tMolecular biology reports.g2019 June, v. 46, no. 3 p.3183-3191dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-019-04775-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01812naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245006800165300001800233520061300251592002800864650001100892650001400903650002300917650001100940650002800951650001300979650002000992650001401012653002101026653001401047653003301061653002101094700002301115700001801138700005701156700001801213773008101231856008101312852000901393655001201402IND60551469820221119192420.0161018e20150701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055146982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2015.02.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShibata, Miki10aAcid-catalyzed [4+3] cycloaddition reaction of N-nosyl pyrroles  ap. 4495-4499.  aAn acid-catalyzed [4+3] cycloaddition reaction of N-nosyl pyrroles with 2-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)acrolein has been developed.

METHODS Diabetes nurse educators in 4 suburban Minneapolis clinic sites surveyed the SMBG training/cure practices of 280 patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Participant SMBG technique was measured by direct observation. Participants performed a finger puncture and used their own meters to measure the first blood sample. A second sample was measured on the HemoCue B Glucose analyzer, and a third sample was used to measure hemoglobin. The series of tests were then repeated. If either of the 2 glucose tests was more than 15% from the HemoCue value, participants were reeducated about the manufacturer's suggested procedure. RESULTS Of the 280 participants, 19% had blood glucose test results greater than the 15% limit for meter accuracy. After reeducation, 69% of those who had initially failed achieved acceptable results. The most significant problems were lack of periodic meter technique evaluation, difficulty using wipe meters, incorrect use of control solutions, lack of hand washing even when observed, and unclean meters. CONCLUSIONS As a result of the study, guidelines were subsequently developed to evaluate meter accuracy in an outpatient setting. Further effort is needed to establish standards for evaluating SMBG.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiabetes mellitus 3ablood glucose 3amonitoring 3aguidelines 3aaccuracy 3apatient education 3apatients 3aquantitative analysis 2aAlgorithms 2aBias (Epidemiology) 2aBlood Glucose Self-Monitoringxinstrumentationxmethodsxstandards. 2aBlood Specimen Collectionxmethodsxstandards. 2aClinical Competencexstandards 2aDecision Trees 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 1xbloodxprevention & control. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xbloodxprevention & control. 2aDiabetes, Gestationalxbloodxprevention & control. 2aEquipment Failure 2aFasting 2aFemale 2aHand Disinfectionxstandards 2aHumans 2aMaintenance 2aMale 2aPatient Compliancexstatistics & numerical data 2aPatient Education as Topicxstandards 2aPractice Guidelines as Topicxstandards 2aPregnancy 2aSurveys and Questionnaires.1 aPearson, Jan1 aCembrowski, George S.1 aBina, Dawn1 aDavidson, Janet1 aList, Sue0 tDiabetes educator.g2000 Nov., v. 26, no. 6 p.981-989dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x0145-72177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0145721700026006103Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02599naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245009400162300001800256500002000274520133100294592002801625650002601653650000801679650002501687650001901712650002001731650002401751650001401775650002001789650001901809650001601828650002401844700003301868700002101901700002301922700002401945773013801969856007302107852000902180655001202189IND60651700020221119103314.0190712e20150213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065170002DNAL7 a10.3390/su70220662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBustamante, Eliseo10aMeasurement and Numerical Simulation of Air Velocity in a Tunnel-Ventilated Broiler House  ap. 2066-2085.  aJournal Article  aA building needs to be designed for the whole period of its useful life according to its requirements. However, future climate predictions involve some uncertainty. Thus, several sustainable strategies of adaptation need to be incorporated after the initial design. In this sense, tunnel ventilation in broiler houses provides high air velocity values (2–3 m·s−1) at animal level to diminish their thermal stress and associated mortality. This ventilation system was experimentally incorporated into a Mediterranean climate. The aim was to resolve these thermal problems in hot seasons, as (traditional) cross-mechanical ventilation does not provide enough air velocity values. Surprisingly, very little information on tunnel ventilation systems is available, especially in terms of air velocity. Using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and a multi-sensor system, the average results are similar (at animal level: 1.59 ± 0.68 m·s−1 for CFD and 1.55 ± 0.66 m·s−1 for measurements). The ANOVA for validation concluded that the use of CFD or measurements is not significant (p-value = 0.1155). Nevertheless, some problems with air velocity distribution were found and need to be solved. To this end, CFD techniques can help by means of virtual designs and scenarios providing information for the whole indoor space.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3aair 3aanalysis of variance 3aclimate models 3afluid mechanics 3amathematical models 3amortality 3apoultry housing 3athermal stress 3auncertainty 3aventilation systems1 aGarcía-Diego, Fernando-Juan1 aCalvet, Salvador1 aTorres, Antonio G.1 aHospitaler, Antonio0 tSustainability.g2015 Feb. 13, v. 7, no. 2 p.2066-2085dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su70220663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03085naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245017100178500001900349520147500368592002801843650001501871650001801886650001301904650001401917650001501931650001601946650000901962650002501971650000701996650002002003650002102023650001302044650001702057650002502074653000902099653003502108653002802143653002502171653002802196700002302224700002902247700001802276700001702294700002202311700001802333773011902351856008802470852000902558655001202567IND60713222920221121224043.0210201e20210210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071322292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1426242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, Elizangela P.10aAluminized surface to improve solar light absorption in open reactors: Application for micropollutants removal in effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis work proposes the evaluation of an aluminized surface on the bottom of open reactors to perform a photo-Fenton process, at circumneutral pH (using Fe III-Ethylenediamine-N,N′-disuccinic acid complex), for elimination of micropollutants (MPs) in real effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants (EMWWTP). Firstly, the strategy was to initially investigate the real EMWWTP spiked with several MPs (acetaminophen, diclofenac, carbamazepine, caffeine, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole) with 20 and 100 μg L⁻¹ in a laboratory scale (evaluated by HPLC-UV) using a solar simulator. Finally, the removal of all MCs present in the real EMWWTP was monitored (evaluated by HPLC-MS) in a pilot-scale (90 L) in a raceway pond reactor (RPR). The treatment time required for degradation above 80% for the investigated MPs was over 30 min, and the predominant effect could be mainly associated with organics present in the real EMWWTP due to the light attenuation and scavenging of radical species. Moreover, the results confirmed that chloride and sulfate would most likely equally not affect the process. The use of an aluminized surface on the bottom of RPRs has been confirmed as a suitable option to improve the photo-Fenton reaction, enabling the use of lower doses of iron. Up to 60 different MPs found in EMWWTP have been successfully degraded using 0.1 mM of Fe at circumneutral pH with a consumption of 30 mg L⁻¹ H₂O₂ with less than 45 min.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aacetaminophen 3acaffeine 3achlorides 3adiclofenac 3aenvironment 3airon 3amunicipal wastewater 3apH 3asolar radiation 3asulfamethoxazole 3asulfates 3atrimethoprim 3awastewater treatment 0aEDDS 0aNeutral photo-Fenton reactions 0aOrganic micropollutants 0aRaceway pond reactor 0aReal secondary effluent1 aRoccamante, Melina1 aPlaza-Bolaños, Patricia1 aOller, Isabel1 aAgüera, Ana1 aAmorim, Camila C.1 aMalato, Sixto0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Feb. 10, v. 755 p.142624-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1426243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03430naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005900155245015000214300001300364520156300377592002801940650001901968650002401987650002202011650001102033650001502044650003502059650002502094650001602119650001702135650001702152650001502169650003302184650000902217650001102226650002202237650001602259650002302275650001602298650001502314651001102329653002702340653002702367653002702394653001302421653003502434653002002469700006002489700001602549700001902565700001802584700002102602700001802623773008802641856009002729852000902819655001202828IND60632899220221118043515.0190425e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063289922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShiu, Ruei-Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4020-060010aAlkylphenol ethoxylate metabolites in coastal sediments off southwestern Taiwan: Spatiotemporal variations, possible sources, and ecological risk  ap. 9-18.  aAlkylphenol ethoxylates (APEOs) are one of the most widely used classes of surfactants, but they are also ubiquitous environmental pollutants and known endocrin-disrupting chemicals. This study is the first to investigate the spatiotemporal variations and possible sources of APEOs and their metabolites, including nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEOs) and octylphenol ethoxylates (OPEOs), in coastal sediments off southwestern Taiwan. The highest APEO concentration in the dry season was observed for the Kaohsiung coastal area, whereas the highest alkylphenol (AP) concentration in the wet season was found offshore at the Tainan Canal exit. No continuous accumulation of alkylphenol metabolites was evident in the area. One possible reason is that seasonal current and wind waves disperse the coastal pollutants. Application of multivariate statistical tools (hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis) confirmed the role of rivers and the Tainan Canal in transporting contaminants to coastal environments, suggesting influences of industrial and human activities on APEO distribution. A further comparison with the predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) proposed by the European Union indicates that nonylphenol (NP) and octylphenol (OP) might pose potential ecological risks to the aquatic environment in the studied area. These findings provide useful information for environmental policy implementation and ecological assessments of different types of endocrine-disrupting chemicals and raise warnings about surfactant applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aaquatic environment 3acoastal sediments 3acoasts 3adry season 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aenvironmental policy 3ametabolites 3anonylphenols 3aoctylphenols 3apollutants 3aprincipal component analysis 3arisk 3arivers 3aspatial variation 3asurfactants 3atemporal variation 3awater waves 3awet season 3aTaiwan 0aAlkylphenol ethoxylate 0aNonylphenol ethoxylate 0aOctylphenol ethoxylate 0aSediment 0aEndocrine-disrupting chemicals 0aEcological risk1 aJiang, Jheng-Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2887-723X1 aGao, Huiyu,1 aFang, Meng-Der1 aLiang, Yu-Jen1 aTang, Chih-Cheng1 aLee, Chon-Lin0 tChemosphere.g2019 June, v. 225 p.9-18dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010000164300001800264520156100282592002801843650002401871650002801895650001601923650002801939650001701967650002401984650002402008650002402032650002402056650002002080650002602100650001702126650002302143650001802166650001102184650001202195700002002207700001702227700001702244700002202261700001702283700001502300773012702315856008102442852000902523655001202532IND60501322020221117224031.0160222e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6050132202DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-015-7148-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Yuxiang10aEnhancement of UDPG synthetic pathway improves ansamitocin production in Actinosynnem pretiosum  ap. 2651-2662.  aAnsamitocin P-3 (AP-3), an amacrocyclic lactam compound, is produced by Actinosynnema pretiosum. As a group of maytansinoid antibiotics, ansamitocins have an extraordinary antitumor activity by blocking the assembly of tubulin forming into functional microtubules. The biosynthesis of ansamitocins is initialized by the formation of UDP-glucose (UDPG) which is converted from glucose-1-phosphate (G1P). In this study, we focused on the influence of enhancement of UDPG biosynthesis on the production of ansamitocins in A. pretiosum. The homologous overexpressions of phosphoglucomutase, starch phosphorylase, and UTP-G1P uridylyltransferase, respectively, could largely increase the pool sizes of G1P and UDPG and result in improved AP-3 production. The elevated intracellular glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) level provided by the enhanced glyconeogenesis had, however, no significant effects on the biosynthesis of AP-3. The G6P-G1P-UDPG pathway was therefore systematically engineered by multiple genetic modifications, and a significant increase in AP-3 production was achieved (168 mg/L of AP-3 in flask culture, 40 % higher than the control strain). We also found that the enhancement of starch assimilation pathway could also improve the assembly of AP-3 to some extent. In addition, heterologous gene overexpression from Actinosynnema mirum could result in more AP-3 biosynthesis in comparison to the corresponding homologous overexpression, suggesting an alternative and promising avenue of metabolic engineering strategy for improving AP-3 production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinosynnema mirum 3aActinosynnema pretiosum 3aantibiotics 3aantineoplastic activity 3abiosynthesis 3agene overexpression 3agenetic engineering 3aglucose 1-phosphate 3aglucose 6-phosphate 3aglyconeogenesis 3ametabolic engineering 3amicrotubules 3aphosphoglucomutase 3aphosphorylase 3astarch 3atubulin1 aZhao, Mengjiang1 aWei, Liujing1 aHu, Fengxian1 aImanaka, Tadayuki1 aBai, Linquan1 aHua, Qiang0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2016 Mar., v. 100, no. 6 p.2651-2662dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-015-7148-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03501naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002700188245008800215300001200303506007600315520193800391592002802329506003702357650002302394650001002417650001602427650002602443650000902469650001802478650001602496650002002512650001002532650001902542650001802561650002202579650002002601650002402621650001202645650001802657650003202675700002202707700001802729700001902747700003002766773009702796856008102893852000902974655001202983IND60133134620221207093459.0160905e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013313462DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-015-0425-62doi7 aPMC44361132pmcid7 a259720972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Diego-Cabero, Nuria10aBile acid mediated effects on gut integrity and performance of early-weaned piglets  ap. 111.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Early weaning (EW) results in a transient period of impaired integrity of the intestinal mucosa that may be associated with reduced plasma concentration of glucagon-like peptide-(GLP) 2. We have previously shown that intragastric infusion of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDC) increases circulating GLP-2 in early-weaned piglets. The aim of this study was to expand previous work to establish whether feeding piglets a cereal-based diet supplemented with CDC can improve gut integrity and animal performance immediately after EW. A cohort of 36 piglets weaned at 20 days of age, 6.2 ± 0.34 kg of body weight (BW) were randomly assigned (n = 18) to receive a standard prestarter diet or the same diet supplemented with 60 mg of CDC per kg of initial BW for ad libitum intake until day 14 postweaning. Thereafter, all pigs were fed the same untreated starter diet for 21 days until the end of the study on day 35. On days 1, 7 and 14 blood samples were collected from 6 pigs per treatment to measure plasma GLP-2. On day 15, 6 pigs per treatment were euthanized to obtain intestinal tissue samples for later histological and gene expression analyses. RESULTS: Supplementing the diet with CDC tended to increase plasma GLP-2 (P < 0.07; 39 %) and the weight of the large intestine (P < 0.10; 11 %), and increased ileal crypt depth (P < 0.04; 15 %) after 14 days of treatment exposure. Although feed intake and BW gain were not affected by treatments, feeding CDC induced the expression of the cytokines TNF-α (P < 0.02; 1.9 fold), IL-6 (P < 0.01; 2.4 fold), and IL-10 (P < 0.006; 2.2 fold) and the tight junctional protein ZON-1 (P < 0.02; 1.5 fold) in the distal small intestine. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the oral administration of CDC to early-weaned pigs has the potential to improve the protection of the intestinal mucosa independently of relevant changes in gut growth.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal performance 3ablood 3abody weight 3achenodeoxycholic acid 3adiet 3aearly weaning 3afeed intake 3agene expression 3aileum 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-6 3aintestinal mucosa 3alarge intestine 3aoral administration 3apiglets 3aswine feeding 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aMereu, Alessandro1 aMenoyo, David1 aHolst, Jens J.1 aIpharraguerre, Ignacio R.0 tBMC veterinary research.g2015 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.111-111dBioMed Centralx1746-61487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-015-0425-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01470naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245008000172300001800252520045800270592002800728650002300756650002300779650002100802653001400823653001300837653002800850653002100878700001900899700001700918700002600935773008100961856008101042852000901123655001201132IND60551470120221119062126.0161018e20150415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055147012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2015.02.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBennasar, M.-Lluïsa10aExploratory studies toward a total synthesis of pericine (subincanadine E)  ap. 2246-2254.  aA possible synthetic approach to the bridged indole alkaloid pericine (subincanadine E), based on the combination of a ring-closing metathesis (RCM) and a Heck cyclization, is described.

Companies have faced different challenges in seeking to combine the best economic performance with increased social and environmental responsibility. Monitoring sustainability is essential for decision-making and management of activities that comprise an organization’s system processes. Evaluation can be performed using indices or a set of indicators. In addition to increasing organizational effectiveness and improving competitiveness, customer service and profitability, it is also a crucial influence on the development of business sustainability. This paper proposes a sustainability index that provides companies with information about their level of economic, social and environmental sustainability, showing their performance at both individual and supply chain level. The importance of the indicators is assessed by using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology applied to a case study of a supply chain in the automotive industry. The various stages experienced during the construction of the index are also shown. The final results achieved are then presented and discussed in light of the objectives.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness development 3abusiness enterprises 3acase studies 3acustomer service 3adecision making 3aeconomic performance 3aglobalization 3aindustry 3amonitoring 3aprofitability 3asupply chain 3asustainable development1 aAzevedo, Susana G.1 aMatias, João Carlos O.,1 aFerreira, Luís M.0 tSustainability.g2015 Feb. 16, v. 7, no. 2 p.2113-2144dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su70221133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02178naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002700146245008300173300001600256520116500272592002801437650002201465650002201487650002401509650002101533650001301554650001101567650000801578650001001586651001901596700002001615773011301635852000901748856008301757655001201840IND2325166720221122065407.0190620e200009  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232516672DNAL7 a10.1177/0145721700026005112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson-Loftin, Wanda10aLong-Term Disease Management Needs of Southern African Americans With Diabetes  ap. 821-832.  aPURPOSE this qualitative study explored the issues, concerns, and needs of low-income, southern African Americans in managing type 2 diabetes over time. METHODS Two focus groups (N=22) were conducted with the target population to collect data. Group sessions were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Content analysis was used to analyze the data. RESULTS The data revealed an overall theme of learning to live with diabetes, which consisted of 3 processes: (1) symptom management, (2) making healthy choices, and (3) emotional adjustment. This article focuses on the processes of symptom management and making healthy choices. Findings suggest that the sequential processes of symptom management and making healthy choices occurred over time primarily through experiential learning in this population and were influenced by social support, caring and collaborative provider-client relationships, and access to resources and culturally sensitive supportive services. CONCLUSIONS Experiential educational methods that incorporate social support and access to resources may be more appropriate than the traditional didactic method of teaching diabetes self-care.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiabetes mellitus 3apatient education 3aeducational methods 3ahealth promotion 3apatients 3aBlacks 3amen 3awomen 3aSouth Carolina1 aMoneyham, Linda0 tDiabetes educator.g2000 Sept., v. 26, no. 5 p.821-832dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x0145-72177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0145721700026005113Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02192naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245015200157300002000309520092400329592002801253650001301281650002401294650001701318650001401335650001401349650001701363700001701380700001701397700001701414700001401431700001601445700001701461700001901478700001501497700001601512700001601528700001701544773012601561856007401687852000901761655001201770IND60669100120221118013959.0190920e20150930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066910012DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra11896d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Taotao10aIdentification of novel JMJD2A inhibitor scaffold using shape and electrostatic similarity search combined with docking method and MM-GBSA approach  ap. 82936-82946.  aWe present a hierarchical workflow combining shape- and electrostatic-based virtual screening for the identification of novel Jumonji domain-containing protein 2A (JMJD2A) inhibitors. Our virtual screening protocol initially involved the identification of small molecules, which had similar shape and electrostatic properties to 5-carboxy-8-hydroxyquinoline (5-carboxy-8-HQ, IOX-1). Molecular docking and Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) rescoring were then used to prioritize these small molecules for Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay Screen (AlphaScreen) assay. Compounds contained a catechol scaffold displayed inhibition activity against JMJD2A. They also exhibited competitive inhibition with respect to 2-oxoglutaric acid (2OG). Our study suggested that the novel structure discovered in the present study may serve as a starting point for developing JMJD2A inhibitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatechol 3acomputer simulation 3aluminescence 3amechanics 3ascreening 3asurface area1 aChen, Weilin1 aLi, Dongdong1 aLin, Hongzhi1 aLiu, Fang1 aBao, Qichao1 aLei, Yonghua1 aZhang, Xiaojin1 aXu, Xiaoli1 aGuo, Xiaoke1 aYou, Qidong1 aSun, Haopeng0 tRSC advances.g2015 Sept. 30, v. 5, no. 101 p.82936-82946dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra11896d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01450naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009200156300001600248520039200264592002800656650002300684650002300707650001900730650001800749650001500767700002000782700001500802700001300817700001900830700002000849700001700869773013100886856007401017852000901091655001201100IND60639037620221118073936.0190501e20161222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063903762DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc08798a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTagg, A.

Under the reaction conditions, the cationic vinyl allylpalladium species undergoes selective migratory insertion of alkenes rather than reductive elimination with nucleophiles. This strategy provides an efficient and unique approach to the construction of functionalized naphthalenes, which are important building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry. Mechanistic studies have revealed that the selective sequential migratory insertion of enyne and alkene is crucial for the cyclization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aalkenes 3aamination 3achemoselectivity 3aorganic chemistry1 aYu, Houjian1 aHuang, Hanmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0108-65420 tOrganic letters.g2020 Oct. 30, v. 22, no. 22 p.8962-8966dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19216x1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.0c033653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02868naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002500187245006900212300001300281506007600294520162100370592002801991506003702019650002102056650002902077650001202106650001402118650002002132650001002152650001502162650001102177650001302188700002202201700002202223700001802245773010602263856008002369852000902449655001202458IND60119385920221207103319.0141214e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011938592DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2009-10-2-r192doi7 aPMC26882782pmcid7 a192167502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNotebaart, Richard A10aAsymmetric relationships between proteins shape genome evolution  ap. 2169.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The relationships between proteins are often asymmetric: one protein (A) depends for its function on another protein (B), but the second protein does not depend on the first. In metabolic networks there are multiple pathways that converge into one central pathway. The enzymes in the converging pathways depend on the enzymes in the central pathway, but the enzymes in the latter do not depend on any specific enzyme in the converging pathways. Asymmetric relations are analogous to the “if->then” logical relation where A implies B, but B does not imply A (A->B). RESULTS: We show that the majority of relationships between enzymes in metabolic flux models of metabolism in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are asymmetric. We show furthermore that these asymmetric relationships are reflected in the expression of the genes encoding those enzymes, the effect of gene knockouts and the evolution of genomes. From the asymmetric relative dependency, one would expect that the gene that is relatively independent (B) can occur without the other dependent gene (A), but not the reverse. Indeed, when only one gene of an A->B pair is expressed, is essential, is present in a genome after an evolutionary gain or loss, it tends to be the independent gene (B). This bias is strongest for genes encoding proteins whose asymmetric relationship is evolutionarily conserved.

DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Medical university affiliated hospital. PATIENT(S): Women aged less than 40 years undergoing BT cycles. INTERVENTION(S): Vitrification and warming of blastocyst with the Cryotop system. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Clinical pregnancy rate (CPR), implantation rate (IR), and multiple pregnancy rate (MPR). RESULT(S): In 110 fresh BT cycles versus 136 vitrified-warmed BT cycles performed from January 2007 to March 2010, the IR and CPR of vitrified-warmed BT cycles were 37.0% and 55.1%, respectively, which were statistically significantly higher than the corresponding values of 25.2% and 36.4% obtained for fresh BT cycles. Additionally, the MPR was not statistically significantly different between vitrified-warmed and fresh BT cycles when a similar number of blastocysts was transferred to patients. CONCLUSION(S): Vitrified-warmed BT cycles resulted in statistically significantly higher CPR and IR compared with fresh BT cycles. A new embryo transfer strategy is therefore proposed whereby fresh BT would be avoided in the initial ovarian stimulation cycle. Instead, all the patient’s available blastocysts would be vitrified-warmed and transferred in subsequent cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablastocyst 3aembryo transfer 3apatients 3apregnancy rate 3aretrospective studies 3avitrification 3awomen1 aZhang, Juanjuan1 aCao, Shanren1 aZhang, Junqiang1 aHeng, Boon Chin1 aHuang, Meiling1 aLing, Xiufeng1 aDuan, Tao1 aTong, Guo Qing0 tFertility and sterility.g2011 Apr., v. 95, no. 5 p.1691-1695dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2011.01.0223Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245016000173300001400333520093300347592002801280650002201308650001701330650002001347650001501367650001701382650001701399650002201416650001001438650001301448650002401461650001301485650001801498650003101516650002101547650001301568650001001581650001601591650001501607653001801622653002501640653001401665653002901679700002301708700001901731773009901750856008601849852000901935655001201944IND60561838520221122154018.0170713e20170401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056183852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2017.01.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAjamein, Hossein14aThe role of various fuels on microwave-enhanced combustion synthesis of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 nanocatalyst used in hydrogen production via methanol steam reforming  ap. 61-73.  aA series of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 nanocatalysts were synthesized by the microwave enhanced combustion method to evaluate the influence of fuel type. Sorbitol, propylene glycol, glycerol, diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol were used as fuel. XRD results revealed that application of ethylene glycol led to highly dispersed CuO and ZnO crystals. It was more highlighted about Cu(111) crystallite facet which known as the main active site of methanol steam reforming. Moreover, using ethylene glycol resulted homogeneous morphology and narrow particles size distribution (average surface particle size is about 265nm). Due to the significant physicochemical properties, the catalytic experiments showed that the sample prepared by ethylene glycol achieved total conversion of methanol at 260°C. Its carbon monoxide production at this temperature was negligible. This nanocatalyst was completely stable during 1440min of time on stream.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactive sites 3acarbon monoxide 3acombustion 3acrystallites 3acupric oxide 3adiethylene glycol 3afuels 3aglycerol 3ahydrogen production 3amethanol 3aparticle size 3aphysicochemical properties 3apropylene glycol 3asorbitol 3asteam 3atemperature 3azinc oxide 0aCuO/ZnO/Al2O3 0aMicrowave combustion 0aFuel type 0aMethanol steam reforming1 aHaghighi, Mohammad1 aAlaei, Shervin0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2017 Apr. 01, v. 137 p.61-73dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2017.01.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03276naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245013100204300001400335520155200349592002801901596005001929596005001979596005002029596007502079596007502154596006302229650001102292650002502303650001702328650001502345650002202360650001402382650001202396650001802408650001202426650001202438700001602450700001602466700001502482700001702497700001602514700001602530700001802546773012602564856008302690852000902773655001202782IND60774591320221117030023.0220421e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077459132DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-021-05213-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Dongyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5644-036910aStocking rate changed the magnitude of carbon sequestration and flow within the plant-soil system of a meadow steppe ecosystem  ap. 33-47.  aAIMS: Livestock grazing is one of the most common utilization methods and exerts a significant effect on the carbon allocations between the above- and belowground components of a grassland ecosystem. The major aim of this study were to evaluate the proportions of ¹³C allocation to various C pools of the plant-soil system of a meadow steppe ecosystem in response to changes of stocking rate. METHODS: In situ stable ¹³C isotope pulse labeling was conducted in a long-term grazing experiment with 4 stocking rate. Plant materials and soil samples were taken at eight occasions (0, 3, 10, 18, 31, 56 and 100 days after labeling) to analyze the decline in ¹³C over time, and their composition signature of ¹³C were analyzed by the isotope ratio mass spectrometer technique. RESULTS: We found a significantly greater decline in assimilated ¹³C of shoot and living root for the heavily grazed swards compared to other stocking rates, with the highest relocation rate of ¹³C into soil C pool compared to other fractions. In addition, light grazing significantly allocated ¹³C assimilates in the belowground pool compared to other stocking rates, especially in the live root and topsoil C-pools. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the effects of grazing on the carbon transfers and stocks within the plant-soil system of the meadow steppe were highly grazing pressure dependent. Plant-soil system in light stocking rate presented the highest C utilization efficiency, however, plants allocated more C to soil C pools with heavily stocking rate.  aPublisher supplied data  a41771205cNatural Science Foundation of China  a41801096cNatural Science Foundation of China  a31971769cNatural Science Foundation of China  a2017YFE0104500cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a2016YFC0500601cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  aCARS-34cChina Agriculture Research System of MOF and MARA 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3aecosystems 3agrazing intensity 3alivestock 3ameadows 3aspectrometers 3asteppes 3atopsoil1 aYan, Ruirui1 aLi, Linghao1 aQi, Jiaguo1 aChen, Jiquan1 aXu, Hongbin1 aYan, Yuchun1 aXin, Xiaoping0 tPlant and soil.g2022 Apr., v. 473, no. 1-2 p.33-47dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-021-05213-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245006000185300001600245520083700261592002801098650001401126650001301140650001601153650000901169650000901178650001701187650001401204650001401218650001201232650002301244650004501267650002501312650004701337650004801384650002201432650002101454650000901475650002301484650001901507650002201526650001401548650003401562650005401596650002301650650002301673650002501696700002301721700002801744700002501772700001801797700002501815700002201840700001901862700002101881773009401902856004801996852000902044655001202053IND4480991020221118131300.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448099102DNAL7 a215530742pmid7 a10.1007/s11248-011-9519-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWallner, Barbara10aGeneration of mice with a conditional Stat1 null allele  ap. 217-224.  aInterferons (IFNs) are key cytokines in the innate immune response that also bridge the gap to adaptive immunity. Signaling upon stimulation by IFN type I, II and III is mediated by the Jak-Stat pathway. STAT1 is activated by all three IFN receptor complexes and absence of STAT1 from mice increases their susceptibility to pathogens. In addition, depending on the setting, STAT1 can act as tumor suppressor or oncogene. Here we report the generation and detailed functional characterization of a conditional Stat1 knockout mouse. We show the integrity of the conditional Stat1 locus and report successful in vivo deletion by means of a ubiquitous and a tissue-specific Cre recombinase. The conditional Stat1 null allele represents an important tool for identifying novel and cell-autonomous STAT1 functions in infection and cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytokines 3aimmunity 3ainterferons 3aloci 3amice 3anull alleles 3aoncogenes 3apathogens 2aAnimals 2aCloning, Molecular 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aIntegrasesxgenetics 2aInterferon-betaxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aInterferon-gammaxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aLiverxphysiology 2aLungxphysiology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Knockout 2aOrgan Specificity 2aPhenotype 2aPhosphorylationxdrug effects 2aSTAT1 Transcription Factorxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSerinexmetabolism 2aSpleenxphysiology 2aTyrosinexmetabolism1 aLeitner, Nicole R.1 aVielnascher, Raimund M.1 aKernbauer, Elisabeth1 aKolbe, Thomas1 aKaraghiosoff, Marina1 aRülicke, Thomas,1 aDecker, Thomas1 aMuller, Mathias,0 tTransgenic research.g2012 Feb., v. 21, no. 1 p.217-224dSpringer-Verlagx0962-88197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11248-011-9519-5  aDNAL 7aarticle03556naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245017000185300001600355520217800371592002802549650001402577650002802591650002702619650001402646650001202660650002202672650001402694650002202708650002402730650001102754650003602765650001902801650001402820650001202834650001302846700001402859700001702873700001902890773011102909856008103020852000903101655001203110IND60119099720221121235303.0141211e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011909972DNAL7 a252864572pmid7 a10.1007/s12603-014-0452-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Hee-Jung10aDepression as a correlate of functional status of community-dwelling older adults: Utilizing a short-version of 5-item Geriatric Depression Scale as a screening tool  ap. 765-770.  aDepression has been known to be associated with functional limitations in elderly populations and screening is an effective preventive approach. The purpose of this study was to examine the contribution of depression in explaining the functional status of community-dwelling older adults and to explore the utility of a short version 5-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-5) as a screening tool. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey SETTINGS: Six hospitals and communities served by home-delivery meal programs PARTICIPANTS: 529 individuals aged 60 years and older. MEASUREMENTS: Using structured survey questionnaires, key variables including demographics, depression status, and two domains of functional status assessed by basic Activities of Daily Living (ADL) /Instrumental ADL (IADL) and mini-mental status (MMSE) were collected. To determine the unique contribution of depression in explaining functional status of participating older adults, hierarchical multiple regression was conducted. RESULTS: The model explained 18 % of the total variance in physical function and 21 % of the total variance in cognitive function. Race/ethnicity and depression were significant predictors of functional status. In particular, entry of the depression variable resulted in a significant R square change of 7%, accounting for a unique portion of the ADL/IADL variance. In terms of cognitive function measured by MMSE, entry of the depression variable showed a small, but significant change. Older adults who were ethnic minorities and had depression were significantly more likely to report poor perceived physical and cognitive function. Hierarchical multiple regressions revealed that some personal factors such as age, education, race/ethnicity contributed to the explanatory model, and depressive symptoms significantly explained additional variance. GDS-5 was less reliable (Cronbach’s alpha= 0.5) to assess depressive symptoms in this study. CONCLUSION: Depression was a significant contributing factor to functional limitations of older adults. A short 5-item version of the GDS could be used to screen older adults, but two-tiered GDS-5/15 would be better alternative tool.  aPublisher supplied data 3acognition 3across-sectional studies 3ademographic statistics 3aeducation 3aelderly 3afunctional status 3ahospitals 3amental depression 3aminorities (people) 3amodels 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aquestionnaires 3ascreening 3asurveys 3avariance1 aMeade, K.1 aAkobundu, U.1 aSahyoun, N.

Because of their complex community structure and rich surface vegetation, deciduous broad-leaved forested swamps are considered to be one of the most difficult types of wetland to classify. In this research, with the support of remote sensing and geographic information system, multi-temporal radar images L-Palsar were used initially to extract the forest hydrological layer and phenology phase change layer as two variables through image analysis. Second, based on the environmental characteristics of forested swamps, three decision tree classifiers derived from the two variables were constructed to explore effective methods to identify deciduous broad-leaved forested swamps. Third, this study focused on analyzing the classification process between flat-forests, which are the most severely disturbed elements, and forested swamps. Finally, the application of the decision tree model will be discussed. The results showed that: 1) L-HH band (a L band with wavelength of 0–235 m in HH polarization mode; HH means Synthetic Aperture Radars transmit pulses in horizontal polarization and receive in horizontal polarization) in the leaf-off season is shown to be capable of detecting hydrologic conditions beneath the forest; 2) the accuracy of the classification (forested swamp and forest plat) was 81.5% based on hydrologic features, and 83.5% was achieved by combining hydrologic features and phenology response features, which indicated that hydrological characteristics under the forest played a key role. The HHOJ (refers to the band created by the subtraction with HH band in October and HH band in July) achieved by multi-temporal radar images did improve the classification accuracy, but not significantly, and more leaf-off radar images may be more efficient than multi-seasonal radar images for inland forested swamp mapping; 3) the lower separability between forested swamps dominated by vegetated surfaces and forest plat covered with litter was the main cause of the uncertainty in classification, which led to misleading interpretations of the pixel-based classification. Finally, through the analysis with kappa coefficients, it was shown that the value of the intersection point was an ideal choice for the variable.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity structure 3adecision support systems 3aforests 3ageographic information systems 3agreenhouse gases 3ahydrology 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3aphenology 3aradar 3aremote sensing 3aswamps 3auncertainty 3awavelengths1 aYan, Tingting1 aZhang, Zhengxiang1 aHe, Chunguang1 aSheng, Lianxi0 tChinese geographical science.g2016 June, v. 26, no. 3 p.352-365dScience Pressx1002-00637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11769-016-0805-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012100165520112500286592002801411650002101439650002101460650002001481650001701501650000701518650001501525650002501540653002701565653002901592653002701621653001901648653001401667700001401681700001201695700001501707700001601722773011801738856008601856852000901942655001201951IND60783413020221122173055.0221004e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078341302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1157602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Dexiu10aAcid/alkali pretreatment enhances the formation of vivianite during anaerobic fermentation of waste activated sludge  aPhosphorus (P) recovery from waste activated sludge (WAS) of wastewater treatment plants is significant in the world suffering from P shortage. Recently, vivianite crystallization has been regarded as an essential method of recovering P from anaerobic fermentation (AF) of WAS. This study performed acid/alkali pretreatment (pH 3/pH 10) on AF of WAS to improve iron reduction and vivianite formation. The results showed that the maximum iron reduction rate (Rₘₐₓ) in the pH 3 and pH 10 groups was increased by 1.9 and 1.7 times compared with that in the Control-Fe group, and the iron reduction efficiency (EFₑ) was increased by 17.5% and 12.0% respectively. The Fe bound P (Fe–P) proportion in the sludge in the pH 3 and pH 10 groups increased by 50.0% and 33.7%, respectively. Furthermore, the relative abundance of the iron-reducing bacteria Clostridium_sensusensu in the pH 3 group was higher; and the Fe–P proportion in the sludge and the size of vivianite crystal after AF were larger. With these results, pH 3 pretreatment was preferred for promoting Fe²⁺ release and vivianite formation during AF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aalkali treatment 3acrystallization 3afermentation 3apH 3aphosphorus 3awastewater treatment 0aWaste activated sludge 0aAcid/alkali pretreatment 0aAnaerobic fermentation 0aIron reduction 0aVivianite1 aZhu, Nian1 aLi, Yao1 aYan, Yixin1 aZhang, Cong0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 319 p.115760-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1157603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01896naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008800164300001600252520086100268592002801129650001401157650001501171650001301186650003101199650001301230653002001243653002301263653002001286653003101306700002001337700001701357773008201374856008101456852000901537655001201546IND60515199520221122135009.0170124e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051519952DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-016-1030-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhifeng10aInvestigation on 3D flow field induced by a plasma actuator with serrated electrode  ap. 481-487.  aThis paper presents an experimental investigation on flow field induced by a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuator with serrated electrodes in still air to further improve its flow control effectiveness. For comparison, the actuator with widely used linear electrodes was also studied. Experiments were carried out using 2D particle image velocimetry. Particular attention was given to the flow topology, discharge phenomenon, and vortex formation mechanism. Results showed that a 2D wall jet was induced by the linear actuators, whereas the plasma actuators with serrated electrode introduced a series of streamwise vorticities, which might benefit flow control (e.g., enhancing the momentum transport in the separated boundary flow). In addition, the mechanism of 3D flow topology induced by the serrated DBD actuator was analyzed in detail.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactuators 3aelectrodes 3amomentum 3aparticle image velocimetry 3atopology 0aPlasma actuator 0aSerrated electrode 0aVortex dynamics 0aParticle image velocimetry1 aZhang, Mingming1 aWang, Lianze0 tScience bulletin.g2016 Mar., v. 61 p.481-487dElsevier B.V.x2095-92737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-016-1030-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245015900174300001600333520192100349592002802270650001502298650001102313650001302324650002202337650001302359650000902372650001702381650001202398650001202410650001202422650001102434650001102445650001602456651001902472653001602491653002802507653001402535653001802549653001302567653001302580700001802593773007802611856008102689852000902770655001202779IND50067069220221120230653.0160511e20130613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006706922DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-013-0209-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSulikowska-Drozd, Anna10aOviparous reproduction of Vestia ranojevici moravica confirms taxonomic value of life history characters in carpathian clausiliids (Gastropoda: Pulmonata)  ap. 687-695.  aBased on five-year observation of 36 snails collected in the Čeladná valley (Moravia, Czech Republic) and their progeny reared in laboratory, it was found that Vestia ranojevici moravica (Brabenec, 1952) is oviparous. The oviparity in V. ranojevici is in line with the previous assumption of its reproductive strategy based on anatomical studies alone. It supports the separate position of the species in the genus Vestiaa (subgenus Brabenecia). V. ranojevici was kept at room temperature (18–25°C) between March and October; in winter snails were stored at 3°C. The egg-laying period started in late March, ca. 1 month after raising the temperature, and lasted till September, with one maximum in spring. In the laboratory the snails laid eggs in batches (usually 4–6 eggs, max 11) or singly. The number of batches per pair per season was 1–8; the corresponding number of eggs — 3–40. The eggs were gelatinous, with separate calcium carbonate crystals in the external envelope. The average egg size was 1.80 × 1.51 mm, but actual size and shape were highly variable: larger and more elongated eggs were produced mainly by laboratory reared animals. Freshly deposited eggs did not contain shelled embryos nor the reproductive tract of dissected individuals contained eggs. At room temperature the eggs hatched after ca. 14–16 days, then the shell growth lasted 20–29 weeks; the snails laid eggs 30 weeks after completion of shell growth indicating one-year life cycle under laboratory conditions. Adult individuals collected in the field reproduced during 4–5 consecutive years. Comparison of V. ranojevici reproduction to the results of breeding of other Carpathian clausiliids in the same laboratory shows that similar reproductive strategies may have evolved independently in different lineages of the group: both the oviparous and egg retaining species belong to the genera Vestia and Balea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGastropoda 3aadults 3abreeding 3acalcium carbonate 3acrystals 3aeggs 3alife history 3aovipary 3aprogeny 3arearing 3asnails 3aspring 3atemperature 3aCzech Republic 0aland snails 0areproductive strategies 0aoviparity 0aegg retention 0ataxonomy 0aMollusca1 aMaltz, Tomasz0 tBiologia.g2013 June 13, v. 68, no. 4 p.687-695dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-013-0209-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02924naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012200166300001600288520156600304592002801870650002201898650001101920650002401931650002801955650001201983650002101995650000702016650001702023650001902040650001902059650002102078650001902099650002202118650001502140650001302155651001002168700001602178700001902194700001402213700001802227700001802245773010102263856008102364852000902445655001202454IND60522640920221119145218.0160603e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052264092DNAL7 a10.1007/s11769-016-0813-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Hongqiang10aEffects of wetland utilization change on spatial distribution of soil nematodes in Heihe River Basin, Northwest China  ap. 339-351.  aThe first account of the effects of wetland reclamation on soil nematode assemblages were provided, three sites in Heihe River Basin of Northwest China, that is grass wetland (GW), Tamarix chinensis wetland (TW) and crop wetland (CW) treatments, were compared. Results showed that the majority of soil nematodes were presented in the 0–20 cm soil layers in CW treatments, followed by in the 20–40 cm and 40–60 cm layers in GW treatments. Plant-feeding nametodes were the most abundant trophic groups in each treatment, where GW (91.0%) > TW (88.1%) > CW (53.5%). Generic richness (GR) was lower in the TW (16) than that in GW (23) and CW (25). The combination of enrichment index (EI) and structure index (SI) showed that the soil food web in GW was more structured, and those in TW was stressed, while the enrichment soil food web was presented in the CW treatment. Several ecological indices which reflected soil community structure, diversity, Shannon-Weaver diversity (H′), Evenness (J′), Richness (GR) and modified maturity index (MMI) were found to be effective for assessing the response of soil namatode communities to soil of saline wetland reclamation. Furthermore, saline wetland reclamation also exerted great influence on the soil physical and chemical properties (pH, Electric conductivity (EC), Total organic carbon (TOC), Total nitrogen (Total-N) and Nitrate Nitrogen (N-NO ₃ –)). These results indicated that the wetland reclamation had significantly effects on soil nematode community structure and soil properties in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTamarix chinensis 3acarbon 3acommunity structure 3aelectrical conductivity 3agrasses 3anitrate nitrogen 3apH 3asaline soils 3asoil food webs 3asoil nematodes 3asoil restoration 3asoil structure 3aspatial variation 3awatersheds 3awetlands 3aChina1 aMao, Zhixia1 aLong, Zhangwei1 aWang, Yan1 aSu, Yongzhong1 aWang, Xuefeng0 tChinese geographical science.g2016 June, v. 26, no. 3 p.339-351dScience Pressx1002-00637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11769-016-0813-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03857naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245017000173300001600343520215100359592002802510650001102538650002502549650001702574650002102591650001702612650001502629650001502644650001702659650002002676650001202696650001202708650001102720650001402731650002802745650002002773650001302793653002002806653001302826653001202839653001502851653001502866653002602881700002502907700002902932700002002961700001802981700001802999700001603017700001603033700002203049773011603071856008303187852000903270655001203279IND60746022420221119191814.0211030e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074602242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2021.07.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFidan, Hilal Saruhan10aComparison of chemical and biological properties of in vivo and in vitro samples of Salvia siirtica Kahraman, Celep & Dogan extracts prepared with different solvents  ap. 421-429.  aThe use of Salvia species among the public and their importance in the scientific world increase due to their numerous pharmacological and biological activities on a daily basis. In this study, the phytochemical contents of different parts (root, branch, leaf, flower, whole) of different specimens of Salvia siirtica (SS) (in vivo and in vitro) extracts prepared with various solvents (petroleum ether, chloroform and ethanol) were determined using different techniques (GC-MS and LC-MS/MS) and the results were compared. In addition, biological activities (antioxidant, cytotoxic, anticholinesterase antiurease, antityrosinase, antielastase and anticollagenase) of all samples were determined and compared. The antioxidant potential of the analysed samples was found to be high, and their enzyme activity potential was low. Besides, in vitro SS-TIS (Temporary Immersion System) sample showed high cytotoxic activity (viability% 2.12 ± 0.06) against MCF-7 (breast cancer) cell line. The results of GC-MS and LC-MS/MS analyses indicated that ferruginol and sugiol could be isolated from the ethanol extract of S. siirtica roots, salvigenin and β-sitosterol from the chloroform extract of the aerial parts, and phenolic compounds from the ethanol extract of the aerial parts. In addition, the amount of rosmarinic acid, caffeic acid and 12-demethylmulticauline of in vitro samples were found to be higher than those of in vivo samples. Furthermore, all samples, both in vivo and in vitro, contained high levels of rosmarinic acid and β-sitosterol. The whole chloroform extract (SSWC) could be the source extract for salvigenin (33952.13 µg/g) and β-sitosterol (16369.71 µg/g), and the root ethanol extract (SSRE) for ferruginol (17721.99 µg/g). As a result, it is understood that the nature of the plant material, the choice of an appropriate solvent and the parts of the material used are quite effective in chemical content. S. siirtica promise potential natural antioxidant agent in food and/or pharmaceutical industry due to its phytochemical content (rosmarinic and caffeic acids, ferruginol, salvigenin) and antioxidant activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalvia 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abreast neoplasms 3acaffeic acid 3acell lines 3achloroform 3acytotoxicity 3aenzyme activity 3aethanol 3aflowers 3aleaves 3apetroleum 3apharmaceutical industry 3arosmarinic acid 3asolvents 0aSalvia siirtica 0aIn vitro 0aIn vivo 0aSalvigenin 0aFerruginol 0aBiological activities1 aKilinc, Fatih Mehmet1 aYilmaz, Mustafa Abdullah1 aAkdeniz, Mehmet1 aYener, Ismail1 aFirat, Mehmet1 aOnay, Ahmet1 aKolak, Ufuk1 aErtas, Abdulselam0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2021 Nov., v. 142 p.421-429dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2021.07.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001300166245008600179300001400265520114200279592002801421650001601449650002101465650002901486650002701515650001301542650001701555650001601572650001001588650002001598650003501618650003001653650002101683650003001704650000901734650001601743650001401759650001301773700001501786700001701801700001601818700001501834700002101849773009801870856008101968852000902049655001202058IND60120229220221121022404.0150131e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012022922DNAL7 a252238572pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-014-3735-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhen10aConstruction of transgenic silkworm spinning antibacterial silk with fluorescence  ap. 19-25.  aA targeting vector consisting of a fusion gene of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene gfp and the antimicrobial peptide cecropin gene cec flanked by pieces of the 5′ and 3′ sequences of the fibroin L chain gene fib-L of the silkworm (Bombyx mori) and a negative selection DsRed marker gene driven by the baculovirus immediate early gene 1 (i.e.-1) promoter, was used to target the silkworm genome in order to explore the possibility of improving the performance of silk. A transgenic silkworm with a green fluorescent cocoon was obtained and PCR analysis of its genome confirmed that the target genes had been integrated into the silkworm genome correctly. Furthermore, in the posterior silk glands of the G6 generation transformation silkworm, a band representing the fusion protein Fib-L-GFP-Cec with a molecular mass of 68.7 kDa was detected by western blotting with an antibody against GFP. An investigation of the number of bacteria attached to a cocoon showed the transgenic silkworm cocoon possessed antibacterial properties.

Heat stress is a critical abiotic stress for winter bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) especially at the flowering and grain filling stages, limiting its growth and productivity in Europe and elsewhere. The breeding of new high-yield and stress-tolerant wheat varieties requires improved understanding of the physiological and genetic bases of heat tolerance. To identify genomic areas associated with plant and grain characteristics under heat stress, a panel of elite European wheat varieties (N = 199) was evaluated under controlled conditions in 2016 and 2017. A split-plot design was used to test the effects of high temperature for ten days after flowering. Flowering time, leaf chlorophyll content, the number of productive spikes, grain number, grain weight and grain size were measured, and the senescence process was modeled. Using genotyping data from a 280 K SNP chip, a genome-wide association study was carried out to test the main effect of each SNP and the effect of SNP × treatment interaction. Genotype × treatment interactions were mainly observed for grain traits measured on the main shoots and tillers. We identified 10 QTLs associated with the main effect of at least one trait and seven QTLs associated with the response to post-anthesis heat stress. Of these, two main QTLs associated with the heat tolerance of thousand-kernel weight were identified on chromosomes 4B and 6B. These QTLs will be useful for breeders to improve grain yield in environments where terminal heat stress is likely to occur.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR-10-BTBR-03cagence nationale de la recherche  a2015/0686cassociation nationale de la recherche et de la technologie  a2012Dcfonds de soutien à l'obtention végétale 3aTriticum aestivum 3aexperimental design 3agenome-wide association study 3agenomics 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3agrain yield 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3aleaf chlorophyll content 3aphenotype 3atemperature 3awheat 3aEurope1 aLafarge, Stéphane1 aRedondo, Elise1 aLievin, Vincent1 aDecoopman, Xavier1 aLe Gouis, Jacques1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5726-49021 aPraud, Sébastien0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2022 Mar., v. 135, no. 3 p.947-964dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl2874x0040-57527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-021-04008-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03818naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002300181245012800204300001600332506007600348520172100424592002802145506003702173650002002210650001802230650002502248650001502273650001002288650001902298650001902317650001602336650001202352650001402364650002302378650001602401650001702417650001202434650002402446650002102470650002102491650002202512650001802534650002102552650003202573650001602605700002902621700002402650700003002674700001702704700001702721700003002738700002402768700001902792700002202811700002102833700002602854700002102880700002602901773012202927856007403049852000903123655001203132IND60617730020221207115412.0181026e20180124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061773002DNAL7 a10.1039/c7fo01028a2doi7 aPMC57837632pmcid7 a291718482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreno-Ulloa, Aldo12aA pilot study on clinical pharmacokinetics and preclinical pharmacodynamics of (+)-epicatechin on cardiometabolic endpoints  ap. 307-319.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe reported that (−)-epicatechin can stimulate mitochondria biogenesis and improve metabolism. However, preliminary studies indicate that the (+) stereoisomer form may be more potent. We evaluated in a preliminary manner, the pharmacokinetics (PK) and initial safety analysis of (+)-epicatechin ((+)-Epi) in healthy and pre-diabetic subjects. Using a mouse model of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance, we also evaluated the metabolic effects of (+)-Epi vs. (+)-catechin (Cat) to determine class effects. In the Phase I PK study, subjects were provided a single incremental oral dose of (+)-Epi (10, 30 or 100 mg). For the PD study, subjects were provided a single 30 mg dose per day for 7 days. Blood samples were collected and safety measures were performed. Incremental doses of (+)-Epi increase the half-life of blood metabolites from 1.2–4.9 h. The compound was well tolerated and no adverse effects were reported. Seven day dosing of pre-diabetic subjects led to tendencies for reductions in circulating levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, which returned to baseline by 7 days after treatment. In animals, 2 weeks of oral dosing (0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 mg kg⁻¹ day⁻¹) dose dependently improved metabolism-related endpoints (weight gain, glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, with thresholds as low as 0.01 mg kg⁻¹ day⁻¹). Cat yielded no effects at 0.1 mg kg⁻¹ day⁻¹. Results indicate that (+)-Epi evidences a favorable PK and safety profile. Using a pre-clinical model, the compound positively modulates metabolism, which may link to mitochondrial effects. Effects are not due to general antioxidant actions, as Cat yielded no effects.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadverse effects 3aanimal models 3aantioxidant activity 3abiogenesis 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3achemokine CCL2 3acholesterol 3aglucose 3ahalf life 3ainsulin resistance 3ametabolites 3amitochondria 3aobesity 3aoral administration 3apharmacodynamics 3apharmacokinetics 3asafety assessment 3astereoisomers 3atriacylglycerols 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aweight gain1 aNájera-García, Nayelli1 aHernández, Marcela1 aRamírez-Sánchez, Israel1 aTaub, Pam R.1 aSu, Yongxuan1 aBeltrán-Partida, Ernesto1 aCeballos, Guillermo1 aDugar, Sundeep1 aSchreiner, George1 aBest, Brookie M.1 aCiaraldi, Theodore P.1 aHenry, Robert R.1 aVillarreal, Francisco0 tFood & function.g2018 Jan. 24, v. 9, no. 1 p.307-319dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7fo01028a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01848naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245012700180300001600307520058300323592002800906650002000934650001800954650001100972650001000983650001000993650001601003651001101019653001101030653002101041653001401062653001301076653001101089700001901100700002301119700001601142700001601158700002301174700001901197773010401216856008501320852000901405655001201414IND60568299120221121061451.0170504e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056829912DNAL7 a10.1080/09397140.2017.13054962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArslangündoğdu, Zeynel10aAutumn migration of the White Stork, Ciconia ciconia, and the Black Stork, C. nigra, over the Bosphorus (Aves: Ciconiidae)  ap. 103-108.  aThe Bosphorus is one of the main migration routes for soaring birds in Europe.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes, and clinical outcome of dogs with acute thoracolumbar intervertebral disc herniation (TL‐IVDH) with and without EH. ANIMALS: One hundred sixty client‐owned dogs that underwent MRI and hemilaminectomy for acute TL‐IVDH at a private practice in Colorado, including 63 dogs with EH and 97 dogs without EH. METHODS: Retrospective review of medical record data from 160 dogs presenting sequentially to a single practice with acute TL‐IVDH that underwent MRI and hemilaminectomy surgery. RESULTS: Sixty‐three of 160 (39%) dogs had confirmed EH. French Bulldogs were significantly overrepresented (23/63; odds ratio [OR]: 4.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8‐9.0; P < .001) of the EH cases. Dogs with EH were more likely to present with clinical signs less than 48 hours than were dogs without EH (24‐48 vs 48‐72 hours; OR: 2.4; 95% CI: 1.2‐4.6; P = .02) and were more likely to be nonambulatory on presentation (OR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.0‐4.1; P = .04). Dogs with EH were more likely to have <50% cross‐sectional spinal cord compression than dogs without EH (OR: 2.3 vs. 0.4; 95% CI: 1.2‐4.4 and 0.2‐0.9, respectively), longer longitudinal spinal cord compression (3 spaces vs 1 space, P < .001), and greater intrinsic spinal cord change (grade 3/severe vs grade 1/mild; P < .001) based on MRI. The location of the intervertebral disc herniation in French Bulldogs with EH was more likely to be thoracolumbar (OR: 10.8; 95% CI: 2.1‐55.7; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: French Bulldogs have a high prevalence of intervertebral disc‐associated EH. Dogs with EH have a shorter clinical course and are more likely to be nonambulatory on initial presentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfidence interval 3adisease course 3ahemorrhage 3aintervertebral disks 3amagnetism 3amedical records 3aodds ratio 3aspinal cord 3asurgery 3aveterinary medicine 3aColorado1 aWindsor, Rebecca1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7443-29121 aStewart, Samuel D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1148-25891 aFuerher‐Senecal, Lori1 aKhana, C.q(Chand),0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2022 July, v. 36, no. 4 p.1365-1372dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl43440x0891-66407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvim.164423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001200166245009300178300001400271520151200285592002801797650002901825650001801854650001401872650002101886650000901907650001001916650001001926650000901936700001601945700001501961700001701976700001401993700001802007700001502025700001602040700001702056773009802073856008102171852000902252655001202261IND60120229320221121042201.0150131e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012022932DNAL7 a252581192pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-014-3745-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Tao14aThe effect of L-carnosine on the circadian resetting of clock genes in the heart of rats  ap. 87-94.  aIt is reported that the circadian timing system may be included in the mechanism by which L-carnosine (Car) affects multiple physiological alterations including blood glucose, cardiovascular functions etc. However, it is not clear whether Car would affect the circadian rhythm of clock genes in the heart and what is the possible mechanism underlying. To clarify these issues, we compared the effects of Car on the expression of circadian genes in the heart of normal and vagotomized rats under control and jet lag conditions. The normal and vagotomized (va) male Wistar rats were divided into three groups respectively. The control and va-Control groups (fed with regular chow) were sampled before the reversal of LD cycle and feeding schedule (day 0). The normal and va-Normal resetting groups (fed with regular chow) as well as the Car and va-Car resetting groups (fed with Car-containing diet) were sampled on day 3 and day 5 after the experimental jet lag. Car-feeding obviously enhanced the resetting rates of clock genes (Bmal1, Dec1, Cry1) in the heart of normal rats after the experimental jet lag. The unilateral surgical vagotomy didn’t alter the diurnal expression patterns and resetting rates of the examined clock genes in normal diet feeding rats. In contrast, it abolished the Car-induced rapid resetting of the clock genes in the heart. Therefore, Car feeding plays a positive role in the circadian resynchronization of the heart clock, which is underlied by the autonomic nervous system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautonomic nervous system 3ablood glucose 3acarnosine 3acircadian rhythm 3adiet 3agenes 3aheart 3arats1 aTao, Yanlai1 aTsang, Fai1 aAbe, Keiichi1 aXu, Liang1 aJiang, Qianru1 aXu, Linfei1 aFu, Haoxuan1 aFu, Zhengwei0 tMolecular biology reports.g2015 Jan., v. 42, no. 1 p.87-94dSpringer-Verlagx0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-014-3745-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245010700174300001600281500001500297520101500312592002801327650001301355650001101368650001101379650002401390650001801414650001301432650001601445650002501461650000901486650001001495650001701505650001201522650001701534650002401551650001101575650001401586651002401600653001201624653001201636700002101648700002201669700002601691700002301717773010401740856008501844852000901929655001201938IND60568299220221121044859.0170504e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056829922DNAL7 a10.1080/09397140.2017.13055172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirkitadze, Giorgi10aRecords of bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) new to both Georgia and Transcaucasia revealed by DNA barcoding  ap. 154-160.  a2019-12-06  aCommunity composition of local pollinator assemblages, population dynamics and distribution patterns of many species are still poorly known, especially in little studied regions like Transcaucasia. We generated a total of 189 DNA barcodes from bees collected in 14 apple orchards in central and eastern Georgia to extend our knowledge of their distribution. Sequences (ca. 700 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene) were compared to the NCBI nucleotide database. Using a threshold of 98% similarity, analyses suggested that the sampled bees belong to 36 species of Apidae, Andrenidae, Halictidae, and Megachilidae. We report five bee species for the first time for Georgia: Andrena alfkenella Perkins, 1914, Halictus cochlearitarsis Dours, 1871, Nomada goodeniana (Kirby, 1802), Nomada ruficornis (Linnaeus, 1758) and Eucera nigrescens Pérez, 1879, four of which are also new for the Transcaucasia region. With these additions, the number of bee species known to occur in Georgia increases to 371.  aPublisher supplied data 3aorchards 3aapples 3aNomada 3acommunity structure 3aDNA barcoding 3aHalictus 3apollinators 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3abees 3agenes 3amitochondria 3aAndrena 3aMegachilidae 3apopulation dynamics 3aEucera 3adatabases 3aRepublic of Georgia 0arecords 0aApoidea1 aHusemann, Martin1 aPaxton, Robert J.1 aRadzevičiūtė, Rita1 aJaposhvili, George0 tZoology in the Middle East.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 63, no. 2 p.154-160dTaylor & Francisx2326-26807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09397140.2017.13055173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245008900155300001800244520136300262592002801625650001601653650002801669650001301697650001401710650001601724650001101740650001401751650001201765650002601777650001101803650001501814650001901829650001801848650001801866650001901884650001201903700001301915700001601928700001801944773014101962856007402103852000902177655001202186IND60685087520221119164343.0200227e20200225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068508752DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta14224j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qin10aNucleotide-driven skin-attachable hydrogels toward visual human–machine interfaces  ap. 4515-4523.  aGreat progress has been recently made in flexible and stretchable electronics. However, realizing the conformal contact between sensors and human skin as well as the visualization of human–machine interfaces is still a challenging task. Here, self-adhesive hydrogels with high transparency are successfully fabricated by a facile one-pot radical polymerization of acrylamide (AAm) and 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) in the presence of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) as a model nucleotide. The addition of a nucleotide makes the hydrogels promising conductors with robust adhesiveness, excellent mechanical behavior, and high optical transparency (transmittance of 94%). Remarkably, the hydrogels can conformally adhere to human skin and adapt its dynamic motions, which can work as skin-attachable wearable strain sensors for accurately monitoring human joint motions, breathing and voice signals. And the hydrogels are capable of perceiving pressure variations for the detection of human movement states, including walking, jogging, and jumping. Besides, the hydrogels featuring high transparency allow creating visual human–machine interfaces for clearly observing the skin condition in real time. This work proposes an innovative and facile strategy for the design of promising soft materials for sophisticated human–machine interfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aadhesion 3abreathing 3aelectronics 3ahumans 3ahydrogels 3ajumping 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apolymerization 3askin (animal) 3atransmittance 3auser interface 3awalking1 aLiu, Xin1 aDuan, Lijie1 aGao, Guanghui0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Feb. 25, v. 8, no. 8 p.4515-4523dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta14224j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03694naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245007700168500001900245520203300264592002802297650002402325650001302349650001102362650002002373650002202393650001302415650000702428650001502435650001602450650002402466650001802490650001802508650001102526650001302537651001002550653001602560653003302576653002402609700001702633700001802650700001802668700001402686700001802700700001702718700001502735700001602750700001402766700001402780700001602794700002002810700001402830700005602844773009602900856008702996852000903083655001203092IND60731303120221122104955.0210428e20210801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073130312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.1150752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Xinhao10aWetland reclamation homogenizes microbial properties along soil profiles  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWetlands store approximately one-third of soil carbon (C) in terrestrial ecosystems, and the loss of C in wetlands has been accelerated by reclamation. However, how wetland reclamation affects microbial properties along soil profiles remains unclear. In this study, we sampled 100 cm soil cores from a wetland and an adjacent cropland that has been cultivated for 23 years to evaluate the impacts of land conversion on soil microbial community structure and soil element concentrations in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeastern China. The C and nitrogen (N) concentrations in microbial biomass declined exponentially with depth in both the wetland and cropland with different magnitudes. Continuous cultivation for 23 years tended to homogenized C, N, phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S) contents in soils and microbial biomass along the soil profile. Compared with the wetland, C and N in cropland soils were lower, and microbial biomass C, N, P and S were lower in surface soils (0–30 cm), while higher in both middle soils (40–70 cm) and deep soils (70–100 cm). Cultivation narrowed the C:N:P:S stoichiometry in soils and microbial biomass, with large changes in surface soils and minor changes in deep soils. The Bray-Curtis dissimilarity test confirmed the large changes in surface soils while minor changes in deep soils. After 23-years of cultivation the abundances of fungi and bacteria were significantly reduced by approximately 90% and 78% in surface soils, but the bacterial abundance was enhanced by approximately 2–3 times in middle soils, leading to a decreasing fungi:bacteria ratio along soil profile in cropland. Soil TC and pH were the predominant factors controlling the microbial composition in wetland. The homogenizing impact of wetland reclamation on microbial properties along soil profiles suggests the different responses of microbial and soil elements to human activities, indicating a critical need of differentiating microbes from soils when examining soil elements under a changing environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity structure 3acropland 3ahumans 3aland use change 3amicrobial biomass 3anitrogen 3apH 3aphosphorus 3asoil carbon 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil profiles 3astoichiometry 3asulfur 3awetlands 3aChina 0aReclamation 0aSoil microbial stoichiometry 0aMicrobial community1 aZhang, Lihua1 aZuo, Yunjiang1 aLiu, Jianzhao1 aYu, Jielu1 aYuan, Fenghui1 aWang, Nannan1 aHe, Liyuan1 aWang, Yihui1 aGuo, Ziyu1 aSun, Ying1 aSong, Yanyu1 aSong, Changchun1 aGuo, Dufa1 aXu, Xiaofeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6553-65140 tGeoderma.g2021 Aug. 01, v. 395 p.115075-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.1150753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011800172520159900290592002801889650001401917650001401931650001001945650001501955650001101970650001001981650002101991650001002012650001402022650001602036651001102052653002002063653002302083653001702106653002002123700006002143700002302203700006102226700005802287773009902345856008502444852000902529655001202538IND60746022620221119191827.0211003e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074602262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2021.1057782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacquet, Florence14aThe micro-economic impacts of a ban on glyphosate and its replacement with mechanical weeding in French vineyards  aIn France, viticulture is the production sector that uses the highest amount of glyphosate per hectare. The prospect of banning this pesticide in France, and in Europe as a whole, has led us to study the existence of alternatives to this herbicide, following article 50.2 of the European regulation 1107/2009, and to estimate the additional costs involved. Based on a national public database, we synthesized the different weed control practices in viticulture and calculated their costs. Our results showed that alternative methods to the use of glyphosate are more or less widespread depending on the wine-producing area in France.Inter-row non-chemical weed control is widespread and involves mechanical operations, with or without the use of cover crops. The most difficult aspect concerns weed control between vine stocks within the rows (intra-row), without applying herbicide. The size of the farms, the structure of the vineyards and especially the distance between rows largely account for the differences in the adoption rates of glyphosate-free practices in wine-producing areas. In total, the additional cost of mechanical weeding compared to glyphosate chemical weeding is €250/ha on average, and varies from €12 to €553/ha depending on the wine-producing area. The generalization of alternatives to glyphosate-use under the European ban on glyphosate could have economic consequences on the income of farmers, the magnitude of which depends on several factors, including the type of vineyard, availability of labour and equipment on each farm, as well as marketing channels.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3aequipment 3afarms 3aglyphosate 3aincome 3alabor 3aplant protection 3avines 3avineyards 3aviticulture 3aFrance 0aEconomic impact 0aMechanical weeding 0aLabour costs 0aMachinery costs1 aDelame, Nathalie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4071-42701 aVita, Jesus Lozano1 aHuyghe, Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0958-96111 aReboud, Xavier1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6430-153X0 tCrop protection.g2021 Dec., v. 150 p.105778-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2021.1057783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01492naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245008500179300001600264520045000280592002800730650001600758650001400774650001000788650001600798651000900814653001200823653001600835653001100851653001600862653000900878653001600887700002900903773010400932856008501036852000901121655001201130IND60568299320221121061306.0170504e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056829932DNAL7 a10.1080/09397140.2017.13055202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeddighi Sadr, Mohammad12aA new species of Limnia Robineau-Desviody, 1830 (Diptera: Sciomyzidae) from Iran  ap. 161-165.  aA new species of the dipteran family Sciomyzidae is described from Iran: Limnia kassebeeri sp. n., which is similar to L. unguicornis (Scopoli, 1763) and L. paludicola Elberg, 1965, but differs from them by the reticulate pattern on the anal cell, the presence of one small seta on the anepisternum, in addition to fine hairs and the features of the genitalia. http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:FCD0AD91-E21D-44CA-9D11-90DE5A92F52D  aPublisher supplied data 3aSciomyzidae 3agenitalia 3ahairs 3anew species 3aIran 0aDiptera 0aSciomyzidae 0aLimnia 0anew species 0aIran 0aMiddle East1 aMohamadzade Namin, Saeed0 tZoology in the Middle East.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 63, no. 2 p.161-165dTaylor & Francisx2326-26807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09397140.2017.13055203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009900169300001400268520156400282592002801846650001101874650001701885650001701902650001201919650001801931650001001949650002401959650002101983700002102004700002502025700002102050700002202071700002502093773009002118856004802208852000902256655001202265IND50062985420221118032942.0130323e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006298542DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-012-1309-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodeghiero, Mirco10aComponents of forest soil CO₂ efflux estimated from Δ ¹⁴C values of soil organic matter   ap. 55-68.  aAIMS: The partitioning of the total soil CO₂ efflux into its two main components: respiration from roots (and root-associated organisms) and microbial respiration (by means of soil organic matter (SOM) and litter decomposition), is a major need in soil carbon dynamics studies in order to understand if a soil is a net sink or source of carbon. METHODS: The heterotrophic component of the CO₂ efflux was estimated for 11 forest sites as the ratio between the carbon stocks of different SOM pools and previously published (Δ¹⁴C derived) turnover times. The autotrophic component, including root and root-associated respiration, was calculated by subtracting the heterotrophic component from total soil chamber measured CO₂ efflux. RESULTS: Results suggested that, on average, 50.4 % of total soil CO₂ efflux was derived from the respiration of the living roots, 42.4 % from decomposition of the litter layers and less than 10 % from decomposition of belowground SOM. CONCLUSIONS: The Δ¹⁴C method proved to be an efficient tool by which to partition soil CO₂ efflux and quantify the contribution of the different components of soil respiration. However the average calculated heterotrophic respiration was statistically lower compared with two previous studies dealing with soil CO₂ efflux partitioning (one performed in the same study area; the other a meta-analysis of soil respiration partitioning). These differences were probably due to the heterogeneity of the SOM fraction and to a sub-optimal choice of the litter sampling period.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aforest soils 3aforests 3ameta-analysis 3aroots 3asoil organic matter 3asoil respiration1 aChurkina, Galina1 aMartínez, Cristina,1 aScholten, Thomas1 aGianelle, Damiano1 aCescatti, Alessandro0 tPlant and soil.g2013 Mar., v. 364, no. 1-2 p.55-68dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-012-1309-1  aDNAL 7aarticle03449naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245015800168300001800326520194300344592002802287650001602315650001602331650001202347650001702359650001702376650001002393650001002403650001002413650003102423650001402454650001202468650000902480650001202489650001102501650001402512650002202526650003502548650001502583700001502598700001902613700001902632700001802651700005602669773013802725856008302863852000902946655001202955IND60771494120221120061354.0220911e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077149412DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-021-04016-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeon, SeongChan10aIdentification of a candidate gene responsible for the G locus determining chartreuse bulb color in onion (Allium cepa L.) using bulked segregant RNA-Seq  ap. 1025-1036.  aKEY MESSAGE: A gene encoding a laccase responsible for chartreuse onion bulb color was identified. Markers tagging this gene showed perfect linkage with bulb colors among diverse germplasm. To identify a casual gene for the G locus determining chartreuse bulb color in onion (Allium cepa L.), bulked segregant RNA-Seq (BSR-Seq) was performed using yellow and chartreuse individuals of a segregating population. Through single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and differentially expressed gene (DEG) screening processes, 163 and 143 transcripts were selected, respectively. One transcript encoding a laccase-like protein was commonly identified from SNP and DEG screening. This transcript contained four highly conserved copper-binding domains known to be signature sequences of laccases. This gene was designated AcLAC12 since it showed high homology with Arabidopsis AtLAC12. A 4-bp deletion creating a premature stop codon was identified in exon 5 of the chartreuse allele. Another mutant allele in which an intact LTR-retrotransposon was transposed in exon 5 was identified from other chartreuse breeding lines. Genotypes of molecular markers tagging AcLAC12 were perfectly matched with bulb color phenotypes in segregating populations and diverse breeding lines. All chartreuse breeding lines contained inactive alleles of DFR-A gene determining red bulb color, indicating that chartreuse color appeared when both DFR-A and AcLAC12 genes were inactivated. Linkage maps showed that AcLAC12 was positioned at the end of chromosome 7. Transcription levels of structural genes encoding enzymes in anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway were generally reduced in chartreuse bulk compared with yellow bulk. Concentrations of total quercetins were also reduced in chartreuse onion. However, significant amounts of quercetins were detected in chartreuse onion, implying that AcLAC12 might be involved in modification of quercetin derivatives in onion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa 3aArabidopsis 3aalleles 3aanthocyanins 3abiosynthesis 3abulbs 3acolor 3aexons 3agene expression regulation 3agermplasm 3alaccase 3aloci 3amutants 3aonions 3aquercetin 3asequence analysis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3astop codon1 aHan, JiWon1 aKim, Cheol-Woo1 aKim, Ju-Gyeong1 aMoon, Jae-Hak1 aKim, Sunggil1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8555-29950 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2022 Mar., v. 135, no. 3 p.1025-1036dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl2874x0040-57527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-021-04016-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03739naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245015900170520210200329592002802431650000902459650001702468650001102485650002302496650001102519650001002530650001402540650001802554650001302572650001802585650001802603650001302621650001702634650002002651650002302671650001502694651001102709653002002720653002402740653001902764653002502783653002902808653003902837700001402876700001502890700001702905700002602922700001602948700001502964773010902979856008803088852000903176655001203185IND60766305720221121043443.0220326e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076630572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marenvres.2022.1055722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSturbois, A.10aSpatio-temporal patterns in stable isotope composition of a benthic intertidal food web reveal limited influence from salt marsh vegetation and green tide  aAssessing fluxes of matter and energy in food webs within and across benthic habitats is important to understand the ecological functioning in bays and estuaries, where the productivity is favoured by a wide diversity of primary producers. The temporal variability (March vs September 2019) in the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope composition of primary food sources and benthic invertebrates consumers was investigated in a large intertidal area (Western English-Channel, France). The study area is influenced by megatidal conditions and characterised by salt marshes in the sheltered part, and seasonal Ulva spp. blooms. The spatio-temporal variability in the structure of the benthic food web was analysed at the scales of both the whole bay and the different assemblages, which constitute the mosaic of habitats. Inferences on potential sources fuelling the food web were supported by spatio-temporal patterns based on covariations and stable isotope trajectory analysis. Results highlighted that phytoplankton, microphytobenthos and SOM were, most likely, the main food sources. The trophic connectivity between salt marsh and benthic habitats within the bay was limited to some macrofauna species inhabiting muddy creeks within the salt marsh. Unexpectedly, the influence of Ulva spp. blooms appeared also limited. Spatial patterns illustrates the constancy of the spatial variability in the benthic pelagic coupling, with a higher influence of microphytobenthos in the upper shore compared to low shore assemblages. This first attempt to characterize intertidal benthic food web constitutes a relevant baseline for the conservation of the bay of Saint-Brieuc where a national Nature Reserve has been created in 1998 for the conservation of overwintering birds. The spatial and temporal patterns of the benthic food web observed in this study (1) confirm the importance to consider food web variability at spatial and temporal scales from sampling designs to data analysis, and (2) demonstrate the ability of the stable isotope trajectory analysis framework to highlight food web dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUlva 3aalgal blooms 3acarbon 3aconservation areas 3aenergy 3afauna 3afood webs 3alittoral zone 3anitrogen 3aoverwintering 3aphytoplankton 3aresearch 3asalt marshes 3astable isotopes 3atemporal variation 3avegetation 3aFrance 0aMarine food web 0aBenthic assemblages 0aδ13C vs δ15N 0aTrophic connectivity 0aBenthic pelagic coupling 0aStable isotope trajectory analysis1 aRiera, P.1 aDesroy, N.1 aBrébant, T.1 aCarpentier, Anylène,1 aPonsero, A.1 aSchaal, G.0 tMarine environmental research.g2022 Mar., v. 175 p.105572-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1982x0141-11367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2022.1055723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245011100174520155800285592002801843650002701871650000901898650002601907650001301933650001201946650000701958650002801965650001301993650001402006650001102020650001302031650002502044650001802069651001002087653002602097653001602123653002602139653002102165700001602186700001502202700001702217700001602234700002002250700001702270700001502287700001702302773009102319856009002410852000902500655001202509IND60727495120221120190236.0220103e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072749512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1297162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Shuyuan10aDistribution of mercury isotope signatures in Yundang Lagoon, Xiamen, China, after long-term interventions  aIsotope signatures of mercury (Hg) were determined for Hg fractions in seawater, sediments, porewaters, core sediments and fish from the Yundang Lagoon, Xiamen, China. Sequential extraction was used to extract Hg fractions in sediments and the purge-trap method was used to preconcentrate Hg in seawater. A large variation in mass dependent fractionation (δ²⁰²Hg: −2.50‰ to −0.36‰) was observed in the lagoon. Seawater and fish samples showed positive mass-independent fractionation (Δ¹⁹⁹Hg: −0.06‰–0.45‰), while most of sediment and porewater samples displayed insignificant mass-independent fractionation (Δ¹⁹⁹Hg: −0.10‰–0.07‰). Ancillary parameters (total organic carbon, sulfide, pH, Eh, water content and grain size) were also measured in the sediments to investigate correlations with Hg isotopes. Three sources (domestic sewage, sediments and atmospheric deposition) were identified as the main sources of Hg in the lagoon seawater. Photochemical reaction was the main process causing isotope fractionation in seawater. Through Hg partitioning and deposition, light isotopes were enriched from dissolved Hg to particulate Hg, then to sediments, and then to porewaters. Finally, Hg isotope signatures were used to identify the Hg sources and fractionation processes in core sediments from different depths. Our results demonstrate that Hg isotopes are powerful tools for tracing Hg sources and arriving at a better understanding of Hg biogeochemical cycling in the lagoon after long-term interventions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric deposition 3afish 3aisotope fractionation 3aisotopes 3amercury 3apH 3aphotochemical reactions 3aseawater 3asediments 3asewage 3asulfides 3atotal organic carbon 3awater content 3aChina 0aSequential extraction 0aHg isotopes 0aIsotope fractionation 0aLagoon ecosystem1 aZhao, Yuhan1 aLv, Supeng1 aWang, Weiguo1 aWang, Weili1 aZhang, Yuanbiao1 aHuo, Yunlong1 aSun, Xiuwu1 aChen, Yaojin0 tChemosphere.g2021 June, v. 272 p.129716-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1297163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245017600163300001600339520152800355592002801883650001601911650002201927650003001949650001101979650003601990650002602026650001602052650001502068650001402083650002502097650001402122650001402136650001802150650002302168650002202191650002902213650001102242650002102253650001702274650000902291650001002300650001902310650002102329700002802350773012202378856007402500852000902574655001202583IND60617730320221120110959.0181026e20180124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061773032DNAL7 a10.1039/c7fo01044c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPradeep, Seetur R.10aAlleviation of oxidative stress-mediated nephropathy by dietary fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) seeds and onion (Allium cepa) in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats  ap. 134-148.  aOxidative stress plays a major role in the progression of diabetes and the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. In this study, the beneficial influence of dietary fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) seeds and onion (Allium cepa) on oxidative stress-mediated renal injury was evaluated in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in adult Wistar rats by the administration of streptozotocin (i.p. 45 mg kg⁻¹). Dietary interventions were made with 10% fenugreek seeds or 3% onion (freeze-dried) or their combination for 6 weeks. These dietary interventions countered nephromegaly in the diabetic animals, the increase in creatinine clearance and oxidative stress in renal tissue. These dietary interventions significantly countered the increased renal cholesterol and triglycerides associated with the diabetic condition. The up-regulation of the receptor for advanced glycation end products, inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers in the renal tissue of the diabetic rats was effectively countered. Renal 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, its excretion, DNA fragmentation and mitochondrial DNA deletion were significantly annulled in the diabetic rats by these dietary interventions. Generally, the beneficial effects were greater in the combined intervention, although they were not additive. Thus, the beneficial influence of dietary fenugreek and onion on oxidative stress-mediated renal injury is higher when consumed together and this may be a strategy to ameliorate diabetic nephropathy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa 3aDNA fragmentation 3aTrigonella foenum-graecum 3aadults 3aadvanced glycation end products 3aanimal disease models 3acholesterol 3acreatinine 3acytokines 3adiabetic nephropathy 3aexcretion 3afenugreek 3afreeze drying 3alaboratory animals 3amitochondrial DNA 3anutritional intervention 3aonions 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3arats 3aseeds 3astreptozotocin 3atriacylglycerols1 aSrinivasan, Krishnapura0 tFood & function.g2018 Jan. 24, v. 9, no. 1 p.134-148dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7fo01044c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003300153245013900186520115400325592002801479650001101507650001801518650001201536650002301548650001301571650001101584653002801595653001901623653002801642653001601670653002001686653004101706700003401747700002701781700002101808700002401829700002501853700002301878773010901901856008802010852000902098655001202107IND60766305820221121034506.0220326e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076630582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marenvres.2022.1055732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiedemann-Saldivia, Bárbara10aNon-consumptive effects of a predatory snail (Acanthina monodon) on a dominant habitat-forming mussel species (Perumytilus purpuratus)  aPredators can influence prey through direct consumption as well as through non-consumptive effects (NCEs). NCEs usually occur mediated by behavioral changes in the prey upon detection of predator cues. Such changes may involve reduction of feeding with a variety of physiological consequences. We evaluated NCEs from an intertidal predatory snail (Acanthina monodon) on a dominant habitat-forming mussel species (Perumytilus purpuratus) from the southeastern Pacific coast. We tested whether A. monodon exerts negative NCEs on clearance rate, oxygen consumption rate, biodeposit production, and between-valve gap size in P. purpuratus. We found that waterborne predator cues triggered a decrease in these variables except biodeposit production. However, the organic content of the biodeposits increased in the presence of predator cues. The snail's physical contact with the mussels strengthened the negative NCEs on between-valve gap size. Since P. purpuratus is a dominant filter-feeder and foundation species in rocky intertidal habitats, predator NCEs on this species might indirectly influence ecosystem-level processes and community structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3alittoral zone 3amussels 3aoxygen consumption 3aresearch 3asnails 0aNon-consumptive effects 0aClearance rate 0aOxygen consumption rate 0aBiodeposits 0aMussel behavior 0aTrait-mediated indirect interactions1 aBüchner-Miranda, Joseline A.1 aSalas-Yanquin, Luis P.1 aValdivia, Nelson1 aCatalán, Alexis M.1 aScrosati, Ricardo A.1 aChaparro, Oscar R.0 tMarine environmental research.g2022 Mar., v. 175 p.105573-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1982x0141-11367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2022.1055733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245013200170520116000302592002801462650001701490650001201507650001101519650001501530650001001545650001301555650002301568650000901591650001501600650001501615650001301630650001301643650001901656650001401675650001201689650001001701650002601711650001401737650001801751650001301769650001801782650000901800653001701809653002401826700001601850700001401866700001801880773012101898856008802019852000902107655001202116IND60688226420221118134349.0200509e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068822642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2020.1040432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Danping10aIntegration of the metabolome and transcriptome reveals the resistance mechanism to low nitrogen in wild soybean seedling roots  aWild soybean is the progenitor of cultivated soybean that has excellent low-nitrogen (N) tolerance. This study revealed the mechanism of resistance to low N in wild soybean seedling roots by analyzing the differences in the physiology, metabolome and transcriptome. Under low-N stress, low-N-tolerant wild soybean seedling roots underwent less growth inhibition, producing longer roots that had a higher carbon (C)/N ratio and C, NO₃⁻, Fe²⁺, Zn²⁺, Ca²⁺, K⁺ and B³⁺ contents compared with common wild soybean. The comparison of the metabolomes and transcriptomes of two genotypes of wild soybean revealed that low-N-tolerant wild soybean reduced its energy consumption by decreasing the synthesis of energy-consuming amino acids. In addition, it enhanced the synthesis of proline and secondary metabolites to resist low-N stress. Enhancing the metabolism of shikimic acid was a unique mechanism involved in low-N tolerance of the low-N-tolerant wild soybean. Moreover, some genes involved in flavonoid synthesis were identified. This study could provide a basis for the investigation and application of wild resources in soybean breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine soja 3acalcium 3acarbon 3aflavonoids 3agenes 3agenotype 3agrowth retardation 3airon 3ametabolism 3ametabolome 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aplant breeding 3apotassium 3aproline 3aroots 3asecondary metabolites 3aseedlings 3ashikimic acid 3asoybeans 3atranscriptome 3azinc 0aWild soybean 0aLow nitrogen stress1 aLi, Mingxia1 aLiu, Yuan1 aShi, Lianxuan0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2020 July, v. 175 p.104043-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2020.1040433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03278naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011200168300001600280520217900296592002802475650001902503650001102522650001602533650002902549650002102578651001302599653002902612653002202641653001902663653002202682653003302704773013102737856005102868852000902919655001202928IND50086618320221116175110.0140412e20120801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008661832DNAL7 a10.1080/1389224X.2012.6917832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerkvens, Jan10aWhat International Aid Organizations Can Learn From International Adult Learning: Experiences From Cambodia  ap. 347-368.  aPurpose: Many countries receive international support to strengthen professional capacity. The effect of these professional development activities (PDAs), however, is often negligible. This article provides useful insights on how international aid organizations could improve their PDAs, by describing an intervention developed and applied in Cambodia. This intervention aimed at developing a training approach to be used within the local ministry and increasing facilitation skills of government trainers in order to improve capacity building outcomes.Design/approach: The intervention incorporates contemporary (adult) learning theory and appreciates local expertise to the full. This was established through an educational design research (EDR) approach. EDR is a research methodology that is applied to design and test innovative interventions in poorly understood contexts.Findings: The intervention was successful in developing a capacity building approach and improved learning facilitation skills of ministerial staff. More time for collaboration, and incorporation of socio-constructivist and adult learning principles helped acknowledging the expertise of local staff. This had a positive effect on professional learning outcomes and ownership.Practical implications: The focus of this article is on the most important design principles for aid organizations and consultants for improving effectiveness of professional development and capacity building projects, and how to acknowledge and incorporate local expertise effectively.Originality/value: Usually, research into the effectiveness of professional development activities is limited to budgetary and organizational issues, leaving the learning component unexplored. This research excavates an alternative capacity building approach linking local expertise with contemporary knowledge on professional development. In addition, it contributes to the knowledge base on the learning component of PDAs and capacity building in Cambodia, both of which are poorly described in academic literature. The outcomes are also valuable for other contexts in which professional development and adult learning are involved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadult learning 3aadults 3aconsultants 3aprofessional development 3aresearch methods 3aCambodia 0aProfessional development 0aInternational aid 0aAdult learning 0aCapacity building 0aCulturally relevant learning0 tjournal of agricultural education and extension.g2012 Aug. 1, v. 18, no. 4 p.347-368dTaylor & Francis Groupx1750-86227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1389224X.2012.691783  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245009200173300001600265520131300281592002801594650004401622650001601666650002201682650003701704650001201741650002101753650002301774650001301797650002101810650002201831650000901853650000901862650001901871650001301890650001401903650001301917650003301930650003701963650003702000653001602037653002302053653003402076653002302110653000902133700006502142773010602207856008702313852000902400655001202409IND60605414920221120072920.0201202e20181020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060541492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.06.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeshoria, Shruti10aIn-situ preparation and properties of gold nanoparticles embedded polypyrrole composite  ap. 217-226.  aA composite was formed by polypyrrole (Ppy), gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) using chloroauric acid (HAuCl₄). MWCNT were carboxy functionalized by oxidation resulting into oxidized MWCNT (OMWCNT). The composite was characterized spectroscopically, structurally and morphologically by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectrocopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) studies which revealed about its successful formation. UV-Vis spectroscopy suggested the in-situ formation of AuNPs, their dispersion into the composite and presence of OMWCNT. XPS analysis revealed the existence of Au, C, N and O elements, signifying the desired formation of the composite. Morphological studies depicted the wrapping of OMWCNT by Ppy along with the presence of dispersed AuNPs. Its electrochemical examination suggested good electron transfer ability of AuNPs and OMWCNT. The interaction of composite with Cd²⁺ ions was investigated both optically and electrochemically, making it a potential candidate for Cd²⁺ sensing. Furthermore, its catalytic activity was also shown, by reduction of methylene blue dye.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acadmium 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalytic activity 3acolloids 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3agold 3aions 3amethylene blue 3ananogold 3aoxidation 3apyrroles 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aPolypyrrole 0aGold nanoparticles 0aMulti-walled carbon nanotubes 0aDye mineralization 0aCd2+1 aKumar Narula, Anudeep1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2657-63260 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Oct. 20, v. 555 p.217-226dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.06.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04392naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002700112245011700139300001600256506002800272520298700300592002803287506003703315650002103352650002503373650000903398650002403407650002403431650001503455650001303470650002403483650001603507650001103523653001803534653003403552653003903586653002403625653001403649700002303663700002703686700003303713773020303746852000903949655001203958IND60784512920221207092940.0201111e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078451292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPadilha, Vanessa Silva10aEfeito da participação em grupos operativos para redução de peso em conhecimentos e parâmetros nutricionais  ap. 250-259.  aResource is Open Access  aObjetivo: avaliar o nível de conhecimento sobre alimentação e nutrição, modificações nos hábitos alimentares e em variáveis antropométricas de usuários com sobrepeso e obesos antes e após participação em grupos de reeducação alimentar.

Although these materials are still inferior compared with DNA-based materials, they have demonstrated tremendous potential for more sophisticated applications in the biomedical field. In this review, we focus on recent advances concerning these materials. First, diverse synthetic strategies of nucleobase-functionalized polymers are introduced and summarized, emphasizing the accessible degree of polymerization and species of nucleobase functionalities. Template polymerization is highlighted as a novel and unique method for the synthesis of nucleobase-containing polymers. Various applications, such as drug and gene delivery carriers, supramolecular hydrogels and adhesives, and self-healing materials, are discussed. This review concludes with issues and challenges that are faced by this class of materials, in the hope of promoting further development of nucleobase-functionalized polymers for broader applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesives 3adrugs 3agene transfer 3ahydrogels 3anucleobases 3apolymerization 3apolymers1 aWang, Zhongkai1 aHua, Zan1 aTang, Chuanbing0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2020 Feb. 26, v. 8, no. 8 p.1576-1588dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9tb02393c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02379naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245006500163300001400228506002800242520130800270592002801578506003701606650001901643650001001662650001001672650001501682650001001697650002101707650001101728700001601739700001701755700002601772773013301798856007701931852000902008655001202017IND60784513020221207092938.0090701e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078451302DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha37130972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTămaș, Mircea,10aMorphological Research on Indigenous Sambucus Species Pollen  ap. 65-69.  aResource is Open Access  aThe pollen grains have a definite shape, size, colour, structure for each species, genus and family and these characters are useful for systematical botany. The pollen has nutritive properties due to its content: proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, vitamins, hormones and minerals. In the Romanian flora vegetate three species of Sambucus, but only S. nigra L. (elder or black elder) supplies a vegetal medical product, Sambuci flos or elder flowers, whereas the others species S. ebulus L. (dwarf elder) and S. racemosa L. (mountain elder or red elder) are considered adulterations. The pollen of Sambucus species were already studied using optical microscopy (Tarnavschi et al.), but the images are in one single layout, therefore the structure details cannot be easily notice. In this context the pollen grains of the three species already mentioned above were studied by SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy). The results demonstrated that this pollen have a small-middle size, oblat-sphaeroidal-prolat shape, threecolpat and the exine adornments are of reticulate type, haemitectate with sticks in the meshs of polygonale net. The flavonoids content is lower than in others species (0.146-0.564 %). The SEM analyse of Sambucus pollen allow a reliable identification of the genus but less for the species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSambucus nigra 3acolor 3aexine 3aflavonoids 3aflora 3alight microscopy 3apollen1 aPOP, Carmen1 aMARTIAN, Ada1 aBARBU-TUDORAN, Lucian0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g2009 June, v. 37, no. 1 p.65-69dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha37130973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245012100172300001800293520192500311592002802236650002202264650001102286650002302297650002402320650000902344650001602353650001802369650001802387650002502405650001702430650000902447650001602456650001002472700006602482700001602548700001702564773013802581856008302719852000902802655001202811IND60771494720221123044534.0220911e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077149472DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-021-04018-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaini, Dinesh Kumar10aMeta-QTLs, ortho-meta-QTLs and candidate genes for grain yield and associated traits in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)  ap. 1049-1081.  aKEY MESSAGE: In wheat, 2852 major QTLs of 8998 QTLs available for yield and related traits were used for meta-analysis; 141 meta-QTLs were identified, which included 13 breeder’s MQTLs and 24 ortho-MQTLs; 1202 candidate genes and 50 homologues of genes for yield from other cereals were also identified. Meta-QTL analysis was conducted using 2852 of the 8998 known QTLs, retrieved from 230 reports published during 1999–2020 (including 19 studies on tetraploid wheat) for grain yield (GY) and the following ten component traits: (i) grain weight (GWei), (ii) grain morphology-related traits (GMRTs), (iii) grain number (GN), (iv) spikes-related traits (SRTs), (v) plant height (PH), (vi) tiller number (TN), (vii) harvest index (HI), (viii) biomass yield (BY), (ix) days to heading/flowering and maturity (DTH/F/M), and (x) grain filling duration (GFD). The study resulted in the identification of 141 meta-QTLs (MQTLs), with an average confidence interval (CI) of 1.4 cM as against a CI of > 12.1 cM (8.8 fold reduction) in the QTLs that were used. The corresponding physical length of CI ranged from 0.01 Mb to 661.9 Mb (mean, 31.5 Mb). Seventy-seven (77) of these 141 MQTLs overlapped marker-trait associations (MTAs) reported in genome-wide association studies. Also, 63 MQTLs (each based on at least 10 QTLs) were considered stable and robust, with 13 MQTLs described as breeder’s MQTLs (selected based on small CI, large LOD, and high level of phenotypic variation explained). Thirty-five yield-related genes from rice, barley, and maize were also utilized to identify 50 wheat homologues in MQTLs. Further, the use of synteny and collinearity allowed the identification of 24 ortho-MQTLs which were common among the wheat, barley, rice, and maize. The results of the present study should prove useful for wheat breeding and future basic research in cereals including wheat, barley, rice, and maize.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3abarley 3abiomass production 3aconfidence interval 3acorn 3agrain yield 3aharvest index 3ameta-analysis 3aphenotypic variation 3aplant height 3arice 3atetraploidy 3awheat1 aŚrīvāstava, Pūjā,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9260-89311 aPal, Neeraj1 aGupta, P.

Yet, the high content of lignocellulosic and refractory materials causes the process to be relatively slow. Therefore, pretreatment methods have been proposed to shorten the hydrolysis phase. The present study examined the effectiveness of alkali pre-treatment (AP), ultrasonic pre-treatment (UP), and alkali-ultrasonic pre-treatment (AUP) applied on wheat straw (WS), solid fraction of cattle manure (SCM) and solid fraction of slaughterhouse waste (SSHW), by monitoring solubilisation ratio, anaerobic biodegradability and methane yield. The results indicate that the solubilisation ratio of the substrates improved regardless of the types of pre-treatment applied. Though, AP was more effective on WS and SSHW than other pre-treatments (UP and AUP), with approximately 47% and 17% extra methane, respectively. Moreover, AP of SCM caused an increased in methane production rate by 100% and minimised lag phase from 16 days to 1 day during anaerobic digestion. Based on Danish conditions, only AP of WS was economical prior to the biogas process due to high extra methane yield. A positive energy budget of 8 € t⁻¹ VS was calculated. High-energy consumption during UP and AUP in laboratory scale hindered the positive benefits of these pre-treatments.  aThis work was supported by Fondation Idella [grant number 17499] and Innovation Fund Denmark [grant number NomiGas: 1305-00018B].  aPublisher supplied data  a17499cFondation Idelladhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100007954  aNomigas: 1305-00018BcInnovation Fund Denmark 3aalkali treatment 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiodegradability 3abiogas 3acattle manure 3aenergy 3afeedstocks 3agas production (biological) 3ahydrolysis 3alignocellulose 3amethane 3amethane production 3amonitoring 3aslaughterhouse wastes 3aslaughterhouses 3asolubilization 3aultrasonics 3awheat straw 0aSolubilisation ratio 0aModified Gompertz 0aEnergy consumption 0aCost-effective1 aRomero-Guiza, Maycoll1 aMoset, Verónica1 aMøller, Henrik Bjarne1 aFernández, Belén0 tEnvironmental technology.g2020 Apr. 2, v. 41, no. 8 p.997-1006dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2018.15168023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01859naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245009000179300001200269520063800281592002800919650002000947650002500967650000900992650001701001650001001018650001601028650001101044650000901055650002701064650001201091650002601103650002701129650001101156650001501167651001201182700002501194700002201219773010501241856008201346852000901428655001201437IND60621487920221120202046.0181117s1997    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062148792DNAL7 a10.1177/1564826597018001072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLatunde-Dada, G.

Cereals, legumes, tubers, and vegetables are the main food types. Although most of these food items have considerable iron, its low bioavailability is one of the factors accounting for the high incidence of iron-deficiency anaemia. The traditional processing procedures, fermentation and germination, improved the chemical and bioavailable iron in the foods studied. Techniques of measuring iron availability in vitro and in vivo were applied to a variety of foods. The advantages and disadvantages of the methods employed are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3adeveloping countries 3adiet 3afermentation 3afoods 3agermination 3agrains 3airon 3airon deficiency anemia 3alegumes 3anutrient deficiencies 3atraditional technology 3atubers 3avegetables 3aNigeria1 aChandra Babu, Suresh1 aChapasuka, Evance0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 18, no. 1 p.1-6dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1564826597018001073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03741naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100005800154245010500212520213700317592002802454650001702482650000902499650001602508650001202524650001602536650002202552650002302574650001702597650001102614650002302625650001602648650001602664650001502680650001802695650001402713650001302727650002402740650001102764650001902775651001302794653001202807653001702819653003302836653001102869653001402880700006602894700005702960773009603017856008903113852000903202655001203211IND60746023520221119191526.0220124e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074602352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.1056642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOwusu, Raphael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4871-278210aCommunity-based Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR): Determinants and policy implications in Tanzania  aForest landscape restoration (FLR) has gained global scientific and political attention in recent times, with many sub-Saharan African countries committing to restoration targets. Despite the commitments, there is a dearth of information on the factors shaping community participation in FLR in the context of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). To close this gap, this study explored Babati District in Tanzania to investigate determinants, choices and policy implications of community-based FLR. A total of 98 households were surveyed in two villages, complemented by four experts’ interviews. We employed a hybrid analytical lens; the socio-ecological co-evolution, and the livelihoods framework for the study. The logistic regression analyses revealed that: (i) while both perceived monetary and non-monetary benefits shape households’ interest in FLR, asset-poor households are more interested in the monetary benefits than their rich counterparts, (ii) households FLR choices are largely shaped by the effectiveness of community-based institutions, (iii) natural, financial and social capital positively shaped households’ choices in FLR while a negative link was established for physical capital, and (iv) crop farmers choose to participate in FLR activities by growing a mixture of fruit and native timber tree species while those in other professions participated by planting only fruit trees species. Policy interventions which valorise community-based institutions should be prioritized to ensure equitable land access and tenure security, and promote the growing of native species. This would increase trust on land tenure and would invariably enhance participation in FLR activities. Moreover, policy incentives (e.g., training, micro-credit and market access) should be introduced to foster agro-based restoration approaches – involving the deliberate combination of tree-planting with crop-farming (agroforestry). Finally, policy support for alternative livelihood strategies such as bee keeping, butterfly gardening, snail and mushroom farming should be promoted to reduce monetary expectations from FLR interventions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroforestry 3abees 3abutterflies 3acapital 3acoevolution 3acommunity service 3aforest restoration 3aforest trees 3afruits 3aindigenous species 3aland policy 3aland tenure 3alivelihood 3amarket access 3amushrooms 3apolitics 3aregression analysis 3asnails 3asocial capital 3aTanzania 0aChoices 0aDeterminants 0aForest landscape restoration 0aAssets 0aInterests1 aKimengsi, Jude Ndzifon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1927-74431 aMoyo, Francis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9143-663X0 tLand use policy.g2021 Oct., v. 109 p.105664-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.1056643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03493naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011200166300001600278506011700294506007600411520139000487592002801877506003701905650001701942650002001959650002201979650001102001650001902012650002202031650001702053650001602070650001302086650001602099650001802115650001302133650000902146650001102155650002202166650001402188650001702202650002902219650002602248650002602274653001402300653001802314653002202332653002102354653002302375700001802398700001802416700001702434700001802451700001402469700001902483700001802502700001902520700002102539700001502560700002102575773011902596856008302715852000902798655001202807IND60788721920221207141121.0220816e202301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078872192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fshw.2022.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Chunxing14aThe mechanisms of melanogenesis inhibition by glabridin: molecular docking, PKA/MITF and MAPK/MITF pathways  ap. 212-222.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGlabridin is the main ingredient of hydrophobic fraction in licorice extract and has been shown to have anti-melanogenesis activity in skins. However, the underlying mechanism(s) remain not completely understood. The aim of this study is thus to elucidate the possible mechanisms related to the melanogenesis suppression by glabridin in cultured B16 murine melanoma cells and in UVA radiation induced hyperpigmentation model of BALB/c mice as well. Molecular docking simulations revealed that between catalytic core residues and the compound. The treatment by glabridin significantly downregulated both transcriptional and/or protein expression of melanogenesis-related factors including melanocyte stimulating hormone receptor (MC1R), microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), tyrosinase (TYR), TYR-related protein-1 (TRP-1) and TRP-2 in B16 cells. Both PKA/MITF and MAPK/MITF signaling pathways were found to be involved in the suppression of melanogenesis by glabridin in B16 cells. Also in vivo glabridin therapy significantly reduced hyperpigmentation, epidermal thickening, roughness and inflammation induced by frequent UVA exposure in mice skins, thus beneficial for skin healthcare. These data further look insights into the molecular mechanisms of melanogenesis suppression by glabridin, rationalizing the application of the natural compound for skin healthcare.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afood science 3ahealth services 3ahormone receptors 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3ahyperpigmentation 3ainflammation 3aingredients 3alicorice 3amelanocytes 3amelanogenesis 3amelanoma 3amice 3amodels 3aprotein synthesis 3aroughness 3atherapeutics 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3aultraviolet radiation 0aGlabridin 0aMelanogenesis 0aMolecular docking 0aPKA/MITF pathway 0aMAPK/ MITF pathway1 aLiu, Xiaoying1 aZheng, Yating1 aZhang, Zejun1 aLi, Yongliang1 aChe, Biao1 aLiu, Guangrong1 aZhang, Lanyue1 aDong, Changzhi1 aAisa, Haji Akber1 aDu, Zhiyun1 aYuan, Zhengqiang0 tFood science and human wellness.g2023 Jan., v. 12, no. 1 p.212-222dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23299x2213-45307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fshw.2022.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01942naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245010700166300001600273520074800289592002801037650001501065650002801080650001401108650002401122650001101146653003601157653002201193653003101215653003001246653002301276653002401299700001901323773014301342856008601485852000901571655001201580IND60568300120221117160258.0200115e20170102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056830012DNAL7 a10.1080/01621459.2015.11226022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Qing10aWeighted Statistic in Detecting Faint and Sparse Alternatives for High-Dimensional Covariance Matrices  ap. 188-200.  aThis article considers testing equality of two population covariance matrices when the data dimension p diverges with the sample size n (p/n → c > 0). We propose a weighted test statistic that is data-driven and powerful in both faint alternatives (many small disturbances) and sparse alternatives (several large disturbances). Its asymptotic null distribution is derived by large random matrix theory without assuming the existence of a limiting cumulative distribution function of the population covariance matrix. The simulation results confirm that our statistic is powerful against all alternatives, while other tests given in the literature fail in at least one situation.

Powdery mildew is a devastating foliar disease occurring in most wheat-growing areas. Characterization and fine mapping of genes for powdery mildew resistance can benefit marker-assisted breeding. We previously identified a stable quantitative trait locus (QTL) QPm.caas-3BS for adult-plant resistance to powdery mildew in a recombinant inbred line population of Zhou8425B/Chinese Spring by phenotyping across four environments. Using 11 heterozygous recombinants and high-density molecular markers, QPm.caas-3BS was delimited in a physical interval of approximately 3.91 Mb. Based on re-sequenced data and expression profiles, three genes TraesCS3B02G014800, TraesCS3B02G016800 and TraesCS3B02G019900 were associated with the powdery mildew resistance locus. Three gene-specific kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) markers were developed from these genes and validated in the Zhou8425B derivatives and Zhou8425B/Chinese Spring population in which the resistance gene was mapped to a 0.3 cM interval flanked by KASP14800 and snp_50465, corresponding to a 431 kb region at the distal end of chromosome 3BS. Within the interval, TraesCS3B02G014800 was the most likely candidate gene for QPm.caas-3BS, but TraesCS3B02G016300 and TraesCS3B02G016400 were less likely candidates based on gene annotations and sequence variation between the parents. These results not only offer high-throughput KASP markers for improvement of powdery mildew resistance but also pave the way to map-based cloning of the resistance gene.  aPublisher supplied data  a31961143007cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aU1904109cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a202102110016cHenan Science and Technology Foundation 3aTriticum aestivum 3achromosomes 3afoliar diseases 3aheterozygosity 3ainbred lines 3aphenotype 3apowdery mildew 3aquantitative trait loci 3aresistance genes 3asequence diversity 3awheat1 aXu, Dengan1 aXu, Xiaowan1 aRen, Yan1 aGao, Fengmei1 aSong, Jie1 aJia, Aolin1 aHao, Yuanfeng1 aHe, Zhonghu1 aXia, Xianchun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2071-197X0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2022 Mar., v. 135, no. 3 p.1083-1099dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl2874x0040-57527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-021-04019-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001300149245009800162300001600260500001500276520186500291592002802156650001702184650001302201650001602214650001302230650001202243650002302255650001002278650001002288650002502298650001302323650002302336650000902359650001102368650001702379650001002396650001802406650001002424650001002434653002502444700002002469700001602489700001702505773011302522856008502635852000902720655001202729IND4467946220221118032906.0141112e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446794622DNAL7 a10.1016/S1875-2780(11)60023-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Lei,10aRoot Infection and Systematic Colonization of DsRed-Labeled Fusarium verticillioides in Maize  ap. 793-802.  a2019-12-06  aFusarium verticillioides (Sacc.) Nirenberg [syn. F. moniliforme J. Sheld., teleomorph: Gibberella fujikuroi (Sawada) Ito in Ito & K. Kimura] is an important causal agent of diseases in maize (Zea mays L.) worldwide, which invades maize plants at all growth stages. This filamentous fungus not only incites obvious symptoms on maize root, stem, and ear, but also is able to infect plants without any visible symptom (endophytic infection). Fluorescent reporter gene-labeled filamentous fungus permits in vitro and in planta monitoring growth and development of the fungus. In this study, gene DsRed encoding red fluorescent protein was delivered into F. verticillioides strain Fv-1 via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Using the DsRed-tagged F. verticillioides, systemic colonization of the fungus in root and stem of the susceptible maize inbred line B73 was investigated to understand the interaction between F. verticillioides and maize. The fungus invaded and multiplied inside the lateral root tissues. Some conidia tended to colonize on the veins of maize root surface and grow along the veins after their germination. Whereas, some others penetrated the plant cells where they attached and formed hyphae for attacking cells nearby. Usually, the mycelia migrated from root to stem through intercellular parts of tissues, while some mycelia ran across different host cells. The colony forming unit (CFU) values from root tended to decrease following the inoculation time, but those from stem inclined to increase. This indicates that F. verticillioides is able to attack the aboveground parts of plant via systemic colonization on root. The results from the present study are useful in disclosing the interaction between F. verticillioides and maize, and can be extended to studying interactions between other soil-borne fungi and plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant growth 3aZea mays 3agermination 3aproteins 3aconidia 3aetiological agents 3astems 3ahosts 3adevelopmental stages 3amycelium 3aFusarium fujikuroi 3acorn 3ahyphae 3aaerial parts 3agenes 3aAgrobacterium 3aroots 3afungi 0aGibberella fujikuroi1 aWANG, Xiao-Ming1 aXU, Rong-Qi1 aLI, Hong-Jie0 tActa agronomica sinica.g2011 May, v. 37, no. 5 p.793-802dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000136x1875-27807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1875-2780(11)60023-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02762naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245010400182300001600286520096600302592002801268650002301296650001601319650001101335650001501346650001701361650002201378650001901400650001701419650002601436650003901462650001601501650004101517650001201558650003701570650003501607650003901642650003701681650002001718650002201738650004201760650004101802700001701843700002201860700001701882700001301899700002101912700002001933700002101953700002401974773012901998856004802127852000902175655001202184IND4474544320221118032824.0120313e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447454432DNAL7 a223108422pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-012-0538-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Anjani10aMicrobial Biomass and Carbon Mineralization in Agricultural Soils as Affected by Pesticide Addition  ap. 538-542.  aA laboratory study was conducted with four pesticides, viz. a fungicide (carbendazim), two insecticides (chlorpyrifos and cartap hydrochloride) and an herbicide (pretilachlor) applied to a sandy clay loam soil at a field rate to determine their effect on microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and carbon mineralization (Cmin).

In order to overcome these limitations, the nanoparticulate CsA delivery technology has been recently proposed to improve CsA immunosuppressive potential, however, its neuroprotective action has not been sufficiently studied. Thus, in the present study two types of (bio)polyelectrolyte-coated nanocapsules containing CsA (AOT/PLL-CsA and AOT/PLL/PGA-CsA) were synthesized using a nanoemulsification technique and the layer-by-layer (LbL) saturation method. By using human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, we demonstrated that CsA alone at a concentration above 0.1 μM had a cell-damaging effect. CsA at lower concentrations (0.1–10 nM) was devoid of toxicity and reduced the hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂)-induced cell damage, whereas its higher contents (0.5 and 1 μM) increased oxidative stress-induced cell death. Further studies showed that both forms of nanoencapsulated CsA were biocompatible and protected SH-SY5Y cells against the H₂O₂-induced damage in the range of concentrations 0.04–0.16 μM, therefore, the proposed nanoformulations for CsA delivery are suitable to reduce its cytotoxic effects and enhance the neuroprotective activity against oxidative stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood-brain barrier 3acell death 3acolloids 3acyclosporine 3acytotoxicity 3aemulsifying 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aimmunosuppression 3ananocapsules 3aneuroprotective effect 3aoxidative stress 3apermeability 0aPolyelectrolyte nanocapsules 0aCyclosporine A 0aSH-SY5Y cells 0aHydrogen peroxide 0aNeurotoxicity1 aJantas, Danuta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6789-44891 aLeśkiewicz, Monika1 aSzczepanowicz, Krzysztof1 aWarszyński, Piotr1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5449-90601 aLasoń, Władysław0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Oct. 20, v. 555 p.264-269dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04156naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100001700157245006300174300001400237506002800251520291300279592002803192506003703220650001103257650001203268650001103280650001603291650002203307650001703329650000903346650002603355650000903381650001903390651001203409653002103421653001803442653001903460700001903479773013503498856009203633852000903725655001203734IND60784513920221207081359.0200207e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078451392DNAL7 a10.33249/2663-2144-2019-83-10-58-632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHrytsai, А.13aAn estimation of the energy potential of biogas of ukraine  ap. 58-63.  aResource is Open Access  aOn account of the growing interest in the fuel and energy complex of Ukraine to efficient use of renewable energy resources in order to supplement and replace the traditional fossil energy sources, there is a need for an objective analysis and evaluation of available renewable resources to generate the heat and electricity. One such alternative energy source is biogas. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the technically achievable energy potential of biogas of Ukraine, which can be obtained from animal waste and from landfills of solid household waste. The objectives of the study are, first, an analysis of the livestock and poultry population and the mass of municipal solid waste in Ukraine as a resource base for renewable energy sources; second, to calculate the technically achievable energy potential of biogas obtained as a result of the energy conversion of the biomass used. The analysis of the livestock and poultry population and the mass of municipal solid waste shows that the largest number of livestock is kept in farms in Poltava, Cherkasy and Chernihiv regions, the smallest one is in Zakarpattia region. The largest number of pigs in Ukraine is in the Donetsk and Kiev regions, the smallest one is in the Transcarpathian and Luhansk regions. With regard to municipal waste, the largest amount was generated in Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk and Kyiv regions, the smallest one is in Kherson, Lugansk and Volyn regions. The biogas energy potential calculations were performed using the mathematical relationships known and adapted to quantify biogas energy potential from animal manure (or poultry manure) and from the organic component of landfills. An estimation of the technically achievable energy potential of biogas (the amount of energy in terms of conventional fuel which can be obtained from the of biomass available for energy conversion in existing energy generating installations with characteristic technical and economic parameters) from the manure of animals or the breeding of poultry their different types (cattle, pigs, chickens) and from solid waste household waste landfills were conducted both in each oblast and in Ukraine as a whole. According to the estimation the technically available energy potential of biogas of Ukraine is 1.6 mln tons of fuel equivalent, or 1.1 mln tons of oil equivalent. The scale of possible utilization of technically available energy potential of biogas by regions of Ukraine is represented by the table 2. Most of all due to the use of this potential it is possible to reduce the consumption of organic fuel in Kharkiv, Vinnitsa, Cherkasy, Dnipropetrovsk and Kyiv regions, where it is 98 ... 269 thousand tons of fuel equivalent, or 69…188 thousand tons of oil equivalent.

After the nematodes were incubated with modified KGM, the survival rate of nematodes under oxidative and heat stress, as well as the fertility and locomotion were measured. KGM(2-5) with molecular weight of 212, 124, 94 and 67 kDa can significantly prolong the mean and maximum lifespan of nematodes in the presence of paraquat. Under heat stress, all partially degraded konjac glucomannan (PDKGM) showed the significant extension of survival rates. Da(1-3) with deacetylation of 7%, 32% and 46% improved the survival rates of nematodes under oxidative stress. Furthermore, genes expression showed that KGM(2-5) and Da(1-3) upregulated the expression of sod-3, hsp-16.2, and atf-7. Taken together, molecular weight reduction or deacetylation of KGM have a significant impact on the stress resistance in vivo. PDKGM applied in stress resistance will be suggested not to exceed 200 kDa and deacylation of KGM will be suggested to be below 50%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aheat stress 3akonjac mannan 3alocomotion 3alongevity 3amolecular weight 3aoxidative stress 3aparaquat 3aphysical fitness 3astress tolerance 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asurvival rate 3aweight loss 0aKonjac glucomannan 0aMolecular weight 0aAcetyl group 0aStress resistance in vivo 0aCaenorhabditis elegans1 aZhang, Yu1 aPeng, Yundi1 aWang, Yangming1 aLi, Bin1 aTian, Jing0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Apr. 15, v. 204 p.397-409dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.01.1613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04613naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245014300173300001600316520279100332592002803123650002203151650002203173650002303195650001703218650001503235650001103250650001303261650001603274650001803290650001003308650001303318650001803331650001803349650002203367650001303389650001103402650002303413650001203436650001303448650001603461650002103477650002303498650001503521650001803536650001603554653001803570653002103588653002303609653001203632653001903644653001403663653002003677700002603697700006203723773010603785856008703891852000903978655001203987IND60605415720221120083944.0201202e20181020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060541572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValenta, Tomáš10aDetermination of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of food hydrocolloids/water interactions by means of thermal analysis and viscometry  ap. 270-279.  aThe aim of this study was to determine thermal properties of pseudoplastic polysaccharides (guar gum, κ-carrageenan and xanthan gum) which find many applications as food hydrocolloids in food industry. There was an obvious relationship between thermal dependency of heats of fusion of hydrocolloids in powder form and activation parameters of hydrodynamic flow in solutions, respectively. Results of thermal analysis confirmed, that powder samples of hydrocolloids as typical foodstuffs of low moisture content less than 15 w% after room conditioning, exhibited varying ability to bind water as depending on their molecular structure. The peak temperature of the endothermic polysaccharide order-disorder phase transition process was found in the temperature range of 50–85 °C. It was influenced simultaneously by the applied heating rate and the samples moisture content. Studied samples moisture content was ranging between 9–40 w.% as was obtained after different conditioning. Observed reaction enthalpy (ΔH) associated with phase transition and water evaporation (proved by appropriate weight loss of the samples Δmw) was ranging from 140 to 670 J/g. Activation energy (Eₐ) of this process in powder samples was calculated from the kinetic parameters using three kinetic models developed by Friedman, Kissinger and model-free kinetics. The latter kinetic models were compared with the Arrhenius model, which was used to determine Eₐ of polysaccharide solutions on reflecting sensitivity of their molecular structure to the temperature and the solvent. According to the Arrhenius model, there were obtained the highest values of Eₐ for κ-carrageenan solutions, indicating the highest resistance of their molecular structure to temperature. This fact can be related to the observed the lowest value of the reaction enthalpy in the case of powder samples, suggesting that energy obtained during the order-disorder transition to change the carrageenan powder structure is limited. On the other hand, xanthan gum was the least temperature dependent sample; activation energy of xanthan solutions was only in the range of 2–6 kJ/mol. Concurrently, ΔH of xanthan powder was determined as the largest of all samples under study. In general, there was found an indirect relationship between activation energy of the solutions determined by viscometry and reaction enthalpy of the powders determined by thermal analysis. Results of the Arrhenius model also indicate that the energy necessary to promote viscous flow of solutions is higher for hydrocolloids in distilled water rather than in 0.07 M KCl aqueous solutions, suggesting the suppression of the polyelectrolyte effect. In both cases, Eₐ was substantially reduced by application of higher shear rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aaqueous solutions 3achemical structure 3aelectrolytes 3aendothermy 3aenergy 3aenthalpy 3aevaporation 3afood industry 3afoods 3aguar gum 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrodynamics 3akappa carrageenan 3akinetics 3amodels 3apotassium chloride 3apowders 3asolvents 3atemperature 3athermal analysis 3athermal properties 3aviscometry 3awater content 3axanthan gum 0aHydrocolloids 0aMoisture content 0aThermal properties 0aTGA/DTA 0aKinetic models 0aViscosity 0aArrhenius model1 aLapčíková, Barbora1 aLapčík, Lubomír1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9917-73100 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Oct. 20, v. 555 p.270-279dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245004800169300001600217520130800233592002801541650002201569650001401591650002501605650001701630650001101647650001301658650001201671650002101683650001401704650001101718653002701729653002201756653002801778653002301806700001901829700002701848700002601875773010801901856008602009852000902095655001202104IND60525294420221122234027.0190318e20160101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052529442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.08.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConley, Kevin10aOrigin of the twist of cellulosic materials  ap. 285-299.  aMolecular Mechanics, Hartree–Fock, and semi-empirical geometry optimizations were carried out on cellulose oligomers and crystallites with and without water solvation. The intramolecular bonding is visualized with the Delocalized Molecular Orbitals (DLMOs). Internal coordinates were relaxed and the structures were gradient optimized for cellulose oligomers composed of 4, 10, 12, 14, 19, and 65 glucose units. The cellulose conformation of minimum energy deviates from the flat ribbon conformation giving rise to half-twist repeating units of about 3–4nm and 60nm along the chain axis. An optimized cellulose chain which is ten glucose units long is 9.57kcal/mol more stable than the flat ribbon model. The DLMOs show the twisted model retains the same hydrogen bonding scheme as the flat model while minimizing steric interactions between H1 and H4′. In cellulose crystallites the twist, which can be left- or right-handed, calls into question the assumption of twofold symmetry in the current flat unit cell. Additionally the hydrogen bonded sheets reorient themselves, suggesting the crystallites are in fact crystalloids. The overall length of the crystal twist is dependent on the cross-section of the crystal. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the optimized crystallites were simulated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acellulose 3acellulosic materials 3acrystallites 3aenergy 3ageometry 3aglucose 3ahydrogen bonding 3amechanics 3amodels 0aCellulose conformation 0aHelical chirality 0aComputational Chemistry 0aTwist of Cellulose1 aGodbout, Louis1 aWhitehead, M.A. (Tony)1 avan de Ven, Theo G.M.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2016 Jan. 01, v. 135 p.285-299dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.08.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001800140245013300158300001300291500000900304500001500313520195400328592002802282650002202310650001002332650002702342650002102369650001602390650002202406653002402428700002502452700002002477773011502497852000902612856007702621655001202698IND4381013420221119113128.0191126e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438101342DNAL7 a10.2136/vzj2004.01752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeol, Yongkoo13aAn Evaluation of the Active Fracture Concept in Modeling Unsaturated Flow and Transport in a Fractured Meter-Sized Block of Rock  ap. 1-13.  aepub  a2019-12-06  aNumerical simulation is an effective and economical method for optimally designing laboratory experiments and deriving practical experimental conditions. We executed a detailed numerical simulation study to examine the active fracture concept (AFC) using a 1-m³-sized block model. The numerical simulations for this study were performed by applying various experimental conditions, including different bottom flow boundaries, varying injection rates, and different fracture–matrix interaction (i.e., by increasing absolute matrix permeability at the fracture–matrix boundary) for a larger fracture interaction under transient or balanced-state flow regimes. Two conceptual block models were developed based on different numerical approaches: a two-dimensional discrete-fracture-network model (DFNM) and a one-dimensional dual-continuum model (DCM). The DFNM was used as a surrogate for a natural block to produce synthetic breakthrough curves of water and tracer concentration under transient or balanced-state conditions. The DCM is the approach typically used for the Yucca Mountain Project because of its computational efficiency. The AFC was incorporated into the DCM to capture heterogeneous flow patterns that occur in unsaturated fractured rocks. The simulation results from the DCM were compared with the results from the DFNM to determine whether the DCM could predict the water flow and tracer transport observed in the DFNM at the scale of the experiment. It was found that implementing the AFC in the DCM improved the prediction of unsaturated flow and that the flow and transport experiments with low injection rates in the DFNM compared better with the AFC implemented DCM at the 1-m³ scale. However, the estimated AFC parameter varied from 0.38 to 1.0 with different flow conditions, suggesting that the AFC parameter was not sufficient to fully capture the complexity of the flow processes in a 1-m³ discrete fracture network.  aPublisher supplied data 3asimulation models 3arocks 3aunsaturated conditions 3aunsaturated flow 3avadose zone 3ahydrologic models 0amathematical models1 aKneafsey, Timothy J.1 aItō, Kazumasa,0 tVadose zone journal.g2006 Jan., v. 5, no. 1 p.1-13dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2004.01753Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01957naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245011300177300001600290520099600306592002801302650001501330650001201345650001301357653001901370653002001389653003001409653001301439773010801452856008601560852000901646655001201655IND60525294520221122234235.0190318e20160101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052529452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.08.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Gorder, Robert A.10aExact closed-form solution to jet flow of a polymer arising in the electrospun nanofiber elaboration process  ap. 187-190.  aIn the present paper, we obtain the exact solution to the jet flow of a polymer arising in the electrospun nanofiber elaboration process. This allows us to improve on the approximate solutions of Colantoni and Boubaker (2014) and He, Kong, Chen, Hu, and Chen (2014). Our corrected and far simpler solution is more useful for extracting the salient physics inherent in the electrospun nanofiber elaboration process. We then consider the more robust formulation of the problem, in which the velocity of the jet and the radius of the jet depend strongly on one another, obtaining the solution in this case as well. All of the results obtained are rather simple, and give us closed-form exact solutions (rather than complicated approximations), and hence these results both maintain accuracy and have the possibility of being useful for future studies into the physics of such mechanical processes. The results also agree nicely with experimental and numerical results present in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3ananofibers 3aphysics 3apolymers 0aExact solution 0aElectrospinning 0aVibration-electrospinning 0aJet flow0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2016 Jan. 01, v. 135 p.187-190dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.08.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008800168300001200256520140700268592002801675650001901703650002501722650003201747650002201779650002601801651001101827651000901838651001801847773010501865856008201970852000902052655001202061IND60621488320221120202041.0181117s1997    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062148832DNAL7 a10.1177/1564826597018002102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBesrat, Abraham10aExperience of International Food and Nutrition Initiatives for Developing Countries  ap. 1-4.  aThe contribution of the United Nations University over the past two decades to institutional capacity-building for research and high-level training in the area of food and nutrition for developing countries stands out prominently among international and bilateral agencies. More than 600 researchers and young scientists, accounting for about 44% of all UNU fellowships awarded, have received postgraduate training in this area. Nearly 70% of the fellowships were hosted at UNU-associated institutions located in industrialized and developing countries. Reflecting UNU's interest in promoting cooperation in the South-South context, a little over one-half of the fellowships awarded for postgraduate research and training have been implemented in developing-country institutions. Training provided in developing countries offers the fellows the opportunity to work on problems that are comparable to those in their home countries and also bolster the standing of the training institution as an important regional centre. The UNU effort in capacity-building has been relatively successful in Latin America and Asia, where key regional and national institutions have been involved in the UNU fellowship programme. The results in Africa have been less successful, because the lack of independent university nutrition programmes has made it necessary to depend too much on government research institutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations 3adeveloping countries 3afood and nutrition programs 3aindustrialization 3aresearch institutions 3aAfrica 3aAsia 3aLatin America0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 18, no. 2 p.1-4dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1564826597018002103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02747naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245014100172300001600313520127700329592002801606650001601634650001201650650000901662650001901671650002101690650001201711650003101723650001201754650001301766653001001779653001201789653000901801653002301810653001601833700001601849700001501865700001701880700001401897700001901911700001501930700001701945700001601962700001501978700001701993773013502010856008702145852000902232655001202241IND60766307320221121094452.0220719e20220430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076630732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.01.1652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hui-Yuan12aA soybean EF-Tu family protein GmEF8, an interactor of GmCBL1, enhances drought and heat tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis and soybean  ap. 462-472.  aA soybean elongation factor Tu family (EF-Tu) protein, GmEF8, was determined to interact with GmCBL1, and GmEF8 expression was found to be induced by various abiotic stresses such as drought and heat. An ortholog of GmEF8 was identified in Arabidopsis, a T-DNA knockout line for which exhibited hypersensitivity to drought and heat stresses. Complementation with GmEF8 rescued the sensitivity of the Arabidopsis mutant to drought and heat stresses, and GmEF8 overexpression conferred drought and heat tolerance to transgenic Arabidopsis plants.

A number of drought-responsive genes, such as GmRD22 and GmP5CS, were induced in the OE-GmEF8 line compared to MR-GmEF8 and EV under normal growth conditions. These results suggest that GmEF8 has a positive role in regulating drought and heat stresses in Arabidopsis and soybean. This study reveals a potential role of the soybean GmEF8 gene in response to abiotic stresses, providing a foundation for further investigation into the complexities of stress signal transduction pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3adrought 3aheat 3aheat tolerance 3ahypersensitivity 3amutants 3apeptide elongation factors 3aproline 3asoybeans 0aEF-Tu 0aDrought 0aHeat 0aTolerant mechanism 0aGlycine max1 aHou, Ze-Hao1 aZhang, Yan1 aLi, Zhi-Yong1 aChen, Jun1 aZhou, Yong-Bin1 aChen, Ming1 aFu, Jin-Dong1 aMa, You-Zhi1 aZhang, Hui1 aXu, Zhao-Shi0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Apr. 30, v. 205 p.462-472dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.01.1653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03513naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013400165300001600299520168100315592002801996596005402024596006302078596014702141650001702288650001602305650002302321650001002344650001902354650001502373650002102388650001502409650002502424650001102449650001602460650002502476650001402501650001802515650002202533650003502555650002602590700001602616700001802632700001602650700001602666700001902682700005402701773013602755856008302891852000902974655001202983IND60771495420221123043325.0220911e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077149542DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-021-03999-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Zhicheng10aFine-mapping and identification of a candidate gene controlling seed coat color in melon (Cucumis melo L. var. chinensis Pangalo)  ap. 803-815.  aKEY MESSAGE: MELO3C019554 encoding a homeobox protein (PHD transcription factor) is a candidate gene that involved in the formation of seed coat color in melon. Seed coat color is related to flavonoid content which is closely related to seed dormancy. According to the genetic analysis of a six-generation population derived from two parents (IC2508 with a yellow seed coat and IC2518 with a brown seed coat), we discovered that the yellow seed coat trait in melon is controlled by a single dominant gene, named CmBS-1. Bulked segregant analysis sequencing (BSA-Seq) revealed that the gene is located at 11,860,000–15,890,000 bp (4.03 Mb) on Chr 6. The F₂ population was genotyped using insertion–deletions (InDels), from which cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (dCAPS) markers were derived to construct a genetic map. The gene was then fine-mapped to a 233.98 kb region containing 12 genes. Based on gene sequence analysis with two parents, we found that the MELO3C019554 gene encoding a homeobox protein (PHD transcription factor) had a nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutation in the coding sequence (CDS), and the SNP mutation resulted in the conversion of an amino acid (A → T) at residue 534. In addition, MELO3C019554 exhibited lower relative expression levels in the yellow seed coat than in the brown seed coat. Furthermore, we found that MELO3C019554 is related to 12 flavonoid metabolites. Thus, we predicted that MELO3C019554 is a candidate gene controlling seed coat color in melon. The study lays a foundation for further cloning projects and functional analysis of this gene, as well as marker-assisted selection breeding.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020YFD1000300cnational key r&d program of china  aCARS-25cchina agriculture research system of mof and mara  aCAAS-ASTIP-IVFCAAS; IVF-BRF2021008cthe agricultural science and technology innovation program of the chinese academy of agricultural sciences 3aCucumis melo 3aamino acids 3achromosome mapping 3acolor 3adominant genes 3aflavonoids 3agenetic analysis 3agenotyping 3ahomeodomain proteins 3amelons 3ametabolites 3anucleotide sequences 3aseed coat 3aseed dormancy 3asequence analysis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atranscription factors1 aShi, Xueyin1 aChen, Xuemiao1 aZheng, Jing1 aZhang, Aiai1 aWang, Huaisong1 aFu, Qiushi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2377-70340 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2022 Mar., v. 135, no. 3 p.803-815dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl2874x0040-57527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-021-03999-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02265naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245010600162300001600268520112200284592002801406650002201434650002301456650001901479650002101498653002701519653001601546653002501562653003101587653002301618653002101641700006001662773010101722856008301823852000901906655001201915IND60731304620221122105037.0210519e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073130462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2021.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaz, Adam10aPredicting macro-kinetic observables in electrocatalysis using the generalized degree of rate control  ap. 233-244.  aKinetic observables such as the Tafel slope, apparent activation energy, and apparent reaction orders all provide mechanistic fingerprints for electrocatalytic processes. Here, we show how each of these quantities is related to the generalized degree of rate control (DRC). We find that the apparent transfer coefficient, an inverted form of the Tafel slope, is a weighted average of the number of electrons transferred to generate each intermediate or product species in a mechanism, where the weighting factor is the DRC. We similarly show that the apparent activation energy and apparent reaction orders (with potential dependence) can also be written in simple terms of the DRC. Since DRCs can further be related with microscopic quantities such as fractional coverages of intermediates, these relations can be used to improve intuition about possible operative mechanisms of complex electrocatalytic processes. Final discussions address the possible impacts of various nonidealities such as electric field effects, adsorbate interactions, and approximations related to the form of electrochemical rate constants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acatalytic activity 3aelectric field 3aelectrochemistry 0aDegree of rate control 0aTafel slope 0aTransfer coefficient 0aApparent activation energy 0aMicrokinetic model 0aElectrocatalysis1 aHolewinski, Adam1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8307-58810 tJournal of catalysis.g2021 May, v. 397 p.233-244dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2021.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03436naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245007900168300001800247520170700265536021801972592002802190596006002218596003802278650000802316650002202324650001902346650001702365650002202382650001102404650001102415650001602426650001302442650001502455650001102470651001002481653002302491653001202514653003002526653002702556700001302583700001402596700001702610700001502627700001602642700002002658700001502678773011902693856008502812852000902897655001202906IND60685698420221119120437.0200306e20200402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068569842DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2018.15203072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Tingyu10aEffect of the wetland environment on particulate matter and dry deposition  ap. 1054-1064.  aIn Beijing, particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere, especially PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀, have attracted public attention because of its adverse effects. A series of studies have investigated the sources and spatial–temporal variation of PM. Wetland has been reported to own the capacity of resolving air problem. To examine the characteristics of the particulate matter in wetlands, the diurnal variation of PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ concentrations with respect to two heights (i.e. 1.5 and 10 m, respectively) and three meteorological factors (i.e. wind speed, temperature, and relative humidity, respectively) was monitored in the Cuihu National Wetland Park in Beijing, and the dry deposition velocity and flux were analysed using the above-mentioned data. Results indicated that (1) As for diurnal variation, the PM concentration constantly decreased at 07:00–16:00 and gradually increased at 16:00–18:00. The maximum instantaneous concentration was observed at 07:00–10:00, while the minimum instantaneous concentration was observed at 13:00–16:00. (2) The annual concentration variation of PM followed the order of dry period > wet period > normal period. (3) The particulate concentrations at 10 m were always greater than those at 1.5 m. (4) The PM concentration was positively correlated to the relative humidity and negatively correlated to the temperature. Wind speed exhibited a complex effect on PM concentration. (5) The regulation of dry deposition efficiency followed the order of spring > winter > summer. (6) Wind speed strongly and positively affected the dry deposition velocity of PM10. The effects of temperature and relative humidity on dry deposition were uncertain.  aThis research was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China [41877535], the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2016JX05] and the National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0505903].  aPublisher supplied data  cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  cNational Key R&D Program of China 3aair 3adiurnal variation 3adry deposition 3aparticulates 3arelative humidity 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3awetlands 3awind speed 3awinter 3aChina 0aParticulate matter 0awetland 0aspatio-temporal variation 0ameteorological factors1 aWang, Yu1 aWu, Yanan1 aZhai, Jiexiu1 aCong, Ling1 aYan, Guoxin1 aZhang, Zhenming1 aLi, Chunyi0 tEnvironmental technology.g2020 Apr. 2, v. 41, no. 8 p.1054-1064dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2018.15203073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012100168300001600289520153100305592002801836650002301864650001401887650001501901650001401916650002101930650001301951650001601964650002801980650001202008650001702020650001102037650001202048650001002060650001702070650002602087650001002113650002602123650001302149700002202162700002602184700003502210773012502245856008102370852000902451655001202460IND60522637820221121022043.0160603e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052263782DNAL7 a10.1007/s10493-016-0039-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRezende, Daniela10aEstimated crop loss due to coconut mite and financial analysis of controlling the pest using the acaricide abamectin  ap. 297-310.  aReducing the losses caused by Aceria guerreronis Keifer has been an arduous task for farmers. However, there are no detailed studies on losses that simultaneously analyse correlated parameters, and very few studies that address the economic viability of chemical control, the main strategy for managing this pest. In this study the objectives were (1) to estimate the crop loss due to coconut mite and (2) to perform a financial analysis of acaricide application to control the pest. For this, the following parameters were evaluated: number and weight of fruits, liquid albumen volume, and market destination of plants with and without monthly abamectin spraying (three harvests). The costs involved in the chemical control of A. guerreronis were also quantified. Higher A. guerreronis incidence on plants resulted in a 60 % decrease in the mean number of fruits harvested per bunch and a 28 % decrease in liquid albumen volume. Mean fruit weight remained unaffected. The market destination of the harvested fruit was also affected by higher A. guerreronis incidence. Untreated plants, with higher A. guerreronis infestation intensity, produced a lower proportion of fruit intended for fresh market and higher proportions of non-marketable fruit and fruit intended for industrial processing. Despite the costs involved in controlling A. guerreronis, the difference between the profit from the treated site and the untreated site was 18,123.50 Brazilian Real; this value represents 69.1 % higher profit at the treated site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAceria guerreronis 3aabamectin 3aacaricides 3aacarology 3achemical control 3acoconuts 3acrop losses 3aeconomic sustainability 3afarmers 3afresh market 3afruits 3amarkets 3amites 3apest control 3apesticide application 3apests 3aprocessing technology 3aspraying1 aMelo, José W.

We analyzed the effects of changes in climate and nitrogen input on the time course of rice yields of nine rice-producing provinces in China for the period between 1961 and 2003. We developed a regional-scale model that considered both climate and nitrogen flow in the rice paddy. Observed yields (Y ₒbₛ) tripled during the period, of which 65 % of the increase was accounted for by the estimated yield (Y ₑₛₜ) based on changes in nitrogen input and climate. The remaining 35 % was attributed to other technological factors (α = Y ₒbₛ/Y ₑₛₜ), which include improvements in cultivars and pest management, for example. Contribution of α became pronounced after 1980 and accounted for 69 and 90 % of the yield increases in the 1980s and 1990s, respectively. Nitrogen input had much greater impacts on Y ₑₛₜ (90 %) than did climate, but Y ₑₛₜ/nitrogen input dropped substantially. Significant positive effects were observed for CO₂ fertilization effects, which differed significantly among provinces; their relative contribution to the increase in Y ₑₛₜ ranged from 1.0 to 7.4 %. The effect of temperature change on Y ₑₛₜ was negative and significant in three provinces, but not for the overall average. To meet future rice demand and to improve nitrogen use efficiency, full use of possible positive interactions among cultivars, nitrogen management, and climate is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acrop models 3acultivars 3agrain yield 3anitrogen 3anutrient use efficiency 3apest management 3aproduction technology 3aquantitative analysis 3arice 3atemperature 3aChina1 aHasegawa, Toshihiro1 aIshigōoka, Yasushi,1 aKuwagata, Tsuneo1 aShindo, Junko1 aTao, Fulu0 tPaddy and water environment.g2015 Oct., v. 13, no. 4 p.529-543dSpringer Japanx1611-24907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10333-014-0470-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01595naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245009400174300001600268520058000284592002800864650001500892650001500907650001400922650001100936653001700947653002100964653005000985653001001035700002401045700002001069773007801089856008101167852000901248655001201257IND50067067820221120044505.0160511e20130613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006706782DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-013-0195-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolakovičová, Simona10aMerkel cells in the stratified squamous nonkeratinized epithelium of the human oesophagus  ap. 743-746.  aThe aim of our research was to identify Merkel cells in stratified squamous nonkeratinized epithelium of the human oesophagus.

In the middle part of the oesophagus there were 30% of CK20-positive Merkel cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aepithelium 3aesophagus 3ahumans 0aMerkel cells 0ahuman oesophagus 0astratified squamous nonkeratinized epithelium 0aCK-201 aMikušová, Renáta1 aPolák, Štefan0 tBiologia.g2013 June 13, v. 68, no. 4 p.743-746dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-013-0195-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03190naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245007900186300002000265520187800285592002802163650001002191650001202201650001602213650002702229650002302256650002102279650001702300650000902317650002202326650001202348650002302360650001902383650001302402650001302415650001302428651001102441700001802452700001702470700001702487773013802504856008102642852000902723655001202732IND60119096320221121014927.0141130e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011909632DNAL7 a250157132pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-014-3273-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHwang, Yaw-Huei10aIncense burning at home and the blood lead level of preschoolers in Taiwan  ap. 13480-13487.  aThe growth and intellectual development of children less than 6 years old may be affected by exposure to low levels of lead. To further reduce environmental lead exposure, this study examined possible household-related factors that affect the blood lead levels of Taiwanese children. In total, based on a stratified random sampling strategy, 934 kindergarten students were recruited throughout Taiwan from April to October 2011 after their parents signed a statement of consent. A venous blood sample was drawn from each participant and analyzed for lead content using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Information on the demographics and household environment of the study subjects was collected by administering a questionnaire (Table 1). The geometric mean lead level in the blood samples of the study subjects was 1.84 μg/dL with a geometric standard deviation of 1.55. The blood lead level was negatively correlated with household income and parental educational levels (p < 0.0001). Study subjects with more siblings also tended to have higher blood lead levels (p < 0.0001). Incense burning in the home, an ethnic tradition, was also identified as a significant factor for increased blood lead levels (p < 0.0003) and demonstrated a dose-dependent relationship with frequency of incense burning at home (p = 0.0022). Because the health effects of low levels of lead exposure have been reported in recent years and because no consensus has been reached regarding a safety threshold for blood lead level in children, any trivial factor is worth investigating to further prevent lead exposure in children. Incense burning at home is a common traditional religious activity in Taiwan; therefore, more study is warranted to further eliminate the lead content in incense and reduce lead exposure for the families who practice this activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3aburning 3acorrelation 3ademographic statistics 3aeducational status 3ahousehold income 3akindergarten 3alead 3amass spectrometry 3aparents 3apreschool children 3aquestionnaires 3asampling 3asiblings 3astudents 3aTaiwan1 aLin, Yi-Shuan1 aLin, Jiayou,1 aWang, Yiren,0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2014 Dec., v. 21, no. 23 p.13480-13487dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-3273-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03016naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245009600170300001600266520155600282592002801838650001601866650001701882650000901899650002001908650001001928650002701938650002601965650002301991650001902014650001302033650002502046650002802071650001202099650000902111650001902120650002002139650000902159650002302168650002002191651000902211700002202220700001402242700001702256700001702273700001702290773010102307856008102408852000902489655001202498IND60439179520221122042621.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043917952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10333-014-0473-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKadiyala, M.

A 2-year-field study on a typic Haplustalf soil was conducted to compare traditional transplanted rice–maize system with water-saving aerobic rice–maize system, with an overall objective of investigating the fate of fertilizer nitrogen (N) using ¹⁵N-labeled urea. Results from the field experiments showed that the rice plants positively responded to N fertilizer application. The average fertilizer N recovery by rice crop over the 2 years in aerobic rice was 26 kg per 100 kg of applied fertilizer N in the main field and 21 kg per 100 kg of applied N in the microplot, while the recoveries were 41 and 32 kg ha⁻¹ per 100 kg of applied N in traditionally cultivated rice under flooded conditions. The fraction of ¹⁵N that was found in soil after the harvest of rice crop ranged from 11.4 to 47.1 kg ha⁻¹ in aerobic rice and 14.2–51.4 kg ha⁻¹ in flooded rice. Average recovery of ¹⁵N fertilizer in maize after the first growing season was 3.3 %, and the corresponding recovery in soil was 19 %. An additional 1.3 % of the fertilizer was recovered by crops during the two subsequent seasons. This study indicates the need to develop management practices that improve N use efficiency in aerobic rice by reducing losses to improve yields and reduce N export to the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaplustalfs 3aOryza sativa 3acorn 3acrop production 3acrops 3afertilizer application 3afield experimentation 3aflooded conditions 3agrowing season 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient use efficiency 3apaddies 3arice 3asemiarid zones 3astable isotopes 3aurea 3awater conservation 3awater shortages 3aAsia1 aMylavarapu, R.

DESIGN: Prospective experimental study. SETTING: Academic research unit. ANIMAL(S): Six-day-old mice. INTERVENTION(S): After cryopreservation, viability tests (n = 10) and short-term culture (1 and 3 days) (n = 5) were performed. A comparison was made with fresh (FR) and noncultured controls (FR Ctrl). MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURE(S): Tissue viability was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase release assay. Apoptosis (caspase-3) and proliferation (Ki67) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and tubular diameter, integrity, and cell density by light microscopy. RESULT(S): Lactate dehydrogenase release was greater after SF than V (54.6% vs. 26.7%), whereas the mean number of apoptotic cells/tubule was higher after V than SF (2.13 vs. 0.07). On day 1, a decrease in cell density was noted in both cryopreserved groups, but this difference was not subsequently observed. On day 3, an increase in proliferation was seen in the SF and V groups versus FR tissue, and similar tubular diameter, integrity, and cell density were found in all cultured groups. CONCLUSION(S): This study shows that both SF and V protocols preserve survival, development, and integrity of prepubertal mouse testicular tissue in short-term organotypic culture. Additional investigation should now be conducted to assess tissue functionality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acryopreservation 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alight microscopy 3amice 3aviability 3avitrification1 aVerleysen, Magali1 aAmorim, Christiani Andrade1 aDolmans, Marie-Madeleine1 aVan Langendonckt, Anne1 aHovatta, Outi1 aWyns, Christine1 aDonnez, J.,0 tFertility and sterility.g2011 Mar. 15, v. 95, no. 4 p.1229-1234.e1dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.04.0623Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245010300175520153700278592002801815650002101843650001501864650002301879650001601902650001701918650001301935650001001948650001701958650002801975650001302003653001602016653001302032653000902045653001702054653001502071700001902086700001602105773011802121856008602239852000902325655001202334IND60783410220221122223832.0221004e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078341022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1157272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTejaswini, M.S.S.R.10aSustainable approach for valorization of solid wastes as a secondary resource through urban mining  aThe incessant population has increased the production and consumption of plastics, paper, metals, and organic materials, which are discarded as solid waste after their end of life. The accumulation of these wastes has created growing concerns all over the world. However, conventional methods of solid waste management i.e., direct combustion and landfilling have caused several negative impacts on the environment (releasing toxic chemicals and greenhouse gases, huge land use) besides affecting human health. Therefore, it is requisite to determine sustainable alternative technologies that not only help in mitigating environmental issues but also increase the economic value of the discarded solid wastes. This process is known as urban mining where waste is converted into secondary resources and thereby conserves the natural primary resources. Thus, this review highlights the technological advancements in the valorization process of discarded wastes and their sustainable utilization. We also discussed several limitations of the existing urban mining processes and further the feasibility of valorization techniques was critically analyzed from a techno-economical perspective. This paper recommends a novel sustainable model based on the circular economy concept, where waste is urban mined and recovered as a secondary resource to support the united nations sustainable development goals (SDGs). The implementation of this model will ultimately help the developing countries to achieve the target of SDGs 11, 12, and 14.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircular economy 3acombustion 3aeconomic valuation 3agreenhouses 3ahuman health 3aland use 3apaper 3asolid wastes 3asustainable development 3atoxicity 0aSolid waste 0aResource 0aSDGs 0aUrban mining 0aZero waste1 aPathak, Pankaj1 aGupta, D.K.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 319 p.115727-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1157273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01741naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002800189245010800217300001300325506007600338520058500414592002800999506003701027650002001064650003101084650002601115700001901141700002401160700002101184773010701205856008201312852000901394655001201403IND60119383220221207101917.0141214e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011938322DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2009-10-12-r1432doi7 aPMC28129502pmcid7 a200421042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvarez, Mariano Javier10aCorrelating measurements across samples improves accuracy of large-scale expression profile experiments  ap. 2293.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGene expression profiling technologies suffer from poor reproducibility across replicate experiments.

With aim to improve the soil aeration properties in the burial environment, the addition of quicklime (CaO) to the grave backfill was tested. Quicklime is expected to promote a stronger aggregation and stabilization of the backfilled soil mainly by forcing an immediate dehydration and particle cementation processes. Two different grave simulations (without buried corpses) were prepared: (1) mixing the grave backfill with 20 kg m⁻³ quicklime (“CaO”) and (2) backfill without CaO (“NIL”) on a cemetery in Northern Germany. The soil type was a Terric Anthrosol (Stagnic) with a loamy sand texture. Undisturbed soil cores were taken from two depths before and after excavation and backfill at regular intervals of 3 months in order to analyze changes in (1) gaseous transport functions expressed by air‐filled porosity, air permeability (air permeameter), gas diffusivity (double chamber method) and related pore continuity indices as well as in (2) soil respiration (alkali trap method) representing microbial activity. Results clearly demonstrated a more conductive pore system in the CaO variant reflected by higher gas diffusivity and air permeability over 1 year compared to the NIL variant. Pore continuity indices also indicated a more connective pore system for the CaO variant. Effects of CaO application on soil respiration rate differed between the quarterly sampling times. Results indicated that microorganism were still active under alkaline soil conditions induced by CaO application, but the quantitative determination of biologically produced CO₂ is influenced by chemical reactions when hydrated quicklime [Ca(OH)₂] was reformed to limestone under consumption of CO₂. The experiments indicate that the application of quicklime is a promising approach to improve aeration properties of grave soils and is therefore proposed as an adequate method to improve the aeration of burials on cemeteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnthrosols 3aaeration 3aair 3aalkaline soils 3acalcium hydroxide 3acalcium oxide 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical reactions 3adiffusivity 3ahumans 3alimestone 3aloamy sand soils 3amicrobial activity 3amixing 3aoxygen 3apermeability 3aporosity 3aquantitative analysis 3asoil quality 3asoil respiration 3atexture 3aGermany1 aZimmermann, Iris1 aFleige, Heiner1 aHorn, Rainer0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2017 Apr., v. 180, no. 2 p.153-164dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl64178x1436-87307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.2016003513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001300166245013500179300002000314520154800334592002801882650002301910650001301933650002001946650001201966650001201978650001101990650002302001650002302024650001702047650000902064650002102073650001402094650002102108650000902129650001002138650001402148650001802162700001602180700001502196700002002211773013802231856008102369852000902450655001202459IND60119096620221121014757.0141130e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011909662DNAL7 a250122062pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-014-3275-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Juan12aA field study on phytoremediation of dredged sediment contaminated by heavy metals and nutrients: the impacts of sediment aeration  ap. 13452-13460.  aCompared to traditional chemical or physical treatments, phytoremediation has proved to be a cost-effective and environmentally sound alternative for remediation of contaminated dredged sediment. A field study was conducted in a sediment disposal site predominantly colonized by Typha angustifolia under different sediment moisture conditions to estimate the phytoremediation effects of dredged sediment. The moisture content was 37.30 % and 48.27 % in aerated and waterlogged sediment, respectively. Total nitrogen (TN) content was higher in the waterlogged sediment than in the aerated sediment. The total Cd contents were lower in aerated sediment, which was mainly resulted from the lower exchangeable fraction of Cd. The bioaccumulation of P, Cu and Pb in T. angustifolia was promoted by waterlogging, and the belowground tissue concentrations and accumulation factors (AFs) of Cu were higher than that of other metals, which can be explained by that Cu is an essential micronutrient for plants. Consistent with many previous studies, T. angustifolia showed higher metal levels in roots than in above-ground tissues at both the sediment conditions. Due to the improved biomass produced in the aerated sediment, the removals of nutrients and the metals by plant harvest were higher from aerated sediment than from waterlogged sediment. It was indicated that maintaining the dredged sediment aerated can avoid release risk and plant uptake of metals, while the opposite management option can promote phytoextraction of these contaminants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTypha angustifolia 3aaeration 3abioaccumulation 3abiomass 3acadmium 3acopper 3acost effectiveness 3aflooded conditions 3aheavy metals 3alead 3anitrogen content 3anutrients 3aphytoremediation 3arisk 3aroots 3asediments 3awater content1 aYang, Lihua1 aZhong, Fei1 aCheng, Shuiping0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2014 Dec., v. 21, no. 23 p.13452-13460dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-3275-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011600168300001600284520152700300592002801827650001701855650002001872650002001892650001901912650001901931650002601950650001601976650001101992650000902003650001002012651002502022651001302047700002102060700002302081700003202104700001902136700002002155700001902175700001902194700002602213773010102239856008102340852000902421655001202430IND60439179820221122042513.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043917982DNAL7 a10.1007/s10333-014-0447-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFigueiredo, Nuno10aElevated carbon dioxide and temperature effects on rice yield, leaf greenness, and phenological stages duration  ap. 313-324.  aThe present field experiment was conducted during two consecutive cropping seasons in central Portugal to study the effects of simultaneous elevation of carbon dioxide concentration ([CO₂]) (550 μmol mol⁻¹) and air temperature (+2–3 °C) on japonica rice (Oryza sativa L. “Ariete”) yield, crop duration, and SPAD-values across the seasons compared with the open-field condition. Open-top chambers were used in the field to assess the effect of elevated air temperature alone or the combined effect of elevated air temperature and atmospheric [CO₂]. Open-field condition was assessed with randomized plots under ambient air temperature and actual atmospheric [CO₂] (average 382 μmol mol⁻¹). Results obtained showed that the rice “Ariete” had a moderate high yielding under open-field condition, but was susceptible to air temperature rise of +2–3 °C under controlled conditions resulting in reduction of grain yield. The combined increase of atmospheric [CO₂] with elevated air temperature compensated for the negative effect of temperature rise alone and crop yield was higher than in the open-field. SPAD-readings at reproductive stage explained by more than 60 % variation the straw dry matter, but this finding requires further studies for consolidation. It can be concluded that potential increase in air temperature may limit rice yield in the near future under Mediterranean areas where climate change scenario poses a serious threat, but long term field experiments are required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aadverse effects 3aair temperature 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3aleaves 3arice 3astraw 3aMediterranean region 3aPortugal1 aCarranca, Corina1 aTrindade, Henrique1 aPereira Uzal, José Manuel,1 aGoufo, Piebiep1 aCoutinho, Joao,1 aMarques, Paula1 aMaricato, Rosa1 ade Varennes, Amarilis0 tPaddy and water environment.g2015 Oct., v. 13, no. 4 p.313-324dSpringer Japanx1611-24907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10333-014-0447-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245011600208520182500324592002802149650001202177650001902189650002902208650001802237650002202255650002602277650001402303650001602317650001702333653002302350653002102373653002202394653002902416653001502445653001102460700005902471700002002530773011802550856008602668852000902754655001202763IND60783410620221122223955.0221004e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078341062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1157312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Shuli,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9238-198410aAssessing the synergies and trade-offs of development projects in response to climate change in an urban region  aA synthesis of the complex relationships, including synergies and trade-offs, between urban development projects and climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives can ensure that all these relationships are taken into consideration. We used a systems approach and applied an impact matrix and chain effect analysis methods to projects in the highly urbanized Taipei metropolitan region to identify the influences and effects between urban development projects and climate change objectives. Three types of urban plans and projects were analyzed: flood control, transportation, and urban planning. The magnitudes of the influences and effects between these projects and plans were derived through interviews with experts familiar with Taipei's urban development. This pilot study found no synergy in the response to climate change mitigation and adaptation for the urban development projects analyzed. The current standalone policies and plans related to urbanization in Taipei have resulted in trade-offs for flood control and public transit projects because they contribute positively toward one climate objective but negatively impact another. A high-level policymaking mechanism that ensures coordination and collaboration between different sectors is needed to supervise sectoral policies. Prior to the approval and implementation of a plan, policymakers should request the assessment of synergies and trade-offs between plans and projects to ensure a synergistic effect to climate change issues. This study confirms that the strategy from individual sector in a metropolitan region will result in trade-off between climate change issues is a global problem. This paper also strengthens the concept that the assessment of synergy/trade-offs between policy and plans should be conducted using systemic approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental management 3aflood control 3aissues and policy 3apublic transportation 3asynergism 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 0aSynergy/trade-offs 0aSystems approach 0aUrban development 0aCarbon dioxide emissions 0aFlood risk 0aTaipei1 aLee, Ying-Chieh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9238-19841 aChiang, Li-Yang0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 319 p.115731-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1157313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245010500185300001600290520091500306592002801221650002701249650002901276650001601305650002801321650002801349650001001377650001501387650003901402650002801441650002701469650001401496650002401510650001801534650002601552650006201578650002901640650002801669650004101697650005201738650002301790700001901813700002001832700002601852700001701878700001701895700002001912700001901932773011401951856004802065852000902113655001202122IND4457180220221118130242.0121003e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445718022DNAL7 a211616082pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-010-9135-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeasmin, Shabina10aCell Surface Display of Cellulase Activity–Free Xylanase Enzyme on Saccharomyces Cerevisiae EBY100  ap. 294-304.  aCellulase-free xylanase has potential for its application in the selective removal of hemicellulose from kraft pulp to give good strength to paper. In this study, a gene (xyn) encoding cellulase activity–free xylanase enzyme (Xyn) was isolated from Paenibacillus polymyxa PPL-3. The xyn gene encoded a protein of 221 amino acids, and the purified Xyn was about 22.5 kDa measured by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Moreover, the cellulase activity–free xylanase enzyme (Xyn) was displayed on the cell surface of Saccharomyces cerevisiae EBY100 using Aga2p as an anchor protein. Cell surface display of xylanase enzyme (Xyn) on S. cerevisiae EBY100 was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Optimum cell surface display of xylanase enzyme (Xyn) was observed at pH 7 and 40 °C. Therefore, cell surface–displayed xylanase enzyme (Xyn) can be used in the paper industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPaenibacillus polymyxa 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aamino acids 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3afluorescence microscopy 3agenes 3akraft pulp 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apulp and paper industry 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3axylanases 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCellulasexmetabolism 2aEndo-1,4-beta Xylanasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPaenibacillusxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSequence Alignment1 aKim, Chul Hawn1 aPark, Hyeon Jin1 aSheikh, Mominul Islam1 aLee, Ji Yong1 aKim, Jae Won1 aBack, Kyung Kil1 aKim, Sŭng-ho,0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2011 June, v. 164, no. 3 p.294-304dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-010-9135-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245017200165300001800337520108500355592002801440596006201468650002001530650002001550650003401570650001701604650001301621650001301634700002001647700005501667700002301722700002701745700001901772700002901791700002901820773012201849856008301971852000902054655001202063IND60774588620221121223639.0220421e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077458862DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-022-07142-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahul, M.

In this work, P(VDF-HFP)-based films containing 2, 4, 8 and 16 wt% Y₃Fe₅O₁₂–Na₀.₅K₀.₅NbO₃ nanocrystalline particles were developed via a simple solvent cast process. In order to facilitate the β-phase crystallization of the P(VDF-HFP), hydrated ferric nitrate was utilized during the preparation of the films, which resulted in significant improvement in the β-phase content. Moreover, the use of Y₃Fe₅O₁₂–Na₀.₅K₀.₅NbO₃ also triggered the β-phase crystallization of the P(VDF-HFP). At the highest filler loading of 16 wt%, a magnetoelectric coefficient of 33.6 mV cm⁻¹ Oe⁻¹ was achieved. Piezoelectric energy harvesting studies were also carried out using the composite film containing 16 wt% Y₃Fe₅O₁₂–Na₀.₅K₀.₅NbO₃ nanocrystalline particles. A maximum open-circuit voltage of 3.79 V was measured when a compressive force of 5 N was applied to the energy harvesting device.  aPublisher supplied data  aSTARS/APR2019/443cMinistry of Human Resource Development 3acomposite films 3acrystallization 3aelectric potential difference 3ananocrystals 3anitrates 3asolvents1 aChacko, Sobi K.1 aRaneesh, B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0056-559X1 aPhilip, K.

The mean Hg concentration in alligator muscles was 0.407 ± 0.114 μg/g (N = 61). Close to 5 % of the muscle samples showed Hg levels above the World Health Organization guideline for fish consumption (0.5 μg/g). A positive and significant relationship was observed between Hg concentrations in muscle and the age of the specimens. The dose-response approach suggests that close to 27.4 years is required for half of the exposed specimens to attain 0.5 μg/g. The hazard quotient (HQ) is a risk indicator which defines the ratio of exposure level and a toxicological reference dose. HQ resulted above the unity for all the specimens when the ingestion rate for riverine communities (200 g of muscle per day) is considered, indicating the existence of hazard. When the ingestion rate for market consumers (28.57 g/day) is considered, the risks are much lower (mean HQ = 0.55), suggesting that such group is not at risk. The establishment of local and regional ingestion rates for riverine populations and market consumers is extremely recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMelanosuchus 3aWorld Health Organization 3aalligators 3adose response 3afish consumption 3ahuman health 3aingestion 3amarkets 3amercury 3amuscles 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3aAmazonia1 aCesar, Ricardo1 aMarsico, Eliane1 aDiniz, George Tadeu Nunes1 aCamargo, Mauricioq(Camargo-Zorro),1 aCastilhos, Zuleica0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2014 Dec., v. 21, no. 23 p.13522-13527dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-3282-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245020200209300001600411520129600427592002801723650002201751650001701773650001201790650001401802650001401816650001901830650002001849650001101869650001801880650003101898650001201929650001801941650001701959650002201976650005201998650001302050653001902063653001502082653002202097653001802119653001602137700001702153700001802170700005602188773013202244856008602376852000902462655001202471IND60622691720221121062133.0181127e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062269172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGan, Sook Yee1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4826-914310aFucosterol exerts protection against amyloid β-induced neurotoxicity, reduces intracellular levels of amyloid β and enhances the mRNA expression of neuroglobin in amyloid β-induced SH-SY5Y cells  ap. 207-213.  aAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to progressive loss of neurons which often results in deterioration of memory and cognitive function. The development of AD is highly associated with the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Amyloid β (Aβ) induces neurotoxicity and contributes to the development of AD. Recent evidences also highlighted the importance of neuroglobin (Ngb) in ameliorating AD. This study assessed the ability of fucosterol, a phytosterol found in brown alga, in protecting SH-SY5Y cells against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. Its effects on the mRNA levels of APP and Ngb as well as the intracellular Aβ levels were also determined in Aβ-induced SH-SY5Y cells. SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to fucosterol prior to Aβ treatment. The effect on apoptosis was determined using Annexin V FITC staining and mRNA expression was studied using RT-PCR. Flow cytometry confirmed the protective effects of fucosterol on SH-SY5Y cells against Aβ-induced apoptosis. Pretreatment with fucosterol increased the Ngb mRNA levels but reduced the levels of APP mRNA and intracellular Aβ in Aβ-induced SH-SY5Y cells. These observations demonstrated the protective properties of fucosterol against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in neuronal cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aPhaeophyceae 3aamyloid 3aapoptosis 3acognition 3aflow cytometry 3agene expression 3amemory 3amessenger RNA 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneurons 3aneurotoxicity 3aphytosterols 3aprotective effect 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astaining 0aAnti-apoptotic 0aMacroalgae 0aNeurodegenerative 0aNeurotoxicity 0aPhycosterol1 aWong, Li Zhe1 aWong, Jia Wun1 aTan, Eng Lai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5659-86600 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Jan., v. 121 p.207-213dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03587naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001400166245010700180300001600287520135500303592002801658650002001686650002501706650001101731650002501742650002701767650000901794650001301803650000901816650001801825650001701843650001801860650001601878650002701894650003601921650001901957650001401976650001501990650002302005650001202028650001402040650001302054650002502067650002502092650001202117650002902129650002202158650002002180650002402200650003702224650002302261650003402284650003502318650005402353650003302407650002702440650004002467650002302507700001302530700001702543700001802560700001402578700001502592700001202607700001602619700001802635773010702653856004802760852000902808655001202817IND50066267620221118022348.0130508e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006626762DNAL7 a230536052pmid7 a10.1007/s10695-012-9719-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Lin10aEffects of dietary histidine on antioxidant capacity in juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var.

A total of 1,200 juvenile Jian carp were fed graded levels of histidine at 2.3 (unsupplemented control), 4.4, 6.3, 8.6, 10.8 and 12.7 g/kg diet for 60 days. Results showed that the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC) in serum and all tissues apparently decreased with increasing histidine levels up to an optimal level and increased thereafter. Anti-superoxide anion (ASA) capacity, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities and glutathione (GSH) content in serum and all tissues, anti-hydroxyl radical (a-HR) capacity, catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities in serum, muscle and intestine, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in serum and intestine, as well as glutathione reductase (GR) activity in serum, muscle and hepatopancreas were improved by dietary histidine. Fish fed diet with 8.6 g/kg histidine had lower serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) activity than that fed with control diet, whereas pattern of glutamate–oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) activity was opposite. The present results suggested that histidine could improve antioxidant capacity and inhibit lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation of juvenile Jian carp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinus carpio 3aalanine transaminase 3aanions 3aantioxidant activity 3aaspartate transaminase 3acarp 3acatalase 3adiet 3afeeding level 3afish feeding 3afree radicals 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahepatopancreas 3ahistidine 3aintestines 3alipid peroxidation 3amuscles 3aoxidation 3aproteins 3asuperoxide dismutase 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aCarpsxmetabolism 2aCatalasexblood 2aDietary Supplements 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aGlutathionexblood 2aGlutathione Peroxidasexblood 2aGlutathione Transferasexblood 2aHistidinexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aHydroxyl Radicalxmetabolism 2aMalondialdehydexblood 2aProtein Carbonylationxdrug effects 2aSuperoxidesxblood1 aZhao, Bo1 aChen, Gangfu1 aJiang, Weidan1 aLiu, Yang1 aJiang, Jun1 aHu, Kai1 aLi, Shuhong1 aZhou, Xiaoqiu0 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2013 June, v. 39, no. 3 p.559-571dSpringer-Verlagx0920-17427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-012-9719-9  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245013300159300001800292520165800310592002801968650001301996650001302009650001902022650001902041650000702060650001702067650001902084650001802103650001302121650002002134650001902154650001602173650002702189650002002216650001502236650002502251700001702276700001502293700006002308700001602368700005702384773017102441856008002612852000902692655001202701IND60600963720221120225130.0180705e20170621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060096372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b014402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Xiao10aTight Ultrafiltration Ceramic Membrane for Separation of Dyes and Mixed Salts (both NaCl/Na2SO4) in Textile Wastewater Treatment  ap. 7070-7079.  aCommercial nanofiltration (NF) membranes have been used to separate dyes and salts in industry; however, NF membrane’s high rejection to divalent salts (i.e., Na₂SO₄) leads to a reduction of salt recovery. In this study, a tight ultrafiltration (t-UF) ceramic membrane (MWCO 8800 Da) is proposed to fractionate dyes and mixed salts (NaCl/Na₂SO₄) for textile wastewater treatment. Performance of the t-UF ceramic membrane and DK polymeric membrane (from GE) has been compared regarding to permeability, retention of reactive dyes, and permeation of salts. The t-UF ceramic membrane presents better permeability, competitive rejection of dye molecules (>98%), and reduced rejection of NaCl (<10%) and Na₂SO₄ (<30%) in comparison with DK membrane; the pure water permeability of t-UF membrane is at least 6 times that of DK membrane. In particular, the operation parameters (TMP, temperature, and pH) and solution environment (concentration and charges) have been intensively evaluated for dye/dual-salts separation efficiency in the membrane process. It also reveals that the t-UF ceramic membrane has performed negative rejection to chloride ions at low operating pressure in the dye and NaCl/Na₂SO₄ solution due to the electrostatic Donnan effect. Concentration of salt, valence of inorganic ions, and charge of dyes are found as having a significant effect on membrane separation performance. In conclusion, the strong retention of dyes and free permeation of salts (i.e., low retention) by the t-UF ceramic membrane proves that it can be applied to desalinate dyeing wastewater of high salinity and recover dyes and salts separately.  aPublisher supplied data 3aceramics 3aindustry 3ainorganic ions 3ananofiltration 3apH 3apermeability 3aprocess design 3areactive dyes 3asalinity 3asodium chloride 3asodium sulfate 3atemperature 3atextile mill effluents 3aultrafiltration 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment1 aChen, Pengli1 aZhou, Ming1 aZhong, Zhaoxiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0574-01851 aZhang, Feng1 aXing, Weihong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3967-485X0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 June 21, v. 56, no. 24 p.7070-7079dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b014403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245018800212506010400400506007600504520121700580592002801797506003701825650002601862650001801888650002301906650002901929650001401958650001601972650001401988650001902002650001502021650001902036650001602055650002102071653002002092653002102112653000802133653003302141653001002174700006102184700006202245773011802307856008602425852000902511655001202520IND60783410920221207114227.0221004e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078341092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1157352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrawiński, Jakub1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8353-185910aEfficient removal of anti-HIV drug - maraviroc from natural water by peroxymonosulfate and TiO2 photocatalytic oxidation: Kinetic studies and identification of transformation products  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this study photochemical transformation of the antiretroviral pharmaceutical maraviroc under the simulated UV–Vis radiation was presented. The drug was shown to be extremely photo-resistant, with a half-life over 250 h, which is particularly significant, considering its presence in the aquatic environments. Addition of the natural river water matrix substantially increased the degradation rate, albeit the process led to formation of numerous phototransformation products. Due to high photostability and presumable environmental persistence of maraviroc, a photocatalytic method of its elimination was proposed. Although titanium dioxide alone presented acceptable results, its combination with peroxymonosulfate enormously accelerated the degradation process, increasing it over 67 000 times in comparison with the direct photolysis. Substitution of ultrapure water with river water resulted in inhibition of the PMS-driven processes, however the decomposition efficiency was still very high. Noteworthy, majority of the identified photoproducts were still present after termination of irradiation in all the experiments, which may indicate necessity of ecotoxicological assessment of those compounds.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantiretroviral agents 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental fate 3aenvironmental management 3ahalf life 3airradiation 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotolysis 3aphotostability 3ariver water 3atitanium dioxide 0aAntiviral drugs 0aPhotodegradation 0aPMS 0aHeterogeneous photocatalysis 0aLC-MS1 aWroński, Michał1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6439-91271 aSkibiński, Robert1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8429-75150 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 319 p.115735-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1157353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245010800205300001800313520110200331592002801433650001501461650002201476650002701498650001701525650003101542650001101573650002401584650002701608650002301635650001601658700002101674700002201695700001701717773012201734856008301856852000901939655001201948IND60774588920221120032011.0220421e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077458892DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-022-07134-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHameed, S.

For further AC conductivity (σₐc) studies, the temperature dependence of the σₐc and dielectric parameters for the optimum concentration CMC/PEO-CuO NPs (2 wt%) were investigated throughout a wide range of frequencies (0.1Hz–10 MHz). The calculation of the activation energy (Eₐ) and relaxation time (τ) suggests that these nanocomposite films are promising for solid-state supercapacitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aactivation energy 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acupric oxide 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aenergy 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymer nanocomposites 3asol-gel processing 3atemperature1 aQahtan, Talal F.1 aAbdelghany, A.

Visible leaf injury, dry weight, chlorophyll, carotenoid content, leaf greenness (SPAD value), quantum yield of photosynthesis, and stomatal resistance were measured to evaluate response. Shoot biomass, total chlorophyll, leaf greenness, and carotenoid content were reduced in ozone-exposed plants. Based on the results of principal component analysis (PCA)-biplot analysis, the order of sensitivity to ozone was: Akbar >> Sufi ≥ Bijoy ≥ Shatabdi > Bari-26 ≥ Gourab > Bari-25 ≥ Prodip ≥ Sourav >> Kanchan. The most important parameters to discriminate cultivars with respect to ozone sensitivity were visible injury and chlorophyll b/a ratio, whereas quantum yield of photosynthesis was less important. Differences in stomatal resistance were not a significant factor in ozone response. Regression of cultivars’ PCA scores against year of release revealed no trend, suggesting that ozone tolerance was not incorporated during cultivar breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3abiomass 3abreeding 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3acultivars 3aleaves 3aozone 3aphotosynthesis 3aprincipal component analysis 3ascreening 3ashoots 3astomatal conductance 3awinter wheat1 aBari, Shafiqul M.1 aBurkey, Kent O.1 aStamatelopoulos, Dimitris1 aAgathokleous, Evgenios0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2014 Dec., v. 21, no. 23 p.13560-13571dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-3286-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01798naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001700189245011100206300001300317506007600330520054100406592002800947506003700975650002401012650002001036650002001056650002601076700001701102700001701119700002501136700001901161700001901180700001501199773010701214856008201321852000901403655001201412IND60119384020221207103950.0141214e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011938402DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2009-10-12-r1392doi7 aPMC28129462pmcid7 a199615992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdler, Priit10aMining for coexpression across hundreds of datasets using novel rank aggregation and visualization methods  ap. 2289.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe present a web resource MEM (Multi-Experiment Matrix) for gene expression similarity searches across many datasets.

However, a major drawback of using mammalian cells is the high production costs associated with uniformly isotope-labeled glycoproteins due to the large quantity of labeled L-glutamine required for their growth. To address this problem, we developed a cost-saving method for uniform isotope labeling by cultivating the mammalian cells under glutamine-free conditions, which was achieved by co-expression of glutamine synthase. We demonstrate the utility of this approach using fucosylated and non-fucosylated Fc glycoforms of human immunoglobulin G1.  aPublisher supplied data  aJP20K15981cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology  aJP19H01017cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology  aJP19J15602cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology  aJP21ae0121013h0301cJapan Agency for Medical Research and Development  aJP20ae0101062cJapan Agency for Medical Research and Development 3acost effectiveness 3aglutamine 3aglycoproteins 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aisotope labeling 3aisotopes1 aYagi, Hirokazu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9296-02251 aYogo, Rina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1595-01941 aOnitsuka, Masayoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4220-14011 aKato, Koichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7187-96120 tJournal of biomolecular NMR.g2022 Apr., v. 76, no. 1-2 p.17-22dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl52412x0925-27387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10858-021-00387-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02421naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245011500164300001600279520121100295592002801506650002501534650001701559650002001576650000901596650001101605650001701616650001601633653004201649653002901691653003401720653002501754700002001779700002501799700001901824773009701843856008601940852000902026655001202035IND60561836720221120084648.0170124e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056183672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2013.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Liu10aExperimental investigation of gas heating and dissociation in a microwave plasma torch at atmospheric pressure  ap. 695-703.  aExperimental investigations are made to understand gas heating and dissociation in a microwave (MW) plasma torch at atmospheric pressure. The MW induced plasma torch operates at 2.45GHz frequency and up to 2kW power. Three different gas mixtures are injected in the form of axial flow and swirl flow in a quartz tube plasma torch to experimentally investigate the MW plasma to gas energy transfer. Air–argon, air–air and air–nitrogen plasmas are formed and their operational ranges are determined in terms of gas flow rates and MW power. Visual observations, optical emission spectroscopy and K-type thermocouple measurements are used to characterize the plasma. The study reveals that the plasma structure is highly dependent on the carrier gas type, gas flow rate, and MW power. However, the plasma gas temperature is shown not to vary much with these parameters. Further spectral and analytical analysis show that the plasma is in thermal equilibrium and presents very good energy coupling between the microwave power and gas heating and dissociation. The MW plasma torch outlet temperature is also measured and found to be suitable for many thermal heating and chemical dissociation applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3adissociation 3aenergy transfer 3aheat 3aquartz 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature 0aAtmospheric pressure microwave plasma 0aGas thermal dissociation 0aOptical emission spectroscopy 0aPlasma visualization1 aKumar, Rajneesh1 aOgungbesan, Babajide1 aSassi, Mohamed0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2014 Feb., v. 78 p.695-703dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2013.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01735naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002000187245004600207300001300253506007600266520061700342592002800959506003700987650001401024650001301038650002601051650002101077650001201098650002601110700002101136700002101157773010601178856008001284852000901364655001201373IND60119384120221207103307.0141214e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011938412DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2009-10-2-r132doi7 aPMC26882672pmcid7 a192082222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDahl, John Arne10aFast genomic μChIP-chip from 1,000 cells  ap. 2163.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGenome-wide location analysis of histone modifications and transcription factor binding relies on chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays.

The objective of this investigation was to develop a protocol for determining functional parameters of microperiphyton fauna in colonization surveys for marine bioassessment based on rarefaction and regression analyses. The temporal dynamics in species richness of microperiphyton fauna during the colonization period was analyzed based on a dataset of periphytic ciliates in Chinese coastal waters of the Yellow Sea. The results showed that (1) based on observed species richness and estimated maximum species numbers, a total of 16 glass slides were required in order to achieve coefficients of variation of <5 % in the functional parameters; (2) the rarefied average species richness and functional parameters showed weak sensitivity to sampling effort; (3) the temporal variations in average species richness were well-fitted to the MacArthur-Wilson model; and (4) the sampling effort of ~8 glass slides was sufficient to achieve coefficients of variation of <5 % in equilibrium average species number (AvS ₑq ), colonization rate (AvG), and the time to reach 90 % of AvS ₑq (AvT ₉₀ ) based on the average species richness. The findings suggest that the AvS ₑq , AvG, and AvT ₉₀ values based on rarefied average species richness of microperiphyton might be used as reliable ecological indicators for the bioassessment of marine water quality in coastal habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCiliophora 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abiological assessment 3acoastal water 3adata collection 3afauna 3aglass 3ahabitats 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3atemporal variation 3awater quality 3aYellow Sea1 aZhong, Xiaoxiao1 aWang, Yangfan1 aWarren, Alan1 aXu, Henglong0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2014 Dec., v. 21, no. 23 p.13461-13469dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-3293-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245012700173300001600300520112200316592002801438650004401466650001501510650001501525650002201540650001301562650001501575650000901590650001101599650000701610650003301617650002301650650001601673650001901689650002101708653001401729653002201743653002001765653001501785700003401800700002001834773013501854856008701989852000902076655001202085IND60622692020221121052005.0220214e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062269202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.11.1062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMozaffari, Maede12aA novel thiosemicarbazide modified chitosan (TSFCS) for efficiency removal of Pb (II) and methyl red from aqueous solution  ap. 457-467.  aThiosemicarbazide modified chitosan, TSFCS, was prepared and characterized by FTIR, SEM and TGA techniques and its application as a novel adsorbent for the removal of Pb(II) and methyl red (MR) was investigated. The effect of some adsorption parameters such as pH, TSFCS dosage and initial concentration of solutions were evaluated. The maximum removal percentage for MR and Pb(II) was found to be about 91% and 85.6% at pH 8 and 5 and TSFCS dosage of 3.33 g/l and 1.33 g/l, respectively. Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherms were evaluated and the maximum adsorption capacities for Pb(II) and MR were found to be 56.89 mg/g and 17.31 mg/g at 55 °C and 25 °C, respectively. Isotherm studies indicate that Pb (II) and MR adsorptions follow Freundlich and Langmuir models, respectively. The adsorption kinetic was more accurately fitted by the pseudo-second order model. Thermodynamic parameters including ΔG°, ΔH° and ΔS° were determined over the temperature range of 25–55 °C. The findings show that the sorption process was spontaneous (ΔG° < 0) and endothermic (ΔH° > 0).  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3achitosan 3aendothermy 3alead 3amodels 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3athermogravimetry 0aAdsorbent 0aThiosemicarbazide 0aMethyl red (MR) 0aPb removal1 aEmami, Mohammad Reza Sarmasti1 aBinaeian, Ehsan0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 123 p.457-467dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.11.1063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245010200166300001600268500002000284520168300304592002801987650001902015650000902034650001802043650001502061650001802076650002002094650002202114650002302136650001102159650002602170650000902196650002402205650001302229700001902242700002002261700001902281700001902300700002102319700002002340773015102360856007802511852000902589655001202598IND60587954420180301000000.0180103e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058795442DNAL7 a10.1002/jpln.2016005782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOelbermann, Maren10aEstimating soil carbon dynamics in intercrop and sole crop agroecosystems using the Century model  ap. 241-251.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUsing process‐based models to predict changes in carbon (C) stocks enhances our knowledge on the long‐term dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) in various land management systems. The objective of this study was to apply the Century model to evaluate temporal SOC dynamics in two temperate intercrop systems [1:2 (one row of maize and two rows of soybeans); 2:3 intercrop (two rows of maize and three rows of soybean)] and in a maize and soybean sole crop. Upon initiation of intercropping, SOC increased by 47% after ≈ 100 years, whereas SOC in the maize sole crop increased by 21% and 2% in the soybean sole crop. The quantity of crop residue input was sufficient to increase the active (turnover time of months to years) SOC fraction in the intercrops and the maize sole crop, but not in the soybean sole crop. The slow fraction, with a turnover time of 20 to 50 years, increased in all crop systems and was the major driver of SOC accumulation. A 3 to 15% loss of SOC from the passive fraction, with a turnover time of 400 to 2000 years, in all crop systems showed the long‐term impact of land‐use conversion from historically undisturbed native grasslands to intensive agricultural production systems. This study provided an example of the potential of process‐based models like Century to illustrate possible effects of cereal–legume intercropping on SOC dynamics and that the model was able to predict SOC stocks within –7 to +4% of measured values. We conclude, however that further fine‐tuning of the model for application to cereal–legume intercrop systems is required in order to strengthen the relationship between measured and simulated values.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecosystems 3acorn 3acrop residues 3agrasslands 3aintercropping 3aland use change 3along term effects 3amanagement systems 3amodels 3aproduction technology 3asoil 3asoil organic carbon 3asoybeans1 aEcharte, Laura1 aMarroquin, Lisa1 aMorgan, Svenja1 aRegehr, Alison1 aVachon, Karen E.1 aWilton, Meaghan0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2017 Apr., v. 180, no. 2 p.241-251dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl64178x1436-87307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.2016005783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245007500168300001600243520120400259592002801463650000801491650001601499650001201515650001101527650002001538650001701558650001601575653001601591653001601607653001401623653001601637653001501653653001401668700002101682700001801703773009701721856008601818852000901904655001201913IND60561836920221120095256.0170124e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056183692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2013.11.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVatani, Ali10aAdvanced exergetic analysis of five natural gas liquefaction processes  ap. 720-737.  aConventional exergy analysis cannot identify portion of inefficiencies which can be avoided. Also this analysis does not have ability to calculate a portion of exergy destruction which has been produced through performance of a component alone. In this study advanced exergetic analysis was performed for five mixed refrigerant LNG processes and four parts of irreversibility (avoidable/unavoidable) and (endogenous/exogenous) were calculated for the components with high inefficiencies. The results showed that portion of endogenous exergy destruction in the components is higher than the exogenous one. In fact interactions among the components do not affect the inefficiencies significantly. Also this analysis showed that structural optimization cannot be useful to decrease the overall process irreversibilities. In compressors high portion of the exergy destruction is related to the avoidable one, thus they have high potential to improve. But in multi stream heat exchangers and air coolers, unavoidable inefficiencies were higher than the other parts. Advanced exergetic analysis can identify the potentials and strategies to improve thermodynamic performance of energy intensive processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acompressors 3acoolers 3aexergy 3aheat exchangers 3aliquefaction 3anatural gas 0aNatural gas 0aDestruction 0aAvoidable 0aUnavoidable 0aEndogenous 0aExogenous1 aMehrpooya, Mehdi1 aPalizdar, Ali0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2014 Feb., v. 78 p.720-737dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2013.11.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002700149245009000176300001600266520171700282592002801999650001302027650001402040650002302054650001102077650001102088650001302099650002302112650001102135650001102146650001902157650001602176650001002192650000902202700002502211700002302236773009902259856008502358852000902443655001202452IND4446668720221120163323.0141112e20110110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444666872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2010.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández-Escobar, R.10aMobilization of nitrogen in the olive bearing shoots after foliar application of urea  ap. 452-454.  aMature ‘on’ and ‘off’ ‘Manzanillo’ olives trees with three healthy branches of 10–12cm in diameter were selected to determine changes in nitrogen levels in the bearing shoots after foliar application of urea. Each selected branch of each tree received one of the following treatments: (i) control without urea application; (ii) foliar application of urea to all the current-season leaves; and (iii) foliar application of urea to all the one-year-old leaves. Urea was applied in May, four days after full bloom in the ‘on’ year trees. Each treated leaf was immersed in a test tube containing a 4% urea solution and 0.1% Tween 20 for 5s. Bearing shoots, composed of both one-year stems and leaves and current-season stems and leaves, were collected at intervals from the beginning of the experiment until 64 days after urea application. Nitrogen was determined in stems and leaves from each part of the bearing shoot, and in fruits during the ‘on’ year. Nitrogen uptake from the leaves was rapidly mobilized from the older to the current-season leaves of the bearing shoot, and thereafter to other storage organs of the tree or to the fruit, which is the largest nitrogen sink in the bearing shoot. No translocation of nitrogen from the current-season leaves to older leaves was observed. The rapid translocation of nitrogen from the younger leaves to other storage organs of the tree could explain the insensitivity of leaf analysis to detect excess nitrogen, since mature leaves from current-season shoots must be sampled to determine the nutritional status of the tree. The failure of leaf analysis to detect excess nitrogen may be a cause of nitrogen over-fertilization in olive orchards.  aPublisher supplied data 3abranches 3aflowering 3afoliar application 3afruits 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anutritional status 3aolives 3ashoots 3astorage organs 3atree fruits 3atrees 3aurea1 aGarcía-Novelo, J.M.1 aRestrepo-Díaz, H.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2011 Jan. 10, v. 127, no. 3 p.452-454dElsevier B.V.x0304-42387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2010.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011800170300001600288520155300304592002801857650001201885650001701897650002001914650001701934650001901951650001501970650001401985650002001999650001102019650001902030650001702049650002302066650001402089650001502103650001002118650001402128650001402142650001102156650001402167650002802181650001302209650001602222653001702238653001402255653001802269653002302287653001602310653002002326700002102346700002902367700002202396773007802418856008102496852000902577655001202586IND50067068320221120044439.0160511e20130613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006706832DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-013-0200-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSosnowska, Bożena10aOxidative damage to human red blood cells treated with chlorfenvinphos, an organophosphate insecticide (in vitro)  ap. 773-778.  aChlorfenvinphos (CFVF) is an organophosphorus insecticide, which was used to control insect pest on livestock and household pests such as flies, fleas, and mites. The molecular basis of toxic properties of CFVF in animals has been insufficiently studied. Blood can transport oxygen and nutrients as well as toxic compounds. Xenobiotics can enter to red blood cells and cause damage. Therefore, investigation of the toxicity of different compounds to erythrocytes is very important. The purpose of the present experiment was to evaluate the effect of this compound on human erythrocytes. We have evaluated the hemolysis, hemoglobin oxidation (met-Hb formation) and lipid peroxidation in human erythrocytes. Moreover, the changes in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were assessed using flow cytometry as well as those in morphological changes of erythrocytes using phase contrast microscopy. This study describes the interaction of low concentrations of CFVF with human erythrocytes as well as the concentrations, which may enter human organism as a result of acute poisoning (0.5–250 μM). It was shown that CFVF only at high concentration induced changes in human erythrocytes. We have observed hemolysis (at 250 μM), changes in morphological parameters including echinocytes formation (at 250 μM), as well as increase in lipid peroxidation in erythrocytes (at 250 μM), ROS formation (at 100 μM) in red blood cells treated 1 hour with CFVF. Additionally, CFVF after 4 h of incubation oxidized hemoglobin, however, to a lower degree.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiptera 3aSiphonaptera 3achlorfenvinphos 3aerythrocytes 3aflow cytometry 3ahemoglobin 3ahemolysis 3ahousehold pests 3ahumans 3ainsect control 3ainsect pests 3alipid peroxidation 3alivestock 3amicroscopy 3amites 3anutrients 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apoisoning 3areactive oxygen species 3atoxicity 3axenobiotics 0aerythrocytes 0ahemolysis 0amethemoglobin 0alipid peroxidation 0aechinocytes 0achlorfenvinphos1 aHuras, Bogumiła1 aNowacka-Krukowska, Hanna1 aBukowska, Bożena0 tBiologia.g2013 June 13, v. 68, no. 4 p.773-778dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-013-0200-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02014naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001800187245015400205300001300359506007600372520068000448592002801128506003701156650001401193650001101207650004201218650001101260700001901271700002401290700002301314700002001337700002101357700002001378700002301398773010601421856008001527852000901607655001201616IND60119384320221207101908.0141214e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011938432DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2009-10-2-r232doi7 aPMC26882682pmcid7 a192367092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKorbel, Jan O10aPEMer: a computational framework with simulation-based error models for inferring genomic structural variants from massive paired-end sequencing data  ap. 2173.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPersonal-genomics endeavors, such as the 1000 Genomes project, are generating maps of genomic structural variants by analyzing ends of massively sequenced genome fragments.

Nevertheless, the interpretation of Hg concentrations is still questioned as a result of a poor knowledge of feather physiology and mechanisms affecting Hg deposition. Given the constraints of feather availability to ecotoxicological studies, we tested the effect of intra-individual differences in Hg concentrations according to feather type (body vs. flight feathers), position in the wing and size (mass and length) in order to understand how these factors could affect Hg estimates. We measured Hg concentration of 154 feathers from 28 un-moulted barn owls (Tyto alba), collected dead on roadsides. Median Hg concentration was 0.45 (0.076–4.5) mg kg⁻¹ in body feathers, 0.44 (0.040–4.9) mg kg⁻¹ in primary and 0.60 (0.042–4.7) mg kg⁻¹ in secondary feathers, and we found a poor effect of feather type on intra-individual Hg levels. We also found a negative effect of wing feather mass on Hg concentration but not of feather length and of its position in the wing. We hypothesize that differences in feather growth rate may be the main driver of between-feather differences in Hg concentrations, which can have implications in the interpretation of Hg concentrations in feathers. Finally, we recommend that, whenever possible, several feathers from the same individual should be analysed.

The catalysts were characterized by XRD, N₂ adsorption, FESEM, TEM and HRTEM, Pt L₃-edge XANES and EXAFS, dissolution-NMR, CO chemisorption, IR spectroscopy, and TGA. A positive correlation was observed between the degree of Pt reduction and CO₂ conversion. Contact time variation experiments showed that CO is a primary product of reaction, while CH₄ is a secondary product. Testing of catalyst crystals with 0.15 and 2.0 μm crystal size, respectively, revealed no influence of diffusion on the reaction rate. Comparison to a conventional Pt/SiO₂ catalyst showed very similar activation energy, with Eₐₚₚ = 50 ± 3 kJ·mol–¹. However, the turnover frequency over Pt/SiO₂ was significantly lower, and Pt/SiO₂ did not yield methane as a product. The Pt-containing UiO-67 Zr-MOF catalyst showed stable activity during 60 h of testing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactivation energy 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acrystals 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amethane 3anitrogen 3aprocess design 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemporal variation 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aØien-Ødegaard, Sigurd1 aBossers, Koen1 aNieuwelink, Anne-Eva1 aManzoli, Maela1 aBraglia, Luca1 aLazzarini, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0404-65971 aBorfecchia, Elisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8374-83291 aAhmadigoltapeh, Sajjad1 aBouchevreau, Boris1 aLønstad-Bleken, Bjørn Tore1 aHenry, Reynald1 aLamberti, Carlo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8004-23121 aBordiga, Silvia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2371-41561 aWeckhuysen, Bert M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5245-14261 aLillerud, Karl Petter1 aOlsbye, Unni1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3693-28570 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 56, no. 45 p.13206-13218dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b014573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245009700172300001600269520170200285592002801987650002402015650002302039650002402062650002002086650001302106650001102119650001402130650001502144650001602159650001802175650002302193650001902216650001202235650001602247653001402263653002302277653001202300653001602312653001102328653001302339700002002352700001902372773007802391856008102469852000902550655001202559IND50067068520221120040815.0160511e20130613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006706852DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-013-0202-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhandeparker, Lidita10aDegradation of barnacle nauplii: implications to chitin regulation in the marine environment  ap. 696-706.  aThe exoskeleton of most invertebrate larval forms is made of chitin, which is a linear polysaccharide of β (1→4)-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues. These larval forms offer extensive body surface for bacterial attachment and colonization. In nature, degradation of chitin involves a cascade of processes brought about by chitinases produced by specific bacteria in the marine environment. Microbial decomposition of larval carcasses serves as an alternate mechanism for nutrient regeneration, elemental cycling and microbial production. The present study was undertaken to assess the influence of chitinase enzyme on the degradation of the nauplii of barnacle, Balanus amphitrite. The survival and abundance of bacteria during the degradation process under different experimental conditions was monitored. To the best of our knowledge, no such study is conducted to understand the degradation of larval exoskeleton using chitinase and its influence on bacteria. An increase in the chitinase activity with increase in temperature was observed. Scanning electron micrographs of chitinase treated nauplii showed scars on the surface of the barnacle nauplii initially and further disruption of the exoskeleton was observed with the increase in the treatment time. Bacterial abundance of the chitinase treated nauplii increased with the increase in enzyme concentration. Pathogenic bacteria such as Vibrio cholerae, V. alginolyticus, V. parahaemolyticus which were initially associated with the exoskeleton were absent after chitinase treatment, however, Bacillus spp. dominated subsequent to chitinase treatment and this might have important implications to marine ecosystem functioning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aBalanus amphitrite 3aN-acetylglucosamine 3aVibrio cholerae 3abacteria 3achitin 3achitinase 3aecosystems 3aexoskeleton 3ainvertebrates 3amarine environment 3ameat carcasses 3anauplii 3atemperature 0achitinase 0aBalanus amphitrite 0anauplii 0azooplankton 0aGlcNAc 0abacteria1 aGaonkar, Chetan1 aDesai, Dattesh0 tBiologia.g2013 June 13, v. 68, no. 4 p.696-706dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-013-0202-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02029naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245016400171300001400335520088600349592002801235650001001263650001001273650001701283651001101300653002001311653002001331653001901351653002301370653002101393700001901414700002101433700001501454773013801469856005101607852000901658655001201667IND50086612220221116175446.0140412e20130401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008661222DNAL7 a10.1080/01650521.2013.7882852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLingnau, Rodrigo10aVocalization of Hylodes meridionalis (Mertens 1927) (Anura, Hylodidae) in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, with comments on nocturnal calling in the family Hylodidae  ap. 76-80.  aWe describe the advertisement and territorial calls of Hylodes meridionalis for the first time and provide observations on nocturnal calling activity for this species.

The endocrine factors in the gonads has been regarded to be involved in SSD. Two oocyte secreted factors-growth differentiation factor 9 (gdf9) and bone morphogenetic factor 15 (bmp15) has been shown to be differentially expressed in the gonad of Chinese tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis), a typical marine fish demonstrating female-biased SSD. To figure out their possible roles in fish SSD, gdf9 and bmp15 of C. semilaevis were firstly cloned. The subsequently phylogenetic and structural analysis revealed that gdf9 and bmp15 were clustered with other fish species and both contained TGF-beta domain in the C-terminal. Furthermore, the temporal and spatial expression by qRT-PCR showed that gdf9 and bmp15 displayed the highest expression level in the female gonad. Moreover, the highest levels of gdf9 and bmp15 transcripts were both detected in the 1.5-year-old female gonad. The in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence experiments revealed that their mRNAs and proteins were both located in the oocyte. Based on the methylome data and bisulfite sequencing PCR, the lowest DNA methylation levels for gdf9 was observed in the female gonad, mainly distributed in the upstream and genebody regions. As for bmp15 gene, the methylation level of females in the genebody region, especially the exon 1, was higher than that of males and pseudomale, while the methylation level of females in the downstream was the lowest. Finally, knock-down of gdf9 siRNA in C. semilaevis ovarian cells resulted in the down-regulation of alk4 and tgfbr1, and up-regulation of bmpr2, smad8, and bmp15. Taken together, the female-gonad-biased expression of gdf9 and bmp15 may be partly attributed to their upstream or genebody DNA methylation status. Gdf9 might be involved in reproduction and growth regulation of C. semilaevis by affecting Smad signaling pathway. Further exploration for these two ovarian factors would be helpful to better understand C. semilaevis SSD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynoglossus semilaevis 3aDNA methylation 3aanimal reproduction 3abisulfites 3abody size 3aexons 3afemales 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ahybridization 3amarine fish 3aoocytes 3aphylogeny 3asexual dimorphism 3atransforming growth factor beta 0aChinese tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) 0aSexual size dimorphism 0agdf9 0abmp15 0asiRNA1 aLi, Xihong1 aCheng, Peng1 aYang, Qian1 aChen, Zhangfan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7626-56091 aChen, Songlin1 aWang, Na1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2135-090X0 tTheriogenology.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 182 p.119-128dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2022.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03673naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245008200165300001800247520176900265592002802034596004702062596006602109596006602175650001502241650002102256650002102277650001602298650002502314650003202339650001602371650002302387650001402410650001302424650001402437650002002451650001902471650001402490650001402504650002402518650001602542650001102558650001302569650001402582650001802596650001502614650001102629650001102640650001102651650001102662700001402673700001902687700001602706700001602722700002002738700007502758773011102833856008202944852000903026655001203035IND60685375020221121024540.0200303e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068537502DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-020-02974-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Saerom10aCellulose/biopolymer/Fe3O4 hydrogel microbeads for dye and protein adsorption  ap. 2757-2773.  aCellulose-based magnetic hydrogel microbeads were prepared through sol–gel transition using a 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate-in-oil emulsion. Surface properties of the microbeads were altered by blending cellulose with chitosan, carrageenan, lignin, or starch. The adsorption capacity of the cellulose microbeads for crystal violet was 1.3 times higher after blending cellulose with carrageenan, while that for methyl orange was 2.0 times higher after blending cellulose with chitosan. As a model study, kinetics and isotherms for the adsorption of crystal violet on the cellulose/carrageenan microbeads were investigated to understand the effect of the biopolymer on the adsorption properties. Adsorption capacities of the cellulose microbeads for pepsin and bovine serum albumin were 1.6 and 1.2 times higher after blending cellulose with chitosan, respectively. The adsorption capacity of the cellulose/carrageenan microbeads for lysozyme was 1.2 times higher than that of the cellulose microbeads. The cellulose/alkali lignin and cellulose/starch magnetic microbeads were found to be efficient supports for immobilization of lipase. Specific activities of lipase immobilized on the cellulose/alkali lignin and cellulose/starch magnetic microbeads were 1.2- and 1.4-fold higher than that of free lipase, respectively. Under denaturing thermal conditions, the half-life of lipase immobilized on the cellulose/alkali lignin and cellulose/starch magnetic microbeads was 47- and 56-fold higher than that of free lipase, respectively. Thus, owing to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and controllability, the cellulose/biopolymer/Fe₃O₄ hydrogel microbeads may have many potential applications in biocatalytic, biomedical, and environmental fields.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018R1D1A1B07050163cMinistry of Education  a2017M1A2A2087647cMinistry of Science ICT and Future Planning  a2017M1A2A2087627cMinistry of Science ICT and Future Planning 3aadsorption 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3abiopolymers 3abovine serum albumin 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acarrageenan 3acatalytic activity 3acellulose 3achitosan 3aemulsions 3aenzyme activity 3agentian violet 3ahalf life 3ahydrogels 3aimmobilized enzymes 3airon oxides 3alignin 3alysozyme 3amagnetism 3amethyl orange 3amicrobeads 3amixing 3amodels 3apepsin 3astarch1 aOh, Yujin1 aYun, Jeongchel1 aYoo, Eunjin1 aJung, Dahun1 aOh, Kyeong Keun1 aLee, Paul S.q(Paul Sang Hyun),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6789-477X0 tCellulose.g2020 Mar., v. 27, no. 5 p.2757-2773dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-020-02974-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
