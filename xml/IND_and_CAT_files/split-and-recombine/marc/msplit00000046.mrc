Assets aid in exiting poverty, not independent of one another, but rather in combination. We develop an approach to estimate the complementarities between education, farm size and infrastructure. Limited access to the three assets of interest here (susceptible to medium- and long-term interventions) might prevent moving a large number of small farmers out of poverty in the short-term (even with support programs). Increased land holding often has lower poverty-reducing potential, and when its potential is high, it is in countries where most land is divided among small operations (for example, Bangladesh). Education is confirmed as highly poverty-alleviating, and has a high complementarity with infrastructure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aassets 3adeveloping countries 3aeducation 3afarm size 3afarmers 3ainfrastructure 3arural poverty 3aBangladesh1 aValdés, Alberto,1 aDavis, Benjamin1 aAnríquez, Gustavo,0 tApplied economic perspectives and policy.g2011 Dec., v. 33, no. 4 p.528-565dOxford University Pressx2040-57907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aepp/ppr0313Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03325naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013700155300002200292520181200314592002802126650002202154650003702176650002202213650001302235650001202248650002202260650001402282650002302296650002502319650002302344650001102367650002002378650001302398650002402411650001502435650002402450650001702474650001102491650003702502700002202539700001602561700002002577700002402597773012702621856007402748852000902822655001202831IND60641392420221122031342.0190505e20161128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064139242DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra24249a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Pin-Ju10aHighly active and reusable silica-aerogel-supported platinum–cobalt bimetallic catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ammonia borane  ap. 112109-112116.  aIn this study, a series of platinum–cobalt bimetallic catalysts supported on mesoporous silica aerogel (SAG), referred to as PCx/SAG, x = 1–6, were prepared by facile chemical reduction and a simple, efficient microwave-assisted method using Co and Pt precursors. The structure, morphology, and chemical composition of a representative catalyst, PC3/SAG, with molar ratio of Pt : Co = 0.27 : 0.73, was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM), inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP), as well as adsorption–desorption isotherm measurements. All of the as-prepared Pt–Co bimetallic catalysts were applied for the generation of hydrogen from an aqueous solution containing 0.33 wt% ammonia borane (AB, NH₃BH₃) at a metal to AB molar ratio (M/AB) of 0.05 at 303 K. The results indicated that among the prepared catalysts, PC3/SAG exhibited the highest catalytic efficiency for the hydrolysis of AB. As compared with that observed for the corresponding mixture of Pt/SAG and Co/SAG, the time required to complete hydrogen generation using the PC3/SAG catalyst was reduced by approximately 5.6 times. A synergistic catalytic effect was observed from PC3/SAG, leading to a high turnover frequency (123.1 mol H₂ per min per mol metal) and a low activation energy (30.2 kJ mol⁻¹). Furthermore, after reusing the catalyst for 5 cycles, the H₂/NH₃BH₃ molar ratio by the dehydrogenation of aqueous NH₃BH₃ by PC3/SAG retained an ideal value of 3.0, and complete hydrolysis was achieved each time in less than 3 min. These results indicate that the bimetallic catalyst PC3/SAG prepared herein is highly efficient for the generation of hydrogen from an aqueous AB solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aactivation energy 3aaerogels 3aammonia 3aaqueous solutions 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical composition 3achemical reduction 3acobalt 3adehydrogenation 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3ahydrolysis 3amicrowave treatment 3aporous media 3asilica 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aHsieh, Chia-Ching1 aChen, Po-Yu1 aWeng, Biing-Jyh1 aChen-Yang, Yui Whei0 tRSC advances.g2016 Nov. 28, v. 6, no. 113 p.112109-112116dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra24249a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02184naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002400141245006800165300001800233500001400251520089800265592002801163650002901191650001601220650002301236650001801259650001601277650001801293650001501311650001701326650001401343650001401357653002401371653001401395653002501409700002001434700002001454700001901474773018501493856007501678852000901753655001201762IND60691810220221119220222.0200502e19990101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069181022DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.63.18592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSASAKI-IGAWA, Keiko10aRole of Hydroxylysine on the Nodulation of Root Nodule Bacteria  ap. 1859-1864.  aNAL-light  aThe growth of Bradyrhizobium japonicum as well as Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. phaseoli growing in minimal medium was repressed by the addition of hydroxylysine (Hyl), although the sensitivity of the former to Hyl seemed to be lower than that of the latter. The nodulation efficiency of both Glycine max (L.) inoculated with B. japonicum cells and Phaseolus vulgaris (L.) inoculated with R. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli cells was reduced in the presence of Hyl, concomitantly with the decrease in the elongation of roots. Besides, the Hyl contents in the seed (seedling) exudates tended to increase when the host plants were inoculated with an unfavorable strain for their nodulation. These results suggest that the Hyl plays a role in the effective symbiotic relationship by regulating the growth of the root nodule bacteria on the root surface and/or the elongation of the host plant’s roots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3aGlycine max 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3abiotechnology 3ahost plants 3ahydroxylysine 3anodulation 3aroot nodules 3aseedlings 3asymbiosis 0ahydroxylysine (Hyl) 0aRhizobium 0aroot nodule bacteria1 aSatō, Tetsuya,1 aMASUDA, Hiroshi1 aOHWADA, Takuji0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g1999 Jan. 1, v. 63, no. 11 p.1859-1864dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.63.18593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02006naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012100168300001600289520087200305592002801177650001501205650002801220650001801248650001401266653001501280653002201295653001501317653002301332653001601355700001601371700001601387700001901403773012801422856008501550852000901635655001201644IND60530897420221119122304.0160723e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053089742DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b012532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Zeyuan10aSynergistic Effect of Acid–Base Coupling Bifunctional Ionic Liquids in Impregnated Resin for Rare Earth Adsorption  ap. 616-624.  aThe synergistic effect produced by ionic liquid extractants in the field of adsorption is first reported here. The data from this work show that the distribution coefficient and synergistic enhancement coefficient of Lu(III) extracted by [P₆₆₆₁₄][EHEHP] and [N₁₈₈₈][BTMPP] in impregnated resin are pronouncedly higher than those in solvent extraction. The synergistic interplay of combined acid–base coupling bifunctional ionic liquids (ABC-BILs) is the key to the higher adsorption efficiencies of REEs. Moreover, no third phase was observed in the adsorption systems. The elimination of the third phase from ABC-BIL is a remarkable advantage of adsorption over solvent extraction in the present study. This paper reveals efficient and environmently friendly potentials in both of academic research and industrial application for REEs adsorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aindustrial applications 3aionic liquids 3asynergism 0aRare earth 0aImpregnated resin 0aAdsorption 0aSynergistic effect 0aThird phase1 aSun, Xiaoqi1 aDong, Yamin1 aWang, Yanliang0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2016 Feb. 01, v. 4, no. 2 p.616-624dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b012533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01676naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009600170300001600266520050300282592002800785650001900813650001200832650001800844650002400862650002000886650001600906653002600922653003000948653002000978653001600998653002401014700001901038700002301057773012801080856008501208852000901293655001201302IND60530897520221119122116.0160723e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053089752DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b012652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBreen, John M.10aMicrowave Synthesis of Short-Chained Fluorinated Ionic Liquids and Their Surface Properties  ap. 387-391.  aMicrowave synthesis is shown to be a valuable route to novel fluorinated ionic liquid surfactants. 1-Methyl-3-(3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,6-nonafluorohexyl)imidazolium iodide was prepared by treatment of 1-methylimidazole with 1-iodo-1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorohexane in a microwave reactor, and this product underwent anion exchange to yield 1-methyl-3-(3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,6-nonafluorohexyl)imidazolium nonafluoro-1-butanesulfonate.

Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity are the serious side effects of fungicide. In the current study, I have evaluated acute cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of triphenyltin (TPT) on human hepatic carcinoma (HepG2) cells and the ameliorating effect of ascorbic acid for 24 h. In this experiment, I have exposed HepG2 cells to ascorbic acids (50, 100, and 200 μM) simultaneously and 24 h prior triphenyltin (TPT, 400 ng/ml) exposure for 24 h to determine the protective effect of ascorbic acid by using MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and NRU (neutral red uptake) assays. Oxidative stress, such as intracellular reactive oxygen species and glutathione levels, was measured in HepG2 cells. The intracellular reactive oxygen species was evaluated using fluorescent probe DCFDA (6-carboxy-2′,7′ dichloro-dihydrofluorescein diacetate). Apoptosis and genotoxicity effects of TPT in HepG2 cells were determined using flow cytometry and comet assay. The result of these experiments showed that the TPT compound (400 ng/ml) induced cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and apoptosis, and DNA damage in HepG2 cells.Ascorbic acid reduced cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and genotoxicity induced by TPT. Thus, ascorbic acid is a potent antioxidant, and it showed a significant protective effect against toxicity induced by TPT in HepG2 cells.  aPublisher supplied data  aResearchers Supporting Project number (RSP-2019/140)cKing Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia 3aDNA damage 3aDNA fragmentation 3aagrochemicals 3aapoptosis 3aascorbic acid 3acarcinoma 3acomet assay 3acytotoxicity 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescent dyes 3afungicides 3agenotoxicity 3aglutathione 3ahumans 3aliver 3aoxidative stress 3apollution 3aprotective effect 3areactive oxygen species 3aresearch0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 Aug., v. 27, no. 23 p.28890-28898dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08821-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012500175300001600300520159500316592002801911650002401939650001101963650001401974650001701988650001502005650001102020650001202031650001902043650002302062650001102085650001302096653002402109653001702133653001402150653001502164653001502179653001802194700005602212773011802268856008602386852000902472655001202481IND60605353320221120194133.0190628e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060535332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.07.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasih-Das, Jonathan10aAnaerobic co-digestion of foodwaste with liquid dairy manure or manure digestate: Co-substrate limitation and inhibition  ap. 917-924.  aProcess instability has been a challenge to anaerobic digestion of foodwaste at higher organic loading rates. Co-digestion is one of the measures to improve stability. This study conducted batch experiments to compare liquid dairy manure and dairy manure digestate as a co-substrate for anaerobic digestion of foodwaste. The batch co-digestion experiments showed a two-stage biogas production process, which could be simulated with a modification of the Gompertz model. The specific biogas yields derived with the two-stage biogas production model was further simulated against the co-substrate ratios with substrate limitation – inhibition models for identifying the optimal co-substrate ratio. The Haldane model was the best to simulate co-substrate limitation – inhibition kinetics in anaerobic co-digestion of foodwaste. A higher ratio of dairy manure could result in co-substrate inhibition to biogas production due to recalcitrance of cellulose and toxicity of lignin and lignin derivatives. Kinetic modeling shows that the optimal volatile solids (VS) ratio of liquid dairy manure is 16.6%, at which the maximum specific methane yield is 0.54 L/g VS. Semi-continuous co-digestion of 88% foodwaste and 12% liquid dairy manure at a hydraulic retention time of 14 d attained 94% of the simulated maximum methane yield. Although co-digestion of foodwaste and manure digestate resulted in lower biogas yields than co-digestion with liquid dairy manure, manure digestate is still an attractive co-substrate that has several operational advantages compared with liquid dairy manure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3acellulose 3adairy manure 3afood waste 3alignin 3aliquids 3alogit analysis 3amethane production 3amodels 3atoxicity 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aDairy manure 0aDigestate 0aFood waste 0aInhibition 0aKinetic model1 aTao, Wendong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3893-13130 tJournal of environmental management.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 223 p.917-924dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.07.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245005800170300001400228520177400242592002802016650001302044650001002057650001702067650001502084650001202099650001602111650002102127650001502148650001902163650001702182650001002199650001402209650001102223650001602234650002202250650002502272653002102297653002802318653001102346700002002357700002102377700001602398773009902414856008502513852000902598655001202607IND60564770220221119153721.0190415e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056477022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoinf.2017.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuan, Guangchen10aMining lake time series using symbolic representation  ap. 10-22.  aSensor networks deployed in lakes and reservoirs, when combined with simulation models and expert knowledge from the global community, are creating deeper understanding of the ecological dynamics of lakes. However, the amount of data and the complex patterns in the data demand substantial compute resources and efficient data mining algorithms, both of which are beyond the realm of traditional limnological research. This paper uniquely adapts methods from computer science for application to data intensive ecological questions, in order to provide ecologists with approachable methodology to facilitate knowledge discovery in lake ecology. We apply a state-of-the-art time series mining technique based on symbolic representation (SAX) to high-frequency time series of phycocyanin (PHYCO) and chlorophyll (CHLORO) fluorescence, both of which are indicators of algal biomass in lakes, as well as model predictions of algal biomass (MODEL). We use data mining techniques to demonstrate that MODEL predicts PHYCO better than it predicts CHLORO. All time series have high redundancy, resulting in a relatively small subset of unique patterns. However, MODEL is much less complex than either PHYCO or CHLORO and fails to reproduce high biomass periods indicative of algal blooms. We develop a set of tools in R to enable motif discovery and anomaly detection within a single lake time series, and relationship study among multiple lake time series through distance metrics, clustering and classification. Furthermore, to improve computation times, we provision web services to launch R tools remotely on high performance computing (HPC) resources. Comprehensive experimental results on observational and simulated lake data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aalgae 3aalgal blooms 3aalgorithms 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3acomputer science 3aecologists 3aexpert opinion 3afluorescence 3alakes 3alimnology 3amining 3aphycocyanin 3asimulation models 3atime series analysis 0aLake time series 0aSymbolic representation 0aMining1 aHanson, Paul C.1 aDugan, Hilary A.1 aPlale, Beth0 tEcological informatics.g2017 May, v. 39 p.10-22dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2190x1574-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2017.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245017200204300002000376500001900396520123100415592002801646650002101674650001301695650001401708650002601722650001301748650001501761650002701776650001301803650001801816650001501834650001901849651001101868700002201879773016901901856008302070852000902153655001202162IND60704313820221120064010.0201030e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070431382DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-09123-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaban, Magda1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8040-586214aThe quantification of bisphenols and their analogues in wastewaters and surface water by an improved solid-phase extraction gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method  ap. 28829-28839.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe study focused on the application of GC in the quantitative analysis of bisphenols and their analogues (12 analytes), and the improvement of solid-phase extraction for the whole water analysis of complex water samples. The role of silylation in the qualitative and quantitative analysis of bisphenols was investigated. Partial degradation occurred for selected targets during hot injection with the presence of a silylation agent. A PSA (primary and secondary amines) sorbent placed on the top of the solid-phase extraction (SPE) column sorbent was found to be a matrix component trap, mostly for humic acids. The whole water analysis was performed by washing the filters with methanol and recycling the extract to the sample. The validation of SPE-GC/MS(SIM) gave limits of detection of 1–50 ng/L for ten target bisphenols with a method recovery of between 87 and 133%. The application of the method was tested by the analysis of wastewater sampled from three wastewater treatment plants located in Poland, and municipal surface waters. The only analytes found were BPA and BPS, within the range of 16–1465 ng/L and < MDL-1249 ng/L in wastewater, and 170–3113 ng/L and < MDL-1584 ng/L in surface water, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical species 3amethanol 3apollution 3aquantitative analysis 3aresearch 3asilylation 3asolid phase extraction 3asorbents 3asurface water 3awastewater 3awater analysis 3aPoland1 aStepnowski, Piotr0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 Aug., v. 27, no. 23 p.28829-28839dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09123-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02456naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245013800160300001600298520148300314592002801797650001501825650001101840650001801851650000901869650001401878650001401892650001401906651001101920700002401931773009501955856007102050852000902121655001202130IND60403215320221122050624.0150831s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040321532DNAL7 a10.1071/IS140632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCairns, Stephen D.10aPhylogenetic reconstruction of scleraxonian octocorals supports the resurrection of the family Spongiodermidae (Cnidaria, Alcyonacea)  ap. 345-368.  aThe Scleraxonia are a group of octocorals that share similarities of their axis morphology. However, molecular phylogenetic analyses have shown this group to be largely polyphyletic. As a result, there is a significant lack of understanding of what constitutes distinct evolutionary units among members of this group, particularly at the family level. Prompted by the discovery of an unknown spongiodermid scleraxonian octocoral (Anthothelidae) from shallow water off the Pacific coast of lower Baja California, a phylogenetic analysis of the undescribed specimen, together with members of six scleraxonian families and an additional 29 non-scleraxonian octocorallian families was performed. Two mitochondrial loci (mtMutS and COI) and one nuclear locus (28S) supported a monophyletic spongiodermid clade (Homophyton, Callipodium, Diodogorgia, Titanideum and Sclerophyton, gen. nov.) at the family-level. The unknown scleraxonian was supported as a new genus and species within the spongiodermid clade, sister to the western Atlantic genus Titanideum. A morphological examination of the taxa within this clade revealed shared morphological similarities in solenial (boundary) canals, and medullar and cortical sclerites. A revision, with illustrations, of the Spongiodermidae was performed. Similar to previous studies, this study underscores the importance of combined morphological and molecular analyses in order to resolve unstable systematic relationships among octocorals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlcyonacea 3acoasts 3ainvertebrates 3aloci 3amonophyly 3anew genus 3apolyphyly 3aMexico1 aWirshing, Herman H.0 tInvertebrate systematics.g2015, v. 29, no. 4 p.345-368dCSIRO Publishingx1445-52267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/IS140633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02271naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012300156300001800279520112900297592002801426650001401454650002101468650001101489650002301500650001601523650001101539650001801550650001901568650001401587650001401601650002101615700001701636700001901653773014201672856007401814852000901888655001201897IND60642424420221120055051.0190507e20160629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064242442DNAL7 a10.1039/c6tb00514d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan, Leung10aCancer-targeted tri-block copolymer nanoparticles as payloads of metal complexes to achieve enhanced cancer theranosis  ap. 4517-4525.  aCancer targeting delivery and controlled release of metal complexes may offer a new approach to improve their anticancer efficacy with eliminated systemic toxicities. Herein, a biotin-conjugated tri-block polymer delivery system was designed and used as a carrier of potent ruthenium polypyridyl (RuPOP) complexes to achieve superior biocompatibility, higher water solubility and cancer-targeting ability. Biotin was used as a targeting molecule to enhance the cellular uptake and retention of RuPOP in diverse carcinoma cells. Furthermore, the nanosystem (Bio-PLGA@Ru) was efficiently internalized by cancer cells by the lipid raft-mediated endocytosis pathway, triggered ROS overproduction and activated p53-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells. Moreover, the nanosystem effectively accumulated in tumor tissue and alleviated the damage of the metal complex to the organs. Taken together, this study demonstrates a smart strategy for the fabrication of a biocompatible and cancer-targeted PLGA-based copolymer nanosystem to achieve superior tumor cell localization and anticancer ability with eliminated systemic toxicities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abiocompatibility 3abiotin 3acomposite polymers 3aendocytosis 3alipids 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aruthenium 3awater solubility1 aHuang, Yanyu1 aChen, Tianfeng0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2016 June 29, v. 4, no. 26 p.4517-4525dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6tb00514d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03490naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245006000188300001800248520142900266592002801695650002501723650002801748650003001776650001701806650002601823650002001849650002501869650001701894650001201911650002401923650001001947650001601957650002601973650001401999650002402013650000902037650001802046650002802064650002902092650001602121650002502137650002102162650004402183650003802227650005502265650002102320650003302341650001402374650002402388650004902412650004002461700001602501700001302517700001302530700001302543700001402556700002002570700001802590700001802608773010202626856005502728852000902783655001202792IND4468761720221118234134.0120727e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446876172DNAL7 a221500972pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03997.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Zheyong10aDivergent evolution of oxidosqualene cyclases in plants  ap. 1022-1038.  a• Triterpenes are one of the largest classes of plant metabolites and have important functions. A diverse array of triterpenoid skeletons are synthesized via the isoprenoid pathway by enzymatic cyclization of 2,3‐oxidosqualene. The genomes of the lower plants Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and moss (Physcomitrella patens) contain just one oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) gene (for sterol biosynthesis), whereas the genomes of higher plants contain nine to 16 OSC genes. • Here we carry out functional analysis of rice OSCs and rigorous phylogenetic analysis of 96 OSCs from higher plants, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Sorghum bicolor and Brachypodium distachyon. • The functional analysis identified an amino acid sequence for isoarborinol synthase (OsIAS) (encoded by Os11g35710/OsOSC11) in rice. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that expansion of OSC members in higher plants has occurred mainly through tandem duplication followed by positive selection and diversifying evolution, and consolidated the previous suggestion that dicot triterpene synthases have been derived from an ancestral lanosterol synthase instead of directly from their cycloartenol synthases. • The phylogenetic trees are consistent with the reaction mechanisms of the protosteryl and dammarenyl cations which parent a wide variety of triterpene skeletal types, allowing us to predict the functions of the uncharacterized OSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aBrachypodium distachyon 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aOryza sativa 3aPhyscomitrella patens 3aSorghum bicolor 3aamino acid sequences 3abiosynthesis 3acations 3adivergent evolution 3agenes 3ametabolites 3amosses and liverworts 3aphylogeny 3areaction mechanisms 3arice 3atriterpenoids 2aArabidopsisxenzymology 2aBrachypodiumxenzymology 2aCyclization 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGene Duplication 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aIntramolecular Transferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMultigene Family 2aOryzaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 2aSorghumxenzymology 2aSqualenexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aTriterpenesxchemistryxmetabolism.1 aDuan, Lixin1 aLiu, Dan1 aGuo, Jie1 aGe, Song1 aDicks, Jo1 aÓMáille, Paul1 aOsbourn, Anne1 aXiaoquan, Qi,0 tnew phytologist.g2012 Mar., v. 193, no. 4 p.1022-1038dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03997.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03329naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245014300207300001800350520176500368592002802133650001302161650001702174650001502191650002602206650001302232650001002245650002202255650001502277650002102292651002202313700006202335700006002397700005902457700006402516700007102580700005802651773011802709856008302827852000902910655001202919IND60734652620221117111353.0210731e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073465262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-021-01207-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoore, Harry A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9035-593712aA rocky heart in a spinifex sea: occurrence of an endangered marsupial predator is multiscale dependent in naturally fragmented landscapes  ap. 1359-1376.  aCONTEXT: Research on the impacts of anthropogenic habitat fragmentation has dominated landscape ecology for decades, yet our understanding of what drives species’ distributions in naturally fragmented landscapes remains limited. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to (i) determine whether rocky patches embedded within a ‘matrix’ of fire prone grasslands act as naturally fragmented landscapes for an endangered marsupial predator, the northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus), and (ii) reveal the extent to which within-patch, patch, landscape variables, and matrix condition drive the occurrence of northern quolls. METHODS: We deployed remote sensing cameras for a total of 200 nights, at 230 sites spanning rocky and grassland habitats across 6000 km² of the Pilbara bioregion of Western Australia. We examined the influence of within-patch, patch, landscape variables, and matrix condition on northern quolls using Generalised Linear Mixed Models. RESULTS: We found strong evidence that northern quoll habitat is naturally fragmented, observing higher occurrence and abundance of quolls in rocky patches than the surrounding grassland matrix. Within rocky patches, quolls were more likely to use patches with higher vegetation cover and den availability (within-patch), lower amounts of edge habitat relative to patch area (patch), and larger amounts of surrounding rocky habitat (landscape). When quolls entered the matrix, they tended to remain in areas with high vegetation cover, close to rocky patches. CONCLUSIONS: Species occurrence in naturally fragmented landscapes is influenced by factors operating at multiple scales. Rocky habitats are naturally fragmented and vital to the conservation of a range of taxa around the world, including the northern quoll.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDasyurus 3aedge effects 3agrasslands 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3aheart 3alandscape ecology 3alandscapes 3avegetation cover 3aWestern Australia1 aMichael, Damian R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3980-97231 aRitchie, Euan G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4410-88681 aDunlop, Judy A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4842-06721 aValentine, Leonie E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1479-07551 aHobbs, R.

Observations from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites have provided data on global terrestrial-water-storage (TWS) changes since 2002. Combining GRACE-TWS and land-surface model (LSM) estimates of soil water, snow-water equivalent and surface-water storage provides a method to quantify groundwater storage (Wgᵣₒᵤₙd). This study examines the Wgᵣₒᵤₙd seasonal variations and trends for Canada’s landmass during the period 2003–2016 using GRACE-TWS and the Canadian LSM EALCO (Ecological Assimilation of Land and Climate Observations) model. The results show the study region has a maximum seasonal variation (ΔWgᵣₒᵤₙd) of 118 mm (volume equivalent 700 km³), with the maximum/minimum Wgᵣₒᵤₙd appearing in July/April. Eastern Canada has relatively large ΔWgᵣₒᵤₙd values, up to 400 mm in Newfoundland. The Prairie region has the smallest value (<50 mm). The western and central regions show the maximum/minimum Wgᵣₒᵤₙd mostly in spring/fall. In contrast, eastern Canada has the maximum/minimum Wgᵣₒᵤₙd mostly in fall/spring. South Ontario and the Prairie area show the maximum/minimum Wgᵣₒᵤₙd in summer/winter. Additionally, the Wgᵣₒᵤₙd trends over the 14-year study period present large spatial variability, with increasing trends of up to 10 mm/year in eastern Canada and decreasing trends (similar magnitudes) in the west. The increasing trend largely offsets the decreasing trend in the study area, and the overall Wgᵣₒᵤₙd for the region does not show a significant trend during 2003–2016. Comparison of Wgᵣₒᵤₙd with groundwater well measurements present similar long-term trends but with a phase difference in seasonal variations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3agroundwater 3ahydrogeology 3amodels 3aseasonal variation 3asoil water 3aspring 3asummer 3asurface water 3awinter 3aOntario1 aWang, Shusen0 tHydrogeology journal.g2022 Mar., v. 30, no. 2 p.401-415dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3943547x1431-21747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-022-02460-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01990naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002600138245015400164300001600318520090400334592002801238650002101266650001601287650001701303650001001320650001001330650002101340650001601361650001201377651001001389700002001399700001901419773011901438856007401557852000901631655001201640IND60238491820221117222007.0151126e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023849182DNAL7 a10.1645/14-683.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGustafsson, Daniel R.14aThe Chewing Lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera: Ischnocera: Amblycera) of Japanese Pigeons and Doves (Columbiformes), with Descriptions of Three New Species  ap. 304-313.  aThe chewing louse fauna of pigeons and doves in Japan is reviewed based on published records and new collections.

P.10aOxygen-limited thermal tolerance is seen in a plastron-breathing insect and can be induced in a bimodal gas exchanger  ap. 2083-2088.  aThermal tolerance has been hypothesized to result from a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand. However, the generality of this hypothesis has been challenged by studies on various animal groups, including air-breathing adult insects. Recently, comparisons across taxa have suggested that differences in gas exchange mechanisms could reconcile the discrepancies found in previous studies. Here, we test this suggestion by comparing the behaviour of related insect taxa with different gas exchange mechanisms, with and without access to air. We demonstrate oxygen-limited thermal tolerance in air-breathing adults of the plastron-exchanging water bug Aphelocheirus aestivalis . Ilyocoris cimicoides , a related, bimodal gas exchanger, did not exhibit such oxygen-limited thermal tolerance and relied increasingly on aerial gas exchange with warming. Intriguingly, however, when denied access to air, oxygen-limited thermal tolerance could also be induced in this species. Patterns in oxygen-limited thermal tolerance were found to be consistent across life-history stages in these insects, with nymphs employing the same gas exchange mechanisms as adults. These results advance our understanding of oxygen limitation at high temperatures; differences in the degree of respiratory control appear to modulate the importance of oxygen in setting tolerance limits.  aPublisher supplied data 0aGlobal warming 0aHeat tolerance 0aHypoxia 0aMulti stressor 0aOCLTT 0aRespiration physiology1 aBilton, David T.0 tJournal of experimental biology.g2015 July 1, v. 218, no. 13 p.2083-2088dThe Company of Biologists LimitedwJournal:jnl49374x0022-09497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.1195603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03880naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003800117024004100155040001800196100001600214245014700230300001800377506007600395506003100471520168200502592002802184596004002212596002602252596002802278596004602306596004902352596003402401596002902435596002702464596000902491596001002500506003702510650002702547650001602574650001602590650002102606650001702627650001702644650001202661650001602673650001302689650001602702650002402718650001502742700004202757700001902799700001802818700002202836700002602858700002302884773011902907856011403026856008403140961000903224852000903233655001203242IND60733628220221207060202.0221002e20191113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073362822DNAL7 a10113/73362822hdl7 a10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b049552doi7 a10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b049552chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChio, Linda10aElectrostatic Assemblies of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes and Sequence-Tunable Peptoid Polymers Detect a Lectin Protein and Its Target Sugars  ap. 7563-7572.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aA primary limitation to real-time imaging of metabolites and proteins has been the selective detection of biomolecules that have no naturally occurring or stable molecular recognition counterparts. We present developments in the design of synthetic near-infrared fluorescent nanosensors based on the fluorescence modulation of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with select sequences of surface-adsorbed N-substituted glycine peptoid polymers. We assess the stability of the peptoid-SWNT nanosensor candidates under variable ionic strengths, protease exposure, and cell culture media conditions and find that the stability of peptoid-SWNTs depends on the composition and length of the peptoid polymer. From our library, we identify a peptoid-SWNT assembly that can detect lectin protein wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) with a sensitivity comparable to the concentration of serum proteins. To demonstrate the retention of nanosensor-bound protein activity, we show that WGA on the nanosensor produces an additional fluorescent signal modulation upon exposure to the lectin’s target sugars, suggesting the lectin protein remains active and selectively binds its target sugars through ternary molecular recognition interactions relayed to the nanosensor. Our results inform design considerations for developing synthetic molecular recognition elements by assembling peptoid polymers on SWNTs and also demonstrate these assemblies can serve as optical nanosensors for lectin proteins and their target sugars. Together, these data suggest certain peptoid sequences can be assembled with SWNTs to serve as versatile optical probes to detect proteins and their molecular substrates.  aPublisher supplied data  cArnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation  cBasic Energy Sciences  cBurroughs Wellcome Fund  cDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency  cFoundation for Food and Agriculture Research  cInnovative Genomics Institute  cLam Research Corporation  cParkinson's Foundation  cUSDA  cUSDOD0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aN-substituted glycines 3aagglutinins 3ablood serum 3acarbon nanotubes 3acell culture 3afluorescence 3alectins 3ametabolites 3apolymers 3aproteinases 3asensors (equipment) 3awheat germ1 aDel Bonis-O’Donnell, Jackson Travis1 aKline, Mark A.1 aKim, Jae Hong1 aMcFarlane, Ian R.1 aZuckermann, Ronald N.1 aLandry, Markita P.0 tNano Letters.g2019 Nov. 11, v. 19, no. 11 p.7563-7572dAmerican Chemical Society (ACS)wSource:2x1530-69927nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/73362823Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b049553Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02143naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011100158300001800269520105700287592002801344650001501372650002001387650001701407650000901424650001301433650002101446650001501467650001401482650001301496700001801509700001101527700001801538773014201556856007401698852000901772655001201781IND60642424920221120064443.0190507e20160615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064242492DNAL7 a10.1039/c6tb00539j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhixuan10aPhosphate-perylene modified G-quadruplex probes for the detection of Pb²⁺ using fluorescence anisotropy  ap. 4330-4336.  aA simple and universal phosphate-perylene modification strategy was applied in the development of G-quadruplex probes with thrombin binding aptamer (TBA) and [d(TGGGT)₄] (G4) sequences. A perylene moiety was inserted at different phosphate positions of oligonucleotides without a significant effect on the G-quadruplex structures. Upon binding with K⁺ or Pb²⁺, these probes showed different perylene fluorescence anisotropy responses due to the different labeling positions and G-quadruplex structures. Two probes (G4-9 and TBA-9) were successfully used in Pb²⁺ detection through fluorescence anisotropy. Once the complexes of Pb²⁺ with G4-9 or TBA-9 were formed, the rotational diffusion of the perylene moiety was limited, resulting in a significant increase in fluorescence anisotropy. Both probes showed good sensitivity to Pb²⁺ and their fluorescence anisotropy signals demonstrated good linear responses to the logarithm of Pb²⁺ concentrations and the detection limits were 24.5 nM and 30.0 nM for TBA-9 and G4-9, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3alead 3amoieties 3aoligonucleotides 3aphosphates 3apotassium 3athrombin1 aPei, Xiaojing1 aLi, Na1 aTang, Xinjing0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2016 June 15, v. 4, no. 24 p.4330-4336dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6tb00539j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245009600157300001600253520106200269592002801331650001201359650001201371650001901383650001601402650001501418650001901433650002301452650002901475650001001504650001101514650001601525653001901541653001401560653001401574653002001588653001101608700001801619700001901637773010901656856007101765852000901836655001201845IND60403217420221122061119.0150831s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040321742DNAL7 a10.1071/WF141342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzalez, S.

We examined effects of maximum fire temperature (a proxy for fire intensity) on the survival, growth and reproductive performance of the shrubs Mulinum spinosum and Senecio bracteolatus at 1 and 2 years post-fire in north-west Patagonian grasslands. We applied two fire temperature treatments to plants of each species. All M. spinosum plants survived fire treatments but high fire temperature notably decreased survival of S. bracteolatus. Bud position and plant architecture probably influenced shrub survival. During the first growing season, M. spinosum did not produce seeds whereas S. bracteolatus plants burned at low temperature produced three times more seeds and bigger seeds than unburned plants. Also, seeds from burned plants of S. bracteolatus had higher germinability than seed from unburned plants.

The present study aimed to assess the effect of arachidonic acid (AA) dietary enrichment on the reproductive performance in virgin females (two-years-old; individual weight 1.0 ± 0.2 kg) kept in fully controlled conditions with respect to different time of hormonal application. Two groups of breeders, ARA (fed AA enriched diet) and CTRL (fed control feed), were reared in two separated tanks of the recirculation system over the course of seven months. Five, six, and seven months after the start of trial, batches of five pairs of breeders (in total 15 pairs per each feeding group) from each group were hormonally treated. Ovulations occurred after six and seven months (oocyte diameter range 912−1030 μm), and samples of dry eggs were taken for the analysis of fatty acid profiles. Among the parameters of reproductive success, the embryo survival was significantly affected by the diet, while induction duration affected latency time only. The CTRL group females showed overall higher embryo survival across both reproduction occasions (p = 0.028) than group fed AA enriched diet (35.7 ± 17.1 % and 18.6 ± 13.6 % in CTRL and ARA group, respectively). A significant accumulation of AA was found in ARA group eggs in both reproduction batches. Virgin pikeperch breeders appear to keep at least one month plasticity towards the duration of spawning induction in controlled conditions and optimal oocyte diameter range for artificial reproduction is between 900−1000 μm. Levelling dietary AA with eicosapentaenoic acid during the entire photothermal protocol negatively altered the egg quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSander lucioperca 3aaquaculture 3aarachidonic acid 3adiet 3aegg quality 3aeggs 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3afatty acid composition 3aoocytes 3arearing 3areproductive performance 3areproductive success 3aspawning 3atanks 3avirgin females 0aPikeperch 0aPhotothermal spawning induction 0aLatency time 0aFinal oocyte maturation 0aOvulation1 aPéter, Géza1 aDemény, Ferenc1 aKugyela, Nándor1 aHorváth, Ákos,1 aPataki, Bernadett1 aHorvath, Zoltan,1 aSándor, Zsuzsanna Jakabne1 aRónyai, Andras0 tAquaculture reports.g2020 Nov., v. 18 p.100430-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2020.1004303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001400138245012400152300001600276520146800292592002801760650003201788650001701820650001901837650001201856650003101868650002501899650001301924650001001937650003101947650000901978650001301987650002002000700001502020700001802035700001402053700001602067700001302083773011902096856007402215852000902289655001202298IND60238492020221117222011.0151126e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023849202DNAL7 a10.1645/14-685.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Tao10aExpression of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1α in the Infiltrative Belt Surrounding Hepatic Alveolar Echinococcosis in Rats  ap. 369-373.  aOur main aims were to investigate hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) expression in the surrounding invasion range of hepatic alveolar echinococcosis (HAE) lesions and determine the pathological basis of angiogenesis. In total, 23 Wistar rats with hepatic echinococcus multilocularis infection were killed and their livers, which contained 27 HAE lesions, obtained. Specimen segments were generated from 119 paraffin blocks. Comparative analysis of the tissue samples containing HAE nodules and hepatic parenchyma of the surrounding region was performed with the immunohistochemical SP method in this animal experiment. Expression patterns of HIF-1α in the surrounding invasion range and the hepatic parenchyma were compared. The HIF-1α positive expression rate was 97.5% (116/119 samples). Expression of HIF-1α in the actively multiplying infiltrative region of the HAE lesions was significantly higher than that in hepatic parenchyma (P < 0.05). Overexpression of HIF-1α in the actively multiplying infiltrative region of HAE lesions in rats is closely related to angiogenesis and microvasculature. The sensitivity of HIF-1α facilitates its application as a representative maker of HAE. Our data indicate that the invasion range of HAE lesions is based on extrusion and compression, and induces anoxia and ischemia in hepatic tissue. Thus, HIF-1α provides a valuable index for evaluating HAE activity, and induces anoxia and ischemia in hepatic tissue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinococcus multilocularis 3aangiogenesis 3aechinococcosis 3ahypoxia 3ahypoxia-inducible factor 1 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aischemia 3aliver 3aparenchyma (animal tissue) 3arats 3asampling 3atissue analysis1 aLi, Haitao1 aYang, Lingfei1 aLei, Yang1 aYao, Lanhui1 aWen, Hao0 tJournal of parasitology.g2015 June, v. 101, no. 3 p.369-373dAmerican Society of Parasitologistsx0022-33957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1645%2F14-685.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03456naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148242077200209245016000981300001601141520157301157592002802730650001902758650001202777650001602789650001702805650001002822650001602832651001502848700001702863700002002880773012602900856008303026852000903109655001203118IND60770416720221118140019.0220316e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077041672DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-021-02431-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGailey, Robert M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4430-839210aAtténuation des défaillances des puits domestiques et coûts dans la planification de la gestion des eaux souterraines: observations des récents plans de durabilité des eaux souterraines en Californie, États-Unis Mitigación de deficiencias en pozos domésticos y costes en la planificación de la gestión de las aguas subterráneas: observaciones de los recientes planes de sostenibilidad de las aguas subterráneas en California, EEUU 地下水管理计划中的生活供水井失效的缓解措施和成本:美国加州近期地下水可持续性计划的经验 Mitigação da perda de integridade de poços domésticos e custos de planejamento do gerenciamento de água subterrânea: observações dos planos de sustentabilidade recentes na Califórnia, EUA10aDomestic-well failure mitigation and costs in groundwater management planning: observations from recent groundwater sustainability plans in California, USA  ap. 417-428.  aDomestic supply wells meet much of the world’s potable water demand. These wells tend to fail as regional groundwater levels decline from intensive agricultural groundwater use, especially during drought when additional pumping occurs. This work examines approaches for addressing impacts on domestic wells in much of the San Joaquin Valley in California, USA, where groundwater management is now required. Mitigation actions and their costs are considered to allow continued well operations as groundwater levels decline to target levels specified in groundwater management plans. The estimated total mitigation cost for groundwater-level declines to the planned management targets ranges from $42 to $96 million depending upon well retirement age. If groundwater levels decline further to defined limits below the management targets allowed during drought, costs increase by $78 to $153 million. There will likely be competition for specialized labor to implement the mitigation actions since agricultural wells will also be affected. Unless current groundwater management plans become more stringent and specify shallower groundwater depth targets, proactive mitigation should be considered for the most vulnerable areas to prevent impacts from growing beyond the capacity for timely mitigation and to avoid widespread failure of rural domestic water supplies. The cost of mitigation for impacted wells is estimated to be less than 2% of the benefit to agriculture from being allowed to pump groundwater in excess of management targets during a multiyear drought.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrinking water 3adrought 3agroundwater 3ahydrogeology 3alabor 3awater table 3aCalifornia1 aLund, Jay R.1 aPhilipp, Jon R.0 tHydrogeology journal.g2022 Mar., v. 30, no. 2 p.417-428dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3943547x1431-21747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-021-02431-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03529naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245014300203300002000346500001900366520175400385592002802139596004002167596004002207650001802247650002202265650001202287650001902299650002002318650001802338650001102356650002902367650001902396650001202415650001502427650001702442650001102459650002002470650003302490650001302523650002002536650001702556650001902573650001402592650002102606650001302627650001202640650001702652650001302669700002002682773016902702856008302871852000902954655001202963IND60704314820221121023415.0201030e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070431482DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-09194-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRashedi, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5791-814410aLife cycle assessment of most widely adopted solar photovoltaic energy technologies by mid-point and end-point indicators of ReCiPe method  ap. 29075-29090.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present article focuses on a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) of the most widely adopted solar photovoltaic power generation technologies, viz., mono-crystalline silicon (mono-Si), multi-crystalline silicon (multi-Si), amorphous silicon (a-Si) and cadmium telluride (CdTe) energy technologies, based on ReCiPe life cycle impact assessment method. LCA is the most powerful environmental impact assessment tool from a product perspective and ReCiPe is one of the most advanced LCA methodologies with the broadest set of mid-point impact categories. More importantly, ReCiPe combines the strengths of both mid-point-based life cycle impact assessment approach of CML-IA, and end-point-based approach of Eco-indicator 99 methods. Accordingly, the LCA results of all four solar PV technologies have been evaluated and compared based on 18 mid-point impact indicators (viz., climate change, ozone depletion, terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication, marine eutrophication, human toxicity, photochemical oxidant formation, particulate matter formation, terrestrial ecotoxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity, marine ecotoxicity, ionising radiation, agricultural land occupation, urban land occupation, natural land transformation, water depletion, metal depletion and fossil depletion), 3 end-point/damage indicators (viz., human health, ecosystems and cost increases in resource extraction) and a unified single score. The overall study has been conducted based on hierarchist perspective and according to the relevant ISO standards. Final results show that the CdTe thin-film solar plant carries the least environmental life cycle impact within the four PV technologies, sequentially followed by multi-Si, a-Si and mono-Si technology.  aPublisher supplied data  a13127241cCharles Darwin University  a26181420cCharles Darwin University 3aacidification 3aagricultural land 3acadmium 3aclimate change 3acradle-to-grave 3aecotoxicology 3aenergy 3aenvironmental assessment 3aeutrophication 3afossils 3afreshwater 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aland use change 3alife cycle impact assessment 3aoxidants 3aozone depletion 3aparticulates 3aphotochemistry 3apollution 3apower generation 3aresearch 3asilicon 3asolar energy 3atoxicity1 aKhanam, Taslima0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 Aug., v. 27, no. 23 p.29075-29090dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09194-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245013900156500001400295520189100309592002802200650002002228650001102248650002002259650002902279700001302308700001502321700001802336700001302354700001502367773012802382856007402510852000902584655001202593IND60733628720221121063904.0210410e20210331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073362872DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130713272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Ling 10aImage Enhancement Driven by Object Characteristics and Dense Feature Reuse Network for Ship Target Detection in Remote Sensing Imagery  aNAL-light  aAs the application scenarios of remote sensing imagery (RSI) become richer, the task of ship detection from an overhead perspective is of great significance. Compared with traditional methods, the use of deep learning ideas has more prospects. However, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has poor resistance to sample differences in detection tasks, and the huge differences in the image environment, background, and quality of RSIs affect the performance for target detection tasks; on the other hand, upsampling or pooling operations result in the loss of detailed information in the features, and the CNN with outstanding results are often accompanied by a high computation and a large amount of memory storage. Considering the characteristics of ship targets in RSIs, this study proposes a detection framework combining an image enhancement module with a dense feature reuse module: (1) drawing on the ideas of the generative adversarial network (GAN), we designed an image enhancement module driven by object characteristics, which improves the quality of the ship target in the images while augmenting the training set; (2) the intensive feature extraction module was designed to integrate low-level location information and high-level semantic information of different resolutions while minimizing the computation, which can improve the efficiency of feature reuse in the network; (3) we introduced the receptive field expansion module to obtain a wider range of deep semantic information and enhance the ability to extract features of targets were at different sizes. Experiments were carried out on two types of ship datasets, optical RSI and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. The proposed framework was implemented on classic detection networks such as You Only Look Once (YOLO) and Mask-RCNN. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3amemory 3aneural networks 3asynthetic aperture radar1 aCao, Yu 1 aHe, Bokun 1 aZhang, Yifan 1 aHe, Chu 1 aLi, Deshi 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Mar. 31, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130713273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001300167245010600180300001600286520107700302592002801379650001801407650002701425650001201452650002401464650000901488650001101497650001701508650001301525650001701538650001201555650003201567650004701599650003301646650005201679650001101731650002901742650000901771650000901780650002301789650001901812650007701831650005001908650001701958650005101975650003802026650003002064650006302094650006902157650001702226700001502243700001602258700001102274700001702285700001402302700001302316700001602329773008402345856008402429852000902513655001202522IND4476887320221118234139.0141111e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447688732DNAL7 a213767872pmid7 a10.1016/j.fitote.2011.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Chao10aTriptolide ameliorates Crohn's colitis is associated with inhibition of TLRs/NF-κB signaling pathway  ap. 709-715.  aGrowing evidence suggests that TLRs/NF-κB signaling pathway plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). We have reported that triptolide, an active component from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook, showed therapeutic activity in IL-10-deficeint (IL-10⁻/⁻) mice, a murine CD model. However the full mechanisms of action of this agent in CD remain largely unknown. We hypothesized that triptolide would ameliorate the experimental colitis by inhibiting TLRs/NF-κB signaling pathway. We found TLR2 and TLR4 were upregulated in IL-10⁻/⁻ mice, triptolide inhibited the TLRs/NF-κB signaling pathway in vivo. In addition, triptolide in vitro was able to downregulate the TLRs/NF-κB pathway in cultured colonic explants from CD patients. Our results confirm the therapeutic effect of triptolide in experimental colitis, and suggest it as a promising compound for CD treatment. These findings also support the possibility that targeted inhibition of TLR signaling pathway is an approach deserving further investigation as a therapeutic strategy for CD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrohn disease 3aTripterygium wilfordii 3acolitis 3amechanism of action 3amice 3amodels 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3atherapeutics 2aAnimals 2aCrohn Diseasexdrug therapy 2aDiterpenesxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aDrug Evaluation, Preclinical 2aEpoxy Compoundsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aHumans 2aInterleukin-10xgenetics 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Knockout 2aMyeloid Differentiation Factor 88xantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aPhenanthrenesxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aPhytotherapy 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effects 2aTissue Culture Techniques 2aToll-Like Receptorsxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription Factor RelAxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aTripterygium1 aShan, Ting1 aFeng, Aiwen1 aLi, Yi1 aZhu, Weiming1 aXie, Ying1 aLi, Ning1 aLi, Jieshou0 tFitoterapia.g2011 June, v. 82, no. 4 p.709-715dElsevier B.V.x0367-326X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fitote.2011.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009300166520174000259592002801999650001402027650001502041650001802056650001802074650001202092650001102104650002202115650002502137650003102162650002002193650000902213650001802222653002102240653001102261653004902272653001502321653002102336653001302357700006302370700006302433773012102496856008202617852000902699655001202708IND60790514920221118134959.0220830e20221101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079051492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2022.1117542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHali, Mirabela10aAlpha4 contributes to the dysfunction of the pancreatic beta cell under metabolic stress  aThe current study examined the roles of Alpha4, a non-canonical subunit of protein phosphatase 2A, in the regulation of acute (insulin secretion) and chronic (cell dysfunction) effects of glucose in pancreatic beta cells. Alpha4 is expressed in human islets, rat islets and INS-1832/13 cells. Incubation of INS-1832/13 cells and rat islets with high glucose (HG) significantly increased the expression of Alpha4. C2-Ceramide, a biologically active sphingolipid, also increased the expression of Alpha4 in INS-1832/13 cells and rat islets. Subcellular distribution studies of Alpha4 in low glucose (LG) and HG exposed INS-1832/13 cells revealed that it is predominantly cytosolic, and its expression is significantly increased in the non-nuclear/cytosolic fractions in cells exposed to HG. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Alpha4 exerted minimal effects on glucose- or KCl-induced insulin secretion. siRNA-mediated deletion of Alpha4 significantly increased p38MAPK and JNK1/2 phosphorylation under LG conditions, comparable to the degree seen under HG conditions. Paradoxically, a significant potentiation of HG-induced p38MAPK and JNK2 phosphorylation was noted following Alpha4 deletion. HG-induced CHOP expression (ER stress marker) and caspase-3 activation were markedly attenuated in cells following Alpha4 knockdown. Deletion of Alpha4 in INS-1832/13 cells prevented HG-induced loss in the expression of Connexin36, a gap junction channel protein, which has been implicated in normal beta cell function. Lastly, depletion of endogenous Alpha4 significantly reduced HG-induced cell death in INS-1832/13 cells. Based on these findings we conclude that Alpha4 contributes to HG-induced metabolic dysfunction of the islet beta cell.  aPublisher supplied data 3acaspase-3 3acell death 3aendocrinology 3agap junctions 3aglucose 3ahumans 3ainsulin secretion 3aislets of Langerhans 3aphosphoprotein phosphatase 3aphosphorylation 3arats 3asphingolipids 0aPancreatic islet 0aAlpha4 0aPP2A or Protein-serine/threonine phosphatase 0aConnexin36 0aMetabolic stress 0aDiabetes1 aWadzinski, Brian E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2980-36971 aKowluru, Anjaneyulu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1700-00770 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 557 p.111754-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2022.1117543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01785naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245014500160300001800305520055900323592002800882650002600910650002300936650002300959650002200982650002201004650002001026650003001046700002001076700002701096700001901123700002301142700002201165700002201187773011801209856007501327852000901402655001201411IND60550093920180208000000.0160909e20130215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055009392DNAL7 a10.1021/jo302460d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomez, Catherine10aPhosphine-Catalyzed Synthesis of 3,3-Spirocyclopenteneoxindoles from γ-Substituted Allenoates: Systematic Studies and Targeted Applications  ap. 1488-1496.  aThe phosphine-promoted [3 + 2] cyclizations between γ-substituted allenoates and arylideneoxindoles have been applied to the stereoselective synthesis of spiro(cyclopentene)oxindoles with trisubstituted cyclopentene units.

In water bodies falling in this category, hydromorphological modifications are permanent, significantly alter the character of the river and cannot be removed without compromising the use of the water body. In HMWBs a dedicated approach to the evaluation of their status is set, and their Ecological Potential must be assessed. Crucial to the process is the definition of Maximum Ecological Potential (MEP) as the reference conditions for HMWB. In the present paper we aim to define MEP conditions for Italian heavily modified lowland rivers, affected by strong bank protection (i.e. levees or bank reinforcement) in reason of flood protection and land drainage uses. The approach applied to identify MEP conditions follows the one considered for natural (not heavily modified) rivers in Italy and large part of Europe and bases on the identification of ‘reference sites’ representative for the river category and alteration. For the selection of MEP sites environmental features representing mitigation measures and/or expected natural features were considered. The ability of such features in discriminating MEP and disturbed sites was verified by multivariate analyses run on abiotic features (Principal Component Analysis) and biological communities (non-metric multidimensional scaling). We demonstrated differences both in terms of invertebrate community and biological metrics used to assess ecological status (and potential) between MEP and impaired river stretches. Finally, we recognized relevant habitat features able to clearly separate MEP reaches from nonMEP reaches with indication on the type and quantity of measures significant for benthic invertebrates and applicable in lowland Heavily Modified Water Bodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrainage 3aflood control 3ahabitats 3ainvertebrates 3alaws and regulations 3amultidimensional scaling 3amultivariate analysis 3aprincipal component analysis 3arivers 3asurface water 3aItaly 0aInvertebrates 0aBank protection 0aMitigation measures 0aWFD 0aMaximum Ecological Potential 0aHMWB1 aTerranova, Laura1 aCazzola, Marcello1 aCason, Manuela1 aBuffagni, Andrea0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Sept. 20, v. 684 p.196-206dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.05.3483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245016900167300001600336520100900352592002801361650002201389650002101411650001301432650001401445650001701459650001701476650002401493650001801517650001201535650002601547650001501573650001301588650002001601650001101621650001601632650001201648650001801660650003701678650001701715653001801732653001201750653002401762700001801786700001201804773013201816856008701948852000902035655001202044IND60617669920221120154618.0181127e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061766992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.10.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Hongli10aIn situ reduction of silver nanoparticles by gelatin to obtain porous silver nanoparticle/chitosan composites with enhanced antimicrobial and wound-healing activity  ap. 633-642.  aThe identification of materials with beneficial properties for wound healing is a major research goal. In this study, gelatin was used as a reducing agent and stabilizer to restore silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in situ, which were mixed with chitosan (CS), crosslinked with tannic acid, and then freeze-dried to obtain a new composite Gelatin/CS/Ag. Gelatin/CS/Ag has a dense pore structure with a pore size of about 100–250 μm. The pores were interconnected. The existence of AgNPs was proven by UV visible spectrophotometry, XRD, and electron microscopy. Gelatin/CS/Ag exhibited good mechanical properties, water absorption, and moisture retention. The material was evaluated in antibacterial experiments, and a good inhibitory effect of Gelatin/CS/Ag was observed. Gelatin/CS/Ag co-cultured with L929 cells did not show cytotoxicity. Finally, Gelatin/CS/Ag promoted wound healing and showed good biocompatibility. In summary, Gelatin/CS/Ag has promising antibacterial and wound healing properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiocompatibility 3achitosan 3acoculture 3acrosslinking 3acytotoxicity 3aelectron microscopy 3afreeze drying 3agelatin 3amechanical properties 3ananosilver 3aporosity 3areducing agents 3asilver 3astabilizers 3atannins 3atissue repair 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awater uptake 0aWound healing 0aGelatin 0aSilver nanoparticle1 aCheng, Junwen1 aYu, Kun0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Jan., v. 121 p.633-642dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.10.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03739naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002000148245011300168300001800281520224400299592002802543650002402571650004302595650001202638650002602650650001402676650001302690650002202703650001902725650002102744650001002765650001302775650002502788650001302813650000902826650001902835650002302854650002302877650002302900650002102923650001602944650001502960651001802975700002002993700001903013773010803032856008403140852000903224655001203233IND4450490420221118234124.0141111e20110415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445049042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2011.01.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEmery, Sarah M.10aFire intensity effects on seed germination of native and invasive Eastern deciduous forest understory plants  ap. 1401-1408.  aLow-intensity fires were important for maintaining the structure of Eastern deciduous forests (EDFs) for thousands of years before European settlement of North America, though fire suppression became a standard management practice in the 1930s. More recently, prescribed fires have been reintroduced to EDF habitats to aid in the restoration of native plant diversity, but invasions of non-native species such as Microstegium vimineum (Japanese stiltgrass) may increase prescribed fire intensity and suppress colonization of native species. As fire becomes a more common management tool in these habitats, it is vital to predict fire temperature effects on the native and non-native species present in the system. In this study, we found that prescribed fires in areas invaded by Microstegium can be 250–300°C hotter than fires in nearby native-dominated areas. We then compared the effects of fire on germination rates of six native and three non-native EDF understory species representing the range of functional groups common in this habitat. We manipulated both fire intensity (temperature and length of exposure) and type of fire effect (direct flame and indirect furnace heat) to generate germination curves and make predictions about potential prescribed fire effects on populations of these species. There were very different responses among species to both direct (flame) and indirect (furnace) heating. Germination of three native species, Lycopus americana (American water horehound), Verbesina alternifolia (wingstem), and Vernonia gigantea (tall ironweed), showed signs of being stimulated by heating at low temperatures, while germination of all non-native species (M. vimineum, Elaeagnus umbellata, and Schedonorus phoenix) were inhibited at these lower intensities. High fire intensity (temperatures above 300°C) effectively killed most species, though one native species, Senna hebacarpa (American senna) and one non-native species, E. umbellata (autumn olive), were capable of tolerating 500°C temperatures. We conclude that high-intensity prescribed fires in habitats invaded by Microstegium may reduce seed germination of some non-native species, but may also inhibit the regeneration of native understory species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeagnus umbellata 3aFestuca arundinacea subsp. arundinacea 3aLycopus 3aMicrostegium vimineum 3aVerbesina 3aVernonia 3adeciduous forests 3afire intensity 3afire suppression 3afires 3afurnaces 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitats 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3aprescribed burning 3aseed germination 3atemperature 3aunderstory 3aNorth America1 aUwimbabazi, Joy1 aFlory, S.

The stereochemical outcome could be controlled by substrate-engineering through size-variation of the ester moiety and by employing stereochemically pure (E)- or (Z)-isomers, which allowed to access both enantiomers of each product in up to quantitative conversion in enantiomerically pure form. In addition, stereoselectivities and conversions could be improved by mutant variants of OPR1, and the utility of the system was demonstrated by preparative-scale applications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aenantiomers 3aesters 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3amoieties 3amutants 3aorganic chemistry 3astereochemistry1 aClay, Dorina1 aDavies, Simon1 aO’Neill, Pat1 aMcDaid, Paul1 aDebarge, Sebastien1 aSteflik, Jeremy1 aKarmilowicz, Mike1 aWong, John W.1 aFaber, Kurt0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2013 Feb. 15, v. 78, no. 4 p.1525-1533dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo302484p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245009100164300001800255520164700273592002801920653001501948653001501963653002601978653002502004653002102029653001802050653001102068700001902079700002102098773014802119856007402267852000902341655001202350IND60331724820221120113723.0150727e20150701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6033172482DNAL7 a10.1242/jeb.1235132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiardini, Jamie-Lee10aConsequences of calcium decline on the embryogenesis and life history of Daphnia magna  ap. 2005-2014.  aAmbient calcium is declining in thousands of soft-water lake habitats in temperate regions as a consequence of unsustainable forestry practices, decreased atmospheric calcium deposition and acidic deposition. As their exoskeleton is heavily reinforced with calcium, freshwater crustaceans have a high specific calcium requirement relative to other aquatic organisms. Daphnia , in particular, is an ideal crustacean for investigating the consequences of calcium decline because it is an abundant and important member of freshwater zooplankton communities. Although it has been established that adult and juvenile Daphnia have different tolerances to low ambient calcium as a result of their different life stage-specific calcium requirements, the consequences of declining calcium on embryonic development have never been investigated. Here, we describe the distribution of calcium in embryonic stages of D. magna and introduce a novel and easy to use staging scheme. We tested whether calcium can be traced from mothers to their offspring. Finally, we assessed the fitness consequences of maternal provisioning in limiting calcium environments. We found that while embryos require calcium for their development and moulting, they do not equilibrate with environmental calcium levels. Instead, we were able to trace calcium from mothers to their offspring. Furthermore, our data strongly suggest that females are faced with an allocation trade-off between providing calcium to their offspring and using it for growth and moulting. Together, these data provide novel insights into the consequences of calcium decline for freshwater zooplankton.  aPublisher supplied data 0aFreshwater 0aCrustacean 0aEmbryonic development 0aAllocation trade-off 0aMaternal effects 0aAcidification 0aStress1 aYan, Norman D.1 aHeyland, Andreas0 tJournal of experimental biology.g2015 July 1, v. 218, no. 13 p.2005-2014dThe Company of Biologists LimitedwJournal:jnl49374x0022-09497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.1235133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04303naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245013000178300001100308520287600319592002803195596007403223596004203297596002403339650001503363650001103378650002003389650001403409650001903423650001003442650002403452650002303476650002603499650001303525650002203538650001003560700007703570700003203647773011003679856008303789852000903872655001203881IND60784344620221118073747.0221005e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078434462DNAL7 a10.1186/s13595-022-01153-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Cunha Vargas, Betânia12aA dataset of Neotropical liana research focusing on the strategies of control for forest restoration and management practices  ap. 32.  aKEY MESSAGE: Forest fragmentation leads to a micro-environmental condition that favors the proliferation of liana, which infest trees, compete with them, and reduce their performance. To report the state of the art of the main actions to manage this structural component of tropical forests, we surveyed the control strategies in the literature in the last 71 years, highlighting research goals, tree-climber interactions, management, restoration, and conservation. Dataset access is at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6678112 . Associated metadata are available at https://metadata-afs.nancy.inra.fr/geonetwork/srv/fre/catalog.search#/metadata/712ff481-dfa2-4ddb-b4fa-fcbd7c517842 CONTEXT: Lianas (woody vines) are considered structural parasites of tropical trees because they start their development as terrestrial seedlings but need to reach a tree canopy for higher light availability. The tree-liana coexistence usually can damage tree species, thus removing lianas has been suggested as an alternative to reinforce forest regeneration. AIMS: The dataset compilation begun during the first author doctoral work and a first dataset on neotropical lianas was published (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4050477) in 2020. The present dataset (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6678112) presents an update of the 2020 dataset with additional amend (published articles from 2018 to 2021) and enhanced metadata descriptions. Our aim is providing an updated database extracted from scientific literature compiling information related to the effect of lianas on tree and forest structure and diversity, and to contribute to improve decision making on forest restoration and management. METHODS: We made a systematic literature review on lianas in the Neotropical region (native or restored) from 1950 to 2021. First, we selected studies on liana management and described each paper according to the following topics: vegetation status, positive (P), and negative (N) effects of lianas on each species, the species in focus, and the suggested management strategy. RESULTS: Almost 83% of the studies pointed out tree-climber interactions as negative to trees. Cutting was the management strategy adopted in 92% of the studies. Controlled burning, enrichment, and selective cutting were adopted in only one paper. Rainy and seasonal forests were the vegetation types with more studied sites (20 and 17 respectively). Only one study suggested enhancing forest diversity through direct seeding of lianas. Four studies evaluated the impact of lianas on forest diversity and forest fauna. CONCLUSION: The data collected showed the different impacts of liana management on the diversity and structure of tropical forests. It can endorse environmental control and management practices and evaluate the consequences of these techniques in recovering forests or improving timber production.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrants #2013/50155-0 FAPESP-Microsoft Research, #2010/51307-0cFAPESP  a2009/54208-6 EMUcFAPESP-VALE-FAPEMIG  a428055/2018-4cCNPq 3aNeotropics 3acanopy 3adata collection 3adatabases 3adirect seeding 3afauna 3aforest regeneration 3aforest restoration 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ametadata 3atimber production 3atrees1 aGuaratini, Maria Tereza Grombone,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1644-05911 aMorellato, L.

The investigation was carried out for a winter period (2 February–6 March) and for one summer month (August) of the reference year 2009. HF radar measurements were compared with in situ recordings from a weather station and with model data, with the aim of resolving both small scale and large scale dynamics. The analysis of the overall performance of the HF radar system in the Gulf of Naples shows that the data are reliable when the wind speed exceeds a 5 m/s threshold. Despite such a limitation, this study confirms the potentialities of these systems as monitoring platforms in coastal areas and suggests further efforts towards their improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aradar 3asummer 3awind direction 3awind speed 3aMediterranean Sea 3aTyrrhenian Sea1 aEsposito, Giovanni 1 aDi Lemma, Roberta 1 ade Ruggiero, Paola 1 aZambianchi, Enrico 1 aPierini, Stefano 1 aFalco, Pierpaolo 1 aBuonocore, Berardino 1 aCianelli, Daniela 1 aUttieri, Marco 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Mar. 31, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130713333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02630naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245017100168300001200339520146200351592002801813650002701841650001501868650001501883650002001898650001901918650000701937650001701944650001601961650002501977650001302002700002202015773015102037856008302188852000902271655001202280IND60770417620221118135603.0220906e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077041762DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-022-09930-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShojaei, Meysam10aUltrasonic-assisted synthesis of zeolite/activated carbon@MnO2 composite as a novel adsorbent for treatment of wastewater containing methylene blue and brilliant blue  ap. 279.  aIn this study, zeolite/activated carbon@MnO₂ composite was used as a novel adsorbent to eliminate methylene blue (MB) and brilliant blue (BB) dyes from aqueous media. To this end, activated carbon (AC) was produced by Ziziphus Spina-Christi leaves and then used to synthesize zeolite/AC@MnO₂ composite. Various analyses such as BET, SEM, EDX, Map, FTIR, and XRD were performed to determine the surface features of the above composite. BET analysis indicated that the aforementioned composite has a mesoporous structure. Also, the best conditions for the adsorption of MB and BB dyes were obtained at pH of 9 and 2, temperature of 25 °C, adsorbent dosage of 1 and 2 g/L, initial dye concentration of 10 mg/L, and contact time of 40 and 60 min, respectively. Under optimal conditions, the utmost removal efficiency of MB and BB dyes using the zeolite/AC@MnO₂ composite was 98.43% and 96.54%, respectively, indicating significant adsorption efficiencies. Moreover, the utmost adsorption capacity of MB and BB dyes was 67.56 and 66.22 mg/g, respectively. Furthermore, intraparticle and film diffusion mechanisms were very important in the adsorption process. Besides, thermodynamic and equilibrium studies indicated that the adsorption process is exothermic, physical, and spontaneous. Generally, the aforementioned composite has a significant adsorption capacity and can be a suitable adsorbent to eliminate cationic dyes from industrial effluents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZiziphus spina-christi 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aheat production 3amethylene blue 3apH 3aporous media 3atemperature 3awastewater treatment 3azeolites1 aEsmaeili, Hossein0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2022 Apr., v. 194, no. 4 p.279-279dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-09930-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245020600163500001400369520142500383592002801808650000901836650001501845650002101860650002301881650002601904650001601930650001901946650001601965650001901981650001802000650002902018700002502047773012802072856007402200852000902274655001202283IND60733629320221121063816.0210410e20210331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073362932DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130713312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoung, Kyle  S.

Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems-deployed thermal infrared sensors (sUAS-TIR) provide a financially and logistically inexpensive means of identifying SGD source zones and quantifying SGD thermal infrared (TIR) plume areas over regional scales at high spatial resolutions. sUAS-TIR additionally offers the unique capability of high temporal resolution measurements of SGD. As a developing science application, the use of sUAS-TIR to image SGD requires substantial background knowledge. We present a proposed methodological construct for implementing a sUAS-TIR program for SGD-TIR data gathering, with applications extending to other research fields that can benefit from airborne TIR. Several studies have used airborne TIR in combination with empirical SGD flux measurements to quantify SGD, reporting a consistently strong regression between SGD flux and SGD TIR plume area. We additionally discuss novel research opportunities for sUAS-TIR technologies, as applied to SGD flux. The combination of high spatial and temporal resolution capabilities, at relatively low costs, make sUAS-TIR a promising new technology to overcome the scaling challenges presented by empirical studies and modeling of SGD fluxes, and advance our understanding of the controls on SGD fluxes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarea 3abody water 3aempirical models 3aempirical research 3aenvironmental surveys 3agroundwater 3aimage analysis 3ameasurement 3aremote sensing 3asurface water 3aunmanned aerial vehicles1 aPradhanang, Soni  M.0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Mar. 31, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130713313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010900165300001600274520148000290592002801770650001501798650002701813650002301840650002601863650001901889650001301908650001501921650001301936650001701949650001201966651001401978653001601992653002302008653001502031653002302046653001702069773011502086856008302201852000902284655001202293IND60564771620221119153731.0190415e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056477162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2017.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, Sudipto10aAnomalies in Australian municipal tree managers’ street-tree planting and species selection principles  ap. 125-133.  aThere is scant research on Australian municipal tree managers’ motivations for street tree planting and the rationales for street tree species selections. Tree managers from 129 city councils across Australia were surveyed to address this knowledge gap. This paper presents the findings from 115 (89%) usable survey responses. Tree managers reported four primary motives for street tree planting: visual and aesthetic (97%), environmental (92%), socio-cultural and community (87%), and health (70%). In contrast, tree species characteristics (97%), management and maintenance issues (92%), visual and aesthetic benefits (89%), site environmental factors (80%) and problems caused by different species (70%) were reported to govern street tree species selection. In spite being the primary motives for planting, considerations for socio-cultural and community benefits (61%) and environmental benefits/ecosystem services (61%) had minor influence on street tree species selection. In absence of established research, Australian city councils’ institutional culture is biased by personal opinions on potential threats to city’s vital infrastructure posed by street tree, resulting in the mismatch between planting and species selection principles. Future research correlating species characteristics to specific ecosystem services/disservices might help Australian city councils to adopt an ecosystem services based approach to street tree planting and species selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3aattitudes and opinions 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental factors 3ainfrastructure 3amanagers 3amotivation 3aplanting 3astreet trees 3asurveys 3aAustralia 0aDisservices 0aEcosystem services 0aRationales 0aTree professionals 0aUrban forest0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2017 May, v. 24 p.125-133dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2017.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014900162300001600311520105800327592002801385650001301413650001401426650001301440650002501453650002201478650002301500650001201523650001201535650001701547650002701564653001201591653000901603653001001612653001801622700001601640700001201656700001401668700002001682773012201702856008201824852000901906655001201915IND60605354720221120214944.0200523e20180915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060535472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2018.01.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, Chen10aIcariin modulates mitochondrial function and apoptosis in high glucose-induced glomerular podocytes through G protein-coupled estrogen receptors  ap. 146-155.  aPodocyte apoptosis in glomerular lesions has been found to have a dominant role in the progression of diabetic nephropathy. The present research aimed to explore the beneficial effect of icariin on diabetic podocytes by interfering in the process of apoptosis. Podocyte apoptosis was significantly exacerbated after high glucose treatment, with the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increasing simultaneously. Here, we demonstrated that icariin, which is a G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER) agonist, inhibited podocyte apoptosis by reducing ROS, maintaining the integrity of mitochondrial membranes. Moreover, the stabilization of mitochondria by icariin was reversed when GPER was knocked down in podocytes. Meanwhile, icariin inhibited the caspase cascade in podocyte apoptosis by promoting Bcl-2 expression and mitochondrial translocation. The above findings at least partly elucidated the mechanism by which icariin stabilized podocytes by inducing the mitochondrial Bcl-2 translocation and therefore preventing downstream apoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aapoptosis 3acaspases 3adiabetic nephropathy 3aenzyme inhibition 3aestrogen receptors 3aglucose 3aicariin 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 0aIcariin 0aGPER 0aBcl-2 0aTranslocation1 aYe, Wenjuan1 aLi, Sai1 aWang, Hui1 aDing, Xuansheng0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2018 Sept. 15, v. 473 p.146-155dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2018.01.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01309naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245011000155300001800265520029500283592002800578650001500606650002300621650002300644650002300667650001200690650001400702700001700716700002000733700002000753773012900773856007200902852000900974655001200983IND60657303720221116224209.0190816e20021119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065730372DNAL7 a10.1039/b207630f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeeg, Oliver10aCombinatorial parallel synthesis and automated screening of a novel class of liquid crystalline materials  ap. 2762-2763.  aCombinatorial parallel synthesis has led to the rapid generation of a single-compound library of novel fluorinated quaterphenyls.

We have conducted homologous cloning and isolated Vigna umbellata multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (VuMATE), a gene encoding a de novo citrate transporter from rice bean. Al treatment up‐regulated VuMATE expression in the root apex, but neither in the mature root region nor in the leaf. The degree of up‐regulation of VuMATE was both partially Al concentration and time dependent, consistent with the delay in the onset of the Al‐induced citrate efflux in rice bean roots. While La3+ moderately induced VuMATE expression, Cd2+ and Cu2+ did not induce the expression. Electrophysiological analysis of Xenopus oocytes expressing VuMATE indicated this transporter can mediate significant anion efflux across the plasma membrane. [14C]citrate efflux experiments in oocytes demonstrated that VuMATE is a H+‐dependent citrate transporter. In addition, expression of VuMATE in transgenic tomato resulted in increased Al resistance, which correlated with an enhanced citrate efflux. Taken together, these findings suggest that VuMATE is a functional homolog of the known citrate transporters in sorghum, barley, maize and Arabidopsis. The similarities and differences of all the known citrate transporters associated with Al stress in the MATE family are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aVigna umbellata 3aXenopus 3aanions 3abarley 3acitrates 3aclones 3acorn 3agene expression 3agenes 3aleaves 3aoocytes 3aplasma membrane 3aresistance mechanisms 3aroots 3atomatoes 3atoxicity 3atransporters 2aAluminumxpharmacology 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCarrier Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCitric Acidxmetabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aFabaceaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOocytes 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aUp-Regulation 2aXenopus1 aYang, Jianli,d1963-1 aZhou, Yuan,1 aPIÑEROS, MIGUEL A.1 aKOCHIAN, LEON V.1 aLI, GUI XIN1 aZHENG, SHAO JIAN0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2011 Dec., v. 34, no. 12 p.2138-2148dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2011.02410.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001900158245019000177300001600367520131700383592002801700650001501728650001001743650001601753650001101769650002101780650001501801650001501816650002701831650000901858650003701867650003601904650004501940650004501985650005902030650002602089650003102115650003302146650001302179650002202192650003902214650002702253650001902280650002002299650004802319651001002367700002102377700001702398700002002415700002802435773012802463856004002591852000902631655001202640IND50064228220221119052730.0130327e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006422822DNAL7 a227403712pmid7 a10.1002/jsfa.57562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUrrutia, Oscar10aTheoretical chemical characterization of phosphate‐metal–humic complexes and relationships with their effects on both phosphorus soil fixation and phosphorus availability for plants  ap. 293-303.  aBACKGROUND: Previous studies showed that phosphate can be complexed by humic acids (HA) through stable metal (M) bridges (PMHA). We studied the thermodynamic properties of PMHA and their relationships with the ability of PMHA to both decrease soil P fixation and increase P availability for plants. With this aim, we studied the theoretical stability of PFeHA, PAlHA and PCaHA by molecular modelling methods in relation to the degree and intensity of P absorption in soils and the ability of plants to take up complexed P. RESULTS: A density functional theory (DFT) quantum chemical study enabled us to obtain stable structures for the three PMHA complexes in water solution. The theoretical stabilities (ΔG⁰) were consistent with that for apparent stability obtained by Scatchard method, PFeHA ≥ PAlHA > PCaHA, though the differences were clearer by the DFT method. Also the reduction of soil P fixation and the release of P from PMHA in the presence of an anionic resin confirmed the stability order of the different PMHA. Plant studies confirmed the ability of diverse plant species to take up both P and metal complexed in PMHA. CONCLUSION: The results indicated the potential efficiency of PMHA‐based fertilizers to optimize P fertilization for crops cultivated in soils with high P fixation ability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acrops 3ahumic acids 3ametals 3amolecular models 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3asoil 2aAluminumxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCalciumxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aChelating Agentsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCicerxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aCrops, Agriculturalxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aFertilizersxanalysis 2aHumic Substancesxanalysis 2aIronxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aKinetics 2aModels, Molecular 2aPhosphatesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPhosphorusxmetabolism 2aQuantum Theory 2aSoilxchemistry 2aTriticumxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 0aSpain1 aGuardado, Iñaki1 aErro, Javier1 aMandado, Marcos1 aGarcía‐Mina, José M0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2013 Jan., v. 93, no. 2 p.293-303dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.5756  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245011600211300001800327506007600345520103100421592002801452506003701480650002501517650001001542650001301552650001901565650002601584650001501610650002401625650001201649650001301661650002601674650001601700700001901716700001701735700002401752700002601776773011401802856008101916852000901997655001202006IND60440693120221207051840.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044069312DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-014-1550-02doi7 aPMC45194602pmcid7 a262439272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinheiro, Joaquina10aUse of UV-C postharvest treatment for extending fresh whole tomato (Solanum lycopersicum, cv.

Disordered eating attitudes are common among women, and can lead to the development and maintenance of eating disorders (ED). Attitudes toward health and taste of food among ED patients and its comparison with non-clinical women are not well known, and this knowledge could improve eating interventions. In this study, we compared taste preferences and health concerns in 27 women with diagnosis of bulimia nervosa (BN) and 216 women of a non-clinical sample. All participants completed the Health and Taste Attitude Scale (HTAS). Using analysis of covariance we compared the HTAS scores of the BN patients with those of the college students. Risk behaviors for ED (assessed by the Eating Attitudes Test) were identified in 54 (25%) of the non-clinical sample, all of whom were therefore excluded in comparison of BN patients. Non-clinical sample, compared to patients, scored higher on the HTAS Taste domain (p < 0.001) and its pleasure subscale (p < 0.001), whereas patients scored higher on the HTAS Health domain (p < 0.05) and its light product interest subscale (p < 0.05). Based on our data, eating attitudes of women of non-clinical sample are related to taste and pleasure, whereas women with BN are concerned with adopting a diet regarded as healthy, thus increasing their interest in “light” products. Therefore, the taste and health concerns must be considered in nutrition interventions for women in general, and prevention and treatment of ED as determinants of food choice.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiet 3aattitudes and opinions 3abulimia nervosa 3anutritional intervention 3awomen 3aanalysis of covariance 3acollege students 3apatients 3afood choices 3arisk behavior 3aingestion 3ataste 0aHealth 0aTaste 0aFood choice 0aeating habits 0aPleasure 0aEating disorder 0aAttitude1 aPhilippi, Sônia Tucunduva,1 aAlvarenga, Marle dos Santos0 tAppetite.g2017 June 01, v. 113 p.172-177dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2017.02.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01041naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245005300159300001800212520020700230592002800437650002300465650001400488650001300502700001900515700001900534773012900553856007200682852000900754655001200763IND60657303920221116223817.0190816e20021119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065730392DNAL7 a10.1039/b207642j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcKeown, Neil B.10aPhthalocyanine-based nanoporous network polymers  ap. 2780-2781.  aNetwork polymers exhibiting large surfaces areas (450–950 m² g⁻¹) are prepared by the phthalocyanine-forming reaction of a bis(phthalonitrile) monomer containing a rigid spirocyclic linking group.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3ananopores 3apolymers1 aMakhseed, Saad1 aBudd, Peter M.0 tChemical communications.g2002 Nov. 19, , no. 23 p.2780-2781dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b207642j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245008500176300001300261520124200274592002801516650002201544650002101566650002101587650002301608650002101631650002601652650001601678650002301694653002701717653002701744653000801771653001801779653001701797700002401814700002201838700001801860773012501878856008502003852000902088655001202097IND60530894620221119122409.0160723e20160104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053089462DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b013272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThakur, Manju Kumari10aSynthesis and Applications of Biodegradable Soy Based Graft Copolymers: A Review  ap. 1-17.  aDifferent kinds of biorenewable materials are rapidly emerging as potential alternatives to conventional petroleum-based synthetic materials. Among these materials, soy protein and its derivatives are of utmost interest and importance due to their advantages such as low cost, biodegradability, environmental friendliness, biocompatibility, renewability, and wide availability to name few. However, the poor physicochemical/mechanical properties as well as high moisture sensitivity of different soy based materials limit their successful applications in many fields. Different methodologies to produce new soy based materials with suitable functional groups are highly desired to increase their range of applications. So, in this Review, we have focused on the recent advances in the various graft copolymerization strategies involving soy and its applications. The synthesis, characterization, and methodology of graft-copolymer processing and resulting properties of the copolymers are fully covered. In this Review, we have attempted to provide a review of different soy protein based functional materials that will facilitate the development of a new generation of multifunctional biobased materials from biorenewable soy resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiobased products 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3acomposite polymers 3acopolymerization 3amechanical properties 3asoy protein 3asynthetic products 0aBiorenewable materials 0aGraft copolymerization 0aSoy 0aBiocomposites 0aApplications1 aThakur, Vijay Kumar1 aGupta, Raju Kumar1 aPappu, Asokan0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2016 Jan. 04, v. 4, no. 1 p.1-17dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b013273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03795naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024004100138040001800179100002200197245010100219506007600320506003100396520176300427592002802190596001202218596001402230596002502244506003702269650002202306650001502328650001102343650001602354650002702370650002102397650002302418650002202441650001302463650001102476650001302487650001502500650001102515650001702526650001502543650002202558651001902580653002702599653003002626653002102656653002402677653002902701653003702730700003002767700002402797700002202821700002302843700001702866700001802883700002802901773011902929856008803048852000903136655001203145IND60792354720221207101144.0221004e20221215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079235472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1585442chorus7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1585442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeite, Pedro A.M.10aContrasting effects of native and exotic vegetation on soil infiltrability in the Sonoran Desert  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aInvasion by exotic grasses is transforming drylands across the planet, but the ecohydrological feedbacks of such invasions are not fully understood. For example, in the Sonoran Desert, previous studies have shown that buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris) alters the spatial patterns of soil moisture, leading researchers to hypothesize that such alterations are related to the plants' effects on soil infiltrability. To evaluate this hypothesis, we compared field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kfₛ) in a native shrubland with that in a neighboring savanna extensively dominated by exotic buffelgrass. We measured Kfₛ during the dormant and growing seasons in both canopy and intercanopy zones. We found that Kfₛ was generally lower during the dormant season than during the growing season. There were no significant differences between sites during the dormant season, and at both sites, Kfₛ was 6–7 times higher under shrubs than in the intercanopies. During the growing season, Kfₛ for the exotic intercanopy was comparable to that for shrub cluster edges (140 mm h⁻¹) and was more than twice that for the native intercanopy. Both shrubs and buffelgrass improved Kfₛ by reducing soil bulk density (thus increasing porosity). Additionally, surface roughness in the exotic intercanopy was nearly 3 times higher than in the native intercanopy. The combination of greater surface roughness and higher infiltration rates during the growing season most likely alters hydrological connectivity in savannas invaded by exotic grasses such as buffelgrass. By capturing portions of the runoff generated in the intercanopy, these grasses reduce runon into shrub patches, with potentially substantial impacts on native vegetation dynamics and stability.  aPublisher supplied data  cCONACYT  cUSDA NIFA  cUniversity of Sonora0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCenchrus ciliaris 3aarid lands 3acanopy 3aenvironment 3ahydraulic conductivity 3ahydrologic cycle 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 3aporosity 3arunoff 3asavannas 3ashrublands 3ashrubs 3asoil density 3asoil water 3asurface roughness 3aSonoran Desert 0aInvasive alien species 0aSoil hydraulic properties 0aSeasonal changes 0aSpatial variability 0aRainfall-runoff modeling 0aWater-related ecosystem services1 aCastellanos, Alejandro E.1 aWilcox, Bradford P.1 aVega-Puga, Masuly1 aMartinez, Enrique,1 aDennis, Sara1 aChoza, Sofía1 aAcuña-Acosta, Delia M.0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Dec. 15, v. 852 p.158544-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1585443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001600141245006600157300001800223500001400241520112800255592002801383650002101411650001901432650001801451650002401469650001001493650001101503650001201514650001301526650003001539650003001569650001901599653002301618653001201641653000801653700001601661700001901677700001901696773018501715856007501900852000901975655001201984IND60691806720221118003905.0200502e19990101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069180672DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.63.17032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDAHAI, Tang10aSite-Directed Mutagenesis of Restriction Endonuclease HindIII  ap. 1703-1707.  aNAL-light  aSite-directed mutagenesis by inverse PCR was done on the HindIII gene. Target residues to be mutated were chosen according to (i) the fact that a mutant obtained by sodium nitrite treatment showed almost no HindIII activity, where Asp-123 was replaced with Asn, and (ii) the model proposed by Stahl et al. (Stahl, F., Wende, W., Jeltsch, A. and Pingoud, A. Biol. Chem. 379, 467-473 (1998)). Sevenkinds of mutants were obtained by the PCR, and their enzymatic and biochemical properties were examined. Threemutants, P50S, D108L, and D123N, showed fairly low HindIII activity. On the other hand, the other four, P84Q, E86K, V106E, and K125N, retained the activity. In particular, E86K showed higher activity than the wild enzyme. This fact was confirmed when activities of the purified wild and E86K enzymes were assayed. These results coincided fairly well with data using E. coli strains that carry the respective mutant plasmids, on their resistance to phage T7 and on growth rate. We conclude that the PE motif at residues 50 and 51, and DXK motif at residues 108-110, are responsible for the enzymic reaction of HindIII.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteriophages 3abiotechnology 3aenzymatic reactions 3agenes 3amodels 3amutants 3aplasmids 3arestriction endonucleases 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3asodium nitrite 0arestriction enzyme 0aHindIII 0aPCR1 aANDO, Shoji1 aTAKASAKI, Yozo1 aTADANO, Jutaro0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g1999 Jan. 1, v. 63, no. 10 p.1703-1707dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.63.17033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245012600164500001900290520171600309592002802025650001102053650002202064650001102086650001202097650001502109650001802124650001602142650002102158650001602179650002302195650002102218650003702239651001202276700001802288700001902306700002202325700002102347773011902368856007302487852000902560655001202569IND60738764120221117213127.0210524e20210513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073876412DNAL7 a10.3390/f120506112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFakhech, Abdessamad 10aImpact of Mycorrhization on Phosphorus Utilization Efficiency of Acacia gummifera and Retama monosperma under Salt Stress  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe impact of salt stress on the growth and phosphorus utilization efficiency (PUE) of two leguminous species: Retama monosperma and Acacia gummifera was studied. The effectiveness of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to mitigate salt stress was furthermore assessed. Growth, N and P tissue concentrations, mycorrhizal root colonization frequency and intensity, and P utilization efficiency (PUE) in the absence or presence of AMF were evaluated under no salt (0 mM L⁻¹) and three salt (NaCl) concentrations of (25, 50 and 100 mM L⁻¹) using a natural sterilized soil. A significant difference in mycorrhizal colonization intensity, root-to-shoot ratio, P uptake, PUE, and N uptake was observed between the legume species. Salt stress inhibited the shoot and root growth, and reduced P and N uptake by the legume species. Mycorrhizal inoculation aided to mitigate the effects of salt stress with an average increase of shoot and root growth responses by 35% and 32% in the inoculated than in the non-inoculated A. gummifera treatments. The average shoot and root growth responses were 37% and 45% higher in the inoculated compared to the non-inoculated treatments of R. monosperma. Average mycorrhizal shoot and root P uptake responses were 66% and 68% under A. gummifera, and 40% and 95% under R. monosperma, respectively. Mycorrhizal inoculated treatments consistently maintained lower PUE in the roots. The results provide insights for further investigations on the AMF conferred mechanisms to salt stress tolerance response by A. gummifera and R. monosperma, to enable the development of effective technologies for sustainable afforestation and reforestation programs in the Atlantic coast of Morocco.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia 3aRetama monosperma 3acoasts 3alegumes 3aphosphorus 3areforestation 3aroot growth 3aroot shoot ratio 3asalt stress 3asoil sterilization 3astress tolerance 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aMorocco1 aJemo, Martin 1 aManaut, Najat 1 aOuahmane, Lahcen 1 aHafidi, Mohamed 0 tForests.g2021 May 13, v. 12, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f120506113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245020100165300001600366520151900382592002801901653001201929653001001941653003101951653002401982653001802006700002102024700002202045700002602067773009402093856008002187852000902267655001202276IND60130672120221120220819.0151127e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013067212DNAL7 a10.1525/auk.2009.081422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeele, Ashley M.10aDark Color of the Coastal Plain Swamp Sparrow (Melospiza Georgiana Nigrescens) may be an Evolutionary Response to Occurrence and Abundance of Salt-Tolerant Feather-Degrading Bacilli in Its Plumage  ap. 531-535.  aThe Southern Swamp Sparrow (Melospiza georgiana georgiana) breeds in northeastern North America in montane, freshwater marshes and fens. Its close relative, the Coastal Plain Swamp Sparrow (M. g. nigrescens), breeds in northeastern North America, but in coastal salt marshes. Coastal Plain Swamp Sparrows are darker than Southern Swamp Sparrows. Darkly colored feathers are more resistant to bacterial degradation by bacilli, which are unusually salt-tolerant. We tested whether the difference in feather color of the pale montane Southern Swamp Sparrow and the dark Coastal Plain Swamp Sparrow could be an adaptive response to differences in the occurrence and activity of bacilli in habitats that differ in salinity. Southern Swamp Sparrows were caught and sampled in cranberry fens in western Maryland, whereas Coastal Plain Swamp Sparrows were sampled in salt marshes on the western shore of the Delaware River, just where it broadens into Delaware Bay. The number of birds with feather-degrading bacteria in their plumage was significantly greater among Swamp Sparrows in salt marshes than among those in freshwater fens. The number of colonies of feather-degrading bacilli per bird was also higher for salt-marsh Swamp Sparrows than for those from freshwater fens. We conclude that the dark plumage of Coastal Plain Swamp Sparrows evolved to resist feather-degradation by salt-tolerant bacilli that occur more frequently and abundantly in their plumage than in the pale plumage of the Southern Swamp Sparrow.  aPublisher supplied data 0abacilli 0acolor 0afeather-degrading bacteria 0aMelospiza georgiana 0aSwamp Sparrow1 aBurtt, Edward H.1 aSchroeder, Max R.1 aGreenberg, Russell S.0 tAuk.g2009 July, v. 126, no. 3 p.531-535dUniversity of California Pressx1938-42547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1525%2Fauk.2009.081423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245012300168520141500291592002801706650001501734650001201749650001101761650001201772650001601784650002601800650001801826650001901844650001301863650001001876650002101886650001501907650002301922653003301945653002101978653001901999653002402018653001902042653002402061700001402085700001502099700001502114700001802129700001602147700001302163700001702176773011902193856008802312852000902400655001202409IND60792354920221117225008.0220914e20221215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079235492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1585462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Yang10aNitrogen budgets of a lower subtropical forest as affected by 6 years of over-canopy and understory nitrogen additions  aAlthough tropical and subtropical regions have replaced temperate regions as the global-change hotspots for increased atmosphere nitrogen (N) deposition, whether the regional forests reach N saturation is still unclear. Understory or floor N addition has been commonly used in N-deposition studies, but the results of such studies have recently been challenged because they fail to account for canopy interception, assimilation, and leaching processes. Here, we conducted a field experiment to quantify the effects of over-canopy and understory N addition on N budgets in a lower subtropical monsoon evergreen broadleaved (LSMEB) forest. We found that the LSMEB forest was not N saturated after receiving additional N at 25 and 50 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ for 6 years. Plants were able to absorb the added N by increasing the N concentrations in their organs, with 120–412 % increasing trend of plant N pools under N-addition treatments. Canopy absorption of N resulting from over-canopy N addition led to increases in N concentrations in tree organs but not to increases in tree biomass. Understory N addition could underestimate the effects of N deposition in forests due to neglecting canopy N interception and canopy effects on N redistribution. Additional experiments using over-canopy N addition are needed to assess the true effects of N deposition on different forest ecosystems in different climate zones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abiomass 3acanopy 3aclimate 3aenvironment 3afield experimentation 3aglobal change 3amonsoon season 3anitrogen 3atrees 3atropical forests 3aunderstory 3awater interception 0aEvergreen broadleaved forest 0aForest hydrology 0aNitrogen cycle 0aNitrogen deposition 0aNitrogen pools 0aNitrogen saturation1 aWang, Jun1 aZhou, Lang1 aTao, Libin1 aLin, Yongbiao1 aHui, Dafeng1 aRen, Hai1 aLu, Hongfang0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Dec. 15, v. 852 p.158546-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1585463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02807naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245010100165506011700266506007600383520135400459592002801813506003701841650001501878650001401893650001201907650002801919650001901947650001201966650001701978650002401995651001002019653002602029653001902055653002202074653002702096653004102123700001602164773011202180856008402292852000902376655001202385IND60792156520221207080923.0220921e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079215652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e022782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jiaping10aEffects of nature contact on children's willingness to conserve animals under rapid urbanization  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWildlife conservation requires public support. Growing evidence has suggested that childhood nature experience plays an essential role in forming one's environmental commitment. Yet, the link between nature contact and children's willingness to conserve wild animals has been examined little, especially for children from developing countries. Here, we conducted a questionnaire survey of school children from 4th to 5th grade and investigated their knowledge, likeability of species, and willingness to conserve wild animals, as well as the associations between nature contact (direct and indirect forms) and these outcomes. A total of 842 students at six primary schools in Nanning, Southern China, participated in the survey. Results showed that children's willingness to conserve wild animals was positively associated with both direct (time spent outdoors) and indirect (watching natural programs or reading natural books) nature contact frequency, their knowledge of species, and their likeability of species. Moreover, children's knowledge and likeability of species were also positively associated with nature contact frequency (direct and indirect forms). Therefore, wildlife conservation would benefit from environmental education and child care policies that enable children to spend time outdoors and learn about nature in multiple ways.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achild care 3achildhood 3aecology 3aenvironmental education 3aquestionnaires 3asurveys 3aurbanization 3awildlife management 3aChina 0aWildlife conservation 0aNature contact 0aSpecies knowledge 0aLikeability of species 0aWillingness to conserve wild animals1 aJiang, Aiwu0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2022 Oct., v. 38 p.e02278-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e022783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245014400166500001900310520144800329592002801777650003101805650002701836650002601863650003301889650002601922650002001948650001001968650001501978650001101993650001402004700002102018700002602039700002202065700002002087700002602107773011902133856007702252852000902329655001202338IND60738764220221117212801.0210524e20210421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073876422DNAL7 a10.3390/genes120506102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenetrey, Quentin 10aAchromobacter xylosoxidans and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia: Emerging Pathogens Well-Armed for Life in the Cystic Fibrosis Patients’ Lung  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), the lung is a remarkable ecological niche in which the microbiome is subjected to important selective pressures. An inexorable colonization by bacteria of both endogenous and environmental origin is observed in most patients, leading to a vicious cycle of infection–inflammation. In this context, long-term colonization together with competitive interactions among bacteria can lead to over-inflammation. While Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, the two pathogens most frequently identified in CF, have been largely studied for adaptation to the CF lung, in the last few years, there has been a growing interest in emerging pathogens of environmental origin, namely Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The aim of this review is to gather all the current knowledge on the major pathophysiological traits, their supporting mechanisms, regulation and evolutionary modifications involved in colonization, virulence, and competitive interactions with other members of the lung microbiota for these emerging pathogens, with all these mechanisms being major drivers of persistence in the CF lung. Currently available research on A. xylosoxidans complex and S. maltophilia shows that these emerging pathogens share important pathophysiological features with well-known CF pathogens, making them important members of the complex bacterial community living in the CF lung.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchromobacter xylosoxidans 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStenotrophomonas maltophilia 3abacterial communities 3acystic fibrosis 3alungs 3amicrobiome 3aniches 3avirulence1 aSorlin, Pauline 1 aJumas-Bilak, Estelle 1 aChiron, Raphaël 1 aDupont, Chloé 1 aMarchandin, Hélène 0 tGenes.g2021 Apr. 21, v. 12, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes120506103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03568naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015000169520206400319592002802383650000802411650001502419650002202434650002102456650001802477650001002495650001002505650001802515650001202533650001202545650002402557650001102581650001602592650001102608653002102619653002302640653003102663653002302694653001602717653002002733700001902753700006002772700002502832700002202857773010002879856008602979852000903065655001203074IND60645561320221121234837.0190606e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064556132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.firesaf.2019.1028242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMense, Maxime10aExperimental and numerical study on low-frequency oscillating behaviour of liquid pool fires in a small-scale mechanically-ventilated compartment  aThe unstable oscillatory behaviour, with frequency in the order of few mHz, that has been occasionally observed in mechanically-ventilated compartment fires, is studied experimentally and numerically. First, a series of experiments using a small-scale compartment have been conducted using heptane and dodecane as fuels. Results show that unstable and stable combustion regimes can occur depending on fuel type, pool size, air renewal rate of the compartment (ARR), and ventilation conditions. For a certain range of these factors, unstable low-frequency (LF) oscillatory combustion, accompanied by thermodynamic pressure and ventilation flow rate variations and displacement of the flame outside the pan, is observed. The occurrence and persistency of LF oscillations result from the competition between oxygen supply and fuel vapor supply due to the heat feedback from the flame and enclosure to the fuel tray. Whatever the fuel type, it is found that i) the range of ARR where LF oscillations appear and the oscillation amplitude increase with the pool size, and ii) the frequency increases, while amplitude decreases, with increasing ARR, independently of the pool size. It is also found that the more flammable the fuel, i) the smaller pool size for which LF oscillations appear and the higher the frequency for the same ventilation conditions, and ii) the wider the range of ARR where LF oscillations appear for a given pool size. The effects of air inlet position and blowing direction on the oscillations properties is also investigated. Second, predictive CFD simulations have been performed using the in-house SAFIR software. Although SAFIR does not correctly describe the displacement of the flame outside the fuel pan, it satisfactorily reproduces the LF oscillatory fire behaviour, especially its dominant frequency. Information about inaccessible or difficult-to-measure local quantities, such as the local evaporation rate, temperature and heat flux at the liquid surface, and species concentrations, are provided from the numerical simulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acombustion 3acomputer software 3aevaporation rate 3afire behavior 3afires 3afuels 3aheat transfer 3aheptane 3aliquids 3amathematical models 3aoxygen 3atemperature 3avapors 0aCompartment fire 0aForced ventilation 0aLow-frequency oscillations 0aCombustion regimes 0aExperiments 0aCFD simulations1 aPizzo, Yannick1 aPrétrel, Hugues1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3044-56951 aLallemand, Christine1 aPorterie, Bernard0 tFire safety journal.g2019 Sept., v. 108 p.102824-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3526x0379-71127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.firesaf.2019.1028243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02214naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009100156300002200247520087500269592002801144650002201172650001401194650001301208650001601221650002101237650001901258650001901277650003301296650001101329650001701340650002101357650003701378700001401415700001301429700001801442700001501460700002001475700001701495700001701512700001701529773012701546856007401673852000901747655001201756IND60641389620221121132249.0190505e20161123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064138962DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra24156e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQian, Xinye10aCeO₂ nanodots decorated ketjen black for high performance lithium–sulfur batteries  ap. 111190-111196.  aA CeO₂ nanodots decorated ketjen black composite was fabricated by a simple wet impregnation method and used as the host of sulfur for a lithium–sulfur battery.

To date, supramolecular driving forces in different solvents remain unclear. In this study, we first synthesized an amphiphilic β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) dimer that consists of one hydrophobic ibuprofen (Ibu) and two hydrophilic β-CD moieties (i.e., Ibu-CD₂). Ibu-CD₂ possesses double supramolecular driving forces, namely, the host–guest recognition and hydrophilic–hydrophobic interaction. The host–guest interaction of Ibu-CD₂ induced the formation of branched supramolecular polymers (SPs) in pure water, whereas the hydrophilic–hydrophobic interaction generated spherical or irregular micelles in water/organic mixtures. The SP size increased with the increase in Ibu-CD₂ concentration in pure water. By contrast, the size of micelles decreased with the increase in volume ratio of water in mixtures.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aibuprofen 3amicelles 3aphysical chemistry 3apolymers 3asolvents1 aFan, Xiao-dong1 aYao, Hao1 aYang, Zhen1 aLiu, Ting-ting1 aZhang, Hai-tao1 aZhang, Wan-bin1 aTian, Wei0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2015 Sept. 03, v. 119, no. 35 p.11893-11899dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.5b053173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02623naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013900172300001600311520128100327592002801608650002201636650001401658650001501672650002001687650004301707650002401750650000901774650002701783650002501810650001801835653002201853653001501875653002601890653002801916700002101944700001601965773013801981856008502119852000902204655001202213IND60565960620221120044437.0170329e20170219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056596062DNAL7 a10.1080/03067319.2017.13045472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsghar, Muhammad10aFlow injection determination of cyromazine in natural water samples using diperiodatoargentate(III)–H2SO4–chemiluminescence system  ap. 276-288.  aA simple and sensitive chemiluminescence (CL) procedure is proposed for the determination of cyromazine (CYR) using flow injection technique. CYR has strong enhancing effect on the CL reaction of diperiodatoargentate-(III) complex (DPA) in H ₂SO ₄ medium. The CL intensity with solid phase extraction (SPE) technique and with and without using online ion exchange resin column (IERC; OH-form) was proportional to the concentration of CYR over the range 0.1–200, 10–1000 and 2–2500 µg L –¹ (R ² = 0.9974, 0.9980 and 0.9990, n = 7 each), respectively. Under the conditions, the limits of detection (S/N = 3) 0.029, 2.5 and 0.5 µg L –¹, relative standard deviations (n = 3) 1.9–3.6%, 1.4–2.7% and 1.0–3.0% and sample throughputs were 120, 80 and 120 h –¹. The effect of reagents concentration, flow rate, sample loop volume, photomultiplier voltage and IERC length was optimised. The mean results for natural water samples analysed by the proposed method were not significantly different at 95% confidence limit with the previously reported HPLC method. Interference from chloride ions could be eliminated by using SPE procedure or incorporating an in-line IERC. The CL mechanism of DPA–H ₂SO ₄–CYR system was also discussed briefly.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemiluminescence 3achlorides 3acyromazine 3adetection limit 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aion exchange resins 3aions 3asolid phase extraction 3astatistical analysis 3asulfuric acid 0aChemiluminescence 0acyromazine 0anatural water samples 0aflow injection analysis1 aYaqoob, Mohammad1 aNabi, Abdul0 tInternational journal of environmental analytical chemistry.g2017 Feb. 19, v. 97, no. 3 p.276-288dTaylor & Francisx1029-03977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2017.13045473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03159naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245017000168520159000338592002801928650001501956650001201971650001401983650003001997650003302027650001702060650001302077650002102090650002202111650001402133650001902147650001502166650002602181650002802207650002402235650002102259653001602280653002002296653000902316653001302325653001502338653001602353700001402369700001702383700001702400700001602417773011302433856008602546852000902632655001202641IND60673092520221120235229.0200503e20200120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067309252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1188632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Zhifeng10aHumidity impact on photo-catalytic degradation: Adsorption behavior simulations and catalytic reaction mechanisms for main gaseous pollutants in papermaking industry  aTo adopt cleaner production technology of photo-catalysis in papermaking industry and improve environmental sustainability, it is essential to understand the impact of ambient humidity on photo-catalytic degradations of gaseous pollutants. This study used TiO₂ colloid as catalyst to study the effects of ambient humidity (30–60%) on the photo-catalytic degradations of formaldehyde (HCHO), benzene (C₆H₆), and hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) generated by papermaking industry. Via adsorption behavior simulations, using density functional theory (DFT) and catalytic reaction mechanisms, the effects of humidity were further investigated. The following results were found: (1) With increasing humidity, the degradation of HCHO was inhibited, because the ambient H₂O content exceeded the demand for hydroxyl radicals produced by H₂O, which led to competitive adsorption. (2) For C₆H₆, an optimum humidity of 40% was identified during the degradation process, which could be attributed to the improved catalytic reaction and the subsequent excessive H₂O content. (3) For H₂S, unlike the negative action for HCHO and the first positive and then negative actions for C₆H₆, with increasing humidity, the H₂S degradation was promoted. This indicated that the large demand for hydroxyl radicals produced by H₂O promoted the H₂S catalytic reaction. Combining experimental, simulation, and theoretical results for these different gaseous pollutants provides sufficient information to understand the impact of humidity on the photo-catalytic oxidation degradation process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abenzene 3acatalysts 3adensity functional theory 3aenvironmental sustainability 3aformaldehyde 3ahumidity 3ahydrogen sulfide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3apollutants 3aproduction technology 3apulp and paper industry 3areaction mechanisms 3atitanium dioxide 0aPapermaking 0aPhoto-catalysis 0aTiO2 0aHumidity 0aAdsorption 0aDegradation1 aTong, Xin1 aShen, Wenhao1 aRoux, J.

Under a hydraulic retention time of 1.5 d, the average effluent COD concentration of 72 mg/L achieved corresponding 90% of COD removal. The permeate flux was varied between 1.7 and 2.9 L/m²/h during operation which decreased with increased biomass concentration inside AFMBR. The trans-membrane pressure (TMP) was generally around 35–40 kPa, however, it increased up to 60 kPa when volatile suspended solid increased to above 2.5 g/L. Both flux and TMP data reveal the importance of biomass control for AFMBR operation. Results from terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) show the genus Methanosaeta was dominant on GAC and it shared dominance with the genera Methanomethylovorans and Methanosarcina in suspended sludge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethanosaeta 3aMethanosarcina 3abiomass 3achemical oxygen demand 3aemulsions 3aindustry 3amembrane bioreactors 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asludge 3asteel 3atotal suspended solids 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aSingle-stage AFMBR 0aCold-rolling wastewater 0aMethanogenesis 0aT-RFLP1 aWhang, Liang-Ming1 aYi, Tse-Fu1 aLiu, Cheng-Pin1 aLin, Tsair-Fuh1 aYeh, Mao-Song0 tBioresource technology.g2018 Sept., v. 263 p.418-424dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2018.04.1243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01197naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245007300156300001800229520024500247592002800492650001300520650001600533650001700549650001300566650001700579650001500596650001400611700001900625700001700644773012900661856007200790852000900862655001200871IND60657304320221116224053.0190816e20021011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065730432DNAL7 a10.1039/b207657h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBin Sun, Xiao10aOne-pot synthesis of hydrogen phosphonate derivatives of d4T and AZT  ap. 2414-2415.  aA simple and one-pot route for the synthesis of d4T or AZT hydrogen phosphonate derivatives via reaction of d4T or AZT with phosphorus trichloride, then alcoholysis and dealkylation in the presence of the corresponding alcohol is described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aalcoholysis 3adealkylation 3ahydrogen 3aphosphonates 3aphosphorus 3asynthesis1 aXun Kang, Jian1 aFen Zhao, Yu0 tChemical communications.g2002 Oct. 11, , no. 20 p.2414-2415dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b207657h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245012100166506011700287506007600404520163300480592002802113506003702141650001202178650001102190650001202201650001102213650001102224650001402235650001702249650002802266650001202294650002302306650001002329651001402339653001302353653001702366653002102383653001802404653001902422700002002441700002702461700001902488773011202507856008402619852000902703655001202712IND60792156720221207094907.0220914e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079215672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e022802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkarda, Beni10aCategorizing the songbird market through big data and machine learning in the context of Indonesia’s online market  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe songbird trade has been identified as a major threat to wild populations, and the bird market has now expanded to online platforms. The study explored the use of machine learning models as a monitoring framework; developed models for taxa identification; applied the best model to understand the current market situation (taxa composition, asking price, and location); and conducted a survey to understand the profile of sellers. The authors found that the machine learning models produced a high level of accuracy in distinguishing relevant ads and identified the songbirds’ taxa. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) was selected as the best model and was used to predict the ad population. The model identified 284,118 songbirds from 247 taxa that were listed online from April 2020 to September 2021. The authors also found that 6.2% of ads listed threatened taxa based on the IUCN Red List. The survey results suggested that songbird sellers are mostly hobbyists or breeders looking for extra income from selling birds. As current studies of the songbird market are mostly conducted offline in the bird markets, transactions by non-bird traders or among hobbyists in the online market are remain underreported. Therefore, monitoring needs to be extended to the online market and to our knowledge, currently there is no applied system or platform is identified for monitoring online songbird market. The result from this study can help fill this gap. Information from the monitoring of the songbird online market in this study may assist stakeholders in formulating corrective action based on the current market situation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aecology 3aincome 3amarkets 3amodels 3aprices 3asongbirds 3astakeholders 3asupport vector machines 3asurveys 3athreatened species 3atrade 3aIndonesia 0aSongbird 0aCategorizing 0aMachine learning 0aOnline market 0aWildlife trade1 aMuchlish, Usman1 aKusumadewi, Sonya Dyah1 aPurnomo, Herry0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2022 Nov., v. 39 p.e02280-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e022803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245012800167300001600295520168000311592002801991653002402019653003002043653002302073653001602096653002102112653001602133700002102149700003002170700003002200773009402230856008002324852000902404655001202413IND60130672520221120220818.0151127e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013067252DNAL7 a10.1525/auk.2009.081792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButler, Michael W.10aAmbient Temperature, but Not Paternity, is Associated with Immune Response in Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis)  ap. 536-542.  aFemales may engage in extrapair copulations to receive indirect benefits in the form of more immunocompetent young. Nestling quality is often assessed by examining immune function using the phytohemagglutinin (PHA) skin test, which can be a predictor of nestling recruitment. However, the PHA test can also be influenced by factors such as nest temperature. We tested the prediction that extrapair young mount greater immune responses to a PHA challenge and recruit at a greater rate than within-pair young in a wild population of Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis). We also investigated ambient temperature and its relationship with immune response. Extra-and within-pair young did not significantly differ with respect to PHA-induced immune response or with respect to recruitment. In contrast to other studies, we found that PHA-induced immune response was not associated with nestling recruitment rates. However, it was positively correlated with minimum ambient temperature for males hatched in 2002 and 2003, and for females in 2003 (with a similar, but marginally nonsignificant, trend in 2002). Immune response to PHA also was positively correlated with nestling mass for males hatched in 2002 and for females hatched in 2002 and 2003. We concluded that given the lack of relationship among immune responses, paternity, and recruitment rates in this population of Savannah Sparrows, nestling immune response to PHA injection should not be considered predictive of recruitment in populations where this relationship has not been explicitly explored, and environmental variables such as nest temperature may be an important covariate in immunoresponsiveness.  aPublisher supplied data 0aextrapair paternity 0aPasserculus sandwichensis 0aphytohemagglutinin 0arecruitment 0aSavannah Sparrow 0atemperature1 aGarvin, Julia C.1 aWheelwright, Nathaniel T.1 aFreeman-Gallant, Corey R.0 tAuk.g2009 July, v. 126, no. 3 p.536-542dUniversity of California Pressx1938-42547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1525%2Fauk.2009.081793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003700113040001800150100001800168245014100186300001600327500000900343520123700352592002801589650002801617650002701645650001601672650002601688650002301714650002401737650002601761650001901787650002001806650002601826650002301852650002201875650001001897650001601907650001601923650002201939650001701961650002001978700002201998700001902020700002302039773012102062852000902183856011202192856008402304961001302388655001202401IND4448382720221118032155.0191228e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444838272DNAL7 a10113/487212hdl7 a10.2135/cropsci2009.12.07112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsilo, Toi J.10aGenetic Mapping and QTL Analysis of Flour Color and Milling Yield Related Traits Using Recombinant Inbred Lines in Hard Red Spring Wheat  ap. 237-246.  aepub  aWheat (Triticum aestivum L.) flour ash content and color are very important properties of flour quality, because they greatly affect the quality of the final product. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) influencing flour color and milling properties of hard red spring wheat were mapped on a genetic linkage map comprised of 531 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) marker loci. Composite interval mapping with 139 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was used to identify QTL within and across three field environments. Twenty-eight QTL influenced flour color and milling properties and were mapped on 11 wheat chromosomes. Quantitative trait loci clusters were identified on six chromosomes: 1A, 1B, 5A, 5B, 5D, and 7B. The marker Xbarc130 that is near the hardness locus on chromosome 5D was linked to five QTL influencing multiple traits. These six QTL clusters explained a substantial variation in flour color and milling properties, including those traits that were correlated. These results aid our understanding of the genetic basis of these traits. The marker loci linked to these QTL may be useful in increasing the frequency of desirable alleles during the early generations of breeding populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative trait loci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3awheat flour 3amicroarray technology 3alinkage (genetics) 3agenetic correlation 3ahard red spring wheat 3abaking quality 3amilling quality 3afield experimentation 3achromosome mapping 3aTriticum aestivum 3acolor 3agrain yield 3aash content 3agenetic variation 3ainbred lines 3agenetic markers1 aHareland, Gary A.1 aChao, Shiaoman1 aAnderson, James A.0 tCrop science.g2011 Jan., v. 51, no. 1 p.237-246dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/487213Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2009.12.07113Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02683naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245011900208300001800327506007600345520144500421592002801866506003701894650001701931650001501948650001101963650001201974650003301986650000902019650001502028650001602043650001802059700001602077773011402093856008102207852000902288655001202297IND60440693720221207071016.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044069372DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-014-1541-12doi7 aPMC45194862pmcid7 a262439282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGanorkar, P.

Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to develop flaxseed fortified rice – corn flour blend based extruded product using twin screw extruder. The effect of roasted flaxseed flour (RFF) fortification (15–25 %), moisture content of feed (12–16 %, wb), extruder barrel temperature (120–140 °C) and screw speed (300–330 RPM) on expansion ratio (ER), breaking strength (BS), bulk density (BD) and overall acceptability (OAA) score of extrudates were investigated using central composite rotatable design (CCRD). Increased RFF level decreased the ER and OAA score significantly while increased BS and BD of extrudates (p < 0.01). Moisture content of extruder feed was positively related to ER (p < 0.01) and OAA (p < 0.05) and negatively related to BD (p < 0.01). Extruder barrel temperature was found to be negatively related to ER and OAA (p < 0.05) and positively related to BD (p < 0.1). Quadratic effect of screw speed was significantly positively related to ER (p < 0.01), BS (p < 0.05) and negatively related to BD (p < 0.01). 15 % RFF fortification with rice flour, 16 % moisture content (wb) of extruder feed, 120 °C extruder barrel temperature and 330 RPM of screw speed gave an optimized product of high desirability with corresponding responses as 3.08 ER, 0.53 kgf BS, 0.106 g.cm⁻³ BD and 7.86 OAA.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abulk density 3acorn flour 3ahumans 3alinseed 3aresponse surface methodology 3arice 3arice flour 3atemperature 3awater content1 aJain, R.

M.14aThe role of directional LAI in determining the fAPAR–NDVI relationship when using active optical sensors in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) pasture  ap. 3219-3235.  aRemote sensing based spectral indices, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), are often used to estimate the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) in plant canopies. Owing to similar changes in both the NDVI and fAPAR as functions of varying solar illumination angle when using entirely passive sensors, the fAPAR–NDVI relationships are often stable, appearing insensitive to solar illumination angle. Active optical sensors (AOS) on the other hand, which have their own illuminating light source and are increasingly being used to measure NDVI (NDVI AOS), do not respond to solar illumination geometry. Yet, the passive sensor-derived fAPAR component of the fAPAR–NDVI AOS relationship remains affected by solar illumination angle. In this paper, a simple two-stream canopy model has been used to predict the fAPAR–NDVI AOS relationships of a pasture canopy (tall fescue; Festuca arundinacea) for a nadir-viewing active optical NDVI sensor under conditions of varying solar elevation angle. Both the model derived and subsequent experimental measurements of the fAPAR–NDVI AOS relationship in this pasture confirmed a strong dependence of the linear fAPAR–NDVI AOS relationships on solar illumination angle. The modelled fAPAR–NDVI AOS relationship only agreed with the field measurements when the ‘solar angle–dependent directional leaf area index’ (LAI θₛ) of the canopy, as presented to the incoming solar photons, was used as opposed to the traditionally used ‘nadir version’ of the leaf area index (LAI). Users of AOS to measure indices such as NDVI must account for the solar illumination angle dependent LAI θₛ when considering any fAPAR–NDVI AOS relationship.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFestuca arundinacea 3acanopy 3ageometry 3aleaf area index 3alighting 3amodels 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apastures 3aphotons 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aremote sensing 3asensors (equipment)1 aLamb, D.

We used mitochondrial DNA data to reconstruct the phylogeny of a group of lowland tanagers (Thraupidae) that contains species distributed in both Central America and South America. Phylogenetic analyses identified a clade that includes all 26 species in the genera Tachyphonus, Ramphocelus, Eucometis, Lanio, Trichothraupis, Coryphospingus, and Rhodospingus. Three of these species (Rhodospingus cruentus, Coryphospingus cucullatus, and C. pileatus) have traditionally been classified with the finches (Emberizidae); here, we show that they are tanagers. The genus Tachyphonus is polyphyletic, with some species more closely related to species in the genus Ramphocelus than they are to other Tachyphonus. The ancestor of the entire clade was distributed in South America or was widespread there and in Central America. Reconstructing the biogeographic history of this group showed a dispersal bias from South America to Central America. Nine dispersal events were inferred, and eight of these involve dispersals from South America to Central America. Temporally, most dispersal events coincide with or postdate the final formation of the Panamanian isthmus. We also used our phylogeny to investigate plumage evolution. Two species are sexually monochromatic, and this condition was derived from sexual dichromatism through the evolution of more colorful female plumage. Although 11 species in the clade have crests, this feature evolved no more than twice within the group.  aPublisher supplied data 0abiogeography 0adispersal 0aPanamanian isthmus 0aplumage evolution 0aRamphocelus 0aTachyphonus 0avicariance1 aRacicot, Rachel A.0 tAuk.g2009 July, v. 126, no. 3 p.635-648dUniversity of California Pressx1938-42547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1525%2Fauk.2009.081953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001300188245015400201300001800355506007600373520103100449592002801480506003701508650002201545650002801567650001501595650002301610650002101633650003401654650004601688650001201734650002401746650001801770650003301788650001301821650002201834700001701856700001601873700001401889773011401903856008102017852000902098655001202107IND60440693920221207051829.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044069392DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-014-1571-82doi7 aPMC45194872pmcid7 a262439122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShao, P.10aMicrowave-assisted extraction and purification of chlorogenic acid from by-products of Eucommia Ulmoides Oliver and its potential anti-tumor activity  ap. 4925-4934.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAn efficient method for the rapid extraction, separation and purification of chlorogenic acid (CGA) from by-products of Eucommia Ulmoides Oliver (E. ulmoides) by microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) coupled with high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) was developed.

Herein, SMF waste was encapsulated into alginate, lyophilized to form cryogenic SMF beads (cSMFB). The cSMFB was characterized and its adsorptive potential was tested in the removal of methylene blue (MB), methylene green (MG), crystal violet (CV) and celestine blue (CB) from aqueous environment. The cSMFB having respective Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda (BJH) pore diameter of 59.88 m²/g and 18.58 Å was developed. Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR) analysis revealed bands at 1630 and 1412 cm⁻¹, attributed to asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of carboxylate ions, characteristic of alginate (used to encapsulate SMF). Also, the bands at 1092 and 1031 cm⁻¹ corresponding to carbohydrate rings of alginate were present. A band ascribed to metal oxides was appeared at 467 cm⁻¹. The encapsulation of SMF waste in alginate was further confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (with peaks at binding energies 34, 284.7, and 532 eV ascribed to Na 2p, C1s, and O 1s), X-ray diffraction (XRD) (with 2θ peaks at 13.5 and 22.2° for sodium alginate), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses. The cross-sectional image of pristine cSMFB showed highly porous rough and uneven surface. Thermogravimetric (TGA-DTA) analysis of cSMFB sample revealed the five stages total weight loss of ∼17.5% between 40 and 800 °C. Alkaline pH (pHi range: 6–8) favored the adsorption of dyes, while the equilibration time at Cₒ: 50 mg/L was varied between 480 and 600 min. The adsorption of dyes was possibly governed through electrostatic interaction, coordinate bond formation, and cationic interchange.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acobalt 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aencapsulation 3afreeze drying 3agentian violet 3aions 3amethylene blue 3amethylene green 3aoxides 3apH 3asodium alginate 3asteel 3asurface area 3awastes 3aweight loss 0aSteel industry waste 0aAlginate 0aLyophilize 0aCationic dyes 0aAdsorption1 aWabaidur, Saikh Mohammad1 aSiddiqui, Masoom Raza1 aAlqadami, Ayoub Abdullah1 aKhan, Akhtar Hussain0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Jan. 20, v. 244 p.118867-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1188673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012900165506011700294506007600411520115200487592002801639506003701667650001201704650001901716650001901735650001901754650001501773650001401788650000901802650001601811650001701827650001301844653001801857653002101875653001901896653001101915653000901926653001301935700002401948773009001972856008502062852000902147655001202156IND60792157020221207092345.0220914e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079215702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fooweb.2022.e002532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Jess10aPredicted impacts of global change on bottom-up trophic interactions in the plant-ungulate-wolf food chain in boreal forests  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGlobal warming has been accelerating as atmospheric CO₂ has risen. The mean annual temperature in boreal forests has increased by 1.5 °C or more, which has profound impacts on plants and wildlife. This overview explores available literature, identifies current knowledge gaps, highlights hypotheses about the cascading effects of global warming in a boreal forest food chain, and suggests future research directions. Our climate-driven bottom-up trophic interaction hypotheses explore climate change effects on boreal plants via five mechanisms: nutrient dilution, water stress, wildfires, snow depth, and phenology shifts. Ungulates may experience longer foraging time and reduced biomass due to less nutritious food resources. As a result, carnivores might benefit from increased stationary prey encounter and vulnerable individuals, but also need to cope with decreased prey biomass and increased energetic expenditure in hunting. We recommend increasing research efforts on nutrient dilution of northern plants, range shifts in northern herbivores that might lead to competition among them, and overall impacts of climate change on wolves.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomass 3aboreal forests 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3afood chain 3aphenology 3asnow 3atemperature 3awater stress 3awildlife 0aGlobal change 0aTrophic cascades 0aBoreal forests 0aArctic 0aWolf 0aUngulate1 aAnderson, Laurel J.0 tFood webs.g2022 Dec., v. 33 p.e00253-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23213x2352-24967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fooweb.2022.e002533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01242naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245011300161300001800274520023900292592002800531650002300559650001300582650001200595650001100607650003000618650002800648700002000676700002200696773012900718856007200847852000900919655001200928IND60657304620221116223611.0190816e20021119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065730462DNAL7 a10.1039/b207710h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGallant, Amanda J.10aCyclopentadienyl benzamidinato chromium complexes as models for alkyl halide activation by chromium reagents  ap. 2914-2915.  aCyclopentadienyl complexes of Cr(ii) and Cr(iii) are stabilized by bis(trimethylsilyl)benzamidinato ligands, allowing the resulting well-defined compounds to serve as models for alkyl halide activation by mid-valent Cr-based reagents.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3achromium 3aligands 3amodels 3aorganic halogen compounds 3aorganosilicon compounds1 aSmith, Kevin M.1 aPatrick, Brian O.0 tChemical communications.g2002 Nov. 19, , no. 23 p.2914-2915dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b207710h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03517naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013700167300001800304520195700322592002802279650001502307650001902322650002102341650002002362650001202382650003302394650001502427650001902442650001602461650001302477650001202490650004302502650001402545650001902559650002002578650001202598650001602610651001002626653001402636653001902650653001902669653001902688700002002707700001602727700001502743700001502758773012002773856008502893852000902978655001202987IND60565961020221120041437.0170329e20170603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056596102DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2017.12920702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, Zexing10aPhenological response of different vegetation types to temperature and precipitation variations in northern China during 1982–2012  ap. 3236-3252.  aPlant phenology is influenced by various climatic factors such as temperature, precipitation, insolation, and humidity, etc. Among these factors, temperature and precipitation are proved to be the most important. However, the relative importance of these two factors is different among various phenophases and regions and is seldom discussed along environmental gradients. Based on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from the NDVI3g dataset and using the mid-point method, we extracted the start date of the growing season (SOG) and the end date of the growing season (EOG) in northern China during 1982–2012. To determine which climate factor was more influential on plant phenology, partial correlation analysis was applied to analyse the spatial difference between the response of SOG and EOG to temperature and precipitation. Finally, we calculated the temperature and precipitation sensitivities of the SOG and EOG. The results showed that: (1) SOG displayed an advancing trend in most regions, while EOG was delayed for all the vegetation types during 1982–2012. (2) SOG was mainly triggered by preseason temperature. The increase in temperature caused an overall advance in SOG. However, the relationship between SOG and precipitation varied among different vegetation types. Regarding EOG, precipitation had greater impacts than temperature in relatively arid environments, such as deserts, steppes and meadow biomes. (3) The response of vegetation phenology (both SOG and EOG) to temperature became stronger with increasing preseason precipitation across space. The response of EOG to precipitation became weaker from arid regions to relatively humid regions. These results provide a better understanding of the spatial pattern of the phenological response along the precipitation gradient and a reference for assessing impacts of future climate change on vegetation phenology, especially in transitional and fragile zones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid zones 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3adata collection 3adeserts 3adry environmental conditions 3aecosystems 3agrowing season 3ahumid zones 3ahumidity 3ameadows 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aphenology 3aremote sensing 3asolar radiation 3asteppes 3atemperature 3aChina 0aPhenology 0agrowing season 0aremote sensing 0aclimate change1 aWang, Huanjiong1 aLiu, Yachen1 aXu, Yunjia1 aDai, Junhu0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2017 June 3, v. 38, no. 11 p.3236-3252dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2017.12920703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003600152245018500188300001600373520110800389592002801497650001701525650001501542650001401557650001501571650001201586650001201598650001501610650002401625650001901649650001401668650001901682650001801701653001401719653001501733653001201748653002201760653001701782653002401799700002201823700001701845700002201862700002101884700002201905700002701927700002501954773010701979856008702086852000902173655001202182IND60611602120221118230934.0200217e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061160212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2018.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGebreyohannes, Abaynesh Yihdego10aSimultaneous glucose production from cellulose and fouling reduction using a magnetic responsive membrane reactor with superparamagnetic nanoparticles carrying cellulolytic enzymes  ap. 532-540.  aThis work aimed at investigating simultaneous hydrolysis of cellulose and in-situ foulant degradation in a cellulose fed superparamagnetic biocatalytic membrane reactor (BMRSᴾ). In this reactor, a dynamic layer of superparamagnetic bionanocomposites with immobilized cellulolytic enzymes were reversibly immobilized on superparamagnetic polymeric membrane using an external magnetic field.The formation of a dynamic layer of bionanocomposites on the membrane helped to prevent direct membrane-foulant interaction. Due to in-situ biocatalysis, there was limited filtration resistance. Simultaneous separation of the product helped to avoid enzyme product inhibition, achieve constant reaction rate over time and 50% higher enzyme efficiency than batch reactor.Stable enzyme immobilization and the ability to keep enzyme in the system for long period helped to achieve continuous productivity at very low enzyme but high solid loading, while also reducing the extent of membrane fouling. Hence, the BMRSᴾ paves a path for sustainable production of bioethanol from the cheaply available lignocellulose.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocatalysis 3abioethanol 3acellulose 3afiltration 3afouling 3aglucose 3ahydrolysis 3aimmobilized enzymes 3alignocellulose 3amagnetism 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 0aCellulose 0aBioethanol 0aFouling 0aEnzyme inhibition 0aNanoparticle 0aMembrane bioreactor1 aDharmjeet, Madhav1 aSwusten, Tom1 aMertens, Matthias1 aVerspreet, Joran1 aVerbiest, Thierry1 aCourtin, Christophe M.1 aVankelecom, Ivo F.J.0 tBioresource technology.g2018 Sept., v. 263 p.532-540dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2018.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03392naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003500188245015500223300001800378506007600396520163100472592002802103506003702131650001502168650001702183650001602200650001802216650001402234650001402248650001702262650001002279650001202289650002102301650001302322650001602335650001102351650001602362650001102378650000902389650002302398650002602421650002002447650001002467650001502477650002702492700002802519700003202547700004302579773011402622856008102736852000902817655001202826IND60440694120221207064621.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044069412DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-014-1569-22doi7 aPMC45194802pmcid7 a262439502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOmowaye-Taiwo, Omolara Adenike10aEffect of germination and fermentation on the proximate composition and functional properties of full-fat and defatted cucumeropsis mannii seed flours  ap. 5257-5263.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGerminated, fermented and raw Cucumeropsis mannii (melon) seeds were processed into flours. A portion of the flours were defatted using n-hexane; both the full fat and defatted flours were evaluated for proximate composition and functional properties. The proximate compositions of the full fat and defatted C. mannii seed flours were: moisture, 4.97–5.67 % and 6.17–8.13 %; total ash, 1.95–3.24 % and 4.38–7.19 %; crude protein, 36.62–39.91 % and 71.91–77.05 %; crude fat, 45.06–49.57 % and 1.56–2.57 %; crude fibre, 2.71–3.63 % and 4.34–4.59 %; carbohydrate, 3.78–4.07 % and 4.45–6.54 %, respectively. The functional properties of the flour from full-fat and defatted seed were: water absorption capacity, 116.67–183.33 % and 216.67–267.67 %; oil absorption capacity, 252.33–274.00 % and 292.00–345.00 %; foaming capacity 17.36–30.34 % and 34.78–44.69 %; foaming stability, 5.17–11.54 % and 11.41–14.55 %; least gelation concentration, 24.67–28.00 and 13.33–18.67 %; emulsion capacity, 49.73–79.28 mL/g and 40.34–65.61 mL/g; bulk density 0.65–0.81 g/mL and 0.36–0.39 g/mL; protein solubility 4.00–5.89 % and 5.21–7.11 %, respectively. Germination enhanced the water absorption capacity, foaming capacity and protein solubility while fermentation increased the emulsion capacity. Defatting improved the water and oil absorption capacities, foaming capacity and protein solubility.

For this reason, adaptation and mitigation measures are important for the future of the wine industry. However, the process of adopting these measures by companies is not sufficiently known. The objective of this paper is to study the action against climate change by the wine sector in Spain, which has 13% of the world’s vineyard area. Data capture was carried out through a survey of wineries. First, a questionnaire was designed and validated. This process included semi-structured and in-depth interviews with several winery owners. Second, the survey was conducted on a simple random sample of 87 Spanish wineries, stratified by region. Third, using a multivariate technique of factor analysis, the research found a set of 11 indicators describing the different types of measures adopted. In addition, a cluster analysis provided four different winery profiles. The first group comprises 37% of the wineries, whose sustainability actions are very focused on viticulture. The second group includes 22% of the wineries, which manage their activities according to widespread sustainability criteria. The third group is composed of 21% of the wineries, whose mitigation measures are only focused on energy. The fourth group includes 21% of the wineries, which are characterized by the absence of measures to achieve sustainability. Finally, the characteristics of the wineries and their responses to specific variables were studied, in relation to their belonging to the groups. The results show that the wineries of all the groups are aware of the existence of climate change and that it can seriously affect them. However, the adoption of measures is very variable from one group to another. Regarding the characteristics of the wineries, large companies and young professionals are positively related to the professional management of sustainability. The certification of organic production is frequent in the wineries, but it is not enough to guide them in their action against climate change. The calculation of the carbon footprint, which is not widespread, is associated with the wineries that systematically manage sustainability. In view of the results, some policies are suggested to favour the action of the vitivinicultural sector against climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acarbon footprint 3acertification 3aclimate change 3acluster analysis 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3afactor analysis 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3amultivariate analysis 3aorganic production 3aprofessionals 3aquestionnaires 3asurveys 3avines 3avineyards 3aviticulture 3awine industry 3awines 3aSpain 0aMitigation 0aAdaptation 0aViticulture 0aWinery 0aSurvey 0aCluster analysis1 aGarcia-Casarejos, Nieves1 aGargallo, Pilar0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Jan. 20, v. 244 p.118874-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1188743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245020300171520106700374592002801441650001501469650001801484650001901502650001501521650000901536650001301545650001301558650001601571653001401587653002701601653002601628653001501654653001701669700002201686700002501708773010601733856008701839852000901926655001201935IND60757262020221119192700.0211206e20220120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075726202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1279122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadeghi, Mehdi12aA contribution to flotation technique as a reliable wettability alteration measurement method for carbonate minerals in separation processes involving hydrocarbons, low salinity water and nanofluids  aA reliable flotation method was developed and experimentally evaluated as a fast and repeatable quantitative wettability measurement technique for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) purposes by comparing its performance with the well-known and reliable method of contact angle measurement. In both methods, oil-wet carbonate specimens were contacted with brines of different salinities and nanoparticle concentrations, and the trend of test results were compared. In the salinity tests, it was observed that flotation results are in full consistency with contact angle measurements. In both methods, salinity reduction from seawater (SW) to 10 times diluted seawater (TDSW) resulted in reaching the maximum hydrophilicity while further dilution to 40 TDSW hindered the wettability alteration process. Nanofluid tests in both methods were also in great consistency at nanoparticle concentrations below 0.1%wt due to particle stability limitations. Finally, two flotation mechanisms for the oil/water/rock system were introduced and one of them was empirically confirmed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbonates 3acontact angle 3ahydrophilicity 3ananofluids 3aoils 3asalinity 3aseawater 3awettability 0aFlotation 0aWettability alteration 0aThree-Phase Interface 0aSeparation 0aLow Salinity1 aHashemi, Rohallah1 aShahverdi, Hamidreza0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Jan. 20, v. 633 p.127912-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1279123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04030naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245015600168300001400324520214300338592002802481650001202509650001302521650001602534650001402550650002002564650002302584650001602607650001602623650000902639650001102648650002302659650001402682650002002696650001702716650001802733650002602751650002302777650001502800650001202815650001502827650001702842650001002859650001902869650001402888650001102902650001302913650002502926650000902951653003102960653001402991653002403005653002103029653000703050653000803057700001803065700001503083700001703098700001803115700001503133773010203148856008503250852000903335655001203344IND60560773120221120234105.0170106e20170102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056077312DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2016.12014912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Yiling10aEffects of root addition and foliar application of nitric oxide and salicylic acid in alleviating iron deficiency induced chlorosis of peanut seedlings  ap. 63-81.  aNitric oxide (NO) and salicylic acid (SA) are two important signaling molecules, which could alleviate chlorosis of peanut under iron (Fe) deficiency. Here, we further investigated the mechanism of different combinations of sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a nitric oxide donor) and SA supplying in alleviation Fe deficiency symptoms and selected which is the best combination. Thus, peanut was cultivated in hydroponic culture under iron limiting condition with different combinations of SNP and SA application. After 21 days, Fe deficiency significantly inhibited peanut growth, decreased soluble Fe concentration and chlorophyll contents, and disturbed ionic homeostasis. In addition, the content of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration increased, which led the lipid peroxidation. Application of SNP and SA significantly changed Fe trafficking in cells and organs, which increased Fe uptake from nutrient solution, and transport from root to shoot, enhanced the activity of ferric-chelate reductase (FCR), that increased the available Fe in cell organelles, and the active Fe, chlorophyll contents in leaves. Furthermore, ameliorated the inhibition of calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and zinc (Zn) uptake and promoted plant growth in Fe deficiency. At the same time, it increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) to protect the plasmolemma from peroxidation. Results demonstrated that different combinations of SNP and SA application could alleviate the chlorosis of peanut in Fe deficiency by various mechanisms. Such as increased the available Fe and chlorophyll concentrations in leaves, improved the activities of antioxidant enzymes and modulated the mineral elements balance and so on. Foliar application of SNP and SA is the best to protect leaves while directly adding them into nutrient solution is the best to protect roots. These results also indicated that the effects of SNP and SA supplying together to leaves or roots are better than respectively adding to roots and spraying to leaves. The best combination is foliar application of SNP and SA.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3achlorosis 3aenzyme activity 3afoliar application 3ahomeostasis 3ahydroponics 3airon 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3amagnesium 3amalondialdehyde 3anitric oxide 3anitroprusside 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutrient solutions 3aorganelles 3apeanuts 3aperoxidase 3aplant growth 3aroots 3asalicylic acid 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3aspraying 3asuperoxide dismutase 3azinc 0aChlorophyll concentrations 0aactive fe 0aantioxidant enzymes 0amineral elements 0aSA 0aSNP1 aDong, Yuanjie1 aKong, Jing1 aTian, Xianyi1 aBai, Xiaoying1 aXu, Linlin0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2017 Jan. 2, v. 40, no. 1 p.63-81dTaylor & Francisx1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2016.12014913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011800167520154900285592002801834650001401862650001101876650001701887650001701904650001201921650001701933650001801950650001801968650002901986650001902015650002502034650001902059653001702078653001602095653001902111653002502130653001402155700002302169700001702192700001802209700002402227700001702251773011302268856008602381852000902467655001202476IND60673093420221118135807.0200210e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067309342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1188882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Xiaojie10aSolidification inside a clean energy storage unit utilizing phase change material with copper oxide nanoparticles  aUtilizing renewable and alternative energy is the best way to confront endangering issues such as reduction of fossil fuels. Thermal energy storage systems can considerably reduce the consumption of energy and they can improve the utilizations of renewable energy sources. Recently, building section becomes a great consumer of heat causing to a great levels of carbon emission. For developing the energy output of the buildings, heat storage mixed with phase change material becomes an efficient technique. For enhancing the productivity, one of the techniques applied is storing heat whilst the time of great solar intensity and releasing it through the night time. Enhancement in the thermal conductivity leads the discharging time of PCM through the solidification to reduce. So, nanoparticles have been dispersed into paraffin in this article. In addition, considering wavy surface for the inner duct is taken into account as second way which is combined with first technique. Numerical approach was successfully verified and employed for various cases. The herein obtained outputs revealed that entropy generation is an augmenting function of amplitude of wavy surface and it is reducing function of concentration of nanomaterial. Also, dispersing nanomaterial is more effective when sinusoidal surface has been employed. Heat flux transfer to PCM declines as time progress. Discharging rate has been minimized as amplitude of wavy channel augments. Influences of amplitude of wavy surface are more pronounced in cases with pure paraffin.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acarbon 3aclean energy 3acupric oxide 3aentropy 3afossil fuels 3aheat transfer 3ananoparticles 3arenewable energy sources 3asolidification 3athermal conductivity 3athermal energy 0aNanoparticle 0aVentilation 0aSolidification 0aFinite volume method 0aWavy duct1 aSheikholeslami, M.1 aJafaryar, M.1 aShafee, Ahmad1 aNguyen, Thoi Trung,1 aLi, Zhixiong0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 245 p.118888-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1188883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01880naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001500141245009800156300001800254500001400272520061300286592002800899650002400927650001800951650001100969650001400980650001900994650002401013650002201037650001801059650000701077653002001084653001701104653002801121700001801149700001801167700001601185773018501201856007501386852000901461655001201470IND60691807820221118003848.0200502e19990101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069180782DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.63.17812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLEE, Eun-A10aIsolation and Characterization of Basic Exochitinase from Leaf Extract of Rehmannia glutinosa  ap. 1781-1783.  aNAL-light  aRehmannia chitinases were extracted from the leaves of Rehmannia glutinosa under acidic conditions (pH 2.9).

Effect of combination of additives (CA) namely dry gluten powder, sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate, fungal α-amylase on the rheological and bread making characteristics of wheat flour partly replaced with roller milled fractions of black gram was studied. With increase in the addition of straight run flour (SRF), protein rich fraction (PRF), protein and fiber rich fraction (P&FRF) from 0 to 20 %, fiber rich fraction, FRF (0–15 %), the farinograph water absorption increased and dough stability decreased; amylograph pasting temperature increased and peak viscosity decreased; bread volume decreased and crumb firmness value increased indicating adverse effect of these fractions on the rheological and bread making characteristics of wheat flour. Sensory evaluation showed that breads were acceptable only up to the level of 15 % for SRF, PRF & P&FRF and 10 % for FRF. However, when CA containing dry gluten powder, sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate and fungal α-amylase was incorporated the overall quality of the products improved.

Three aerobic granular sequencing batch reactors (SBR) performing simultaneous nitrification, denitrification and phosphorus removal (SNDPR) were run at different aeration time (120, 90, and 60 min). Aerobic granules could remain their integrity and stability over long-term operation under high aeration intensity and different time, and shorter aeration time favored the retention of biomass, better settleability, and more production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Besides, efficient and stable reactor performance for carbon and phosphorus were achieved, especially, enhanced nitrogen removal was obtained due to reduction of aeration time. Further exploration revealed that the aeration time shaped the bacterial community in terms of diversity, composition, as well as the distribution of functional groups involving carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3abacterial communities 3abiomass 3acarbon 3adenitrification 3agranules 3amoieties 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 0aAerobic granules 0aSNDPR 0aAeration intensity 0aAeration time 0aEPS 0aMicrobial community1 aChen, Li1 aZhang, Shujia1 aWang, Li1 aLiang, Jiawen1 aXia, Wenhao1 aWang, Hongyu1 aZhou, Jinping0 tBioresource technology.g2018 Sept., v. 263 p.214-222dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2018.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245010700214300001800321520153500339592002801874650001401902650003401916650001601950650003501966650001002001650001102011650001602022650002902038650002002067650002402087653002502111653002302136653002702159653003002186653002802216700005702244773009902301856008502400852000902485655001202494IND60673093720221118135758.0191214e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067309372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2019.09.1172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadeghian, Hamidreza1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8037-540812aA novel impact-assessment framework for distributed PV installations in low-voltage secondary networks  ap. 2179-2194.  aThis paper proposes an impact-assessment framework to appropriately assess the impacts of two different types of distributed solar photovoltaic (DPV) installation on a realistic distribution network. To examine the spontaneous customer-based installations, a detailed Monte Carlo-based technique is introduced. For the controlled utility-based installation, a multi-objective optimization problem for the sizing and location of DPV installation is formulated aiming to improve energy loss, voltage deviation, and voltage fluctuation, avoiding reverse power flow and voltage violation. Solar insolation study is performed using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to estimate the potential of the network for DPV installation. In addition, a synthetic load profile modeling is developed to create yearly electricity load profiles for all the buildings in the given distribution network. The proposed framework is applied to a local distribution network with synthetic load profiles, Geographic Information System (GIS), and realistic solar insolation. It is found that for customer-based installation, voltage violation occurs beyond 30% of DPV penetration level, demonstrating the necessity of utility-based installation scheme for higher penetration ratios. Beyond a specific threshold, the probability of reverse power flow significantly increases in customer-based installation. Therefore, to achieve higher penetration ratios without reverse power flow and other negative impacts, utility-aided installation is necessary.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectricity 3ageographic information systems 3alidar 3amodels 3aprobability 3arenewable energy sources 3asolar radiation 3asystem optimization 0aDistribution network 0aRooftop PV systems 0aDistributed generation 0aOptimal sizing and siting 0aSynthetic load modeling1 aWang, Zhifang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6577-95510 tRenewable energy.g2020 Mar., v. 147 p.2179-2194dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2019.09.1173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02534naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010800169300001600277520122300293592002801516650002201544650001901566650001901585650001101604650001501615650001201630650001401642650001901656650001301675651001001688653002201698653002001720653002701740653001701767653001401784700001501798700001801813700001401831700001501845773013301860856008601993852000902079655001202088IND60088668020221119045335.0190410e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008866802DNAL7 a10.1016/S1002-0160(13)60038-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWU, Guo-Zhong10aCombining Solvent Extraction and Bioremediation for Removing Weathered Petroleum from Contaminated Soil  ap. 455-463.  aThis study aimed to evaluate the efficacy, practicality and sustainability of a combined approach based on solvent extraction and biodegradation to remediate the soils contaminated with high levels of weathered petroleum hydrocarbons. The soils used in this study were obtained from the Shengli Oilfield in China, which had a long history of contamination with high concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons. The contaminated soils were washed using a composite organic solvent consisting of hexane and pentane (4:1, v/v) and then bioremediated in microcosms which were bioaugmentated with Bacillus subtilis FQ06 strains and/or rhamnolipid. The optimal solvent extraction conditions were determined as extraction for 20 min at 25 °C with solvent-soil ratio of 6:1 (v/w). On this basis, total petroleum hydrocarbon was decreased from 140 000 to 14 000 mg kg−1, which was further reduced to < 4 000 mg kg−1 by subsequent bioremediation for 132 d. Sustainability assessment of this integrated technology showed its good performance for both short- and long-term effectiveness. Overall the results encouraged its application for remediating contaminated sites especially with high concentration weathered hydrocarbons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3ahexane 3aoil fields 3apentane 3apetroleum 3apolluted soils 3asolvents 3aChina 0aBacillus subtilis 0abioaugmentation 0aintegrated remediation 0aTU-A solvent 0arhamnolip1 aCOULON, F.1 aYANG, Yue-Wei1 aLi, Hong,1 aSui, Hong,0 tPedosphere.g2013 Aug., v. 23, no. 4 p.455-463dElsevier LtdaSoil Science Society of ChinawJournal:jnl4085839x1002-01607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(13)60038-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245010200169300001600271520141400287592002801701650001501729650001101744650001001755650002101765650001101786653002501797653003301822653003201855653003001887653002001917700001501937700001801952700001501970773010101985856008602086852000902172655001202181IND60563860620221118145906.0170713e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056386062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2015.12.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKheldoun, A.12aA new Golden Section method-based maximum power point tracking algorithm for photovoltaic systems  ap. 125-136.  aOne way to improve the efficiency of solar powered systems is to maximize the energy harvesting from the photovoltaic module by using a maximum power point tracking algorithm. The latter must be simple for implementation, fast and accurate to cope with fast changing atmospheric conditions and partial shading operations. The paper presents a new maximum power point tracking method based on Golden-Section Optimization technique for photovoltaic systems. The proposed method converges to the Maximum Power Point by interval shrinking. Initially, two points are selected from the search space whose boundaries are known, evaluated then a new point is accordingly generated. At given iteration the algorithm has a new narrowed interval bounded by the new point and one of the initial points according to the evaluation results. The algorithm stops iterating (interval shrinking) when the interval becomes small enough and the photovoltaic system is forced to operate at the average value of the last found interval without perturbing either the voltage or the duty cycle. This makes the photovoltaic system converges rapidly to the maximum power point without voltage or power oscillations around the maximum power point thereby lower energy waste. A comparison results with recently published work are provided to show the validity of the proposed algorithm under fast changing conditions and partial shading.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aenergy 3ashade 3asolar collectors 3awastes 0aPhotovoltaic systems 0aMaximum power point tracking 0aGolden-Section Optimization 0aSteady state oscillations 0aPartial shading1 aBradai, R.1 aBoukenoui, R.1 aMellit, A.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 111 p.125-136dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2015.12.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245010600171506010400277506007600381520135400457592002801811506003701839650003001876650002501906650001901931650001101950650002401961650001601985650001302001650001102014651001002025653003502035653002302070653002002093653002602113700005602139773011902195856008802314852000902402655001202411IND60792356020221207101159.0220921e20221215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079235602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1585682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Yuanyuan10aEnergy consumption in China: Spatial effects of industrial concentration, localization, and diversity  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis paper discusses the effects of industrial agglomeration on electrical energy consumption from a spatial perspective by highlighting multiple agglomeration types. It is argued that different types of industry agglomeration may exert differentiated effects on energy consumption and their possible spatial interactions. With city sector panel data of China's 285 prefecture-level cities for the period 2003–2013, we adopted the Spatial Durbin Model (SDM) with fixed effects to examine the spatial effects of industrial agglomeration types on energy consumption. The model found that all types of industrial agglomeration play significant and different roles in explaining overall local energy consumption. Second, geographical proximity, diversity, and related variety show the spatial spillover effects on surrounding areas. Third, the spatial energy effects of industrial agglomeration across regions are evidently heterogeneous. Diversity and one of its sub-forms-related variety maintains consumption-saving effects in regions with the initial or intermediate stage of an industry life cycle, while unrelated variety changes over different phases. The results suggest that policymakers scientifically discriminate regional features and guide the agglomerated types of industries in order to balance economic growth with energy conservation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aconcentration (economics) 3aeconomic development 3aelectric power 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aenvironment 3aindustry 3amodels 3aChina 0aIndustrial agglomeration types 0aEnergy consumption 0aSpatial effects 0aSpatial heterogeneity1 aHu, Zhiqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9371-03050 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Dec. 15, v. 852 p.158568-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1585683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03182naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245015700167300001600324520154800340592002801888650002601916650002501942650001301967650002201980650002202002650002302024650001502047650001902062650002202081650000902103650000902112650001402121650001502135650001502150650001502165650001302180653002202193653003302215653002702248653003002275653002502305653001402330700001702344700001602361700001402377700001802391700001402409773012002423856008802543852000902631655001202640IND60645447220221120084439.0190725e20190920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064544722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.05.3222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qin10aBiogenic iron mineralization of polyferric sulfate by dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria: Effects of medium composition and electric field stimulation  ap. 466-475.  aPolyferric sulfate (PFS) is a coagulant widely used for removing contaminants from the aqueous phase; however, PFS destabilizes and recrystallizes in the solid phase in the presence of dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria (DIRB), which has a profound influence on the cycle of Fe and the fate of the associated pollutants. Our objective is to investigate the combined effects of medium composition and electric field stimulation on the biomineralization of PFS. Batch experiments were conducted with PFS and the DIRB Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 under anoxic conditions to examine the microbial reduction of PFS to Fe(II) and its subsequent biotransformation. The high concentration of phosphorous in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) is responsible for slower and less extensive Fe(II) generation compared to the lower concentration of phosphorous in a medium of 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid (PIPES). The PBS system induces the formation of green rust (SO42−) and vivianite as the major minerals; in contrast, magnetite is the predominant end product in the PIPES system. The application of an anodic potential of 0.2 V significantly stimulates Fe(II) release from PFS, leading to precipitation and transformation of more crystalline minerals in increased quantities. The results demonstrate that Fe(II) catalyzes biomineralization of PFS to a variety of secondary products; this electron transfer process is highly dependent on the rate and magnitude of PFS reduction and the surface reaction with the host compound and adsorbed ions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aShewanella oneidensis 3aanaerobic conditions 3abacteria 3abiomineralization 3abiotransformation 3acatalytic activity 3acoagulants 3aelectric field 3aelectron transfer 3aions 3airon 3amagnetite 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3apollutants 3asulfates 0aBiomineralization 0aDissimilatory iron reduction 0aElectrical stimulation 0aBioelectrochemical system 0aSediment remediation 0aCoagulant1 aWei, Ziliang1 aYi, Xiaoyun1 aTang, Jie1 aFeng, Chunhua1 aDang, Zhi0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Sept. 20, v. 684 p.466-475dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.05.3223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01277naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245006700154300001800221520033700239592002800576650002200604650001500626650001700641650002200658650001000680700002000690700002100710700003000731773011800761856007500879852000900954655001200963IND60550091620221119035430.0160909e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055009162DNAL7 a10.1021/jo302585a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, Bijan10aFluorescent Tris-Imidazolium Sensors for Picric Acid Explosive  ap. 1306-1310.  aTwo new anthracene-functionalized fluorescent tris-imidazolium salts have been synthesized, characterized, and proven to be selective sensors for picric acid, which is a common constituent of many powerful explosives.

Insect pollination enhances fruit set, but little is known about how pollination success varies by number of visits from bumble bees. To quantify the efficiency of bumble bees at pollinating eggplants, we allowed 1,2,6, and 12 bumble bees (Bombus impatiens Cresson) to visit eggplant flowers and compared percentage of flowers that set fruit, fruit weight, and seed set after 3 wk. We compared yield from these visit numbers to eggplant flowers that were left open for unlimited visitation. Eggplant flowers set the most fruit from open-pollination and 12 visits. Larger, seedier fruits were formed in open-pollinated flowers. However, fruit characteristics in the 12 visit treatment were similar to lower visitation frequencies. We confirm B. impatiens as an efficient eggplant pollinator and document the greatest benefit from 12 bumble bee visits and open-pollinated flowers. To maintain effective eggplant pollination, local conditions must be conducive for bumble bee colony establishment and repeated pollen foraging trips.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombus impatiens 3aSolanum melongena 3acrop yield 3aeggplants 3aflowers 3aforaging 3afruit set 3afruits 3ainsect pollination 3aopen pollination 3apollen 3apollinating insects 3aseed set 3aself-pollination 0aeggplant 0aSolanum melongena 0apollination 0abumble bee1 aMinor, Emily S.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2015 June, v. 108, no. 3 p.1456-1459dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01691naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245004700171520074800218592002800966650001000994650001201004650000901016653000801025653000801033653000801041653000801049653000801057653001801065653002201083653002701105653001601132773009801148856008601246852000901332655001201341IND60751853920221120230903.0211017e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075185392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2021.1100912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaehashi, Kohei10aSystemic risk of portfolio diversification  aThis paper studies the vulnerability arising from the corporate loan holdings of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) using a network reconstruction method and stress tests. Because of the portfolio diversification requirement imposed on the management of CLOs, some corporate loans are held by multiple CLOs. This commonality of corporate loans among CLO portfolios suggests the possibility that the diversification of risk in each CLO is not as high as it may appear from the perspective of the entire market. Stress tests show that portfolio diversification of securitization as observed in the CLO loan holdings is not necessarily effective in enhancing system-wide robustness against the idiosyncratic defaults of the underlying assets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aloans 3amarkets 3arisk 0aD85 0aE44 0aG01 0aG23 0aL14 0aSystemic risk 0aBipartite network 0aNetwork reconstruction 0aStress test0 tEconomics letters.g2021 Nov., v. 208 p.110091-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2021.1100913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245006700157300001600224520194100240592002802181650001602209650002002225650001502245650001202260650002102272650000902293650000902302650001802311650001202329650001702341650001202358700001702370773011802387856007402505852000902579655001202588IND60331720320221120113703.0150727e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6033172032DNAL7 a10.1093/icb/icv0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUyeno, T. A.10aMuscle Articulations: Flexible Jaw Joints Made of Soft Tissues  ap. 193-204.  aThis study surveys animals that use soft tissues rather than rigid links to build jaw joints. Hard biting elements are useful; they are used in piercing or shearing during feeding and interactive behaviors and can directly impact survival and reproduction. The best understood biting systems include biting elements that are mounted on rigid jaw links that form a joint capable of transmitting the bite reaction forces. As such, jaws must incorporate joints that resist compression. Many jaw joints are “sliding joints”, in which jaw links come into direct contact and the shape of the sliding contact surfaces dictates possible motions. There are, however, organisms that have biting elements on jaws that are made of flexible muscle and connective tissues. If arranged as a muscular hydrostat, in which multiple orientations of the muscle fibers may co-contract to provide turgid skeletal support, the multifunctional joint not only (a) provides the force to move the biting elements, but also (b) creates repositionable pivots and (c) transmits bite reaction forces. Such flexible joints, termed “muscle articulations”, may be important to a number of soft-bodied animals. In this survey, we review the function of previously described muscle articulations: the joints found between inarticulate brachiopods’ valves, cephalopods’ beaks, the hooks of kalyptorhynch flatworms, and errant polychaetes’ jaws. We also review the morphology, physiology, and feeding behaviors of the hagfish as a putative muscle articulation in an effort to understand how this jawless craniate is capable of biting with surprising force, seemingly without the benefit of any obvious method of opposing the force of the dental plate that is used to remove portions of food. Initial analysis suggests that a muscle articulation may be a key feature in coordinating head and body movements to provide the leverage needed for strong “bites”.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCephalopoda 3aPlatyhelminthes 3aPolychaeta 3aanimals 3afeeding behavior 3ahead 3ajaws 3amuscle fibers 3amuscles 3areproduction 3asurveys1 aClark, A.

Twenty-three varieties of commonly consumed breakfast foods of South India were tested. The data on glycemic carbohydrates were developed by using a modified method of anthrone followed by glycemic index and glycemic load by using FAO/WHO method. The results of glycemic carbohydrates among the commonly consumed breakfast foods range from 49.63% (vada sambar) to 71.84% (vegetable biryani). The results of the glycemic index among the commonly consumed breakfast foods were shown highest of 79.69 (onion dosa) and lowest of 36.89 (vada sambar). The results of the glycemic load of commonly consumed breakfast foods tested were shown highest of 39.69 (plain dosa) and lowest of 18.44 (vada sambar) respectively. The glycemic carbohydrates, glycemic indices and glycemic loads among the breakfast foods tested were almost similar except for vada sambar. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report glycemic carbohydrate, glycemic index and glycemic load of commonly consumed breakfast foods of South India and found to be higher in rice-based breakfast foods than that of legume-based breakfast foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRusa unicolor 3abreakfast 3acarbohydrates 3adatabases 3aglycemic index 3aglycemic load 3aonions 3aIndia1 aNaik, Rakesh1 aSobhana, Prasanthi Prabhakaran0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2022 Sept., v. 59, no. 9 p.3619-3626dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-022-05368-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03481naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245006500166520203900231592002802270650000902298650001202307650002902319650001702348650003102365650001402396650002302410650001802433650000902451653001902460653003702479653002802516653004902544700001502593700001602608700005802624700002702682700005602709700001402765700001502779700001602794773011802810856008602928852000903014655001203023IND60790512720221118133243.0220914e20221101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079051272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1160202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qiao10aGas transport in landfill cover system: A critical appraisal  aLandfill gas (LFG) emission is gaining more attention from the scientific fraternity and policymakers recently due to its threat to the atmosphere and human health of the populace living in surrounding premises. Though landfill cover (LFC) (viz., daily, intermittent and final cover) is widely used by landfill operators to mitigate or reduce these emissions, their overall performance is still under question. A critical analysis of available literature, primarily pertaining to (i) the composition of the landfill gases and their migration in the LFC system, (ii) experimental and mathematical investigations of the transport mechanism of gas and (iii) the impact of additives to cover soils on transport and fate of gas, has been conducted and presented in this manuscript. Investigation of the efficiency of modified soil was mainly focused on laboratory test. More field tests and application of amended cover soils should be conducted and promoted further. Studies on nitrous oxide and emerging pollutants, including poly-fluoroalkyl substances transport in landfill cover system are limited and need further research. The transport mechanisms of these unconventional contaminants should be considered regarding the selection of LFC materials including geomembrane and geosynthetic clay liners. The existing analytical and numerical models can provide a basic understanding of LFG transport mechanisms and are able to predict the migration behaviour of LFG; however, there are still knowledge gaps concerning the interaction between different species of the gas molecule when modeling multi-component gas transport. Gas transport through fractured cover should also be considered when evaluating LFG emission in the future. Simplified design method for landfill cover system regarding LFG emission based on analytical models should be proposed. Overall, mathematical models combined with experiments can facilitate more visualized and intensive insights, which would be instrumental in devising climate adaptive landfill covers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3aclimate 3aenvironmental management 3ahuman health 3alaboratory experimentation 3alandfills 3amigratory behavior 3anitrous oxide 3asoil 0aLandfill cover 0aReactive gas transport phenomena 0aMultiphase porous media 0aExperimental and numerical studies. contents1 aGu, Xiting1 aTang, Suqin1 aMohammad, Arif1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1815-50731 aSingh, Devendra Narain1 aXie, Haijian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5625-039X1 aChen, Yun1 aZuo, Xinru1 aSun, Zhilin0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 321 p.116020-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1160203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03505naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245014000172300001600312520157300328592002801901650001401929650001301943650001701956650001001973650000901983650001501992650001802007650002102025650001802046650001902064653000802083653000802091653000902099653001002108653000702118653000902125653000802134653001002142653000902152653000802161653000702169653000702176653000902183653000902192653000802201653000802209653000802217653000802225653000802233653000902241653000702250653000802257653000802265653000802273653000602281653000902287653001502296653001402311653002302325653005302348700001902401700002202420700002002442700002002462700003402482773013502516856008702651852000902738655001202747IND60617667620221121032456.0190131e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061766762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.10.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNanda, Biswarup10aAcylated chitosan anchored paclitaxel loaded liposomes: Pharmacokinetic and biodistribution study in Ehrlich ascites tumor bearing mice  ap. 367-379.  aAcylated chitosan (Myristoyl and Octanoyl) coated paclitaxel-loaded liposomal formulation was developed with an aim to overcome the cremophor EL related toxicities. They were evaluated for drug entrapment, in vitro drug release, and cytotoxicity and cell uptake behavior using A549 cells. The 99mTc radio-labeled formulations were also evaluated in vivo in Ehrlich Ascites Tumor (EAT) bearing mice for biodistribution and tumor uptake. The mean particle size of both coated and uncoated liposomal formulations was found to be in the range of 180–200 nm with high drug entrapment efficiency (>90% in case of uncoated liposomes and 80 ± 5% in case of coated liposomes). The uncoated liposomes displayed negative zeta potential (−10.5 ± 4.9 mV) whereas coated liposomes displayed positive zeta potential in the range of +21 to +27 mV. Slower drug release was observed in case of liposomes coated with acylated chitosans as compared to uncoated and native chitosan coated liposomes. All liposomal formulations were found less cytotoxic than paclitaxel injection (Celtax™, Celon Labs, India). In vitro cell uptake and intracellular distribution studies confirmed the cytosolic delivery of uncoated and coated liposomes. The myristoyl chitosan coated liposomal system (LMC) exhibited improved pharmacokinetic, biodistribution and tumor uptake characteristics over other formulations. These obtained results confirmed the potential application of acylated chitosn coated liposomal delivery systems (LMC) in tumor targeting of paclitaxel and other drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinoma 3achitosan 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3amice 3apaclitaxel 3aparticle size 3apharmacokinetics 3aradiolabeling 3azeta potential 0aPTX 0aFDA 0aDOPE 0aCHEMS 0aCh 0aA549 0aEAT 0a99mTc 0aDMEM 0aFBS 0aMC 0aOC 0aMLVs 0aSUVs 0aLCh 0aLOC 0aLMC 0aPBS 0aMTT 0aDMSO 0aPI 0aRES 0aMRT 0aEPR 0aP 0aPCLs 0aPaclitaxel 0aLiposomes 0aMyristoyl chitosan 0aOctonoyl chitosan, cytotoxicity, biodistribution1 aManjappa, A.S.1 aChuttani, Krishna1 aBalasinor, N.H.1 aMishra, Anil K.1 aRamachandra Murthy, Rayasa S.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 122 p.367-379dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.10.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245008900175500001900264520097700283592002801260650002201288650002501310650001601335650001801351650001101369650001101380650002701391650001301418650001101431650001901442650001501461650001501476650001801491650001101509653001801520653001101538653001301549653000801562653001401570653001001584700001901594700003101613700003501644700003901679700002501718700003101743700004101774700003501815773012101850856008301971852000902054655001202063IND60706642920221121110816.0201124e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070664292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcdf.2020.1002332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMariano, Tamara Borges10aPrebiotic fructooligosaccharides obtained from escarole (Cichorium endivia L.) roots  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aInulin and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) are fructans a reserve polysaccharides that have a great economic interest in the food and pharmaceutical industries.

This includes the use of N-glycosides of enone sugars as reactive dienophile in asymmetric synthesis of bicyclic adduct through Diels–Alder cycloaddition reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3acycloaddition reactions 3aglycosylation 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganic compounds 3astereoselective synthesis 3asugars1 aWilliam, Ronny1 aLiu, Xue-Wei0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2013 Feb. 01, v. 78, no. 3 p.1293-1299dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo302619b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02350naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002000167245007500187300001600262520120500278592002801483650001201511650002601523650001001549650001601559650001401575650001801589650001001607650001701617653001601634653002001650653001701670653002101687653001401708700001701722773010101739856011501840852000901955655001201964IND50065153720221119204427.0151127e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006515372DNAL7 a10.1658/1100-9233(2005)16[559:ISDUEC]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJurado, Enrique10aIs seed dormancy under environmental control or bound to plant traits?  ap. 559-564.  aQuestions: Is dormancy selected as a means by which a seed defers germination until suitable environmental conditions occur? Are plant species in frost-free and drought-free environments less likely to have some form of dormancy than species from environments with frost and/or drought? Are there any relationships between dormancy and three important plant traits: seed size, plant longevity, and growth form?Methods: Data from the literature including 3164 species were compiled. We quantified the relationship between dormancy and seed size (1795 species), plant longevity (183 species), and growth form (3164 species).Results: Plant species of environments with frost and/or drought were more likely to possess some form of seed dormancy (morphological, physiological, morphophysiological, or physical) than species in more benign environments. Seeds exhibiting some form of dormancy were lighter in weight and generally more prevalent among herbaceous species. Woody plants had a larger proportion of non-dormant seeds. There was a broad overlap in seed size between species with dormant and non-dormant seeds. We also found no significant relationship between seed dormancy and plant longevity.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrought 3aenvironmental factors 3afrost 3agermination 3alongevity 3aseed dormancy 3aseeds 3awoody plants 0aGrowth form 0aPlant longevity 0aSeed ecology 0aSeed germination 0aSeed size1 aFlores, Joel0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2005 Oct., v. 16, no. 5 p.559-564dOpulus Pressx1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1658%2F1100-9233%282005%2916%5B559%3AISDUEC%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245009100179300001600270520140800286592002801694650002601722650002901748650001801777650001701795650001901812650001401831650001101845650001701856650002301873650001301896650001501909650001001924650001401934650001501948650002001963700002401983773012502007856008102132852000902213655001202222IND60477486220221120090002.0151224e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047748622DNAL7 a10.1007/s10493-015-9977-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt-Jeffris, Rebecca A.10aPhenology and structure of a phytoseiid community in an insecticide-free apple orchard  ap. 173-182.  aCommercial orchards have acarine communities that are reduced in biological diversity compared to their undisturbed counterparts. Examining the phenology of an unsprayed orchard allows for the examination of non-pesticide factors that drive changes in populations. This study examined the mite community in a largely unsprayed research orchard in 2013–2014. The phytoseiids Galendromus flumenis (Chant), Amblydromella caudiglans (Schuster), Kampimodromus corylosus Kolodochka, and Galendromus occidentalis (Nesbitt) were found, in addition to Zetzellia mali (Ewing) and Aculus schlechtendali (Nalepa). Although G. occidentalis is typically the dominant phytoseiid in commercial orchards, G. flumenis was much more abundant in this unsprayed block. Aculus schlechtendali appeared to be the main source of prey for all predator species. The availability of this prey item and the lack of pesticides are likely the factors that allowed for G. flumenis to reach high abundances. Tetranychids were scarce, emphasizing the role of these mites as induced pests; without the application of disruptive sprays, the predatory mite community was able to maintain biological control. This study demonstrates that the species complex of generalist phytoseiids that is present in orchard systems undisturbed by pesticides is sufficient to maintain spider mite populations below damaging levels throughout the season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAculus schlechtendali 3aMetaseiulus occidentalis 3aTetranychidae 3aTyphlodromus 3aZetzellia mali 3aacarology 3aapples 3abiodiversity 3abiological control 3aorchards 3apesticides 3apests 3aphenology 3apopulation 3apredatory mites1 aBeers, Elizabeth H.0 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2016 Feb., v. 68, no. 2 p.173-182dSpringer International Publishingx0168-81627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-015-9977-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005800152245016200210300001600372520115500388592002801543650001901571650003201590650001301622650001301635650002501648650003001673650001101703650001301714650000901727653003201736653003301768653002401801700001701825700001801842700002001860773013201880856008702012852000902099655001202108IND60617667920221123034145.0181127e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061766792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.10.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHam, Dae Woong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4278-270110aOsteogenic effectiveness of photo-immobilized bone morphogenetic protein-2 using different azidophenyl-natural polymer carriers in rat calvarial defect model  ap. 333-341.  aThe osteogenetic potential of photo-immobilized azdiophenyl (Az)-natural polymers as a carrier of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) was assessed in 56 rats randomized to four groups. The control group comprised implanted collagen sheet with BMP-2. In the three experimental groups, the implant comprised collagen sheet with photo-immobilized BMP-2 on Az-gelatin (Az-Gel), Az-O-carboxymethyl chitosan (Az-OMC), or Az‑O‑carboxymethyl low molecular chitosan (Az-LMC). Micro-computed tomography analysis revealed more regenerated bone in Az-Gel at 8weeks. Immunohistochemical analysis at 4weeks revealed that the positively expressed cellular ratio in RUNX2-stained cells was significantly higher in Az-Gel and Az-OMC groups. At 8weeks, only the Az-Gel group showed higher positively expressed cellular ratio compared with the control group. These results demonstrate the superior osteogenetic potential of photo-immobilized BMP-2 using Az-Gel carrier in a rat calvarial defect model compared with control group. Photo-immobilization of BMP-2 using Az-gelatin could be a more effective carrier system of BMP-2 than a chitosan-based carrier system.  aPublisher supplied data 3abone formation 3abone morphogenetic proteins 3achitosan 3acollagen 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amicro-computed tomography 3amodels 3apolymers 3arats 0aAzidophenyl natural polymer 0aBone morphogenetic protein-2 0aPhotoimmobilization1 aSon, Tae-il,1 aLee, Tae-jin,1 aSong, Kwang-Sup0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Jan., v. 121 p.333-341dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.10.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003400145245012400179300001600303500001500319520169800334592002802032650001302060650001602073650001502089650001102104650001602115650001102131650001202142650002302154650001602177653001102193700002502204700002302229700002402252773012802276856008102404852000902485655001202494IND4469499520221117043304.0141112e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446949952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2012.01.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEscobedo-Avellaneda, Zamantha10aInclusion of the variability of model parameters on shelf-life estimations for low and intermediate moisture vegetables  ap. 364-370.  a2019-12-05  aShelf-life is the time period during which products retain market-acceptable quality while meeting legal and safety requirements. Deterministic models yield single value estimations of shelf-life typically based on average or worst-case values for input parameters. In deterministic calculations, considering the input parameter variability can be challenging. In this study, a Monte Carlo procedure and the G.A.B. model for moisture sorption isotherms were used to predict shelf-life frequency distributions for intermediate moisture (IM) tomato slices, and low moisture (LM) onion flakes and sliced green beans. End of shelf-life for IM tomato slices (initial awÂ =Â 0.8) was assumed to occur for a 10% moisture loss, and when aw changed from 0.25 to 0.4 for LM onion flakes and LM sliced green beans. The estimated shelf-life for tomato slices, LM onion flakes, and LM sliced green beans based on the deterministic approach was 243, 86, and 79 days, respectively. The Monte Carlo procedures yielded shelf-life frequency distributions with values ranging 181â366, 76â95, and 71â90 days, respectively. Products would fail before the deterministic shelf-life value with an unacceptably high probability of 51.6, 48.6, and 53.0%, respectively. If 5% is an acceptable probability that the actual shelf-life is shorter than specified, the estimated values would be 211, 81, and 73 days, respectively. Xâ and K were the most influential G.A.B parameters on the shelf-life of the three products. The package area, product amount, and water vapor transmission rate were high contributors and had the expected effect on shelf-life as demonstrated by deterministic estimations.  aPublisher supplied data 3atomatoes 3aprobability 3ashelf life 3amodels 3agreen beans 3aonions 3aslicing 3asorption isotherms 3awater vapor 0ainputs1 aVelázquez, Gonzalo,1 aTorres, J.

Historically, HIV vaccine regimens have been tested in NHPs by administering a single high dose of the challenge virus. More recently, evaluation of candidate HIV vaccines has entailed repeated lowâdose challenges, which more closely mimic typical exposure in natural transmission settings. In this article, we consider evaluation of the type and magnitude of vaccine efficacy from such experiments.

The first 30 NH2-terminal amino acids were determined by Edman degradation and showed significant sequence homology with intracellular pathogenesis-related (IPR) plant proteins and the Bet v 1 allergen family. The deduced amino acid sequence of cDNAs coding for T1, isolated by RT-PCR and 5' RACE-PCR, exhibited an average sequence identity of 40% with both IPR and Bet v 1-related allergens. T1 and all related proteins contained a p-loop motif typically found in nucleotide-binding proteins as the most conserved sequence feature. Northern blot analysis showed that cytokinin treatment of periwinkle callus induced T1 transcripts, whereas addition of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid inhibited this accumulation. Hybridization of genomic periwinkle DNA with the T1 cDNA suggested that the protein is encoded by a single-copy gene. Immunoblot studies with a panel of Bet v 1-specific antibodies and sera from Bet v 1 allergic individuals identified T1 as a protein that is immunologically distinct from the Bet v 1 allergen family and has no allergenic properties. 3ainterspecific variation 3atissue culture 3amessenger RNA 3aCatharanthus roseus 3acomplementary DNA 3azeatin 3aallergens 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogenesis-related proteins 3a2,4-D 3acallus 0aspecies differences 0acomparisons 0agenetic regulation 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/y10612 0aplant proteins1 aLaffer, S.1 aSchoentgen, F.1 aValenta, R.1 aChenieux, J.C.1 aRideau, M.1 aHamdi, S.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1998 Mar., v. 36, no. 5 p.791-798x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle04602naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002700110040001800137100001700155245009200172300001800264520221900282650002502501650003502526650001702561650001902578650002002597650002602617650002202643650001902665650001602684650001302700650001302713650003902726650003702765650001302802650001602815650002002831650002302851650002402874650001202898650001302910650004102923650002802964650007802992650002203070650003603092650002903128650003603157650001503193650002303208650000903231650002803240650007603268650002703344650002503371650003703396650003903433650005403472650004703526650003203573700001503605700001603620773007503636852000903711856007703720930003303797945001303830946001303843655001203856IND2056204220221119024105.0970328e19960604dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205620422DNAL7 a86795412pmid7 a10.1021/bi95180482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrack, P.R.10aActivation of the multicatalytic endopeptidase by oxidants. Effects on enzyme structure  ap. 7142-7149.  aIt is well established that the functional properties of proteins can be compromised by oxidative damage and, in vivo, proteins modified by oxidants are rapidly degraded. It was hypothesized that oxidants may also affect the ability of proteases to hydrolyze peptides and proteins. We therefore examined the effect of oxidants on the endopeptidase activities of the 650 kDa 20S proteasome or multicatalytic endopeptidase (MCP), which is thought to play a central role in nonlysosomal protein breakdown. Treatment of the MCP with the oxidant system, FeSO4-EDTA-ascorbate, stimulated the peptidase activities of the MCP while H2O2 treatment showed little or no stimulation. However, treatment of the MCP with FeSO4-EDTA-ascorbate or H2O2 stimulated proteinase activity by 480%- and 730%, respectively. An endogenous activator of the MCP, PA28, stimulated the acidic, basic, and hydrophobic peptidase activities of the MCP, but had no effect on proteolytic activity. Treatment of PA28 with oxidants in the presence of MCP or alone did not greatly affect PA28's ability to activate the peptidase activities of the MCP. Using nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, structural alterations in the enzyme which may be responsible for the activation of peptidase and protease activities following exposure to oxidants were investigated. Treatment of the MCP with reagents that activate proteolysis, including H2O2, as well as the serine protease inhibitor 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin and the cysteine protease inhibitor p-(chloromercuri)benzenesulfonic acid. all caused dissociation of the 650 kDa MCP. However, exposure to FeSO4-EDTA-ascorbate resulted in little or no dissociation of the complex. The MCP complex dissociated by p-(chloromercuri)benzenesulfonic acid could be reassociated upon treatment with the reducing agent dithiothreitol, but dithiothreitol failed to completely reassociate 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin- or H2O2-treated MCP. Therefore, chemical modification of the MCP can cause activation with varying degrees of complex dissociation. These results suggest that metabolites, such as reactive oxygen species, in addition to endogenous proteins, such as PA28, are capable of modulating MCP activity. 3abenzenesulfonic acid 3acysteine proteinase inhibitors 3adissociation 3adithiothreitol 3aenzyme activity 3afunctional properties 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrophobicity 3ametabolites 3aoxidants 3apeptides 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aproteins 3aproteolysis 3areducing agents 3aserine proteinases 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aChloromercuribenzoatesxpharmacology 2aCoumarinsxpharmacology 2aCysteine Endopeptidasesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aEnzyme Activation 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aErythrocytesxenzymology 2aHydrogen Peroxidexpharmacology 2aHydrolysis 2aIronxpharmacology 2aMale 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultienzyme Complexesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aOxidantsxpharmacology 2aPeptidesxmetabolism 2aProteasome Endopeptidase Complex 2aProtein Conformationxdrug effects 2aProteinsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aSerine Proteinase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2ap-Chloromercuribenzoic Acid1 aWaxman, L.1 aFagan, J.M.0 tBiochemistry.g1996 June 4, v. 35, no. 22 p.7142-7149x0006-29607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi95180483Available from publisher's Web site  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle02087naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148100001400166245010300180300001600283520090400299650001301203650002701216650002701243650001201270650002201282650002201304650001901326650002001345650001601365650001801381700001701399700001301416700002101429773007201450852000901522856008701531930003301618945001301651946001301664655001201677IND2321749420221119023851.0010626e200106  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232174942DNAL7 a189439442pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO.2001.91.6.5582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaky, J.10aSurface hydrophobicity and surface rigidity induce spore germination in Colletotrichum graminicola  ap. 558-564.  aWe investigated the relationship between physical characteristics of artificial surfaces, spore attachment, and spore germination in Colletotrichum graminicola. Surface hydrophobicity and surface rigidity were both signals for breaking dormancy and initiating spore germination, but spore attachment alone was not an important inducing signal. The presence of a carbon source overrode the necessity for a rigid, hydrophobic substrate for spore germination. Spore attachment was typically stronger to more hydrophobic surfaces, but certain hydrophilic surfaces also proved to be good substrates for spore attachment. In contrast to spore germination, appressorial induction was more dependent on attachment to a rigid substrate than it was on surface hydrophobicity. Appressoria were induced efficiently on hydrophilic surfaces, as long as there was significant conidial attachment to those surfaces. 3aZea mays 3aGlomerella graminicola 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aconidia 3aspore germination 3adormancy breaking 3ahydrophobicity 3asurface tension 3aappressoria 3abinding sites1 aAnderson, K.1 aMoss, M.1 aVaillancourt, L.0 tPhytopathology.g2001 June, v. 91, no. 6 p.558-564x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO.2001.91.6.5583Available from publisher's Web site  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03740naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245017900146300001600325500001500341520153800356650001801894650002201912650002001934650002501954650002001979650002501999650001602024650001802040650002402058650001802082650002302100650003402123650001802157650004602175650003802221650006602259650003002325650002802355650002102383650002802404650003202432650006702464650001802531650002302549650003402572650003502606650003902641653002802680653001902708653001102727653002302738653003802761700001502799700001502814700001902829700001102848700001902859700001702878773008102895852000902976930003302985945001303018946001103031655001203042IND2163828420221119023822.0980903e199712  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216382842DNAL7 a94266032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchultz, C.J.10aMolecular characterisation of a cDNA sequence encoding the backbone of a style-specific 120 kDa glycoprotein which has features of both extensins and arabinogalactan proteins  ap. 833-845.  a2019-12-05  aNicotiana alata has a style-specific hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein (the 120 kDa glycoprotein) which has properties of both extensins and AGPs. [19, 20]. The 120 kDa glycoprotein is a soluble component in the extracellular matrix of the transmitting tract of styles where it accounts for ca. 9% of the total buffer-soluble protein. Here we describe the molecular cloning of a cDNA representing the gene NaPRP5 which encodes the backbone of the 120 kDa glycoprotein. Expression of mRNA is restricted to styles, consistent with observations on the distribution of the 120 kDa glycoprotein. Levels of accumulation of the transcript encoding the 120 kDa protein backbone are not altered significantly by pollination with either compatible or incompatible pollen. The protein backbone of the 120 kDa glycoprotein, as predicted by the cDNA sequence, is composed of three distinct domains. The sequence of these domains, together with linkage analysis of the carbohydrate component of the 120 kDa glycoprotein, allows predictions of the likely distribution of substituent glycosyl chains along the protein backbone. The similarity of the C-terminal domains of the 120 kDa glycoprotein and GaRSGP, the galactose-rich style glycoprotein of N. alata, is consistent with the two molecules sharing a common antigenic domain in their backbones [31]. The sharing of domains between distinct hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins suggests that identification of a glycoprotein of this class solely by its protein or carbohydrate epitope is not valid. 3amessenger RNA 3acomplementary DNA 3aNicotiana alata 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3anucleotide sequences 3apollination 3aglycoproteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxchemistry 2aFertilization 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGlycoproteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aHydroxyprolinexchemistry 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aMucoproteinsxchemistry 2aOrgan Specificityxgenetics 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aPlants, Toxic 2aPollenxphysiology 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aTranscription, Geneticxphysiology 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u88587 0astyles 0achemical structure 0ahydroxyproline rich glycoproteins1 aHauser, K.1 aLind, J.L.1 aAtkinson, A.H.1 aPu, Z.1 aAnderson, M.A.1 aClarke, A.E.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1997 Dec., v. 35, no. 6 p.833-845x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03754naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245013200143300001600275500001500291520162200306650002501928650001801953650002101971650001001992650001402002650001202016650002102028650002502049650001502074650002002089650001102109650001902120650002202139650002102161650001202182650001002194650001002204650001902214650002402233650001202257650003902269650001602308650003802324650001702362650001102379650001002390650002802400650002102428650005402449650001402503650004402517650003102561650004902592653001902641653001902660653002802679653001702707653000902724653004002733653001902773653001502792653002502807700001702832773008102849852000902930930003302939945001302972946001102985655001202996IND2163829720221119023539.0980903e199712  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216382972DNAL7 a94266072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChou, I.T.10aCharacterization of the cyclophilin gene family of Arabidopsis thaliana and phylogenetic analysis of known cyclophilin proteins  ap. 873-892.  a2019-12-05  aWe have isolated four members of the Arabidopsis cyclophilin (CyP) gene family, designated ROC1 to ROC4 (rotamase CyP). Deduced peptides of ROC1, 2 and 3 are 75% to 91% identical to Brassica napus cytosolic CyP, contain no leader peptides and include a conserved seven amino-acid insertion relative to mammalian cytosolic CyPs. Two other Arabidopsis CyPs, ROC5 (43H1; ATCYP1) and ROC6 (ATCYP2), share these features, ROC1, ROC2, ROC3 and ROC5 are expressed in all tested organs of light-grown plants. ROC2 and ROC5 show elevated expression in flowers. Expression of ROC1, ROC2, and ROC3 decreases in darkness and these genes also exhibit small elevations in expression upon wounding. The five Arabidopsis genes encoding putative cytosolic CyPs (ROC1, 2, 3, 5 and 6) contain no introns. In contrast, ROC4, which encodes a chloroplast stromal CyP, is interrupted by six introns. ROC4 is not expressed in roots, and is strongly induced by light. Phylogenetic trees of all known CyPs and CyP-related proteins provide evidence of possible horizontal transfer of CyP genes between prokaryotes and eukaryotes and of a possible polyphyletic origin of these proteins within eukaryotes. These trees also show significant grouping of eukaryotic CyPs on the basis of subcellular localization and structure. Mitochondrial CyPs are closely related to cytosolic CyPs of the source organism, but endoplasmic reticulum CyPs form separate clades. Known plant CyPs fall into three clades, one including the majority of higher-plant cytosolic CyPs, one including only ROC2 and a related rice CyP, and one including only chloroplast CyPs. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amessenger RNA 3astructural genes 3astems 3aphylogeny 3aflowers 3abinding proteins 3aamino acid sequences 3aisomerases 3agene expression 3aleaves 3aabiotic stress 3agenetic variation 3amultigene family 3aintrons 3aroots 3alight 3aplant proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aGene Dosage 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aHumans 2aLight 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aPeptidylprolyl Isomerasexbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aStress, Physiologicalxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0agenbank/u40400 0agenbank/u40399 0amolecular sequence data 0arotamase cyp 0adark 0apeptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase 0agenbank/u42724 0ainsertions 0anucleotide sequences1 aGasser, C.S.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1997 Dec., v. 35, no. 6 p.873-892x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02593naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245014800143300001600291520067700307650002200984650002201006650001801028650001001046650003501056650002001091650002001111650001201131650001801143650001201161650002101173650001301194650002501207650001801232650001101250650002501261650002701286650002001313650004401333650003801377650004001415650001501455650003301470650001801503650003301521650003101554650004001585650005701625653001601682653002401698700001501722700001501737700001601752700001501768700001301783773008101796852000901877930003301886945001301919946001101932655001201943IND2163838220221119023654.0980903e199712  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216383822DNAL7 a94266182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, H.10aMorphological changes and hypomethylation of DNA in transgenic tobacco expressing antisense RNA of the S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase gene  ap. 981-986.  aS-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) is a key enzyme in the regulation of intracellular methylation reactions. To investigate the role of SAHH in methylation reactions and morphogenesis in planta, we have made transgenic plants expressing antisense RNA of tobacco SAHH. The transgenic plants displayed distinct morphological changes including a floral homeotic change. We hypothesized that the changes were caused by increased levels of cytokinin. In those transgenic plants, we observed that a repetitive DNA sequence appeared less methylated than controls. We speculated that altered gene expressions by the hypomethylation of DNA might be involved in the changes. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3atransgenic plants 3aantisense RNA 3agenes 3amethionine adenosyltransferase 3agene expression 3aDNA methylation 3aflowers 3amorphogenesis 3astamens 3aplant morphology 3adwarfing 3aabnormal development 3amessenger RNA 3aleaves 3arepetitive sequences 2aAdenosylhomocysteinase 2aDNA Methylation 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aHydrolasesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aHydrolysis 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPlants, Toxic 2aRNA, Antisensexbiosynthesis 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aRNA, Plantxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aTobaccoxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 0asegregation 0adna hypomethylation1 aMasuta, C.1 aUehara, K.1 aKataoka, J.1 aKoiwai, A.1 aNoma, M.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1997 Dec., v. 35, no. 6 p.981-986x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01903naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245014900126300001600275520083700291650001301128650001901141650001401160650001101174650001601185650002001201650002001221650001901241650001801260650001901278650001301297653001401310700001601324700001901340773009201359852000901451930003301460945001301493946001101506655001201517IND2039081120221119023747.0940425e199310  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203908112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBouvier, L.10aTwo methods of haploidization in pear, Pyrus communis L.: greenhouse seedling selection and in situ parthenogenesis induced by irradiated pollen  ap. 229-232.  aSeedlings of 12 crosses involving pear varieties or hybrids were observed for the presence of haploid plants.

Numerous diploid plants with the maternal phenotype were also obtained, and their genetic origin was subsequently studied by means of isozyme analysis. 3acrossing 3aPyrus communis 3aseedlings 3apollen 3airradiation 3agamma radiation 3aparthenogenesis 3aembryo (plant) 3aembryogenesis 3aembryo culture 3ahaploidy 0aselection1 aZhang, Y.X.1 aLespinasse, Y.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1993 Oct., v. 87, no. 1/2 p.229-232x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03274naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245007000166300001600236500001500252520164300267650001601910650002501926650001601951650002301967650003201990650001602022650002602038650001802064650001802082650001802100650002102118650001902139650001102158650002102169650001502190650001002205650002002215650002002235650001202255651001202267653002602279653001302305653001702318653001802335653002002353653001302373700002102386700002002407773013102427852000902558856008502567930003302652946001102685655001202696IND4401207920221119023900.0080210e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440120792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10342-005-0086-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRötzer, Thomas 10aEffects of environmental changes on the vitality of forest stands  ap. 349-362.  a2019-12-04  aUsing the physiological single tree growth model BALANCE, vitality of forest stands was simulated in dependence of the site-related factors, climate and stand structure. At six level II plots in southern Germany with the main tree species beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), oak (Quercus robur L.), spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.), and pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), simulated results were compared to measured values (soil water content, bud burst and leaf colouring, diameter at breast height, tree height and crown density) in order to validate the model. Sensitivity tests were done to examine the influence and the interactions of the environmental parameters. The validation results show that BALANCE is capable of realistically simulating the growth and vitality of forest stands for central European regions for medium term time spans (several years). The validation of the water balance module produces mean absolute errors based on field capacity between 2.7 and 6.9% in dependence of sites and forest stands. Senescence of foliage as well as crown density is reproduced with a correlation coefficient of 0.70 compared to measurements. Differences between measured and simulated diameter values were smaller than 1% for spruce and smaller than 6.5% for beech after 7 years of simulation, and smaller than 1% for oak after 8 years of simulation. On the other hand, the simulations for pine trees conform less with the measurements (difference: 22.6% after 8 years). The sensitivity of the model on environmental changes and on combinations of these parameters could be demonstrated. The responses of the forest stands were quite different. 3atree growth 3aenvironmental models 3acorrelation 3asoil water content 3atree and stand measurements 3aPicea abies 3aenvironmental factors 3aforest stands 3aQuercus robur 3agrowth models 3aPinus sylvestris 3afield capacity 3aleaves 3amodel validation 3asoil water 3atrees 3aFagus sylvatica 3astand structure 3aclimate 3aGermany 0aTree growth modelling 0aVitality 0aForest stand 0awater balance 0aCrown condition 0aLevel II1 aGrote, Rüdiger 1 aPretzsch, Hans 0 tEuropean journal of forest research.g2005 Dec., v. 124, no. 4 p.349-362dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1612-46697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10342-005-0086-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20080210b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02787naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245014500144300001800289500001500307520121600322650001301538650001901551650001301570650002301583650001901606650001001625650001301635650002001648650001201668650001201680650003601692650004201728650003801770650001301808650003501821650001101856650002301867650000901890650004701899653001301946653002501959653002801984653002002012653002002032700001602052700001402068700002102082773007502103852000902178939003302187946001302220655001202233IND9200547220221119023905.0920211e199108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920054722DNAL7 a16564182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, E.J.14aThe influence of ev6 on the immune response to avian leukosis virus infection in rapid-feathering progeny of slow- and rapid-feathering dams  ap. 1673-1678.  a2019-12-04  aEndogenous virus (EV) locus ev6 encodes only virus envelope glycoprotein. The influence of ev6 on the immune response to contact infection with hatchmates infected with avian leukosis virus (ALV) was compared in replicate hatches. The ALV Subgroup E-resistant, rapid-feathering (RF) female chickens produced by slow-feathering (SF) and RF dams with and without ev6 were exposed at hatch to hatchmates infected with ALV Subgroup A (Strain RPL-40). The RPL-40 viremia, shedding, and virus neutralizing antibodies were measured among pullets from two hatches at 22 wk of age. Although significant (P<.05), difference between hatches in the immune response to contact infection were noted among ev6+ pullets, significantly fewer ev6+ pullets seroconverted than their ev6- hatchmates. At 22 wk of age, significantly more lymphomas were also found among ev6+ pullets than among ev6- hatchmates. In flocks wherein both parents add progeny were homozygous resistant to Subgroup E virus, there was no detrimental maternal effect on RF progeny from SF dams that carried ev21. These results also confirm that selection for genetic cellular resistance to Subgroup E ALV infection eliminates congenital transmission of EV21. 3achickens 3aavian leukosis 3alymphoma 3agenetic resistance 3adams (mothers) 3agenes 3agenotype 3aimmune response 3aprogeny 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralxbiosynthesis 2aAvian Leukosisxgeneticsximmunology. 2aAvian Leukosis Virusximmunology. 2aChickens 2aFeathersxgrowth & development 2aFemale 2aImmunity, Cellular 2aMale 2aViremiaxgeneticsximmunologyxveterinary. 0aimmunity 0acongenital infection 0anatural immunotolerance 0afeathering rate 0aavian oncovirus1 aFadly, A.M.1 aLevin, I.1 aCrittenden, L.B.0 tPoultry science.g1991 Aug., v. 70, no. 8 p.1673-1678x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02886naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245010400145300001800249500001500267520058200282650002500864650001800889650002100907650002200928650002400950650001400974650002500988650002001013650002201033650001501055650001101070650002401081650003901105650001801144650002301162650002301185650004901208650004401257650003801301650001701339650001101356650002401367650004501391650002801436650006701464650003001531650008501561650007701646650003301723650002301756650003401779653002301813653004401836653002801880653001301908653002501921653002101946700001701967700001401984700001701998773008302015852000902098930003302107945001302140946001102153655001202164IND2163841120221119023642.0980903e199712  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216384112DNAL7 a94266292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorris, P.C.10aCloning and characterisation of MEK1, an Arabidopsis gene encoding a homologue of MAP kinase kinase  ap. 1057-1064.  a2019-12-05  aWe report the cloning of a cDNA for MEK1, an Arabidopsis thaliana gene encoding a homologue of MAP kinase kinase (MEK).

Analysis of their sequences reveals some peculiar features, suggesting the presence of post-transcriptional regulation events: an upstream ORF, two unspliced introns and a putative leucine zipper in the ORF coded by the unspliced RNA. Transient expression in protoplasts indicates that the upstream ORF inhibits expression of a downstream coding sequence. Finally, we demonstrated that anoxia, in roots, increases the ratio between the spliced and the unspliced mRNA and affects the expression of other myb-related genes. 3atranscription factors 3acoleoptiles 3amessenger RNA 3aalternative splicing 3aprotoplasts 3aregulator genes 3acomplementary DNA 3aOryza sativa 3agene interaction 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3ahypoxia 3aDNA-binding domains 3aintrons 3aroots 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOryzaxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPlant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aTranscription Factorsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxphysiology. 0agenbank/x96749 0aupstream open reading frame 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x89605 0agenbank/x96750 0anucleotide sequences1 aSolinas, G.1 aValle, G.1 aGiovinazzo, G.1 aCoraggio, I.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1997 Dec., v. 35, no. 6 p.1003-1008x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03537naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245015500142300001600297500001500313520207100328650000902399650001602408650001502424650002302439650001802462650001202480650002002492650002102512650001602533650001802549650001402567650002302581650001202604650000902616650002102625650001302646650001602659650003602675650001102711650000902722650003402731650001102765650001302776650001402789650001602803653002002819700001602839773007302855852000902928939003302937946001302970655001202983IND9103416220221119023656.0910830e199102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910341622DNAL7 a20278272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, H.Y.10aBeak trimming effects on behavior patterns, fearfulness, feathering, and mortality, among three stocks of white Leghorn pullets in cages or floor pens  ap. 211-221.  a2019-12-04  aWhite Leghorn pullets of the Y1, Y2, and North Central Randombred (NCR) experimental stocks were used. Half of the birds of each stock had half of the upper and less of the lower mandible removed at 4 wk of age by making a V-shaped cut as viewed from the side (BT), whereas the other half retained their beaks intact (IN). Pullets were moved from growing pens to a layer house at 18 wk of age. Seventy-two cages and 30 floor pens were filled with 6 and 20 birds per unit, respectively. Pullets within a cage or floor pen were all of the same genetic stock and beak treatment. All measurements were performed within 10 wk after housing, except for mortality in cages. When kept in cages, genetic stocks did not show behavioral differences. However, in floor pens, stock differences were detected in feeding, crouching, and nonaggressive pecking. When kept in cages, the stocks also differed in 24-wk body weight, weight gain from 18 to 24 wk, and certain measures of fearfulness in both cages and pens, and in feather condition at 21 and 22 wk. Mortality from cannibalism and hen-days survival of caged IN pullets differed among genetic stocks. Mortality from cannibalism was absent among pullets kept in experimental floor pens. In cages, BT pullets were less active, gained less weight, and had lower incidence of cannibalism than IN pullets. Also, BT pullets were less nervous and had better feather condition than IN pullets. However, trimming beaks to prevent cannibalism was less effective in NCR pullets than in Y1 or Y2 pullets. In floor pens, BT pullets showed less activity and reduce feeding frequency and less fearfulness as indicated by duration of induced tonic immobility. Agonistic behaviors were not different between BT and IN pullets. From these results, beak trimming could be interpreted as having either stressful or stress-alleviating effects, depending on the criteria used. However, proper beak trimming appears beneficial when cannibalistic pecking is likely to be a problem. The relative benefits of beak trimming vary among genetic stocks. 3abeak 3abody weight 3aaggression 3astrain differences 3abattery cages 3apullets 3aliveweight gain 3afeeding behavior 3afearfulness 3abeak trimming 3amortality 2aAgonistic Behavior 2aAnimals 2aBeak 2aBehavior, Animal 2aBreeding 2aCannibalism 2aChickensxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aEating 2aFear 2aFeathersxanatomy & histology 2aFemale 2aGrooming 2aMortality 2aWeight Gain 0apoultry housing1 aCraig, J.V.0 tPoultry science.g1991 Feb., v. 70, no. 2 p.211-221x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02030naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245013700130300001600267520114600283650002101429650001101450650001401461650002201475650000901497650002401506650001701530700001601547700002501563773007301588852000901661939003301670946001301703655001201716IND9103416520221119023241.0910830e199102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910341652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaque, A.K.M.A.10aExtrusion processing of broiler starter diets containing ground whole hens, poultry by-product meal, feather meal or ground feathers  ap. 234-240.  aTwo experiments were conducted to evaluate the use of ground whole hens in broiler starting diets processed through an extruder. In both experiments, the extruded whole hen diet improved growth rate and feed conversion in broiler chicks when compared with the unextruded corn-soybean meal diet. There were no differences (P less than or equal to .05) in body weight, feed consumption, or feed conversion performance of chicks fed diets in either the extruded or unextruded form. No microorganism colonies were found, using total aerobic plate count, when feed was extruded at 132 or 140 C. These results demonstrate that extrusion technology can be used to process diets containing freshly ground whole hens to produce a nutritionally adequate broiler diet and that the whole hens can be included at 9.3% (dry basis) in a broiler diet. Considerable variation was found for DM CP, and crude fat percentages among samples of both culled and dead hens collected from a commercial laying operation. The magnitude of this variation emphasizes the need to evaluate critically the chemical composition of hens if they are to be used as a feedstuff. 3abroiler chickens 3achicks 3aextrusion 3aforage evaluation 3ahens 3acarcass composition 3afeather meal1 aLyons, J.J.1 aVandepopuliere, J.M.0 tPoultry science.g1991 Feb., v. 70, no. 2 p.234-240x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02623naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245009700147300001600244500001500260520130700275650001601582650001601598650001501614650001601629650002901645650001601674650002001690650002401710650001101734650001601745650001201761650002301773650001601796650004801812650003101860650001101891650002301902650002601925653002801951700001801979700001601997773007302013852000902086939003302095946001302128655001202141IND9101922220221119023110.0910424e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910192222DNAL7 a20473522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFritsche, K.L.10aEffect of dietary fat source on antibody production and lymphocyte proliferation in chickens  ap. 611-617.  a2019-12-04  aThe purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of fat source on the immune response of chickens. One-day-old pullets were fed corn and soybean meal-based diets containing 7% by weight one of the following fat sources: lard, corn oil canola oil, linseed oil (LO), or fish oil (FO). After being fed experimental diets for 3 wk, humoral and cellular immune responses were assessed. Chicks were injected with SRBC and antibody titers were measured, 7 days later, by hemagglutination. Concanavalin A (Con A), pokeweed mitogen (PWM), or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated proliferation of splenocytes was assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation. Results demonstrated that antibody titers in FO-fed chicks were higher (P<.005) compared with titers in chicks fed the other fat sources. The proliferative response to Con A and PWM were 30 to 50% lower (P<.13 and P<.05, respectively) in chicks fed the oils rich in omega-3 fatty acids, LO and FO. The response to LPS was poor. The effect of dietary fats source on lymphocyte proliferation was completely abrogated when autologous chicken serum was excluded from the culture medium. Fat source also seemed to affect growth and feed intake of the chickens. In conclusion, dietary fat source has a significant impact on the immune response of chickens. 3adietary fat 3abody weight 3aantibodies 3alymphocytes 3alymphocyte proliferation 3afeed intake 3aimmune response 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3achicks 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aAntibody Formation 2aBody Weight 2aChickensxgrowth & developmentximmunology. 2aDietary Fatsxpharmacology 2aFemale 2aImmunity, Cellular 2aLymphocyte Activation 0aunsaturated fatty acids1 aCassity, N.A.1 aHuang, S.C.0 tPoultry science.g1991 Mar., v. 70, no. 3 p.611-617x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02315naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245014500132300001600277500001500293520120100308650002401509650002501533650002301558650002201581650002301603650001901626650002201645650001701667650001101684653001401695653001301709700001901722700001401741700002001755773010101775852000901876939003301885946001101918655001201929IND9305110220221119023149.0930830e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930511022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWijdeveld, M.M.G.10aAccumulation of viral 126 kDa protein and symptom expression in tobacco systemically infected with different strains of tobacco mosaic virus  ap. 437-451.  a2019-12-04  aTobacco mosaic virus strains W U1, flavum, V4 and masked, which induce symptoms in tobacco ranging from a severe mosaic to virtually no reaction, were used to study relationships between accumulation of viral 126 kDa protein, X-body formation and symptom expression. The RNAs of all strains encode proteins of similar sizes to those of the common strain W U1. Antisera against the coat and 126 kDa proteins of W U1 recognized corresponding proteins of the other three strains. All virus strains accumulated to substantial levels in systemically infected leaves, as evidenced by the presence of coat protein in virus crystals. The 126 kDa protein was localized in large X-bodies associated with nuclei in W U1- and flavum-infected tissue, but in tiny X-bodies, free in the cytoplasm, in masked-infected plants. Neither X-bodies, nor 126 kDa proteins were observed in V4-infected tissue. Since in vitro synthesized 126 kDa protein from V4 was not more sensitive to proteolysis than that from W U1 or flavum, accumulation of the protein in X-bodies in the latter seems to result from excess synthesis. The possibility that the X-bodies are involved in the expression of severe symptoms is discussed. 3aNicotiana glutinosa 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3anuclear inclusions 3aprotein synthesis 3astrain differences 3aviral proteins 3aNicotiana tabacum 3apathogenesis 3aleaves 0aNicotiana 0ax-bodies1 aGoldbach, R.W.1 aMeurs, C.1 aLoon, L.C. van.0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g1992 Dec., v. 41, no. 6 p.437-451x0885-57657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02876naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245011200145300001800257520124500275650002501520650001501545650002001560650001801580650002001598650001401618650001201632650001601644650001601660650001101676650002501687650003601712650007501748650001601823650001601839650001301855650004401868650002901912650001301941650004501954650002501999650003002024650003002054650002902084650002502113653001602138700001902154773008302173852000902256930003302265945001302298946001102311655001202322IND2196941620221119023138.0990211e199808  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219694162DNAL7 a97000762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWetzel, C.M.10aRegulation of phytoene desaturase expression is independent of leaf pigment content in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 1045-1053.  aSynthesis of carotenoids in higher plants occurs in the plastids, but all of the required enzymes are coded for in the nuclear genome and are post-transcriptionally imported into the plastid compartment. Regulation of the synthesis of the enzymes is poorly understood. The two-step desaturation of phytoene to zeta-carotene, carried out by the enzyme phytoene desaturase (PDS), is one of the earliest steps in the pathway and has been studied in several systems. Previous analyses of phytoene-accumulating tissue suggested that there may be feedback regulation of PDS gene transcription, with higher expression in white tissue. To investigate this regulation further, we examined phytoene-accumulating tissue in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Two types of phytoene-accumulating tissue were studied: Norflurazon-bleached plants and white sectors from the immutans variegation mutant. Based on competitive RT-PCR measurements of PDS mRNA and immunochemical detection of PDS protein, we determined that there is no significant induction of PDS gene expression specific to white tissue, indicating that PDS expression is independent of the pigment status of the cells. Reasons why our results differ from those in other systems are discussed. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aoxygenases 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3aprotein content 3aseedlings 3amutants 3acarotenoids 3anorflurazon 3aleaves 3aimmunohistochemistry 3achemical constituents of plants 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aCarotenoids 2aChlorophyll 2aFeedback 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aHerbicidesxpharmacology 2aMutation 2aOxidoreductasesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aPigments, Biological 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPyridazinesxpharmacology 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aRNA, Plantxanalysis 0avariegation1 aRodermel, S.R.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1998 Aug., v. 37, no. 6 p.1045-1053x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02615naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002000149245010600169300001800275520081600293650003001109650001901139650001601158650002001174650001601194650002501210650002501235650002401260650005301284650002401337650001201361650001801373650002501391650002101416650003801437650001801475650001501493650002801508650001801536650001801554650003101572650004301603650003601646650001501682650005301697653002801750653001901778653003301797653002601830700001501856700001701871773007201888852000901960939003301969946001102002655001202013IND9305109420221119022946.0930830e199307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930510942DNAL7 a83350092pmid7 aPMC4135532pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimon-Mateo, C.10aPolyprotein processing in African swine fever virus; a novel gene expression strategy for a DNA virus  ap. 2977-2987.  aThis report shows that African swine fever virus (ASFV)--a large DNA-containing virus - synthesizes a polyprotein to produce several of its structural proteins. By immunoprecipitation analysis, we have found that ASFV polyprotein is a 220 kDa myristoylated polypeptide (pp220) which, after proteolytic processing, gives rise to four major structural proteins: p150, p37, p34 and p14. Processing of the ASFV polyprotein takes place at the consensus sequence Gly-Gly-X and occurs through an ordered cascade of proteolytic cleavages. So far, polyprotein processing as a mechanism of gene expression had been found only in positive-strand RNA viruses and retroviruses. According to the results presented here, ASFV is the first example of a DNA virus that synthesizes a polyprotein as a strategy of gene expression. 3aAfrican swine fever virus 3aviral proteins 3aproteolysis 3agene expression 3aproteinases 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3astructural proteins 2aAfrican Swine Fever Virusxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBiological Evolution 2aDNA, Recombinant 2aGene Expression Regulation, Viral 2aGenome, Viral 2aHydrolysis 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMorphogenesis 2aMyristic Acid 2aMyristic Acidsxmetabolism 2aProtein Processing, Post-Translational 2aProteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aVero Cells 2aViral Structural Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/z22777 0apost translation proteolysis 0aprotelytic processing1 aAndres, G.1 aViñuela, E.0 tEMBO journal.g1993 July, v. 12, no. 7 p.2977-2987x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04062naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245014900129300001600278500001500294520255400309650003202863650002002895650003602915650001702951650003702968650002203005650002203027650001703049650001103066650001603077650001403093650002303107653003703130653002203167653002203189653001403211653001503225653002103240653003503261653003603296653001903332700001603351700001803367700001703385773010103402852000903503939003303512946001103545655001203556IND9305109920221119023133.0930830e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930510992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarver, T.L.W.10aEffects of PAL inhibitor, AOPP, on oat, barley and wheat cell responses to appropriate and inappropriate formae specials of Erysiphe graminis DC  ap. 397-409.  a2019-12-04  aSeedling leaves of oat cv. Selma, barley cv. Golden Promise and wheat cv. Cerco, were excised and infused either with water or with 10(-3) M alpha-aminooxy-beta-phenylpropionic acid (AOPP), a specific inhibitor of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL). Seedling leaves of the three cereal species from both treatments were inoculated with an isolate of Erysiphe graminis from each of the formae speciales avenae, hordei and tritici. In all appropriate host-parasite combinations, AOPP treatment decreased the percentage of primary germ tubes and appressoria associated with localized autofluorescent host cell responses, and increased the percentage of appressoria forming haustoria, i.e. increased the susceptibility of epidermal cells to haustorium formation. Thus, autofluorogens appear to be phenolic compounds associated with resistance to infection of these cereal species by their appropriate forma speciales of E. graminis. AOPP treatment also decreased the percentage of host cells which showed whole-cell autofluorescence, indicating cell death, as a result of attack by an appropriate fungal isolate. In appropriate combinations, whole-cell autofluorescence was most common in the barley f. sp. hordei combination, where decreased epidermal cell death due to AOPP treatment may have contributed to increased rates of haustorium formation. For appropriate combinations this is the first report showing AOPP-associated increase in quantitative susceptibility (reduction in background resistance) for barley and wheat. In inappropriate combinations, AOPP treatment decreased the percentage of primary germ tube contact sites associated with localized autofluorescence, but did not decrease the percentage of appressoria associated with localized autofluorescence. In only one of six inappropriate combinations (oat f. sp. tritici) did AOPP treatment increase rates of haustorium formation above the very low levels seen in all inappropriate host-parasite combinations in water-treated leaves. The failure of AOPP to suppress localized autofluorescent responses to fungal appressoria and to increase susceptibility, in most inappropriate host-parasite combinations suggests that resistance factors operate in inappropriate combinations which are not present in appropriate combinations. Although AOPP treatment decreased the relatively high percentages of dead, autofluorescent cells resulting from inappropriate interactions, decreased cell death was not accompanied by increased haustorium formation, i.e. cell susceptibility was not increased. 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3aHordeum vulgare 3aBlumeria graminis f. sp. hordei 3afluorescence 3aBlumeria graminis f. sp. tritici 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aTriticum aestivum 3aAvena sativa 3aleaves 3aappressoria 3ainfection 3aphenolic compounds 0aErysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici 0aBlumeria graminis 0aErysiphe graminis 0ahaustoria 0agerm tubes 0aautofluorescence 0aerysiphe graminis f.sp. avenae 0aErysiphe graminis f. sp. hordei 0afungal anatomy1 aZeyen, R.J.1 aRobbins, M.P.1 aDearne, G.A.0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g1992 Dec., v. 41, no. 6 p.397-409x0885-57657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02813naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245007800166300001800244520110000262650002701362650000801389650002501397650001201422650002201434650001601456650002301472650002201495650002701517650003201544650001801576650002501594650002801619650001301647650003001660650002801690650001801718650004401736650001901780650002201799650002601821653001401847653002301861653001601884653002701900653003201927653002601959653001901985653001802004700001702022700001702039700001802056773007202074852000902146939003302155946001102188655001202199IND9305109320221119023211.0930830e199307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930510932DNAL7 a76875432pmid7 aPMC4135522pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobaglia, C.10aEvolution and replication of tobacco ringspot virus satellite RNA mutants  ap. 2969-2976.  aThe replication properties of linker insertion-deletion mutants of tobacco ringspot virus satellite RNA have been studied by amplification in plants infected with the helper virus. Sequence analysis of the cDNAs corresponding to the replicated forms shows that only one of the original mutated molecules replicates unaltered, and in general new variants accumulate. Depending on the location of the original mutation three types of sequence modifications were observed: (i) deletion of the mutated region followed by sequence duplication, (ii) sequence duplication and deletion outside of the mutated region and (iii) limited rearrangements at the site of mutation. The mutant that replicates without sequence changes accumulates linear multimeric forms suggesting that self-cleavage is affected although the sequence alteration does not involve the hammerhead catalytic domain. Alternative RNA conformations are likely to play a role in the origin of this phenotype and in the formation of sequence duplications. These results demonstrate the great structural flexibility of this satellite RNA. 3aTobacco ringspot virus 3aRNA 3anucleotide sequences 3amutants 3acomplementary DNA 3amutagenesis 3achemical reactions 3aVigna unguiculata 3amolecular conformation 3aprotein secondary structure 2aBase Sequence 2aBiological Evolution 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aPlant Virusesxgenetics 2aPlants, Toxic 2aRNAxbiosynthesisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aRNA, Satellite 2aSequence Deletion 2aTobaccoxmicrobiology 0adeletions 0aincomplete viruses 0areplication 0asequence rearrangement 0ahammerhead catalytic domain 0asequence modification 0ahelper viruses 0aself cleavage1 aBruening, G.1 aHaseloff, J.1 aGerlach, W.L.0 tEMBO journal.g1993 July, v. 12, no. 7 p.2969-2976x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02868naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001200149245005900161300001800220520130000238650002801538650002501566650001201591650002501603650002001628650002901648650002101677650002401698650001801722650002401740650001201764650001801776650003301794650001501827650002001842650002501862650004201887650002801929650003301957650004801990650002702038653001502065653002302080653002302103653001502126653003102141700001702172773007202189852000902261939003302270946001102303655001202314IND9305108320221119023227.0930830e199307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930510832DNAL7 a83349912pmid7 aPMC4135232pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, K.10aFunctional domains of the Drosophila Engrailed protein  ap. 2723-2733.  aWe have studied the transcriptional activity of the Drosophila homeodomain protein Engrailed (En) by using a transient expression assay employing Schneider L2 cells. En was found to very strongly repress promoters activated by a variety of different activator proteins. However, unlike another Drosophila homeodomain-containing repressor, Even-skipped (Eve), En was unable to repress the activity of several basal promoters in the absence of activator expression. These findings indicate that En is a specific repressor of activated transcription, and suggest that En may repress transcription by a different mechanism than Eve, perhaps by interfering with interactions between transcriptional activators and the general transcription machinery. By analyzing the properties of a variety of En mutants, we identified a minimal repression domain composed of 55 residues, which can function when fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain. Like repression domains identified in the Drosophila repressors Eve and Kruppel, the En repression domain is rich in alanine residues (26%), but unlike these other domains, is moderately charged (six arginine and three glutamic acid residues). Separate regions of En that may in some circumstances function in transcriptional activation were also identified. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aDNA-binding proteins 3amutants 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3atranscription (genetics) 3apromoter regions 3aDNA-binding domains 3abinding sites 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBinding Sites 2aDNA, Recombinantxmetabolism 2aDrosophila 2aFungal Proteins 2aHomeodomain Proteins 2aInsect Hormonesxchemistryxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aTrans-Activatorsxphysiology 2aTranscription Factorsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aTranscription, Genetic 0ainhibition 0agenetic regulation 0arepression domains 0aen protein 0atranscriptional activators1 aManley, J.L.0 tEMBO journal.g1993 July, v. 12, no. 7 p.2723-2733x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04102naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001900149245016400168300001800332500001500350520223600365650001202601650001302613650002202626650002102648650001502669650001602684650003002700650002502730650001202755650002502767650002002792650002402812650001802836650003602854650001502890650002402905650002302929650002102952650004302973650001803016650001203034650002803046650001303074650005703087650003903144650003403183653001803217653002803235653001503263653001503278700001403293700001603307700001603323773007203339852000903411939003303420946001103453655001203464IND9305108220221119023318.0930830e199307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930510822DNAL7 a83349882pmid7 aPMC4135182pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFankhauser, C.14aThe S. pombe cdc16 gene is required both for maintenance of p34cdc2 kinase activity and regulation of septum formation: a link between mitosis and cytokinesis?  ap. 2697-2704.  a2019-12-04  aIn the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, septum formation and cytokinesis are dependent upon the initiation, though not the completion of mitosis. A number of cell cycle mutants which show phenotypes consistent with a defect in the regulation of septum formation have been isolated. A mutation in the S. pombe cdc16 gene leads to the formation of multiple without cytokinesis, suggesting that the normal mechanisms that limit the cell to the formation of a single septum in each cycle do not operate. Mutations in the S. pombe early septation mutants cdc7, cdc11, cdc14 and cdc15 lead to the formation of elongated, multinucleate cells, as a result of S phase and mitosis continuing in the absence of cytokinesis. This suggests that in these cells, the normal mechanisms which initiate cytokinesis are defective and that they are unable to respond to this by preventing further nuclear cycles. Genetic analysis has implied that the products of some of these genes may interact with that of the cdc16 gene. To understand how the processes of septation and cytokinesis are regulated and coordinated with mitosis we are studying the early septation mutants and cdc16. In this paper, we present the cloning and analysis of the cdc16 gene. Deletion of the gene shows that it is essential for cell proliferation: spores lacking a functional cdc16 gene germinate, complete mitosis and form multiple septa without undergoing cell cleavage. Examination of the activity of p34(cdc2) kinase in the cdc16-116 mutant shows that, after shift to the non-permissive temperature, mitotic p34(cdc2) kinase activity decays rapidly and cells fail to respond normally to the absence of the mitotic spindle, initiating septum formation even if mitosis has not been completed. The sequence of the predicted gene product shows homology to the BUB2 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Expression of the BUB2 gene in S. pombe will rescue the cdc16-116 mutant, but not a null allele. The cdc16 gene product may be part of a feedback mechanism preventing premature exist from mitosis by maintaining high levels of P34(cdc2) activity until the initiation of anaphase, thereby coordinating mitosis with septation, cytokinesis and entry into the next cycle. 3amitosis 3aproteins 3aSaccharomycetales 3astructural genes 3acell walls 3amutagenesis 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3aamino acid sequences 3amutants 3anucleotide sequences 3aenzyme activity 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCDC2 Protein Kinasexmetabolism 2aCell Cycle 2aCell Cycle Proteins 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Recombinant 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGenes, Fungal 2aMitosis 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aSchizosaccharomycesxcytologyxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSchizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0acell division 0amolecular sequence data 0acell septa 0acell cycle1 aMarks, J.1 aReymond, A.1 aSimanis, V.0 tEMBO journal.g1993 July, v. 12, no. 7 p.2697-2704x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01669naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245013600128300001600264520065000280650001500930650001800945650002800963650001100991653001801002700001901020700001701039700001701056700001701073700001701090700002101107700001701128773009401145852000901239930003301248945001301281946001301294655001201307IND2198700020221119022933.0990513e199812  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219870002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGusakov, A.V.10aInteraction between indigo and adsorbed protein as a major factor causing backstaining during cellulase treatment of cotton fabrics  ap. 279-293.  aA model microassay system was developed to measure indigo backstaining on cotton fabrics in the presence of enzymes on a small laboratory scale.

The effectiveness of the constructs was first compared in cell suspension cultures by counting blue expression units (b.e.u.). The expression of construct pAHC25 ranged from 3 to 50 fold greater than pBARGUS in different species. In addition, the two plasmids were quantitatively compared in Triticum aestivum and Zea mays by using the more sensitive GUS fluorometric assay to determine the amount of methylumbellyferride (MU) produced. There was more than a 30 fold increase in MU production with pAHC25 than with pBARGUS in the wheat suspension, while the maize suspension showed only a 2.5 fold increase with the pAHC25 construct. Transient GUS expression was also visualized in immature embryos of Pennisetum glaucum following bombardment with pBARGUS and pAHC25 DNA. Expression of plasmid pAHC25 was twice as high as pBARGUS.

Polyclonal sIgA was purified by sequential chromatography on protein A-Sepharose, DEAE-cellulose, and gel filtration on Toyopearl HW-55 and Sepharose 4B columns. Its purity was established by one- and two-dimensional SDS-PAGE. The protein kinase activity was inhibited by specific antibodies (Abs) against sIgA, and was stable to acidic and alkaline conditions. Catalytic sIgA showed optimal reaction conditions (pH and MgCl2 concentration) and substrate specificity different from those of known protein kinases; i.e., sIgA phosphorylated the serine residues of various milk proteins in the presence of different gamma-[32P]nucleoside- and deoxynucleoside-5'-triphosphates. The homogeneous Fab fragment of sIgA also showed kinase activity. An ATP-binding activity of fractions of sIgA was demonstrated by affinity chromatography on ATP-Sepharose and by covalent binding of an affinity analog of ATP; this activity was mediated by the L chain of sIgA. The authors believe these observations are the first example of the catalytic activity of IgA Abs and of natural catalytic Abs with synthetic activity. In addition, the findings suggest the likelihood that catalytic Abs are generated by the immune system of healthy mothers. 3aserine 3asubstrate specificity 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aimmunoglobulin A 3agel chromatography 3amilk 3aphosphorus 3acatalytic activity 3amothers 3amagnesium chloride 3aantibodies 3aprotein phosphorylation 3abinding capacity 3ahumans 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aimmune system 3aprotein kinases 3amilk proteins 3abreast milk 3aagarose 3apH 3aaffinity chromatography 2aAdult 2aBlotting, Western 2aCatalysis 2aChromatography, Affinity 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aImmunoglobulin A, Secretoryxmetabolism 2aMilk Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMilk, Humanxchemistry 2aPhosphorylation 2aProtein Kinasesxmetabolism 0adairy protein1 aKit, Y.Ya.1 aSemenov, D.V.1 aKhlimamkov, D.Yu.1 aBuneva, V.N.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g1998 Oct., v. 75, no. 1 p.77-91x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle02856naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002300193245010000216300001800316520130400334650001701638650001201655650001301667650001201680650003001692650001401722650002901736650002801765650001101793650003101804650002401835650002601859650004501885650004201930653000801972653001401980653003101994700002102025700002202046700002102068773012602089852000902215856009202224930003302316946001302349655001202362IND4408939420221119023201.0080815e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440893942DNAL7 a185189292pmid7 aPMC25749072pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05510.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFisher, Stephen K.10aVolume-dependent osmolyte efflux from neural tissues: regulation by G-protein-coupled receptors  ap. 1998-2014.  aThe CNS is particularly vulnerable to reductions in plasma osmolarity, such as occur during hyponatremia, the most commonly encountered electrolyte disorder in clinical practice. In response to a lowered plasma osmolarity, neural cells initially swell but then are able to restore their original volume through the release of osmolytes, both inorganic and organic, and the exit of osmotically obligated water. Given the importance of the maintenance of cell volume within the CNS, mechanisms underlying the release of osmolytes assume major significance. In this context, we review recent evidence obtained from our laboratory and others that indicates that the activation of specific G-protein-coupled receptors can markedly enhance the volume-dependent release of osmolytes from neural cells. Of particular significance is the observation that receptor activation significantly lowers the osmotic threshold at which osmolyte release occurs, thereby facilitating the ability of the cells to respond to small, more physiologically relevant, reductions in osmolarity. The mechanisms underlying G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated osmolyte release and the possibility that this efflux can result in both physiologically beneficial and potentially harmful pathophysiological consequences are discussed. 3ahyponatremia 3ataurine 3athrombin 2aAnimals 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aCell Size 2aElectrolytesxmetabolism 2aHomeostasisxphysiology 2aHumans 2aNervous Systemxmetabolism 2aNeuronsxmetabolism 2aOsmolar Concentration 2aReceptors, G-Protein-Coupledxmetabolism 2aWater-Electrolyte Balancexphysiology 0aATP 0aglutamate 0aregulatory volume decrease1 aCheema, Tooba A.1 aFoster, Daniel J.1 aHeacock, Anne M.0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2008 Sept., v. 106, no. 5 p.1998-2014dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05510.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080815b20080905c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03407naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245010200188300001800290520190900308650001202217650002002229650002202249650000902271650001902280650002002299650002002319650002502339650001502364650001202379650002502391650002202416650001402438650002302452650002402475650002402499650002402523653001702547653002402564653001702588700001602605700001902621773011602640852000902756856009202765930003302857946001102890655001202901IND4401863220221119023456.0080223e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440186322DNAL7 a183026832pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03659.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aECKERT, C.G.10aGenetic variation across species' geographical ranges: the central-marginal hypothesis and beyond  ap. 1170-1188.  aThere is growing interest in quantifying genetic population structure across the geographical ranges of species to understand why species might exhibit stable range limits and to assess the conservation value of peripheral populations. However, many assertions regarding peripheral populations rest on the long-standing but poorly tested supposition that peripheral populations exhibit low genetic diversity and greater genetic differentiation as a consequence of smaller effective population size and greater geographical isolation relative to geographically central populations. We reviewed 134 studies representing 115 species that tested for declines in within-population genetic diversity and/or increases in among-population differentiation towards range margins using nuclear molecular genetic markers. On average, 64.2% of studies detected the expected decline in diversity, 70.2% of those that tested for it showed increased differentiation and there was a positive association between these trends. In most cases, however, the difference in genetic diversity between central and peripheral population was not large. Although these results were consistent across plants and animals, strong taxonomic and biogeographical biases in the available studies call for a cautious generalization of these results. Despite the large number of studies testing these simple predictions, very few attempted to test possible mechanisms causing reduced peripheral diversity or increased differentiation. Almost no study incorporated a phylogeographical framework to evaluate historical influences on contemporary genetic patterns. Finally, there has been little effort to test whether these geographical trends in putatively neutral variation at marker loci are reflected by quantitative genetic trait variation, which is likely to influence the adaptive potential of populations across the geographical range. 3aanimals 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3aloci 3aphylogeography 3aplants (botany) 3apopulation size 3apopulation structure 3aprediction 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aGenetic Variation 2aGeography 2aModels, Biological 2aModels, Statistical 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSpecies Specificity 0aconservation 0ageographical ranges 0arange limits1 aSAMIS, K.E.1 aLOUGHEED, S.C.0 tMolecular ecology.g2008 Mar., v. 17, no. 5 p.1170-1188dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03659.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080224b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02157naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002000129245009400149300001600243520086900259650001301128650002301141650001301164650001001177650001401187650001701201650002201218650001201240650001201252650002101264650000701285650001701292650002601309650001601335700002001351700002001371700001901391700002001410700002301430700001701453700001601470700001301486773009601499852000901595930003301604945001301637946001301650655001201663IND2200353320221119023116.0990828e199902  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220035332DNAL7 a153047302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoroljova, O.V.10aLaccase of Coriolus zonatus: isolation, purification, and some physicochemical properties  ap. 115-127.  aLaccase is one of the lignolytic enzymes found in liquid cultures of the fungus Coriolus zonatus in defined medium. The enzyme was isolated from culture liquid and characterized. Laccase from C. zonatus is a single-chain protein with a molecular mass of 60 kDa. Carbohydrate moiety of enzyme consisted of mannose, galactose and N-acetyl-glucosamine in a ratio of 6:2:0.6, respectively, and comprised 10% of the entire molecule. Isoelectric point was detected at pH 4.6. Laccase was found to have a pH optimum of 4.9 and temperature optimum of 55 degrees C. Substrate specificity studies were conducted with catechol, K-ferrocyanide, hydroquinone, and sinapinic acid as substrates. The highest efficiency of catalysis was observed with sinapic acid as the substrates.

The lowest YE concentration that promoted significant PL induction without acting as a carbon source for the fungus corresponded to 0.0075%. Neither calcined YE nor a nutrient solution containing micronutrients induced PL production, indicating that the inducer was an organic compound. Vitamins, phospholipid components, amino acids, and nitrogenous bases were tested in place of YE and promoted no significant PL induction. A PL inducer compound was found to be soluble in the nucleotide fraction obtained during extraction of YE. The inducer was shown to be a thermostable polar substance dialyzable at 2000 Daltons, hydrolyzable by HCl, and activated by boiling for up to 60 min. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) exogenously added to the culture medium at 5 and 10 mM was capable of inducing PL in P. griseoroseum grown on sucrose, suggesting that at least one compound may be present in YE acting in a cooperative fashion for the maintenance of high levels of cAMP into the cell. PL activity and the level of cAMP inside the fungal cells increased after the addition of YE to the culture medium, suggesting the participation of this messenger in this enzyme's synthesis. 3aPenicillium 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aamino acids 3aboiling 3acarbon 3aculture media 3acyclic AMP 3afungi 3ahydrochloric acid 3amolecular weight 3amycelium 3anutrient solutions 3apectin lyase 3aphospholipids 3asucrose 3athermal stability 3avitamins 3ayeast extract1 aCoelho, J.L.C.1 aMinussi, R.C.1 aChavas-Alves, V.M.1 aBrandao, R.L.1 aSilva, D.O.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g1999 Feb., v. 76, no. 2 p.129-141x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a19991003b19991007c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle03413naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100003900171245011900210300001600329520149000345650002801835650003001863650001201893650001401905650001701919650001201936650001301948650001901961650003801980650001802018650001902036650005002055650001202105650001802117650004102135650002902176650002002205650002802225650002902253650003102282650003002313650001802343650006102361650001902422653001902441653001602460653001802476653000902494700002102503700003202524773011002556852000902666856009202675930003302767946001102800655001202811IND4400558920221119023129.0080127e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440055892DNAL7 a179960192pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03365.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoldschmidt-Clermont, M.q(Michel)10aRedundant cis-acting determinants of 3' processing and RNA stability in the chloroplast rbcL mRNA of Chlamydomonas  ap. 566-577.  aWe have designed a screen for mutants affected in 3' maturation of the chloroplast rbcL mRNA in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We inserted a spectinomycin resistance cassette, 5'atpA::aadA::3'rbcL, in a peripheral domain of tscA, the gene for a small non-coding RNA involved in trans-splicing of psaA. Depending on the orientation of the cassette, a polar effect was observed which was due to processing at the 3'rbcL element: the chimeric tscA RNA was truncated and splicing of psaA was blocked. We selected phenotypic revertants of this insertion mutant that restored psaA splicing, which correlated with the presence of chimeric transcripts that regained the 3' part of tscA. We analyzed two nuclear and six chloroplast suppressors. Five chloroplast mutations altered a short element in the center of the second inverted repeat in the 3'rbcL (IR2), and one deleted a larger region including this element. These mutations revealed a cis-acting element in IR2 which is required for 3' processing. When the same mutations were inserted in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the native rbcL gene, the rbcL mRNA accumulated to normal levels, but in strong alleles its 3' end was located upstream, near the end of the first inverted repeat (IR1). Deletion of either IR1 or IR2 allowed stable accumulation of rbcL mRNA, but deletion of both resulted in its complete absence. This indicated that the two inverted repeats function as redundant mRNA stability determinants in the 3' UTR of rbcL. 3a3' untranslated regions 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aalleles 3achimerism 3achloroplasts 3amutants 3amutation 3anon-coding RNA 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aspectinomycin 3atrans-splicing 2a3' Untranslated Regionsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aChlamydomonasxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aChloroplastsxenzymology 2aModels, Genetic 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aRNA Stability 2aRibulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTrans-Splicing 0aRNA processing 0achloroplast 0aRNA stability 0arbcL1 aRahire, Michèle1 aRochaix, J.-Dq(Jean-David)0 tPlant journal.g2008 Feb., v. 53, no. 3 p.566-577dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03365.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080127b20080202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04179naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245011000146300001600256520236800272650001102640650001302651650002702664650002202691650002602713650002202739650002302761650001302784650001502797650001602812650001502828650001202843650002302855650003302878650003402911650002802945650004102973650003503014650002203049650001603071650002403087650005803111650004103169650003703210650003003247650002803277650003803305650002803343650001303371653001403384700001703398700001503415700001803430773006403448852000903512939003303521946001103554655001203565IND9305106420221119023032.0930830e199305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930510642DNAL7 a83329952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, F.C.T.10aCentral and peripheral cardio-respiratory effects of saxitoxin (STX) in urethane-anesthetized guinea-pigs  ap. 645-664.  aEffects of saxitoxin (STX; 10 micrograms/kg; i.p.) on cardio-respiratory activities were evaluated in urethane-anesthetized guinea-pigs. Concurrent recordings were made of electrocorticogram (ECoG), bulbar respiratory-related unit activities, diaphragmatic electromyogram (DEMG), electrocardiogram (Lead II ECG), blood pressure, heart rate, end-tidal CO2, arterial O2/CO2 tensions, and arterial pH. The average time to STX-induced respiratory failure was about 10 min. The most striking effect prior to apnea was a state of progressive bradypnea which emerged 5-7 min after the toxin administration. Other noteworthy responses included (i) a time-dependent decrease in ECoG amplitudes which typically began before the development of a bradypneic profile; (ii) an increasing degree of diaphragm neuromuscular blockade; (iii) a state of combined hypercapnia and uncompensated acidemia; (iv) a declining blood pressure; (v) an incrementally dysfunctional myocardial performance; and (vi) an increasingly degenerative central respiratory activity profile which ultimately culminated in a complete loss of central respiratory drive. The therapeutic effect of intratracheally administered oxygen was equivocal in that the cardio-respiratory activities, be they of central of peripheral nature, remained conspicuously dysfunctional and precarious despite 100% oxygen ventilation. What can be inferred from this study is two-fold. First, STX-induced ventilatory insufficiency can be attributed to a loss of functional integrity of both central and peripheral respiratory system components. That is, although diaphragm blockade contributes significantly to STX-induced respiratory failure, analyses of single respiratory unit activity data revealed that the central respiratory rhythmogenic mechanism also appeared to play a pivotal role in the development of a bradypneic profile which promotes, and directly causes, a complete loss of respiratory drive. Second, a state of unabating depression of central respiratory activities, which seemed to be refractory to the effect of O2, suggests STX has a direct and persistent action on medullary rhythmogenic mechanisms. In conclusion, these findings indicate that both central and peripheral cardio-respiratory components are critically involved in STX-induced apnea, dysfunctional cardiovascular performance, and lethality. 3atoxins 3atoxicity 3acentral nervous system 3aperipheral nerves 3acardiovascular system 3aelectrophysiology 3arespiratory system 3aurethane 3aanesthesia 3aguinea pigs 2aAnesthesia 2aAnimals 2aBlood Gas Analysis 2aBlood Pressurexdrug effects 2aCerebral Cortexxdrug effects 2aDiaphragmxdrug effects 2aElectroencephalographyxdrug effects 2aElectromyographyxdrug effects 2aElectrophysiology 2aGuinea Pigs 2aHeartxdrug effects 2aMedulla Oblongataxanatomy & histologyxdrug effects. 2aMyocardial Contractionxdrug effects 2aOxygen Consumptionxdrug effects 2aRespirationxdrug effects 2aRespiration, Artificial 2aRespiratory Musclesxdrug effects 2aSaxitoxinxpharmacology 2aUrethane 0adinophyta1 aBenton, B.J.1 aLenz, R.A.1 aCapacio, B.R.0 tToxicon.g1993 May, v. 31, no. 5 p.645-664x0041-01017nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03483naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245009700174300001600271500002400287520208000311650003702391650002102428650002202449650002102471650001302492650001602505650001402521650001202535650001502547650001202562650001102574650004102585650001502626650002202641650001102663650002002674650001702694650001902711650002302730700001802753700002502771700001702796773012402813852000902937856005502946655001203001IND4396219220221119023049.0071021e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439621922DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.2007.00602.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConnor, Edward C.14aThe role of the plant in attracting parasitoids: response to progressive mechanical wounding  ap. 145-155.  aIncludes references  aBased on the model system of Brussels sprouts [Brassica oleracea var. gemmifera (Brassicaceae)], the herbivore cabbage white caterpillar, Pieris brassicae (L.) (Lepidoptera: Pieridae), and the parasitoid wasp, Cotesia glomerata (L.) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), the influence of plant damage type, and damage duration were assessed on plant volatile emission and subsequent recruitment of natural antagonists of the herbivore. Plants were damaged by three methods for a period of either 3 or 8 h: herbivore damage (HD), progressive mechanical damage, and final mechanical damage inflicted in a single event. Wind-tunnel bioassays evaluated whether the mode of damage affected female parasitoid oriented flight. After both periods of damage, all treatments were highly significantly preferred by naïve C. glomerata to undamaged control plants. After 3 h, herbivore-damaged plants were significantly preferred to plants with final damage (FD). Most remarkably, following 8-h damage, the parasitoid preferred both herbivore-damaged and progressively damaged plants to plants with FD and did not significantly discriminate between herbivore and progressively damaged plants, thus indicating a similarity in plant response to herbivore and progressive mechanical damage. In addition to wind-tunnel bioassays, emitted plant volatiles were collected and analysed by thermal desorption gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, following 3 and 8 h of damage in order to correlate volatiles released from different damage types with the attraction of the parasitoid. Differences in volatile profiles from all damage types were similar following both 3 and 8 h of damage, with only (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate found to be emitted in significantly higher quantities by final mechanical damage compared with HD after 3 h. In conclusion, the plant's response to progressive mechanical damage was more similar to HD than final mechanical damage deployed at a single point in time, irrespective of damage duration, and C. glomerata did not significantly discriminate between progressive damage and HD. 3aBrassica oleracea var. gemmifera 3aBrussels sprouts 3aCotesia glomerata 3aPieris brassicae 3aacetates 3aantagonists 3abioassays 3acabbage 3adesorption 3afemales 3aflight 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aherbivores 3amechanical damage 3amodels 3aparasitic wasps 3aplant damage 3aplant response 3avolatile compounds1 aRott, Anja S.1 aSamietz, J.q(Jörg)1 aDorn, Silvia0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2007 Nov., v. 125, no. 2 p.145-155dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2007.00602.x 7aarticle02507naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245009200144300001600236500001500252520113300267650002801400650002301428650002201451650002501473650002301498650001801521650001701539650002401556650002801580650002301608650004601631650002801677650003401705650003701739650003401776653002401810653002801834653001101862700001701873773008101890852000901971930003301980945001302013946001102026655001202037IND2196758920221119023052.0990130e199807  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219675892DNAL7 a96870702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoshi, C.P.10aConserved sequence motifs in plant S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferases  ap. 663-674.  a2019-12-05  aPlant S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferases (SAM-Mtases) are the key enzymes in phenylpropanoid, flavonoid and many other metabolic pathways of biotechnological importance. Here we compiled the amino acid sequences of 56 SAM-Mtases from different plants and performed a computer analysis for the conserved sequence motifs that could possibly act as SAM-binding domains. To date, genes or cDNAs encoding at least ten distinct groups of SAM-Mtases that utilize SAM and a variety of substrates have been reported from higher plants. Three amino acid sequence motifs are conserved in most of these SAM-Mtases. In addition, many conserved domains have been discovered in each group of O-methyltransferases (OMTs) that methylate specific substrates and may act as sites for substrate specificity in each enzyme. Finally, a diagrammatic representation of the relationship between different OMTs is presented. These SAM-Mtase sequence signatures will be useful in the identification of SAM-Mtase motifs in the hitherto unidentified proteins as well as for designing primers in the isolation of new SAM-Mtases from plants. 3ainterspecific variation 3asequence alignment 3acomputer analysis 3aamino acid sequences 3aadenosylmethionine 3abinding sites 3atransferases 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBinding Sitesxgenetics 2aConserved Sequence 2aMethyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlantsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aS-Adenosylmethioninexmetabolism 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0aspecies differences 0amolecular sequence data 0aplants1 aChiang, V.L.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1998 July, v. 37, no. 4 p.663-674x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02948naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002200149245007200171300001600243500002400259520199000283650001602273650001602289650001702305650001302322650001102335700001802346700001502364700001802379773013902397852000902536856008902545655001202634IND4464871820221119023344.0130204s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446487182DNAL7 a10.1016/S1537-5110(03)00036-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcFarlane, N.J.B.10aDetection of Bone Fragments in Chicken Meat using X-ray Backscatter  ap. 185-199.  aIncludes references  aX-ray backscatter was used to detect near-surface fragments of chicken clavicle, 2 cm long and 20–60 mg in weight, in polystyrene phantoms and in samples of breast meat. The densities of clavicle fragments and pieces of breast meat were measured by Archimedes’ method, and were respectively 1·32±0·05 and 1·07±0·007 g cm−3. Samples were prepared consisting of blocks of polystyrene, or of chicken breast, into which fragments of clavicle were inserted, approximately 0·1 cm below the surface. The samples were scanned in front of a 140 kVp X-ray source, and the backscattered X-rays were counted by a detector collimated at 135° to the beam. The spatial resolution was 0·1 by 0·1 cm in the source–sample–detector plane, and 2 cm in the perpendicular direction. The scattered spectra were collected, and for each spectrum, three quantities were plotted against sample position: the counts in a 10–40 keV energy window; the counts in a 40–95 keV energy window; and the mean spectral energy over the range 10–95 keV. The contrasts from these measurements were compared with those obtained in transmission images. The detected counts in the 10–40 keV energy window showed little positive contrast, but strong negative contrasts due to attenuation. The contrasts ranged from −13 to −25·8%, and the signal-to-noise ratios (normalised for a 30 mA source at 1 s sampling time) were 5·8–11·7. The detected counts in the 40–95 keV energy window showed peaks in the backscatter when the scan passed across a bone fragment. The contrasts ranged from 4·2 to 14·7%, and the signal-to-noise ratios from 1·6 to 5·6. The mean spectral energy gave results intermediate between the two, with contrasts in the range 1·7–6·7% and signal-to-noise ratios from 3·0 to 11·0. The 10–40 keV energy window gave contrasts which were larger than those in the transmission images, and the 40–95 keV energy window gave contrasts similar to the transmission images. 3aX-radiation 3abreast meat 3achicken meat 3achickens 3aenergy1 aSpeller, R.D.1 aBull, C.R.1 aTillett, R.D.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2003 June, v. 85, no. 2 p.185-199dPublished for Silsoe Research Institute by Academic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1537-5110(03)00036-93Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02289naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008300126300001600209500001500225520097600240650002501216650003601241650001201277650001201289650001301301650001301314650001701327650002001344650001901364650002201383650001801405650001901423650002001442650002701462653002801489653001101517653002601528700001401554700001601568773017901584852000901763930003301772945001301805946001301818655001201831IND2206477720221119022941.0000817e200007  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220647772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKobashi, K.10aAbscisic acid content and sugar metabolism of peaches grown under water stress  ap. 425-428.  a2019-12-05  aA water stress treatment was imposed on peach trees [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch 'Kansuke Hakuto' (Peach Group)] to elucidate the relationship among sugar accumulation, sugar metabolism, and abscisic acid (ABA) in fruit under water stress. Treatment was carried out on peach trees grown in containers from 8 July 1996 [80 days after full bloom (DAFB)] for 16 days, to achieve a predawn water potential of -0.8 to -1.1 MPa compared to that of -0.4 to -0.6 MPa in control trees. Levels of sorbitol, sucrose, and total sugars, as well as the activity of sorbitol oxidase increased in fruit of water stressed trees under moderate water stress (-0.8 MPa), whereas under severe water stress (-1.1 MPa), no difference between the water-stressed trees and the controls was observed. Water stress also induced an increase in ABA in the fruit. These initial results indicated that water-stress-induced ABA accelerated sugar accumulation in peaches by activating sorbitol metabolism. 3astomatal conductance 3achemical constituents of plants 3aglucose 3asucrose 3afructose 3asorbitol 3awater stress 3aoxidoreductases 3aPrunus persica 3adiurnal variation 3aabscisic acid 3aphotosynthesis 3awater potential 3acontainer-grown plants 0acarbohydrate metabolism 0afruits 0aplant-water relations1 aGemma, H.1 aIwahori, S.0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g2000 July, v. 125, no. 4 p.425-428aAmerican Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03325naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100001900167245005700186300001600243500002400259520226600283650004102549650001502590650001102605650001502616650001402631650001502645650002602660650001602686650001602702650001402718773013902732852000902871856010702880655001202987IND4464872520221119022910.0130204s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446487252DNAL7 ahttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1537-5110(03)00063-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarchant, B.P.10aTime–frequency Analysis for Biosystems Engineering  ap. 261-281.  aIncludes references  aMany biological and agricultural systems naturally emit a number of signals which may be easily gathered and then used to monitor or control the system. For example, signals consisting of measurements of the temperature or heart rate of animals may be used to assess the health of the individuals. The interpretation of these signals is relatively simple since the value at any time gives some indication of the animal's condition. Other signals such as acoustic or vibration measurements are less easy to interpret. Here it is the spectral content, that is the amplitude and rate of oscillations within the signal, that is important rather than the actual measurement value or trend. Often such signals are complicated and their spectral content varies with time. This paper provides a review of methods, known as time–frequency analyses, that accurately track these variations. Researchers in other areas have found that traditional time–frequency techniques such as the short-time Fourier transform are unable to calculate the spectral content of highly transient signals with sufficient accuracy. For this reason new signal processing methods such as wavelets and energy distributions have been developed. In this review these methods are described and their application to the output from biological or agricultural systems is discussed. Six different analysis techniques are detailed. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages and is suited to different types of signal. The aim is to give objective criteria that may be used to choose the correct analysis technique for a particular signal. To this end, key properties of each method are compared, such as the precision or resolution, the form and ease of interpretation of results, the ability to separate the relevant parts of the signal from noise, the complexity of computation required and the pitfalls or artefacts that may occur. The motivation for this review is to enable researchers to select the correct tools required to investigate the information content of previously unstudied signals. Information from such signals may be of great value in a number of biosystems engineering applications such as automatic control of farm machinery or integrated monitoring systems for livestock. 3aagricultural machinery and equipment 3aautomation 3aenergy 3aheart rate 3alivestock 3amotivation 3aprocessing technology 3aresearchers 3atemperature 3avibration0 tBiosystems engineering.g2003 July, v. 85, no. 3 p.261-281dPublished for Silsoe Research Institute by Academic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1537-5110(03)00063-13Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02758naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001700149245011600166300001600282500002400298520172900322650001402051650001102065650001002076650001302086650001102099650000902110650001402119650002202133650001202155700001602167773013902183852000902322856008902331655001202420IND4464873220221119022954.0130204s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446487322DNAL7 a10.1016/S1537-5110(03)00064-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelie, N. de10aCharacterisation of Claw–floor Contact Pressures for Standing Cattle and the Dependency on Concrete Roughness  ap. 339-346.  aIncludes references  aInadequate properties of concrete floors in livestock buildings seem to be an important cause of cattle lesions. High local pressures on claw tissues may contribute to damage of the claw. Monitoring of foot-to-ground pressure distributions may provide insight in the relation between high local pressures and foot lesions. In the current research, the pressure distribution of the foot-to-ground contact area was recorded using thin film tactile sensors. During the experiments, the sensor was located between previously prepared bovine claws and concrete samples with different surface roughness. The measurement procedure permitted a gradual increase in the vertical load on the claws at a test bench, while at the same time the contact area and the pressure distribution could be registered. Five different levels of surface roughness were obtained by finishing fresh concrete samples with a metal float, a wooden float or a brush, and by washing the concrete surface to two different degrees. The results showed a clear increase in contact area with increasing pressure. The abaxial wall and bulb of the claws had the major load-bearing function. The metal-floated concrete resulted in the largest contact area and the lowest pressures, while the washed concrete resulted in much smaller contact areas and higher pressures. Other finishing methods gave intermediate results. The maximum pressure under a load of 4 kN was about twice as high on a wooden-floated or lightly washed surface (around 40 MPa), compared to a metal-floated surface (around 20 MPa). On the severely washed out surface, the maximum pressure was even four to five times higher. This may indicate a higher risk on claw lesions due to local overload. 3abuildings 3acattle 3aclaws 3aconcrete 3afloors 3arisk 3aroughness 3asurface roughness 3awashing1 aRombaut, E.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2003 July, v. 85, no. 3 p.339-346dPublished for Silsoe Research Institute by Academic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1537-5110(03)00064-33Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01899naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245013700126300001600263520079300279650001701072650002101089650002501110650002201135650002701157650002201184650002801206650000701234650002101241650002901262650001201291650001601303650001501319700001601334773009501350852000901445930003301454945001301487946001301500655001201513IND2061172720221119022951.0980109e199705  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206117272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbraham, M.10aKinetics of the enzymatic saccharification of pretreated tapioca waste (Manihot esculenta) and water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes)  ap. 133-145.  aStudies were carried out on saccharification of pretreated tapioca waste and water hyacinth under two different conditions: using microbial enzymes (cellulase from Myrothecium verrucaria, Coprinus comatus, Pleurotus florida, and Cellulomonas sp.) and solid-state fermentation.

Among the two different treatments, enzymatic saccharification was found to be the most efficient. Among the various cellulase sources tested, M. verrucaria cellulase was found to be the most efficient one followed by C. comatus, P. florida, and finally Cellulomonas sp. 3aCellulomonas 3aCoprinus comatus 3aEichhornia crassipes 3aManihot esculenta 3aMyrothecium verrucaria 3aPleurotus florida 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3apH 3asaccharification 3asolid state fermentation 3atapioca 3atemperature 3awastewater1 aKurup, G.M.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g1997 May, v. 66, no. 2 p.133-145x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle02646naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245014200188300001400330500002400344520107400368650001001442650001601452650001601468650001501484650001501499650000801514650001101522650001001533650002301543650001501566650000901581650002501590650005101615650001401666650001101680650004701691650000901738650002301747650003601770650002201806700001301828700001601841700001501857700001501872700001301887773011501900852000902015856009202024655001202116IND4464743520221119022942.0130110s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446474352DNAL7 a126623652pmid7 a10.1046/j.1365-277X.2003.00427.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrummond, S.10aEffectiveness of dietary advice given by community dietitians to men with elevated blood cholesterol in a clinical setting: a pilot study  ap. 81-83.  aIncludes references  aObjective: To compare the effect of two types of dietary advice given by community dietitians on subsequent dietary intake in Scottish men, over 8 weeks. Design: A parallel design intervention study was employed. Twenty-five men with elevated blood cholesterol levels were randomly assigned to Group 1 (advice to reduce dietary fat only) or Group 2 (advice to reduce dietary fat and sugar). Results: Neither group significantly reduced fat intakes, yet both groups self-rated their fat intake as being lower at the end than at the start of the study. Group 2 reduced per cent energy from sugar and increased per cent energy from starch without significantly changing per cent energy from total carbohydrate. No significant change in blood cholesterol levels were observed. Conclusions: Advice to reduce dietary fat was not effective in this group of subjects. Advice to reduce both fat and sugar resulted in a decrease in sugar intake only. Both groups wrongly rated their fat intake to be lower at the end of the study. This may be a barrier to further dietary advice. 3ablood 3acholesterol 3adietary fat 3adietitians 3afat intake 3amen 3asugars 2aAdult 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCounseling 2aDiet 2aDiet, Fat-Restricted 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadministration & dosage 2aDietetics 2aHumans 2aHypercholesterolemiaxbloodxdiet therapy. 2aMale 2aPatient Compliance 2aStarchxadministration & dosage 2aTreatment Outcome1 aKirk, T.1 aJackson, J.1 aHendry, J.1 aPanton, S.1 aGray, F.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g2003 Apr., v. 16, no. 2 p.81-83dBlackwell Sciencex0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-277X.2003.00427.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03623naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001600149245008800165300001600253500002400269500001500293520237000308650001502678650002402693650001502717650001802732650001002750650001402760650001302774650001102787650001302798650001302811650001302824650001302837650001002850653001402860700001402874700001402888700001402902700002402916773013902940852000903079856008903088655001203177IND4464874020221119022959.0130204s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446487402DNAL7 a10.1016/S1537-5110(03)00095-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHennens, D.10aDevelopment of a Flow Model for the Design of a Momentum Type Beet Mass Flow Sensor  ap. 425-436.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA lot of research is done to monitor yield during harvesting. Combined with a positioning system, this information can be used to produce yield maps. Based on the yields of successive years, site-specific field management can be done, aiming for higher local economic and ecological yield efficiencies. In this research, a curved plate mass flow sensor for sugar beet is designed with the aid of a mathematical model. The principle is based on measuring the impulse flow colliding with the plate. For granular materials, an accuracy of 2% is achieved. The mass flow sensor for sugar beet is integrated as a curved side rack in the cleaning channel of the harvester. The side rack is mechanically isolated from the frame. A theoretical model of the beet flow over the turbines of the cleaning unit is calculated and incorporates all physical parameters that influence the mass flow measurement by the momentum sensor. The flow density and friction coefficients with the rack and the turbine characterise the mass flow. From the model, the influence of the different parameters (slope, beet velocity, friction, length of the plate) on the momentum is investigated. The force exerted on the rack of the cleaning unit is measured, from which the momentum can be indirectly calculated. A measurement device is constructed, minimising the influence of the harvesting conditions and the material properties. After calibration, measurements are carried out on the cleaning unit of a Dewulf R6000T (two-phase system) and an Agrifac ZA 215 EH (one-phase system). Research is done to construct the sensor independent on friction properties between beets and the rack. Major influence comes from the velocity of the transported material. Variations in beet speed have to be registered continuously with a Doppler radar meter. Influences of a varying slope can also be corrected regarding the instantaneous beet velocities. More accurate measurements are done when the sensor is installed on bigger spinning wheels because of higher momentum due to a higher centrifugal force and hence a higher signal to noise ratio. To evaluate the model, only average mass flows and flow speeds could be used to predict the executed moments. When comparing the integrated measured momentum and the scale weight of the harvester bin, the error never exceeds 3% when using the derived equation. 3aharvesting 3amathematical models 3asugar beet 3ayield mapping 3aradar 3amass flow 3amomentum 3awheels 3aspinning 3aturbines 3afriction 3acleaning 3abeets 0aeconomics1 aBaert, J.1 aBroos, B.1 aRamon, H.1 aDe Baerdemaeker, J.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2003 Aug., v. 85, no. 4 p.425-436dPublished for Silsoe Research Institute by Academic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1537-5110(03)00095-33Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03672naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005400126300001600180500001500196520252200211650002102733650001302754650001402767650002102781650002102802650001302823650001202836650003202848650001302880650001602893650001302909650001402922651001102936653001302947653002002960700002302980773017903003852000903182930003303191945001303224946001303237655001203250IND2206487320221119023132.0000817e200007  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220648732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErdogan, V.10aInterspecific hybridization in hazelnut (Corylus)  ap. 489-497.  a2019-12-05  aEight Corylus L. (hazelnut) species were intercrossed in all possible combinations to reveal genetic relationships. Pollinations were made on either individually bagged branches or trees covered entirely with polyethylene using mixtures of pollen of five genotypes to minimize low cluster set due to single incompatible combinations. Percent cluster set, seed germination, and hybrid seedling survival were determined. Hybridity of seedlings was verified by inspection of morphological traits. Based on percent cluster set, seed germination, and hybrid seedling survival along with observed morphological similarities, Corylus species were placed in three groups: 1) the tree hazels C. colurna L. (turkish tree hazel) and C. chinensis Franchet (chinese tree hazel), 2) the bristle-husked shrub species C. cornuta Marshall (beaked hazel), C. californica (A.DC.) Rose (california hazel), and C. sieboldiana Blume (manchurian hazel), and 3) the leafy-husked shrub species C. avellana L. (european hazel), C. americana Marshall (american hazel), C. heterophylla Fischer (siberian hazel), and C. heterophylla Fischer var. sutchuensis Franchet (sichuan hazel). The two tree hazel species crossed with each other readily, as did the three bristle-husked shrub species. The frequency of blanks was low (<20%) for crosses of the tree hazels, and <50% for interspecific crosses within the group of bristle-husked species. The leafy-husked shrub species could be crossed with each other in all directions, although cluster set on C. heterophylla was low. For crosses of species belonging to different groups, set was generally low and the frequency of blanks high. Nevertheless, a few hybrid seedlings were obtained from several combinations. When used as the female parent, C. californica set nuts when crossed with all other species, indicating possible value as a bridge species. Crosses involving C. avellana were more successful when it was the pollen parent. In crosses with C. avellana pollen, cluster set on C. chinensis was better than on C. colurna and the frequency of blanks was much lower, indicating that it might be easier to transfer nonsuckering growth habit from C. chinensis than from C. colurna. Reciprocal differences in the success of crosses was observed. The following crosses were successful C. californica x C. avellana, C. chinensis x C. avellana, C americana x C. heterophylla, C. cornuta x C heterophylla, C. californica x C. colurna, and C. americana x C. sieboldiana, but the reciprocals were not. 3aseed germination 3ataxonomy 3aseedlings 3agenetic distance 3aplant morphology 3agenotype 3aCorylus 3ainterspecific hybridization 3abranches 3apollination 3aseed set 3amortality 3aOregon 0acrossing 0aincompatibility1 aMehlenbacher, S.A.0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g2000 July, v. 125, no. 4 p.489-497aAmerican Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03101naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010400125300001500229520185100244650002102095650002302116650001102139650001802150650001102168650001502179650001602194650001302210650000902223650002102232650000702253650002702260650002402287650001602311650002502327650001002352650002302362650004002385650001702425700001402442700001402456773009302470852000902563930003302572945001302605946001302618655001202631IND2090453820221119023101.0980515e199707  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND209045382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCole, K.D.10aAqueous two-phase partitioning of milk proteins application to human protein C secreted in pig milk  ap. 97-112.  aMilk of transgenic pigs secreting recombinant human Protein C (rHPC) was used as a model system to determine the utility of aqueous two-phase extraction systems (ATPS) for the initial step in the purification of proteins from milk. The major challenges in purification of recombinant proteins from milk are removal of casein micelles (that foul processing equipment) and elimination of the host milk proteins from the final product. When milk was partitioned in ATPS composed of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and ammonium sulfate (AS), the phases were clarified and most of the caseins precipitated at the interphase. The partition coefficients of the major milk proteins and rHPC were dependent upon the molecular weight of the PEG used in the ATPS. Higher-partition coefficients of the major whey proteins, beta-lactoglobulin, and alpha-lactalbumin were observed in ATPS made up of lower molecular-weight PEG (1000 or 1450) as compared to systems using higher molecular-weight PEG. Lowering the pH of the ATPS from 7.5 to 6.0 resulted in increased precipitation of the caseins and decreased their concentration in both phases. rHPC had a partition coefficient of 0.04 in a system composed of AS and PEG 1450. The rHPC in pig milk was shown to be highly heterogenous by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The heterogeneity was owing to inefficient proteolytic processing of the single chain to the heterodimeric form and differences in glycosylation and other post-translational processing. Differential partitioning of the multiple forms of purified rHPC in the AWS was not observed. rHPC after processing in ATPS was recovered in a clear phase free of most major milk proteins. ATPS are useful as the initial processing step in the purification of recombinant proteins from milk because clarification and enrichment is combined in a single step. 3aammonium sulfate 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3acasein 3aglycosylation 3ahumans 3ainterphase 3alactalbumin 3amicelles 3amilk 3amolecular weight 3apH 3apartition coefficients 3apolyethylene glycol 3aproteolysis 3arecombinant proteins 3aswine 3atransgenic animals 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 3awhey protein1 aLee, T.K.1 aLubon, H.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g1997 , v. 67, no. 1/2 p.97-112x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle02146naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245007700168300001600245520068400261650002000945650003500965650001101000650001801011650003801029650001001067650002201077650001101099650002701110650002501137650001301162650005201175650001201227650001001239650001201249651001001261653001001271653001101281700001301292700001401305700001701319700001501336700001601351773012801367852000901495856009201504930003301596946001101629655001201640IND4404883520221119023124.0080425e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440488352DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0434.2007.01361.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandel, V.10aIncidence of Prunus necrotic ring spot virus on Malus domestica in India  ap. 382-384.  aIn surveys of apple (Malus domestica) orchards in various parts of Himachal Pradesh, samples from trees showing necrotic symptoms on the leaves were collected and tested for detection of Prunus necrotic ringspot virus (PNRSV) initially by ELISA followed by RT-PCR using coat protein gene primers.

The influence on EOC of growth and interaction of a white rot fungus and the indigenous soil microorganisms was studied. During decomposition of straw by Pleurotus sp. or Dichomitus squalens, EOC in straw increased from 18 to 39-83 mg g(-1). Nevertheless, only low amounts of EOC were translocated into the adjacent soil. When sterile straw was brought into contact with nonsterile soil, consumption of EOC by the soil microorganisms in the straw was higher than the EOC flux from straw into soil. During simultaneous growth of white rot fungi and soil organisms, propagation of soil bacteria in straw and growth of the fungal mycelia in soil were partially inhibited. However, the accumulation of EOC in straw by the fungi continued in the presence of soil microbiota. 3aPleurotus 3acarbon 3alignocellulose 3amicrobial growth 3amycelium 3asoil 3asoil bacteria 3asoil fungi 3astraw 3awhite-rot fungi1 aKleeberg, I.1 aZadražil, F.0 tBioresource technology.g2000 Oct., v. 75, no. 1 p.57-65x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03171naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245010800186300001600294500002400310520137000334650001501704650001101719650001701730650001401747650003001761650001201791650001401803650001801817650002201835650000901857650000901866650000901875650001001884650001701894650002101911650004501932650001301977650001201990650001102002650003002013650003702043650001102080650002302091650003502114650001502149650004202164650000902206650001102215650001402226700001502240700001702255700001202272700001402284700001702298773011702315852000902432856009202441655001202533IND4464744020221119023158.0130110s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446474402DNAL7 a126623702pmid7 a10.1046/j.1365-277X.2003.00424.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitsui, T.10aSmall bowel bacterial overgrowth and rice malabsorption in healthy and physically disabled older adults  ap. 119-122.  aIncludes references  aAim: To determine whether there are differences in small bowel bacterial overgrowth (SBBO) and rice digestion between healthy and disabled older adults and to estimate the influence of physical activity on these nutritional statuses. Method: Fifteen disabled adults who commute to a day-care centre and 11 healthy older adults participated in this study. SBBO and rice absorption were judged using a breath hydrogen test. Physical activity was estimated using a pedometer. Results: The average number of steps taken per day by the disabled was 1056 ± 243, which was statistically lower than that of the healthy, 6904 ± 782 (P < 0.001). No SBBO-positive subject was seen in the healthy group, whereas five (33.3%) of 15 disabled older adults were SBBO-positive. After ingesting glucose solution, the ▵H2 of disabled subjects was higher than that of the healthy subjects (7.6 ± 2.7 versus 0.5 ± 0.3 p.p.m., P < 0.05). Rice malabsorption was seen in one (9.1%) of 11 in the healthy and two (14.3%) of 14 in the disabled groups, which was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Disabled older people who have a physically inactive lifestyle are at risk of SBBO, probably because of a reduction in their intestinal motility. SBBO has no influence on absorption of rice, and some older adults, independent of physical condition, can not absorb rice adequately. 3aabsorption 3aadults 3abreath tests 3adigestion 3agastrointestinal motility 3aglucose 3alifestyle 3amalabsorption 3aphysical activity 3arice 3arisk 2aAged 2aAging 2aBreath Tests 2aDisabled Persons 2aEnterobacteriaceaexgrowth & development 2aExercise 2aFasting 2aFemale 2aGastrointestinal Motility 2aGlucosexadministration & dosage 2aHumans 2aHydrogenxanalysis 2aIntestine, Smallxmicrobiology 2aLife Style 2aMalabsorption Syndromesxepidemiology 2aMale 2aOryza. 2aSolutions1 aKagami, H.1 aKinomoto, H.1 aIto, A.1 aKondo, T.1 aShimaoka, K.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g2003 Apr., v. 16, no. 2 p.119-122dBlackwell Sciencex0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-277X.2003.00424.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01754naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009800128300001400226520080600240650001801046650001801064650001301082650002301095650001001118650001901128650001201147650001701159650001301176650001101189700002401200700002401224773007801248852000901326930003301335945001301368946001101381655001201392IND2207698820221119023343.0001109e200010  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220769882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFilho, E.A.B.10aBabassu coconut starch liquefaction: an industrial scale approach to improve conversion yield  ap. 49-55.  aThe mesocarp of the babassu coconut, that represents 23% of the fruit weight, is the source of an amylaceous flour containing approximately 50% (w/w) starch.

Design: The 1994–1996 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (CSFII) provided the study sample. Snacking episodes were defined as a ‘food and/or beverage break’, and subjects were classified as morning, afternoon, evening, multiple or never snackers. Subjects/setting Our study included data from 1756 men and 1511 women who provided two nonconsecutive, multiple-pass 24-h dietary recalls. Statistical analyses: Mean values of each subject's two 24-h recalls were used for analyses, and data were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows and SUDAAN. Results: Compared with women, men were more likely to be evening, multiple or never snackers. Male multiple snackers had significantly higher energy intakes than did afternoon and never snackers, whereas female multiple snackers had higher energy intakes than did morning, evening and never snackers. At the same time, male and female multiple snackers had more prudent energy-adjusted intakes of protein, cholesterol, calcium and sodium. Coffee, cola, milk, ice cream and fruits were among the most frequently consumed snacks by men and women. The BMI did not differ significantly across snacker categories. Conclusion: These data indicate that snacking patterns have some effects on energy and nutrient intakes but not on BMI. Snack food choices remain a concern, especially beverages, including those that are sweetened. Vegetables and fruits as snacks should be encouraged. 3aContinuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals 3aadults 3abeverages 3abody mass index 3acalcium 3acholesterol 3aenergy 3afood choices 3afruits 3aice cream 3amen 3amilk 3asnacks 3asocial sciences 3asodium 3astatistical analysis 3avegetables 3awomen 2aAdult 2aBody Mass Index 2aCalcium, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aEdible Grain. 2aCholesterol, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aDiet 2aDiet Records 2aDiet Surveys 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMental Recall 2aNutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aSex Characteristics 2aSodium, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aTime Factors 3aUnited States1 aHeaton, C.L.B.1 aTaylor, C.A.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g2003 Feb., v. 16, no. 1 p.3-11dBlackwell Sciencex0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-277X.2003.00417.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04235naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166100002100184245009400205500002400299500001500323506007600338520196100414506003702375650001902412650001702431650002202448650002802470650001102498650001502509650001202524650001502536650001502551650001102566650001902577650001002596650003802606650001102644650002902655650001902684650001602703650001302719650001102732650002502743650001202768650002902780650002302809650001002832650002602842650002802868650001502896650002302911650006002934650003202994650005603026650004703082650002403129650002803153651001403181651002903195653001703224700002503241700002403266700002103290773008603311852000903397856008303406655001203489IND4464801620221207063845.0130118s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446480162DNAL7 a220857672pmid7 aPMC32276012pmcid7 a10.1186/1751-0147-53-582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZienius, Dainius10aRaccoon dog rabies surveillance and post-vaccination monitoring in Lithuania 2006 to 2010  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground Oral rabies vaccination (ORV) in rabies infected regions should target the primary rabies vector species, which in Lithuania includes raccoon dogs as well as red foxes. Specific investigations on ORV in raccoon dogs are needed e.g. evaluation of vaccine effectiveness under field conditions. The objective of the current study was to investigate the efficacy of the ORV programme 2006-2010 in Lithuania by examining the number of rabies cases and estimating the prevalences of a tetracycline biomarker (TTC) and rabies virus antibodies in raccoon dogs. Methods From 2006 to 2010, 12.5 million rabies vaccine-baits were distributed by aircraft. Baiting occurred twice per year (spring and autumn), targeting raccoon dogs and red foxes in a 63,000 km2 area of Lithuania. The mandibles of raccoon dogs found dead or killed in the vaccination area were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy for the presence of the TTC. Rabies virus sera neutralizing anti-glycoprotein antibody titres were determined using an indirect ELISA method and seroconversion (> 0.5 EU/ml) rates were estimated. Results During the study period, 51.5% of raccoon dog mandibles were positive for TTC. 1688 of 3260 tested adults and 69 of 175 tested cubs were TTC positive. Forty-seven percent of raccoon dog serum samples were positive for rabies virus antibodies. 302 of 621 investigated adults and 33 of 95 investigated cubs were seropositive. In the same time 302 of 684 and 43 of 124 tested samples were TTC and ELISA positive in spring; whereas 1455 of 2751 and 292 of 592 tested samples were TTC and ELISA positive in autumn. There was a positive correlation between the number of TTC and antibody positive animals for both adult and cub groups. Conclusions ORV was effective in reducing the prevalence of rabies in the raccoon dog population in Lithuania. The prevalence of rabies cases in raccoon dogs in Lithuania decreased from 60.7% in 2006-2007 to 6.5% in 2009-2010.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aneutralization 3atetracycline 3aRabies lyssavirus 3afluorescence microscopy 3aautumn 3amonitoring 3abaiting 3aantibodies 3abiomarkers 3arabies 3aseroprevalence 3afoxes 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aspring 3aNyctereutes procyonoides 3aseroconversion 3avaccination 3aaircraft 3aadults 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralxblood 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aFoxes 2aImmunization Programs 2aPopulation Surveillance 2aPrevalence 2aProgram Evaluation 2aRabiesxepidemiologyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aRabies Vaccinesximmunology 2aRabies virusximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aRaccoon Dogsxbloodximmunologyxvirology. 2aTetracyclinexblood 2aVaccinationxveterinary 3aLithuania 0aLithuaniaxepidemiology. 0aRabies virus1 aPridotkas, Gediminas1 aLelesius, Raimundas1 aSereika, Vilimas0 tActa veterinaria scandinavica.g2011 Nov., v. 53dBioMed Centralx1751-01477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1751-0147-53-583Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02808naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166100002400184245003700208500002400245506007600269520110100345506003701446650002701483650003501510650001101545650002601556650001801582650002401600650003501624650002801659650001401687650001201701650003201713650003701745650006401782650002601846650002601872650001101898650002801909650003801937651001101975651002601986700001902012700001502031700002102046700002102067773008602088852000902174856008302183655001202266IND4464801320221207063803.0130118s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446480132DNAL7 a220995022pmid7 aPMC32319422pmcid7 a10.1186/1751-0147-53-612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansen, Cristina M.10aTularemia in Alaska, 1938 - 2010  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTularemia is a serious, potentially life threatening zoonotic disease. The causative agent, Francisella tularensis, is ubiquitous in the Northern hemisphere, including Alaska, where it was first isolated from a rabbit tick (Haemophysalis leporis-palustris) in 1938. Since then, F. tularensis has been isolated from wildlife and humans throughout the state. Serologic surveys have found measurable antibodies with prevalence ranging from < 1% to 50% and 4% to 18% for selected populations of wildlife species and humans, respectively. We reviewed and summarized known literature on tularemia surveillance in Alaska and summarized the epidemiological information on human cases reported to public health officials. Additionally, available F. tularensis isolates from Alaska were analyzed using canonical SNPs and a multi-locus variable-number tandem repeats (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) system. The results show that both F. t. tularensis and F. t. holarctica are present in Alaska and that subtype A.I, the most virulent type, is responsible for most recently reported human clinical cases in the state.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFrancisella tularensis 3aHaemaphysalis leporispalustris 3ahumans 3aminisatellite repeats 3apublic health 3aserological surveys 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atandem repeat sequences 3atularemia 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Wildxmicrobiology 2aDisease Reservoirsxmicrobiology 2aFrancisella tularensisxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aHistory, 20th Century 2aHistory, 21st Century 2aHumans 2aPopulation Surveillance 2aTularemiaxepidemiologyxhistory. 3aAlaska 0aAlaskaxepidemiology.1 aVogler, Amy J.1 aKeim, Paul1 aWagner, David M.1 aHueffer, Karsten0 tActa veterinaria scandinavica.g2011 Nov., v. 53dBioMed Centralx1751-01477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1751-0147-53-613Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02297naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245016700126300001600293520113300309650001601442650001301458650001401471650001001485650002001495650001401515650001501529650001301544650001301557650002101570650000901591650001801600650001201618651001201630651001001642653002901652700001801681700001801699773008001717852000901797930003301806945001301839946001101852655001201863IND2207011920221119023336.0000929e200001  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220701192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, K.A.10aNitrogen excretion by farm livestock with respect to land spreading requirements and controlling nitrogen losses to ground and surface waters. 2. Pigs and poultry  ap. 183-194.  aIn this paper, published and some unpublished information on excretion by pigs and poultry is reviewed. Well established relationships between feed and water intake and faecal and urinary output in fattening pigs have been adapted, using modern growth curves and typical commercial feeding practice, to make estimates of excretal output for a range of growing and finishing pigs and, also, breeding sows. Nitrogen (N) outputs were then estimated from typical excretal N content. For poultry, estimates were based on empirical data available from a range of production related studies and, for broilers and turkeys, a metabolic model relating litter output to liveweight, feed inputs and feed conversion. An alternative approach of estimating N excretion, via N balance calculations, was undertaken for fattening pigs and sows and for the major poultry categories, and provides some validation of the estimated standards, increasing confidence in their application. These standards are now incorporated into the guidelines already in place for Nitrate Vulnerable Zones in England and Wales and in the recently revised Water Code. 3abody weight 3abreeding 3aexcretion 3afarms 3afeed conversion 3afinishing 3aguidelines 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3asows 3asurface water 3aturkeys 3aEngland 3aWales 0anitrate vulnerable zones1 aCharles, D.R.1 aMoorhouse, D.0 tBioresource technology.g2000 Jan., v. 71, no. 2 p.183-194x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle04684naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166100002000184245013000204500002400334500001500358506007600373520241800449506003702867650001302904650002102917650002202938650001802960650001302978650001902991650001503010650001103025650001603036650001403052650002403066650003003090650001703120650002003137650001203157650002303169650001403192650003003206650001203236650003303248650003903281650005303320650001103373650002803384650002003412650002603432650003703458650003303495650002103528650003003549650004203579651001303621651002803634653000903662700002003671700001903691700002003710700002103730700002103751773008603772852000903858856008303867655001203950IND4464799320221207051705.0130118s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446479932DNAL7 a214737602pmid7 aPMC30833712pmcid7 a10.1186/1751-0147-53-242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMegersa, Bekele10aCattle brucellosis in traditional livestock husbandry practice in Southern and Eastern Ethiopia, and its zoonotic implication  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground Cattle brucellosis has significant economic and zoonotic implication for the rural communities in Ethiopia in consequence of their traditional life styles, feeding habits and disease patterns. Hence, knowledge of brucellosis occurrence in traditional livestock husbandry practice has considerable importance in reducing the economic and public health impacts of the disease. Methods A total of 1623 cattle sera were serially tested using the rose Bengal test as screening and complement fixation test as confirmatory tests. The Stata survey command was used to establish prevalences for the overall and individual variables, while potential risk factors for seropositivity were analyzed using a multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results The results showed that 3.5% (95% CI = 2.4, 4.5%) of the animals and 26.1% (95% CI = 18.6, 33.7) of the herds tested had antibodies against Brucella species. Village level seroprevalence ranged from 0% to 100%. A higher seroprevalence was observed in pastoral system than mixed farming although this variable was not significant in the final model. The final logistic regression model identified herd size; with large (odd ratio (OR) = 8.0, 95% CI = 1.9, 33.6) and medium herds (OR = 8.1, 95% CI = 1.9, 34.2) showing higher risk of Brucella infection when compared to small herds. Similarly, the odds of Brucella infection was higher in cattle aged above 4 years when compared to age groups of 1-2 (OR = 5.4, 2.1, 12.9) and 3-4 years (OR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.0, 9.6). Herd level analysis of the risk factors revealed that large and medium herds as well as herds kept with multiple livestock species were at higher risk of acquiring Brucella infection. Brucellosis in traditional livestock husbandry practices certainly poses a zoonotic risk to the public, in consequence of raw milk consumption, close contact with animals and provision of assistance during parturition. Due to lack of diagnostic facilities and information on its occurrence, human brucellosis is most likely misdiagnosed for other febrile diseases prevailing in the areas and treated empirically. Conclusions The results of this study demonstrated that bovine brucellosis is widely prevalent in the study areas particularly in pastoral production system. Hence, the study suggests the need for implementing control measures and raising public awareness on prevention methods of brucellosis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrucella 3amilk consumption 3arural communities 3apublic health 3araw milk 3aseroprevalence 3aantibodies 3acattle 3aparturition 3aherd size 3aregression analysis 3acomplement fixation tests 3arisk factors 3acontrol methods 3asurveys 3abovine brucellosis 3ascreening 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxblood 2aBrucellaxisolation & purification 2aBrucellosis, Bovinexepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aCattle 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aLogistic Models 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aNeutralization Testsxveterinary 2aRose Bengalxdiagnostic use. 2aRural Population 2aSeroepidemiologic Studies 2aZoonosesxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 3aEthiopia 0aEthiopiaxepidemiology. 0arisk1 aBiffa, Demelash1 aNiguse, Fekadu1 aRufael, Tesfaye1 aAsmare, Kassahun1 aSkjerve, Eystein0 tActa veterinaria scandinavica.g2011 Apr., v. 53dBioMed Centralx1751-01477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1751-0147-53-243Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02838naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166100002100184245013400205500002400339506007600363520122200439506003701661650001801698650001201716650001001728650001001738650000901748650002801757650001701785650001001802650001801812650001001830650001901840650001401859650001701873650001201890650001101902650003401913650002801947650004501975650002702020650001702047651002602064700002002090700002002110773008602130852000902216856008302225655001202308IND4464801520221207051733.0130118s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446480152DNAL7 a220854142pmid7 aPMC32275872pmcid7 a10.1186/1751-0147-53-592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSogstad, Åse M.10aAssociation of claw disorders with claw horn colour in norwegian red cattle - a cross-sectional study of 2607 cows from 112 herds  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aClaw disorders cause problems in dairy cattle all over the world. Nutrition, feeding, environment, claw trimming routines, hormonal changes related to calving and genetics are among the factors which influence the pathogenesis. The colour of the claw horn (pigmentation) has been suggested to play a role. The aim of this study was to investigate if there were any associations between the colour of the sole horn and claw disorders detected at claw trimming. Altogether, 2607 cows on 112 farms were claw trimmed once and the colour (dark, mixed or light) of the right lateral hind claw and hind claw disorders were recorded by 13 trained claw trimmers. The data were analysed using logistic regression models with logit link function, binomial distribution and herd and claw trimmer as repeated effects, with herd nested within claw trimmer. Haemorrhages of the sole (HS) and white line (HWL) were more frequently found in light than in dark claws (OR = 2.61 and 2.34, respectively). Both HS (OR = 1.43) and corkscrewed claws (OR = 1.84) were slightly more prevalent among cows which had claws with mixed colour versus dark claws. There were no significant associations of other claw disorders with claw horn colour.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNorwegian Red 3acalving 3aclaws 3acolor 3acows 3across-sectional studies 3adairy cattle 3afarms 3afoot diseases 3aherds 3alogit analysis 3anutrition 3apigmentation 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxepidemiology 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aFoot Diseasesxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aHoof and Clawxsurgery 2aPigmentation 0aNorwayxepidemiology.1 aFjeldaas, Terje1 aØsterås, Olav0 tActa veterinaria scandinavica.g2011 Nov., v. 53dBioMed Centralx1751-01477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1751-0147-53-593Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02794naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245018100166300001600347520178200363650001102145653002202156653000802178653000802186653002702194700002102221773011002242852000902352856008502361930003302446946001302479655001202492IND4400827920221119023229.0080203e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440082792DNAL7 a10.1007/s00251-005-0045-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorimine, Junzo 10aIntrahaplotype and interhaplotype pairing of bovine leukocyte antigen DQA and DQB molecules generate functional DQ molecules important for priming CD4⁺ T-lymphocyte responses  ap. 750-762.  aAntigen-specific CD4⁺ T-lymphocyte responses are restricted by major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, which influence T-cell priming during infection. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and bovine leukocyte antigen (BoLA) DRB3 and DQ genes are polymorphic, but unlike HLA, many BoLA haplotypes have duplicated DQ genes, and antibody-blocking studies indicated that BoLA-DQ molecules present various pathogen epitopes. Limited experimentation also suggested that BoLA-DQ molecules formed by interhaplotype pairing of A and B chains are functional. To compare antigen presentation by DR and DQ molecules and to definitively demonstrate functional BoLA-DQ molecules derived from interhaplotype pairing, different combinations of DR or DQ A and B proteins were expressed with CD80 in 293-F cells for use as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This approach identified 11 unique restriction elements including five DR and six DQ pairs for antigen-specific CD4⁺ T-cell responses against tick-transmitted bovine hemoparasites Anaplasma marginale or Babesia bovis. Interhaplotype pairing of DQ A and B molecules was demonstrated. Testing of six expressed DQA/B pairs from an animal with duplicated DQ haplotypes (DH16A/DH22H) demonstrated that an interhaplotype pair, DQA*2206/DQB*1301, presented A. marginale peptide B. In DH22H and DH16A homozygous animals, DQA*2206 was tightly linked with DQB*1402, and DQA*22021 was linked with DQB*1301. APCs from these donors could not present peptide B, confirming that DQA*2206/DQB*1301 encoded a functional interhaplotype pair. Functional BoLA-DQ molecules are generated by both intrahaplotype and interhaplotype pairing of A and B chains and play a similar role to BoLA-DR in priming helper T-cell responses to important pathogens. 3acattle 0aBoLA-MHC class II 0aDQA 0aDQB 0aInterhaplotype pairing1 aBrown, Wendy C. 0 tImmunogenetics.g2005 Nov., v. 57, no. 10 p.750-762dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0093-77117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00251-005-0045-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20080203b20080301c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02370naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001700136245010100153300001800254520125900272650002001531650001301551650001401564650001501578650001401593650001401607650001301621650001601634650001501650650001401665650000901679653001601688653001701704653002501721700002001746700001801766773009601784852000901880930003301889945001301922946001301935655001201948IND2051422520221119023446.0960528e199601  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205142252DNAL7 ano direct match2pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenani, J.V.10aLateral parabrachial nucleus and serotonergic mechanisms in the control of salt appetite in rats  ap.

The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of hypoxia in both adenosine A₁ and A₂A receptors endogenously expressed in C6 glioma cells. Two hours of hypoxia (5% O₂) caused a significant decrease in adenosine A₁ receptors. The same effect was observed at 6 h and 24 h of hypoxia. However, adenosine A₂A receptors were significantly increased at the same times. These effects were not due to hypoxia-induced alterations in cells number or viability. Changes in receptor density were not associated with variations in the rate of gene expression. Furthermore, hypoxia did not alter HIF-1α expression in C6 cells. However, HIF-3α, CREB and CREM were decreased. Adenosine A₁ and A₂A receptor density in normoxic C6 cells treated with adenosine for 2, 6 and 24 h was similar to that observed in cells after oxygen deprivation. When C6 cells were subjected to hypoxia in the presence of adenosine deaminase, the density of receptors was not significantly modulated. Moreover, DPCPX, an A₁ receptor antagonist, blocked the effects of hypoxia on these receptors, while ZM241385, an A₂A receptor antagonist, was unable to prevent these changes. These results suggest that moderate hypoxia modulates adenosine receptors and cAMP response elements in glial cells, through a mechanism in which endogenous adenosine and tonic A₁ receptor activation is involved. 3ahypoxia 0aadenosine receptors 0aC6 glioma cells 0adown-regulation1 aLeón, David.1 aRuiz, María Angeles1 aAlbasanz, José Luis1 aMartín, Mairena0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2008 June, v. 105, no. 6 p.2315-2329dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05314.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080606b20080704c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02694naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245007700147300001600224520135000240650002201590650000801612650002101620650001801641650001601659650002101675650001601696650001201712650000901724650002201733650002101755650001101776650000801787650003401795650001601829650002701845650002801872650001701900650002501917650002301942650002401965650001701989700001902006773009502025852000902120930003302129945001302162946001302175655001202188IND2207945820221119023353.0001122e200005  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220794582DNAL7 a109496922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBayraktar, E.10aProduction of citric acid using immobilized conidia of Aspergillus niger  ap. 117-125.  aConidia of Aspergillus niger were immobilized in calcium alginate gel for the production of citric acid. First, the type of the preactivation medium, together with the preactivation period, was investigated. It was found that A. niger requires a 2-d preactivation period at a 0.05 g/L NH4NO3 concentration. Second, preactivated cells were used to determine the effects of nitrogen concentration and the flow rate of oxygen and air on the production of citric acid. Maximum citric acid production was attained with medium containing 0.01 g/L of NH4NO3. The rate of citric acid production in the nitrogenous medium was 33% higher when oxygen was used instead of air during the production phase. This corresponds to an increase of 85% when compared to production when neither oxygen nor air was fed into the system. In the nonnitrogenous medium citric acid concentration remained similar regardless of the use of air or oxygen. However, in the nonnitrogenous production medium, citric acid production was not influenced considerably when oxygen was used instead of air. The advantage of using immobilized cells is that production is achieved easily in the continuous system. Therefore, citric acid production was also tested using a packed-bed bioreactor, and an increase in productivity by a factor of 22 was achieved compared to the batch system. 3aAspergillus niger 3aair 3aammonium nitrate 3abatch systems 3abioreactors 3acalcium alginate 3acitric acid 3aconidia 3agels 3aimmobilized cells 3anitrogen content 3aoxygen 2aAir 2aAspergillus nigerxmetabolism 2aBioreactors 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aCitric Acidxmetabolism 2aFermentation 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aSucrosexmetabolism 2aTime Factors1 aMehmetoglu, U.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2000 May, v. 87, no. 2 p.117-125x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a20010301b20010313c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle03526naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245010400124300001600228500001500244520218200259650002502441650001302466650001702479650002302496650001902519650001502538650000902553650001202562650001702574650001402591650001702605650001902622650001302641650001302654650002502667650001002692650001702702651001002719653001102729653001102740653001902751700001502770773017902785852000902964930003302973945001303006946001303019655001203032IND2206161120221119021909.0000801e200003  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220616112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKondo, S.10aCell wall metabolism and induction of ripening capacity in 'La France' pear as influenced by 2,4-DP  ap. 242-247.  a2019-12-05  aEffects of the synthetic auxin 2, 4-DP on fruit ripening of 'La France' pear (Pyrus communis L.) on 'Quince C' (Cydonia oblonga Mill. rootstock) were investigated. A solution of 2,4-DP at 90 microliter(.)L(-1) was applied 143, 151, and 159 days after full bloom (DAFB) to whole trees and compared with nonstored nontreated fruit and stored nontreated fruit (harvested 165 DAFB). Internal ethylene concentration in 2,4-DP-treated fruit increased more than in nonstored nontreated fruit and the level was higher the earlier the application time. Fruit firmness decreased earliest for fruit treated with 2,4-DP at 143 DAFB, followed by 151 DAFB-treated fruit and then 159 DAFB-treated fruit. In the nonstored nontreated fruit, firmness also showed a slight decrease with time. In all 2,4-DP treatments, water-soluble polyuronide (WSP) increased with ripening and hexametaphosphate-soluble polyuronide (HMP) and HCl-soluble polyuronide (HP) concentrations decreased. Most notably, WSP concentration increased earliest in fruit treated with 2,4-DP at 143 DAFB. Total concentration of neutral sugars from cell walls in each treatment decreased with time, and the levels in fruit treated with 2,4-DP at 143 DAFB were lowest at each sampling time. Arabinose concentrations were high compared with other neutral sugars throughout fruit ripening for each treatment, while glucose concentrations were high in nonripened fruit. At 193 DAFB, approximately equal to 85% of the fruit treated with 2,4-DP at 143 DAFB reached edible condition (firmness not more than 0.4 N(.)mm(-2)) on the tree. Furthermore, approximately equal to 85% of the fruit treated with 2,4-DP at 151 DAFB reached edible condition on 200 DAFB and close to 100% of the fruit treated with 2,4-DP at 159 DAFB on 207 DAFB. When ripened in a controlled room at 20 degrees C and 90% relative humidity after 2,4-DP treatment, the fruit treated earliest reached edible condition the soonest. Results demonstrate that 2,4-DP treatment can be used as an effective method of producing good quality fruit ripened on the tree, and that 2,4-DP may be an adequate replacement for cold storage conditioning to induce ripening capacity. 3achemical composition 3aethylene 3acrop quality 3aapplication timing 3aPyrus communis 3acell walls 3aears 3aglucose 3afood storage 3aarabinose 3afood quality 3apropionic acid 3afirmness 3aripening 3acell wall components 3a2,4-D 3acold storage 3aJapan 0asugars 0afruits 0aflowering date1 aTakano, Y.0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g2000 Mar., v. 125, no. 2 p.242-247aAmerican Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02166naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002800152245008600180300001800266520120800284653003001492653002901522653001601551653000901567653000901576700002801585773010601613852000901719856009201728930003301820946001101853655001201864IND4409811020221119021922.0080905e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440981102DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-0643.2007.00807.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLARSEN, THOMAS STAUFFER10aBone marrow histomorphology and JAK2 mutation status in essential thrombocythemia  ap. 1267-1273.  aA retrospective study of 38 essential thrombocythemia (ET) patients was conducted, reviewing bone marrow biopsies according to WHO criteria using a semiquantitative scoring system. Four patients did not fulfil the WHO criteria for a myeloproliferative disorder and one biopsy was insufficient for evaluation. 14 patients were reclassified as having prefibrotic idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF), whilst the ET diagnosis was sustained in 19 patients. The individual bone marrow parameters of the reviewed diagnosis showed no correlation with JAK2 V617F mutation status, which was determined by a highly sensitive quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) method. However, we could confirm previous findings of higher haemoglobin and lower platelet levels in the JAK2 V617F positive patients. Thus, the well-established phenotypic relationship of JAK2-positive ET and PV at the biochemical and molecular level was not recorded as regards bone marrow morphology according to the WHO criteria. Accordingly, the WHO concept of two distinct entities, ET and prefibrotic IMF, does not seem to fit the model of JAK2-positive ET as part of a biological continuum of JAK2 V617F-positive chronic myeloproliferative disorders. 0aEssential thrombocythemia 0aidiopathic myelofibrosis 0aprefibrotic 0aJAK2 0aqPCR1 aLarsen, Thomas Stauffer0 tAPMIS.g2007 Nov., v. 115, no. 11 p.1267-1273dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0903-46417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0643.2007.00807.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080905b20081011c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01892naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010200125300001600227520073600243650002300979650001801002650001101020650001701031650001501048650001401063650001501077650001101092650001101103650002101114650002301135653001101158653001601169653001501185700001701200700001801217773017901235852000901414930003301423945001301456946001301469655001201482IND2206157920221119022110.0000801e200003  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220615792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnoche, M.10aSpray application factors and plant growth regulator performance.

The best expressions were identified under the criteria that all the kinetic parameters should assume acceptable values in a feasible range and should result in the best fit of the experimental data. The kinetic parameters were estimated from steady-state data of several sugar concentrations in feeding stream (S(0) = 160, 170, 180, 190, 200 g/L), constant dilution rate (D = 0.2 h(-1)), recycle ratio (alpha = 13.6), and temperature (T = 30 degrees C). The best model for the yeast growth was of power-law type, whereas for the product formation the best model was of linear type.

Because of high viscosity, which develops during mashing, it was necessary to pretreat ground rye-water slurries with viscosity-reducing enzymes. There were no viscosity problems during the preparation of triticale mashes. Fermentations were conducted at 20 degrees C, with and without 16 mM urea as a nitrogenous supplement. All fermentations were completed within 120-144 h. Supplementation with urea shortened the times required for completion of fermentation by 33% for triticale and by 40% for rye. The fermentation efficiencies for both grains ranged between 90 and 93%. These values are comparable to those reported for wheat, implying competitiveness of rye and triticale as fermentation feedstocks to replace wheat. The final ethanol yields were 409 L for rye and 417-435 L for triticale/t (dry basis). For a given size of fermentation vessel, 33% more grain was used in the VHG fermentation process than in normal gravity fermentation. This resulted in a 35-56% increase in ethanol concentration in the beer, when fermentors were filled to a constant volume. The corresponding reduction in water use by about one-third would result in savings in energy consumption in mash heating, mash cooling, and ethanol distillation. Fermentation efficiencies and final ethanol yields obtained per unit weight of grain fermented were not significantly different from the normal gravity fermentations. 3abeers 3acooling 3adistillation 3aenergy conservation 3aenzymes 3aethanol 3aethanol fuels 3aethanol production 3afeedstocks 3afermentation 3afermenters 3afuel production 3aheat 3amash 3amashing 3arye 3aslurries 3atriticale 3aurea 3aviscosity 3awheat 0afermentation technology1 aThomas, K.C.1 aIngledew, W.M.1 aSosulksi, K.1 aSosulski, F.W.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g1998 Mar., v. 69, no. 3 p.157-175x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle03140naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245013100168300001600299520176100315650001402076650001302090650001302103650001502116650001302131650001702144650001102161650001502172650001402187650001802201650001102219650002302230650001902253650001402272650001302286650001502299650001302314653002102327700001802348700001502366700001702381773011502398852000902513856009202522930003302614946001102647655001202658IND4407668520221119021900.0080712e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440766852DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2435.2008.01421.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMouquet, N.10aModelling the relationship between a pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea) and its phytotelma community: mutualism or parasitism  ap. 728-737.  a1. To improve our understanding of the relationship between the pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea) and the phytotelma community inhabiting its leaves we built an exploratory, mechanistic model based on stochiometric constraints on carbon and nitrogen associated with prey decomposition. 2. Our theoretical results suggest that the phytotelma community is acting as a mineralizing system producing nitrogen for the plant. This is confirmed by data collected in the field and in the literature, that show the amount of nitrogen produced by the decomposition of prey is sufficiently high to be considered as a major source of nitrogen for the plant. 3. In our model, nitrogen yield is higher if the phytotelma community is restricted to bacteria alone than when the full food web is present. Nitrogen availability is negatively affected by bacterivores (rotifers and protozoa mostly) and positively affected by a cascading effect of mosquito larvae. 4. When sedimentation rate is high, mosquitoes have a global positive effect on nitrogen production because they indirectly reduce the amount of nitrogen lost through sedimentation more than they export nitrogen through pupation. On the other hand, when sedimentation rate is low there is a hump-shaped relationship between the uptake rate of bacterivores by mosquito larvae and the nitrogen yield in the plant. 5. We conclude that plant-bacteria and plant-mosquito interactions are predominantly mutualistic, whereas plant-bacterivore interactions are predominantly parasitic. Our work also illustrates how ecosystem properties (here nitrogen production by the phytotelma community) can be understood as a function of trophic complexity and can be seen as a product of selection at the scale of a community. 3aCulicidae 3aProtozoa 3aRotifera 3aSarracenia 3abacteria 3abacterivores 3acarbon 3aecosystems 3afood webs 3ainsect larvae 3aleaves 3amechanistic models 3amineralization 3amutualism 3anitrogen 3aparasitism 3apupation 0atrophic cascades1 aDaufresne, T.1 aGray, S.M.1 aMiller, T.E.0 tFunctional ecology.g2008 Aug., v. 22, no. 4 p.728-737dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-84637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2008.01421.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080712b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02024naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001300135245007800148300001600226500002400242520101600266650001201282650002201294650002301316650001601339650001301355650001101368650001301379650001201392650001501404650001101419650001401430700001201444700001801456773009201474852000901566856007501575655001201650IND4464855320221119021924.0130201s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446485532DNAL7 a10.1071/BT030422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShan, F.10aMeiotic chromosome behaviour and Boronia (Rutaceae) genome reorganisation  ap. 599-607.  aIncludes references  aMeiotic observation of nine genotypes of seven Boronia Sm. species revealed that B. megastigma Bartling (2n = 14), B. molloyae J.R.Drumm.

The effect of temperature and number of cycles on the efficiency of ASE was investigated: the best results were obtained by using a temperature of 100°C and one static cycle. A mixture of hexane/acetone 1:1 (v/v) was used as extraction solvent. Mean total method recovery under optimized conditions was 85%. The developed methodology was applied to the analysis of suspended particulate matter from Lake Maggiore waters (north of Italy). Mean PAH concentrations in suspended particulate matter from Lake Maggiore ranged from 0.2 ng L-¹ for anthracene to 18.7 ng L-¹ for naphthalene. 3aacetone 3aanthracenes 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahexane 3anaphthalene 3aparticulates 3asolvents 3atemperature 3awater pollution 2aAcetonexchemistry 2aAnthracenesxanalysis 2aFresh Waterxanalysis 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aHexanesxchemistry 2aNaphthalenesxanalysis 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxanalysis. 2aSolventsxchemistry 2aTemperature 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aItaly 3aLake Maggiore0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2005 Sept., v. 383, no. 1 p.107-114dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-005-3383-13Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20111102  aNon-US 7aarticle02533naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245010700124300001600231500001500247520132500262650001801587650001801605650001301623650002701636650002001663650000701683650001901690650001401709650001601723650002801739651001201767653002101779653001501800653001301815700001701828700001901845773017901864852000902043930003302052945001302085946001302098655001202111IND2206477220221119021854.0000817e200007  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220647722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarsh, K.10aPPi formation by reversal of the tonoplast-bound H+-pyrophosphatase from 'Valencia' orange juice cells  ap. 420-424.  a2019-12-05  aTonoplast vesicles isolated from juice cells of mature 'Valencia' oranges [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck] showed similar tonoplast-bound vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) and inorganic pyrophosphatase (V-PPiase) activity as measured by product formation. Both proton pumps were able to generate a similar pH gradient, although steady-state was reached faster with ATP as substrate. When a delta pH of 3 units was imposed (vesicle lumen pH of 4.5 and incubation medium of 7.5), tonoplast-bound PPiase was not able to significantly amplify the existing delta pH. Although not able to function as a H+ pump, V-PPiase effectively synthesized PPi in the presence of inorganic phosphate (Pi). Formation of PPi by V-PPiase was enhanced by ATP but inhibited by NaF, gramicidin, and by antibodies raised against V-PPiase from mung bean [Vigna radiata (L.) R. Wilcz. (Syn. Phaseolus aureus Roxb.)]. Immunological analysis demonstrated an increase in V-PPiase protein with fruit maturity. Data indicate that under in vivo conditions, the V-PPiase of mature orange juice cells acts as a source of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) but not as a H+ pump. We propose that synthesis of PN provides a mechanism for recovery of stored energy in the form of the pH gradient across the vacuole during later stages of development and postharvest storage. 3aplant tissues 3ahydrogen ions 3avacuoles 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aCitrus sinensis 3apH 3apyrophosphates 3atonoplast 3aproton pump 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aFlorida 0apyrophosphatases 0asubstrates 0avesicles1 aGonzalez, P.1 aEcheverria, E.0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g2000 July, v. 125, no. 4 p.420-424aAmerican Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02412naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001500149245016400164300001600328500002400344520136900368650002001737650001101757650001301768650001401781700001801795700001701813700001501830700001601845773013901861852000902000856008902009655001202098IND4464871620221119021838.0130204s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446487162DNAL7 a10.1016/S1537-5110(03)00044-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParloo, E.10aModelling of Sprayer Boom Dynamics by Means of Maximum Likelihood Identification Techniques, Part 1: A Comparison of Input-output and Output-only Modal Testing  ap. 163-171.  aIncludes references  aIt is a well-known fact that the linear dynamic behaviour of mechanical structures can be studied by modelling the relation between force(s) [input(s)], acting on the structure, and their resulting structural vibration response(s) [output(s)]. For industrial structures, in their real in-operation conditions, it often becomes hard (or impossible) to experimentally measure the excitation. For this reason, attention has been paid to the development of system identification techniques that work on a basis of response data only. The use of such techniques allows the identification of modal models for structures excited by unknown ambient noise and vibration. In this contribution, controlled vibration experiments were conducted on a sprayer boom that was mounted on a tractor. A comparison was made between the results of a classic input-output and output-only modal analysis based on maximum likelihood system identification techniques. Due to the interaction between the dynamic artificial excitation device and the test structure, the output-only approach modelled the excitation device together with the test structure. The identified output-only modal parameters were validated by direct comparison to the identification results obtained on a classic input-output transfer function data set between the generator input signal and the structural responses. 3adata collection 3amodels 3atractors 3avibration1 aGuillaume, P.1 aAnthonis, J.1 aHeylen, W.1 aSwevers, J.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2003 June, v. 85, no. 2 p.163-171dPublished for Silsoe Research Institute by Academic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1537-5110(03)00044-83Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02599naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245012300185300001600308500001500324520073800339650002701077650001501104650001301119650001601132650001301148650002601161650001301187650001401200650002701214650001301241650005401254650004201308650001901350650001201369650002101381650003501402650003901437650002401476650002401500650003201524653001701556653001301573653002901586700002501615700002301640700002401663700002401687773013501711852000901846856008501855930003301940945002501973946001101998655001202009IND4401023720221119021645.0080203e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440102372DNAL7 a160825312pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-005-3387-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchupp, Peter J.10aUse of solid-phase extraction to enable enhanced detection of acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) in environmental samples  ap. 132-137.  a2019-12-04  aA challenge for understanding the role of bacterial cell-cell signalling in the environment is the detection of those signals, which are often present in low (nmol L-¹) concentrations. We describe here a simple purification method, solid-phase extraction (SPE), for increasing the sensitivity of detection for one such group of signals, acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), in environmental samples. Spiking of dried marine sponge tissue (Stylinos sp.) with AHLs resulted in detection down to 0.01 ppm for 3-oxo-hexanoyl homoserine lactone (3-oxo C₆-HSL) and 1 ppm for hexanoyl homoserine lactone (C₆-HSL). Compared with liquid extraction methods use of SPE resulted in twofold and tenfold improvements in sensitivity, respectively. 3achemical concentration 3ahomoserine 3asampling 3aenvironment 3alactones 3aaquatic invertebrates 3aPorifera 3adetection 3asolid phase extraction 3abacteria 2a4-Butyrolactonexanalogs & derivativesxanalysis. 2aAgrobacterium tumefaciensxmetabolism 2aAminoacylation 2aAnimals 2aBiological Assay 2aBiosensing Techniquesxmethods 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxanalysis 2aHexanolsxchemistry 2aPoriferaxchemistry 2aSensitivity and Specificity 0apurification 0aStylinos 0aacyl homoserine lactones1 aCharlton, Timothy S.1 aTaylor, Michael W.1 aKjelleberg, Staffan1 aSteinberg, Peter D.0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2005 Sept., v. 383, no. 1 p.132-137dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-005-3387-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110429b20110507c00000000  aINDdTEMeYLP 2011/0  aNon-US 7aarticle03075naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002000149245009100169300001600260500002400276520195800300650002102258650001602279650001902295650001802314650001102332650001302343650002102356650001402377650001502391650001502406650001302421650001702434700001302451773013902464852000902603856008902612655001202701IND4464872120221119021635.0130204s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446487212DNAL7 a10.1016/S1537-5110(03)00048-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNdegwa, Pius M.10aSampling Procedures for Piggery Slurry in Deep Pits for Estimation of Nutrient Content  ap. 239-248.  aIncludes references  aAccurate application rates of pig manure during pump out time depend on the correct determination of nutrient contents of the manure, which in turn is a function of the integrities of the samples or the sampling method. This study compared two sampling methods for obtaining representative samples from three different sources of manure prior to the actual pump out time from pig manure stored in pits, to a control method. In addition, empirical relationships between nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and total solids that could help in quicker determinations of the manure nutrient contents on-site during scheduled pump out time were also investigated. Results showed that, stirring representative manure in a 200 l barrel for a period of at least 5 min using a paddle-stirrer such as the one described in this study is adequate for complete homogenisation of manure essential for drawing off a representative sample from any point in the barrel. Further, results showed that, the use of a sump pump (such as the one described in this study) placed at the bottom of a similar barrel and oriented to shoot manure horizontally is also adequate for homogenising the manure after 5 min of operation: a procedure that also allows for collection of a representative sample from any point in the container. Using the above two techniques, correct nutrient determinations are possible before the pumpout date, allowing for proper planning of the manure application in the field. The value for correlation coefficient R of 0·24 for a linear regression between total solids (TS) and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) using data obtained in this study was low suggesting that the content of TS cannot be used to estimate the TKN content. However, the value for the correlation coefficient R of 0·92 for a linear regression between TS and total phosphorus (TP) obtained using data from this study indicated that, TS can be used to estimate the TP in the manure. 3aapplication rate 3acorrelation 3ahomogenization 3alinear models 3amixing 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3apig manure 3aplanning 3atotal solids1 aZhu, Jun0 tBiosystems engineering.g2003 June, v. 85, no. 2 p.239-248dPublished for Silsoe Research Institute by Academic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1537-5110(03)00048-53Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03724naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001100128245011500139300001600254500001500270520153500285650001301820650001801833650002101851650002201872650002401894650001901918650002501937650002001962650001401982650001101996650001402007650002102021650001002042650002002052650002402072650001802096650002302114650003302137650001602170650005002186650002702236650002802263650003102291650003402322650001902356650004002375650003002415650002902445650002502474650002402499650002702523650003402550650003602584653002102620653002102641653002102662653002802683653003502711653002502746653002102771653002102792700001802813773008102831852000902912930003302921945001302954946001102967655001202978IND2196658820221119021907.0990126e199807  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219665882DNAL7 a96785702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Z.14aThe ltk gene family encodes novel receptor-like kinases with temporal expression in developing maize endosperm  ap. 749-761.  a2019-12-05  aWe describe the isolation and characterization of maize cDNAs that are transcribed from a small gene family and encode a novel group of receptor-like kinases (RLKs). The distinctive extracellular domain of these novel RLKs includes a unique number and arrangement of leucine-rich repeats (SRR), a proline-rich region (PRR), a putative protein degradation target sequence (PEST), and a serine-rich region (SRR). The intracellular domain contains a putative serine/threonine protein kinase. To distinguish them from other reported RLKs, these novel RLKs were termed leucine-rich repeat transmembrane protein kinases (LTKs). Based on analysis of available deduced protein sequences, LTK1 and LTK2 were predicted to be 92.1% identical, while LTK2 and LTK3 were predicted to be 97.5% identical. Though the three LTK proteins showed high homology, the region that most distinguished LTK1 from LTK2 and LTK3 was found in the extracellular domain, in the SRR. To differentiate between expression of the individual ltk genes, we used the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in combination with restriction enzyme analysis. While ltk1 transcripts were constantly present in all tissues tested, ltk2 and ltk3 transcripts were only detected in the endosperm. Furthermore, transcript levels for both ltk1 and ltk2 showed modulation during endosperm development, peaking at 20 days after pollination. These results suggest that members of the ltk gene family mediate signals associated with seed development and maturation. 3aZea mays 3amessenger RNA 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3aopen reading frames 3aembryo (plant) 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aendosperm 3aleaves 3areceptors 3amultigene family 3aroots 3aseed maturation 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aGene Dosage 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxphysiology 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Familyxgenetics 2aOpen Reading Framesxgenetics 2aPlant Proteins 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aProtein Kinasesxgenetics 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aRNA, Plantxanalysis 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aZea maysxenzymologyxgenetics. 0agenbank/af023267 0agenbank/af023165 0agenbank/af023164 0amolecular sequence data 0aserine/threonin protein kinase 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/af023166 0aseed development1 aWurtzel, E.T.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1998 July, v. 37, no. 5 p.749-761x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03176naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245012700129300001600256500001500272520180400287650001402091650001402105650004702119650002202166650002102188650002802209650001502237650002002252650003202272650001302304653002202317653002002339653001002359700001902369700001902388700001802407700001502425700001602440700001602456773017802472852000902650930003302659945001302692946001302705655001202718IND2322181620221119022112.0010724e200105  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232218162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOraguzie, N.C.10aGenetic diversity and relationships in Malus sp. germplasm collections as determined by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA  ap. 318-328.  a2019-12-05  aFour subsets of apple (Malus Mill.) germplasm representing modern and old cultivars from the repository and apple genetics population of the Horticulture and Food Research Institute of New Zealand Limited were used in this study. A total of 155 genotypes randomly chosen from the four subsets were analyzed for random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) variation. Nine decamer primers generated a total of 43 fragments, 42 of which were polymorphic across the 155 genotypes. Pairwise distances were calculated between germplasm subsets using the distance metric algorithm in S-PLUS, and used to examine intra-and inter-subset variance components by analysis of molecular variation (AMOVAR). A phenogram based on unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average (UPGMA) cluster analysis was constructed from the pairwise distances and a scatter plot was generated from principal coordinate analysis. The AMOVAR showed that most of the variation in the germplasm (94.6%) was found within subsets, suggesting that there is significant variation among the germplasm. The grouping of genotypes based on the phenogram and scatter plot generally did not reflect the pedigree or provenance of the genotypes. It is possible that more RAPD markers are needed for determining genetic relationships in apple germplasm. Nevertheless, the variation observed in the study suggests that the current practice of sublining populations in the first generation to control inbreeding may not be necessary in subsequent generations. If these results are confirmed by fully informative molecular markers, germplasm managers should reassess the structure of their genetics populations. There may be a need to combine sublines in order to capture the maximum genetic diversity available and to streamline breeding efforts. 3agermplasm 3acultivars 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3agenetic variation 3agenetic distance 3aplant genetic resources 3agene banks 3aMalus domestica 3ainterspecific hybridization 3agenotype 0amalus kirghisorum 0amalus sieversii 0aMalus1 aGardiner, S.E.1 aBasset, H.C.M.1 aStefanati, M.1 aBall, R.D.1 aBus, V.G.M.1 aWhite, A.G.0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g2001 May, v. 126, no. 3 p.318-328aAmerican Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02020naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001300157245004100170300001400211500001500225520087500240650002101115650001701136650003601153650001901189650002701208650001301235650001101248653001701259700001701276700001701293700001401310700001701324700001501341700001701356773006901373852000901442856007801451930003301529945001301562946001101575655001201586IND2041381020221119022040.0940810s1993    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204138102DNAL7 a241961752pmid7 a10.1007/BF002323072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGozu, Y.10aIn vitro propagation of Iris pallida  ap. 12-16.  a2019-12-05  aPlantlets were regenerated from callus of Iris pallida, an important perfume plant.

Yellow calli grew with partial differentiation into white tissue, probably embryogenic, during subculture on the same medium with a 16-h photoperiod. Only yellow-colored calli with the white tissue could differentiate into plantlets after transfer to kinetin- or gibberellin- supplemented LS medium. Regenerated plantlets which grew on the medium without growth regulators were transferred to the soil. After 2 years of cultivation in soil, the regenerated plants flowered and formed rhizomes.

Groundwater samples were collected and analyzed at 42 sites in December 2001 and October 2006. A comparative study of hydrochemical data indicates: groundwater is mildly alkaline with a pH of 7.0-8.2; electrical conductivity (EC) varies from 605 to 5,770 μS/cm in December 2001, and 652-5,310 μS/cm in October 2006. More than 62% of the groundwater samples in 2006 have TDS value <2,000 mg/l, which is within permissible limit of potable water, but 57% of the samples in 2001, are higher than the maximum permissible limit. Extremely low HCO₃/Cl and variable high Mg/Ca (molar ratios) had been indicated the transformation of the fresh groundwater aquifer systems to saline in 2001. Groundwater of this Island is mainly classified as Na-Cl and mixed types. A high percentage of Na-Cl type of these waters indicates the possibility of seawater ingression/intrusion process during 2001 and comparatively mixed water type indicates the dilution activities of groundwater. Excessive withdrawal of groundwater has caused the increase of saline water intrusion. Improvement of groundwater quality in this Island due to artificial recharge structures made by NGRI under RGNDWM project and affects of the flood due to heavy rainfall of the months of September-October 2005 are discussed in this paper. 3ahydrochemistry 3aions 3asalinity 3aIndia 0aIntrusion 0aPotharlanka Island1 aSingh, V.

'Maurin Makea', 'Ottawa', and 'Muskoka') were sampled from October to April. Carbohydrate contents of canes and flower buds were analyzed, and cold hardiness (LT(50)) was determined by controlled freezing. Starch, sucrose, glucose, fructose, and minor amounts of raffinose and stachyose were present in both cane and bud tissues. Glucose and fructose were the predominant sugars in buds. In canes, the proportion of sucrose of all sugars was greater than in buds. Seasonal changes in carbohydrates were related to changes in cold hardiness and mean air temperature during a 5-day period preceding sampling. Starch decreased during fall and was barely detectable in midwinter. Soluble carbohydrates accumulated to 73 to 89 mg(.)g(-1) dry weight in canes and 113 to 131 mg(.)g(-1) dry weight in buds in midwinter. The most striking increase occurred in the concentration of sucrose, but glucose, fructose, raffinose, and stachyose also accumulated. There was a positive correlation between LT(50) and the amount of starch, but a negative correlation between LT(50) and the amounts of total soluble carbohydrates, sucrose, glucose, and fructose. High levels of sucrose, total soluble carbohydrates, and a high ratio of sucrose to glucose plus fructose were characteristic of a hardy cultivar. Results are evidence of the importance of carbohydrate reserves, especially sucrose, on winter survival of red raspberry. 3aRubus idaeus 3acultivars 3ashoots 3aseasonal variation 3abuds 3astarch 3asucrose 3aglucose 3afructose 3araffinose 3astachyose 3aair temperature 3acold tolerance 0aratios0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g1999 Sept., v. 124, no. 5 p.507-513aAmerican Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL  a20000702b20000711c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle04258naa a2200973 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245013200142300001600274500001500290520145100305650001701756650002301773650001001796650002101806650002001827650002501847650002101872650001201893650001301905650001101918650001801929650002201947650003101969650002502000650002202025650001702047650001302064650002002077650001002097650001102107650002202118650002802140650001402168650002402182650002602206650001802232650004902250650002302299650003202322650002302354650002102377650003602398650003402434650001502468650001802483650002802501650002302529650005802552650002002610650005302630650002602683650004202709650003402751650002702785653001502812653001902827653002802846653002302874653001602897653001902913653001802932653001602950653002502966700001402991700001503005700001603020700001403036700001703050700001403067700001503081700001403096700001503110773008103125852000903206930003303215945001303248946001103261655001203272IND2196733120221119022107.0990129e199806  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219673312DNAL7 a96178192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, C.Y.12aA new class II rice chitinase, Rcht2, whose induction by fungal elicitor is abolished by protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitor  ap. 523-534.  a2019-12-05  aAmong the four classes of chitinase, a class II chitinase had not yet been reported for rice. We have isolated and characterized a class II acidic chitinase, Rcht2, from rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Cheongcheongbyeo). The protein consists of a single polypeptide chain of 261 amino acid residues and includes a putative signal sequence of 29 amino acids at its N-terminus. It has a calculated molecular mass of 27 642 Da and an isoelectric point of 5.56. The Rcht2 chitinase lacks the cysteine-rich and hinge domains in the N-terminal region of the protein, which is the criterion for its classification as a class II chitinase. Comparison of the genomic and the cDNA sequence revealed that the coding region of Rcht2 consist of three exons of 301, 112, and 370 bp separated by two introns of 89 and 984 bp. In suspension-cultured rice cells, the transcript level of Rcht2 was dramatically increased by treatment with both glycol chitin and fungal elicitor. The application of protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitors, calyculin A and okadaic acid, effectively abolished the induction of Rcht2 in response to fungal elicitor. In contrast, the activation of Rcht2 transcript was not inhibited by both cycloheximide and protein kinase inhibitors. These results demonstrate that protein dephosphorylation events play a crucial role in the elicitor-mediated induction of Rcht2 in rice cells, while de novo protein synthesis is not required for induction. 3aOryza sativa 3aMagnaporthe grisea 3aroots 3astructural genes 3agene expression 3acell wall components 3amultigene family 3aintrons 3amycelium 3aleaves 3amessenger RNA 3acomplementary DNA 3aphosphoprotein phosphatase 3aamino acid sequences 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aokadaic acid 3aethephon 3aenzyme activity 3aexons 3achitin 3amercuric chloride 3acell suspension culture 3achitinase 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAscomycotaxchemistry 2aBase Sequence 2aChitinasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCycloheximidexpharmacology 2aDNA, Complementary 2aEnzyme Induction 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aFungal Proteinsxpharmacology 2aHydrolysis 2aIon Transport 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOryzaxenzymology. 2aPhosphoprotein Phosphatasesxantagonists & inhibitors 2aPhosphorylation 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Phosphatase 1 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTranscription, Genetic 0archt2 gene 0agenbank/l40338 0amolecular sequence data 0agenetic regulation 0aderivatives 0agenbank/l40336 0aglycol chitin 0acalyculin a 0anucleotide sequences1 aGal, S.W.1 aChoe, M.S.1 aJeong, S.Y.1 aLee, S.I.1 aCheong, Y.H.1 aLee, S.H.1 aChoi, Y.J.1 aHan, C.D.1 aKang, K.Y.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1998 June, v. 37, no. 3 p.523-534x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03292naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245017500143300001600318520124100334650001701575650002801592650002001620650002701640650001501667650000801682650000801690650002501698650002401723650001101747650002801758650001501786650001601801650001101817650001901828650002001847650003001867650004901897650002101946650001101967650002201978650003402000650005502034650003702089650006802126650002902194650003802223653003302261653001602294653001202310653004202322653002502364700001702389700001702406700001302423700001702436700001802453773008102471852000902552930003302561945001302594946001102607655001202618IND2196731920221119021318.0990129e199806  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219673192DNAL7 a96178162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuka, I.10aBiochemical and immunological characterization of rice homologues of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 Tat binding protein and subunit 4 of human 26S proteasome subunits  ap. 495-504.  aPreviously, we isolated two cDNA clones, TBPOs-1 and TBPOs-2, encoding putative ATPases that are the rice homologues of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) Tat binding protein-1 and subunit 4 of human 26S proteasome. In order to determine the RNA-dependent ATPase activity of these putative proteins, the subclones from these cDNA clones were expressed in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins with maltose-binding protein. The recombinant proteins stimulated ATP hydrolysis in the presence of poly(U) and rice total RNA. In contrast, single- and double-stranded forms of HindIII-digested lambda phage DNA are less effective at stimulating ATP hydrolysis. Western blot analysis using antisera against the TBPOs proteins showed a widespread appearance of these proteins in rice tissues and cultured cells. The TBPOs proteins were also found around the region where rice proteasomes would sediment. In addition, the TBPOs-1 protein bound to tobacco TATA-binding protein in vitro. Thus, we suggest that the TBPOs proteins are novel RNA-dependent ATPases characteristic of DEAD-box proteins and propose that the TPBOs proteins can exist in rice proteasomes. Further, the TBPOs-1 protein is thought to play a role in transcriptional events. 3aOryza sativa 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aenzyme activity 3aadenosine triphosphate 3ahydrolysis 3aRNA 3aDNA 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aleaves 3acell suspension culture 3aorganelles 3aproteinases 3ahumans 3aviral proteins 3aanimal proteins 2aAdenosine Triphosphatases 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aHIV-1xchemistry 2aHumans 2aOryzaxchemistry. 2aPeptide Hydrolasesxchemistry 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aProteasome Endopeptidase Complex 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxchemistryximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aTATA-Box Binding Protein 2aTranscription Factorsxmetabolism 0ahuman immunodeficiency virus 0acomparisons 0abinding 0arna-dependent adenosinetriphosphatase 0atata-binding protein1 aYanagawa, Y.1 aYamazaki, K.1 aUeda, T.1 aNakagawa, H.1 aHashimoto, J.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1998 June, v. 37, no. 3 p.495-504x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02918naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245012700145300001600272500001500288520114800303650002501451650001301476650001801489650002501507650002001532650001001552650001801562650002501580650001801605650001001623650001601633650001101649650003201660650007501692650001301767650002801780650001701808650001001825650002801835650004201863650004801905653002101953653001501974653000901989653001601998653002802014653002102042653001302063653002102076700001402097700001602111700001802127773008102145852000902226930003302235945001302268946001102281655001202292IND2196730320221119021230.0990129e199806  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219673032DNAL7 a96178132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeaver, L.M.12aA comparison of the expression patterns of several senescence-associated genes in response to stress and hormone treatment  ap. 455-469.  a2019-12-05  aThe expression of several Arabidopsis thaliana senescence-associated genes (SAGs) in attached and/or detached leaves was compared in response to age, dehydration, darkness, abscisic acid, cytokinin, and ethylene treatments. Most of the SAGs responded to most of the treatments in a similar fashion. Detachment in darkness and ethylene were the strongest inducers of both SAGs and visible yellowing. Detachment in light was also a strong inducer of SAGs, but not of visible yellowing. The other treatments varied more in their effects on individual SAGs. Responses were examined in both older and younger leaves, and generally were much stronger in the older ones. Individual SAGs differed from the norms in different ways, however, suggesting that their gene products play a role in overlapping but not identical circumstances. Some SAGs responded quickly to treatments, which may indicate a direct response. Others responded more slowly, which may indicate an indirect response via treatment-induced senescence. Four new SAGs were isolated as part of this work, one of which shows strong similarity to late embryogenesis-abundant (Lea) genes. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aethylene 3amessenger RNA 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3agenes 3abenzyladenine 3anucleotide sequences 3aabscisic acid 3alight 3achlorophyll 3aleaves 2aAbscisic Acidxpharmacology 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aDarkness 2aEthylenesxpharmacology 2aGenes, Plant 2aLight 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxpharmacology 2aPlant Physiological Phenomenaxdrug effects 0agenbank/af053063 0asenescence 0adark 0adesiccation 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/af053064 0aleaf age 0agenbank/af0530651 aGan, S.S.1 aQuirino, B.1 aAmasino, R.M.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1998 June, v. 37, no. 3 p.455-469x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02342naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245007600144300001400220520071400234650001600948650001400964650001400978650001300992650001201005650002201017650001701039650001501056650001101071650001501082650002201097650001601119650001101135650002801146650001401174650002601188650002401214650002801238650001201266650003301278650003101311650001501342650001301357650002301370650003201393650002001425650003201445650001601477650001101493700001801504700001601522700002701538773009501565852000901660930003301669945001301702946001301715655001201728IND2332573520221119021311.0030515e200301  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233257352DNAL7 a124952052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBustos, G.10aModeling of the hydrolysis of sugar cane bagasse with hydrochloric acid  ap. 51-68.  aSugar cane bagasse was hydrolyzed under different concentrations of hydrochloric acid (2-6%), reaction times (0-300 min), and temperatures (100-128 degrees C).

Further epidemiological studies are needed to examine this relationship more fully; additional experimental work is required to determine the mechanisms by which dietary fat influences mammary cancer in animals. Dietary carbohydrate and minor dietary components, such as retinoids and certain trace elements, also appear to influence mammary cancer in animals. Decreasing the fat content of the diet may offer a practical means of reducing mortality from breast cancer, which continues to be a major cause of death in many parts of the world.

Frequent rearrangements of T4 lysozyme transgenes were detected. A vector derivative containing two matrix associated regions (MARs) flanking its multiple cloning site was constructed. In transgenic potato plants, reduced variability in gene expression due to position effects was detected. When either the donor vector contained MAR sequences, or when vector pPCV701 which contains a pBR322 fragment next to the left border were used, only relatively few rearrangements were observed. However, when the T4 lysozyme gene was driven by a CaMV 35S promoter modified by multiplied enhancer region carrying either 2 or 4 elements, frequent rearrangements were again obtained. 3alysozyme 3agenetic transformation 3agene transfer 3arecombinant DNA 3atransgenic plants 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aplasmid vectors 3aSolanum tuberosum 3atransfer DNA 3abacteriophages 3agene expression 3agenes 3aCauliflower mosaic virus 3apromoter regions 2aBlotting, Southern 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGenetic Vectors 2aGenome, Plant 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aRhizobiumxgenetics 2aTransformation, Genetic 0aenhancer sequences 0a35s promoter 0agenetic recombination 0aposition effect 0amatrix associated regions 0at-dna binary vector 0anucleotide sequences 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aJahnke, A.1 aDuring, K.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1998 June, v. 37, no. 3 p.581-585x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03251naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245008400146300001600230500001500246520101700261650002501278650001801303650002201321650003001343650002501373650002001398650002101418650001201439650001901451650002301470650001901493650001401512650002001526650001101546650002101557650002301578650002401601650005101625650001801676650002301694650002601717650003301743650002501776650002001801650001701821650002801838650004201866650003301908650003001941650004301971650004202014650003802056650003402094650002402128653002102152653002802173653001202201653002102213653001202234653002502246653002102271700001302292700001402305700001502319773008102334852000902415930003302424945001302457946001102470655001202481IND2196756220221119021538.0990130e199807  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219675622DNAL7 a96870632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakahashi, T.10aIdentification by PCR of receptor-like protein kinases from Arabidopsis flowers  ap. 587-596.  a2019-12-05  aWe have isolated three receptor-like kinase cDNAs from an Arabidopsis flower cDNA library by PCR using degenerate oligonucleotide primers for conserved domains of protein kinases. Cloning and sequencing of the full-length cDNAs, designated RKF1 to 3 (receptor-like kinase in flowers), showed that the putative extracellular domain of the RKF1 protein contains 13 tandem repeats of leucine-rich sequences and those of RKF2 and RKF3 have no significant homology with other plant sequences. RNA blot analysis revealed that the RKF1 mRNA is highly expressed in stamens while RKF2 and RKF3 mRNAs are present at low levels in all organs examined. In situ localization experiments indicated that the RKF1 mRNA is detectable in early flower primordia and during stamen development. In addition, when fused to a GUS reporter gene, the RKF1 promoter directed high GUS expression in pollen grains. Recombinant RKF1, produced in Escherichia coli, was found to have kinase activity with serine/threonine specificity in vitro. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amessenger RNA 3acomplementary DNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aflower primordia 3aintrons 3areporter genes 3achromosome mapping 3ahistochemistry 3areceptors 3aenzyme activity 3apollen 3apromoter regions 3abeta-glucuronidase 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Structuresxenzymology 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aProtein Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Plantxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTissue Distribution 0agenbank/af024649 0amolecular sequence data 0astamens 0agenbank/af024648 0aflowers 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/af0246501 aMu, J.H.1 aGasch, A.1 aChua, N.H.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1998 July, v. 37, no. 4 p.587-596x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03015naa a2200625 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002100133245008100154300001600235500002300251520128500274650001601559650001801575650002401593650002201617650001501639650001001654650000901664650001201673650004601685650003001731650002401761650001501785650003501800650000901835650002501844650003201869650003601901650003501937650001101972650001101983650000901994650000902003650001602012650002702028650003702055650001402092650000902106650001202115650002602127650001002153650002402163653001202187700001902199773009602218852000902314939003302323945000802356946001302364655001202377991585305750742620221119021354.0820414e198202  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI820005582DNAL7 a70392932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWack, Jeffery T.10aSmoking and its effects on body weight and the systems of caloric regulation  ap. 366-380.  aLiterature review.  aExtract: Cigarette smoking and excess body weight, each of which contributes to poor health and risk of death, appear to be inversely related. Data indicate that smokers weigh less than nonsmokers, and that weight gain occurs after the cessation of smoking. The popular wisdom is that this is due to differences in caloric intake; smokers weigh less because they consume less, and they gain weight upon stopping smoking as a consequence of consuming more. Cross-sectional data on this point are conflicting. Some studies of daily caloric intake suggest that smokers may, in fact, consume more calories a day than nonsmokers. In addition to affecting ingestive behavior, however, cigarette smoking has a variety of physiological effects that may play a more important role than amount of calories consumed in accounting for lower body weights among smokers and weight gain after cessation. Evidence regarding the effects of cigarette smoking and nicotine upon the behavioral, sensory, and metabolic components of the processes of caloric regulation and nutrition is reviewed in order to suggest mechanisms by which smoking may affect weight. Longitudinal within-subject designs investigating changes associated with the cessation and initiation of smoking are recommended.

Levels of putrescine, cadaverine and bacterial loads increased (P < 0.05) during storage, but histamine and tyramine were not detected in any of the tested samples. Initial concentrations of putrescine and cadaverine were 0.24 and 0.07 mm/kg, and finally reached 5.27 and 4.21 mg/kg, respectively. Correlations were found between putrescine and psychrotrophs, and between cadaverine and pseudomonads. The putrescine and cadaverine content ofwhole Southern Caspian Kutum seemed to be good quality markers and freshness indicators. In our previous study, the presence of contents of biogenic amines in rainbow trout was demonstrated. However, this research was undertaken by testing Caspian Kutum, which was sold in the fish markets in Iran so that a better understanding of the safety quality of the products can be accomplished to better protect the health of the consumers. According to this research, levels of putrescine, cadaverine and bacterial loads increased during iced storage as both biogenic amines cadaverine and putrescine are good quality markers for the Caspian Kutum. 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aPseudomonas 3aRutilus frisii 3aRutilus kutum 3acadaverine 3afish 3afreshness 3ahistamine 3aice 3amarkets 3amicrobial load 3amonitoring 3aproduct safety 3aputrescine 3astorage time 3atyramine 3aIran1 aJaʻfarī, Ḥusayn.1 aSAHARI, MOHAMMAD ALI1 aHOSSEINI, HEDAYAT1 aMONTAZERI, NAIM1 aPARVIZ, MOHAMMAD1 aNAZARINIA, ABDULLAH0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2007 Aug., v. 31, no. 4 p.541-550dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4514.2007.00128.x 7aarticle02869naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245015000127300001600277500001500293520162400308650001401932650002601946650001501972650002101987650001202008650001702020650001402037650001902051650001302070650002002083650001702103650001102120653002502131653001502156653001102171700001702182773018002199852000902379930003302388945001302421946001302434655001202447IND2204171720221119021340.0000428e199909  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220417172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLester, G.E.10aPostharvest application of calcium and magnesium to honeydew and netted muskmelons: effects on tissue ion concentrations, quality, and senescence  ap. 545-552.  a2019-12-05  aMuskmelon senescence is directly associated with a decline in hypodermal mesocarp membrane integrity and its Ca concentration, but infusing Ca into melons has been a problem. Fully ripened and abscised hybrid honeydew [Cucumis melo L. (Inodorus Group) 'Honey Brew'] and netted muskmelon [Cucumis melo L. (Reticulatus Group) 'Explorer'] fruit were submerged (dipped) 20 min at 25 +/- 3 degrees C in a solution containing a Ca-chelate, a Mg-chelate, a combination of both chelates, or no mineral chelate. Following 10 or 24 days of cold storage (4 degrees C for 'Explorer' and 10 degrees C for 'Honey Brew'), fruit were analyzed for mineral content and various senescence-related parameters. Abscised 'Honey Brew' fruit dipped in either Ca-chelate or (Ca+Mg)-chelate and abscised 'Explorer' fruit dipped in (Ca+Mg)-chelate, followed by 10 days cold storage, had hypodermal mesocarp Ca concentrations of at least 6.0 mg(.)g(-1) dry weight. Maintaining hypodermal mesocarp tissue Ca concentrations at this level during postharvest storage, especially for fully ripe 'Honey Brew' fruit, maintained membrane integrity and fruit firmness, and extended storage life 2.4-fold (i.e., to 24 days). The senescence regulatory effect of postharvest Ca-chelate treatments on abscised 'Explorer' was highly variable, compared to 'Honey Brew', which appeared to be due to the surface netting interfering with movement of Ca into the hypodermal mesocarp. Thus, postharvest Ca-chelate application to abscised 'Honey Brew' fruit could delay fruit senescence in commercial storage, and open up new markets for fully ripened honeydew melons. 3acultivars 3apostharvest treatment 3ashelf life 3achelating agents 3acalcium 3afood quality 3amagnesium 3acell membranes 3amesocarp 3amineral content 3acold storage 3amelons 0achemical composition 0asenescence 0afruits1 aGrusak, M.A.0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g1999 Sept., v. 124, no. 5 p.545-552aAmerican Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL  a20000702b20000711c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02276naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245012600145300001600271520126500287650002201552650002301574650001401597650002701611650001101638650001501649650001601664650002101680650001801701700001801719700001301737773009601750852000901846930003301855945001301888946001301901655001201914IND2206760920221119021622.0000907e199908  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220676092DNAL7 a153047802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkimoto, M.12aA kinetic study on lipase-catalyzed interesterification of soybean oil with oleic acid in a continuous packed-bed reactor  ap. 131-142.  aTo provide a mathematical basis for the design and operation of a continuous, packed-bed reactor for the interesterification of soybean oil, soybean oil that contains 22.7% oleoyl and 54.3% linoleoyl moieties as molar acyl moiety composition was interesterified in hexane with oleic acid, using an immobilized sn-1,3-specific lipase (Lipozyme IM) from Mucor miehei. The reaction was carried out in a U-shaped Pyrex glass-made packed-bed reactor at 37 degrees C in the following system: concentration of soybean oil in the feed stream = 12.5 wt%, molar ratio of fatty acid to soybean oil = 3.0, and water content in the feed stream = 1340-2340 ppm. At these water contents, Lipozyme IM gave practically the same catalytic activity, and the content of triacylglycerols in the product oil was 91-94 wt%. Rate equations for the change in oleoyl and linoleoyl moiety compositions in soybean oil were derived and their validity was confirmed experimentally. On the other hand, the catalytic activity of Lipozyme IM decayed in the first-order fashion. Based on these deactivation kinetics, the flow rate of the feed stream is simulated for the operation of a continuous, packed-bed reactor at 37 degrees C that produces an oil of a fixed composition of oleoyl moiety. 3aRhizomucor miehei 3acatalytic activity 3aequations 3afatty acid composition 3ahexane 3aoleic acid 3asoybean oil 3atriacylglycerols 3awater content1 aNagashima, Y.1 aSato, D.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g1999 Aug., v. 81, no. 2 p.131-142x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle02435naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245011900165300001600284500001500300520145000315650002001765653001901785653001401804653001501818700001901833700001501852773011601867852000901983856008501992930003302077946001102110655001202121IND4408522420221119021544.0080801e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440852242DNAL7 a10.1007/s00254-007-1022-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiaoyou 10aRe-evaluating the impacts of human activity and environmental change on desertification in the Minqin Oasis, China  ap. 705-715.  a2019-12-04  aThe Minqin Oasis and its adjacent regions in northern China experienced significant desertification beginning 2,000 years ago and continuing to the present, and numerous studies have claimed that human activities, especially the flourishing of agriculture, have played a major role in environmental change in this region. Our analysis suggests that the observed desertification was mainly controlled by changes in the water component of the ecosystem and the arid climate. The impacts of cultivation on desertification from 2,000 years ago to the mid-1900s appear to have been relatively minor compared to the impacts of the area's arid climate and its native geomorphological processes. Although human activity has increased from the late-1940s to the present, and the areas of the oasis reclaimed for agriculture have reached a maximum, desertification over the past 50 years appears to be a continuing process that began thousands of years ago, and is mainly controlled by decreasing water levels caused by the arid climate, local geomorphological processes and overuse of water in the upstream. Although both human activities and climate variation are important drivers of the desertification process, and it is not possible to completely separate the human influence from the climate impact, key factors on controlling desertification should be investigated before we place the blame solely on the flourishing of agriculture in this region. 3adesertification 0aHuman activity 0awater use 0aArid China1 aWang, Xunming 1 aYan, Ping 0 tEnvironmental geology.g2008 Aug., v. 55, no. 4 p.705-715dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0943-01057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-007-1022-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20080801b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02200naa a2200421 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001900097040001800116100002200134245006800156300001400224500002300238500001500261520105400276650002601330650001901356650001001375650002301385650001001408650002101418650001101439650002701450650001401477651001801491651001801509653002901527653003301556653001301589700002101602773008001623852000901703939003301712945000801745946001301753655001201766991585304020742620221119021414.0820405e198202  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI820005212DNAL7 a102540852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewis, Charles E.10aDeterminants of children's health-related beliefs and behaviors  ap. 85-97.  aLiterature review.  a2019-12-04  aConsiderable evidence exists that individual behavior is inconsistent with personal health maintenance or the operation of a cost-effective US health care system. Since the altering of adult behavior is difficult, the appropriate time for intervention is childhood. Relevant literature on adult health-related behaviors (preventive health, sickness, illness) is reviewed with reference to health models; little literature has been generated on the development of children's health-related beliefs and behaviors over the past 30 years. Based on literature, experience, and research over the past 9 years, the most important determinants of children's health-related beliefs and behaviors are elucidated (covering demographic, family, child, and health care system factors). The most important finding, based on a review of interviews with hundreds of 5-12 year old children, states that children are far more competent in decision-making than adults perceive. A program designed to optimize health-care-related behaviors of children is proposed.

Expression of the tRNA(Pro) genes was demonstrated in vivo and sequence analysis suggested amplification of the tRNA(Pro) gene copy number through duplication of a gene cluster at the same locus of the bean genome. The two tRNA(Thr) genes isolated were actively transcribed and their transcripts processed in a HeLa cell system. In vivo expression tests of these genes and aminoacylation assays of the corresponding in vitro transcripts showed the presence of identity determinants in the anticodon of plant tRNA(Thr). The tRNA(Leu) gene was not expressed due to deviation from the consensus in the internal B-box promoter. The same sequence deviation also prevented aminoacylation of the corresponding in vitro transcript. This tRNA(Leu) however exists in plants and is synthesized from another gene with a consensus B-box promoter. Plant mitochondria import from the cytosol a number of nucleus-encoded tRNAs, including tRNA(Leu) and tRNA(Thr). From the available sequence data, we could not identify any conserved structural motif characteristic for the nucleus-encoded tRNAs imported into plant mitochondria, either in the tRNAs, or in the gene flanking sequences. These results suggest that recognition of tRNAs for import is idiosyncratic and likely to depend on protein/RNA interactions that are specific to each tRNA or each isoacceptor group. 3athreonine 3aleucine 3aproline 3atransfer RNA 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3agene expression 3atranscription (genetics) 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3amitochondria 3amolecular conformation 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aConserved Sequence 2aFabaceaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aHeLa Cells 2aHumans 2aMitochondriaxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aRNA, Transferxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Transfer, Leuxbiosynthesisxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Transfer, Proxbiosynthesisxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Transfer, Thrxbiosynthesisxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 0agenbank/y15080 0agenbank/x98183 0agenbank/x98184 0atransfer 0acytoplasm 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x98179 0acloverleaf structure1 aKauffmann, S.1 aChoisne, N.1 aMarechal-Drouard, L.1 aGreen, G.1 aWintz, H.1 aSmall, I.1 aDietrich, A.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1998 Mar., v. 36, no. 4 p.613-625x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01960naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001800149245007500167300001600242500002400258520098000282650001701262650001301279650001001292650001101302650001401313650001101327650001501338651001001353700001601363700001401379700001701393773010201410852000901512856008901521655001201610IND4464657120221119021156.0121217s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446465712DNAL7 a10.1016/S0140-1963(03)00029-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaballero, I.10aSeed bank structure along a semi-arid gypsum gradient in Central Spain  ap. 287-299.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of this paper is to evaluate seed bank density and composition along a semi-arid gypsum gradient in Central Spain. Seed bank density was relatively high (16,214 seed/m2) with a very clumped spatial distribution. Landform and microslope were the best predictors for seed density, indicating that density can be at least partly interpreted as a result of the physical processes regulating secondary dispersal. A high number of species appeared in the seed bank (68) being most of them annual gypsophytes. A relevant feature is that three widely distributed perennial gypsophytes occurred among the 10 more abundant species (Helianthemum squamatum, Lepidium subulatum and Sedum gypsicola). Presence of perennial among the most frequent species of the seed bank is not a shared characteristic with other arid and semi-arid systems. CCA model suggested that vegetation bands, microslope and vegetation perennial cover were factors shaping the composition of the seed bank. 3aHelianthemum 3aLepidium 3aSedum 3agypsum 3alandforms 3amodels 3avegetation 3aSpain1 aOlano, J.M.1 aLoidi, J.1 aEscudero, A.0 tJournal of arid environments.g2003 Oct., v. 55, no. 2 p.287-299dAcademic Pressx0140-19637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-1963(03)00029-63Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02773naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245013800128300001400266500001500280520121600295650002801511650002101539650002101560650002201581650001401603650002501617650002501642650002201667650002201689650003001711650001001741650002001751650001201771650001701783653002401800653002101824653002101845653002801866653001401894653002101908653002101929653002501950700001401975700001501989700001402004700001502018700001502033700001502048773007802063852000902141930003302150945001302183946001102196655001202207IND2195945620221119021448.0981210e199805  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219594562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHashimoto, T.10aIntraspecific variability of the tandem repeats in Nicotiana putrescine N-methyltransferases.

Genomic Southern blot analyses indicated that this N-terminal repeat array is found in tobacco PMTs but absent in Hyoscyamus and Atropa PMTs. A truncated tobacco PMT in which this repeat array was entirely removed still retained full enzymatic activity when expressed in Escherichia coli. Three PMT genes (NsPMT1, NsPMT2, NsPMT3) isolated from Nicotiana sylvestris encode two, five, and nine tandem repeats, respectively, in the first exon, but otherwise encode highly conserved proteins. Analysis of PCR fragments amplified from the genomes of N. tabacum and its two probable progenitors shows that one of the nine repeat elements in NsPMT3 was precisely deleted in the corresponding N. tabacum gene. These results indicate that direct tandem repeats of a 33 bp sequence that encodes 11 amino acids of no obvious function were added to the ancestral Nicotiana PMT gene, and that the tandem repetition was genetically very unstable, contracting or expanding during evolution of the Nicotiana species. 3ainterspecific variation 3aHyoscyamus niger 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3aevolution 3aNicotiana sylvestris 3aamino acid sequences 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aAtropa belladonna 3aNicotiana tomentosiformis 3aexons 3aenzyme activity 3aintrons 3atransferases 0aspecies differences 0agenbank/ab004322 0agenbank/ab004324 0amolecular sequence data 0adeletions 0agenbank/ab004323 0agenbank/ab004325 0anucleotide sequences1 aShoji, T.1 aMihara, T.1 aOguri, H.1 aTamaki, K.1 aSuzuki, K.1 aYamada, Y.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1998 May, v. 37, no. 1 p.25-37x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03106naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001300171245012900184300001600313500002400329520147700353650001101830650000901841650002801850650001501878650001701893650001001910650001001920650001801930650001101948650002501959650001301984650001401997650002002011650001502031650001002046650001902056650000902075650001802084650001102102650000902113650002102122650001102143650002302154650004002177650002602217650001202243650002302255651001802278700001402296773011702310852000902427856009202436655001202528IND4464650520221119021622.0121214s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446465052DNAL7 a127531102pmid7 a10.1046/j.1365-277X.2003.00438.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEves, A.10aFood provision and the nutritional implications of food choices made by young adult males, in a young offenders' institution  ap. 167-179.  aIncludes references  aThe nutritional adequacy of diets provided by a prison was assessed by analysis of the kitchen menu for 1 week of a 4-week cycle. Dietary intakes were determined using a predefined 7-day diet diary in which prisoners indicated what they had eaten, and how much. A total of 159 prisoners took part in the study. The food provided by the prison kitchen was broadly in line with current dietary recommendations. Vitamin content exceeded recommendations, with the exception of niacin in the vegetarian menu (12.6 mg compared with the reference nutrient intake of 16.8 mg). Selenium content was low in all menus, but particularly in the vegetarian menu in 1997 where it equalled the lower reference nutrient intake (LRNI) (39.5 μg). Food choices made by prisoners resulted in a wide variation in dietary intakes. Fat intake (as a proportion of energy) exceeded the recommended 35% in 82% of diets in 1996, and 64% of diets in 1997. In 1996, 34% of prisoners had intakes above 40% energy as fat. High fat intakes were largely the result of consuming items from the prison shop. Vitamin D intakes were low (3.4 and 3.3 μg in 1996 and 1997, respectively) compared with the recommendation (10 μg) for those with limited exposure to sunlight. Intakes of a number of minerals fell below recommendations, with some prisoners barely meeting the LRNI. This was particularly notable for selenium where 35% of prisoners in 1996, and 60% of prisoners in 1997 had intakes below the LRNI. 3aadults 3adiet 3adietary recommendations 3afat intake 3afood choices 3afoods 3amales 3amenu planning 3aniacin 3anutritional adequacy 3aselenium 3avitamin D 3avitamin content 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aCohort Studies 2aDiet 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aFood 2aFood Preferences 2aHumans 2aMineralsxanalysis 2aNutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aPrisonersxpsychology 2aPrisons 2aVitaminsxanalysis 0aGreat Britain1 aGesch, B.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g2003 June, v. 16, no. 3 p.167-179dBlackwell Sciencex0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-277X.2003.00438.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01842naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001700157245008500174300001400259500001500273520084500288650001301133650001301146650002101159650001001180650001101190653002101201700002201222700002301244773006901267852000901336856007801345930003301423945001301456946001101469655001201480IND2041383620221119021440.0940810s1993    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204138362DNAL7 a241961852pmid7 a10.1007/BF002323172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeorge, P.S.10aClonal multiplication of Gardenia jasminoides Ellis through axillary bud culture  ap. 59-62.  a2019-12-05  aAn efficient clonal multiplication system was developed for in vitro propagation of crocin-producing Gardenia jasminoides Ellis plants. Murashige and Skoog's (MS) medium containing 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP 1 mg l-1) and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA 1 mg l-1) resulted in multiple shoot initiation at the rate of 21 shoots per explant in 60 d of culture. Transfer of the microshoots into liquid MS medium supplemented with BAP (5 mg l-1) with two subcultures of 15 d duration in the same medium resulted in 400 +/- 25 shoots per explant. Efficient rooting was achieved in MS medium supplemented with alpha-naphthaleneacetic acid (5 mg l-1). The in vitro raised plants were hardened in a greenhouse and transplanted to the field successfully.

The occurrence of these parasites was not limited to a specific area only. The two groups of parasites were found infecting the body of copepods. The first group is called Ellobiopsis chattoni and the second group is called Thalassomyces sp. which were found infecting many copepods namely Paracalanus aculeatus, Paracalanus crassirostris, Acartia danae,Temora discaudata . The infected organisms were found in reduced size, hence the biomass of plankton was also found less than that of the non infected copepods but the overall biodiversity of marine organisms were not found affected during the infection period. 3aAcartia 3abiodiversity 3abiomass 3aparasites 3aplankton1 aHussain, M.0 tJournal of arid environments.g2003 May, v. 54, no. 1 p.149-153dAcademic Pressx0140-19637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1006/jare.2001.08833Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03598naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001700179245010000196300001800296500002400314506007600338520197000414506003702384650001602421650002902437650001502466650001902481650002102500650001102521650002102532650001602553650001402569650001602583650001602599650001102615650001402626650001102640650003702651650001602688650002402704650003402728650002102762650002202783700002202805700001902827700002102846773010202867852000902969856007802978655001203056IND4429003520221207072929.0091120e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442900352DNAL7 a198336112pmid7 aPMC27784002pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcp2562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAssani, Akym10aVesicle formation in the membrane of onion cells (Allium cepa) during rapid osmotic dehydration  ap. 1389-1395.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Optimization of osmotic dehydration in different plant cells has been investigated through the variation of parameters such as the nature of the sugar used, the concentration of osmotic solutions and the processing time. In micro-organisms such as the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the exposure of a cell to a slow increase in osmotic pressure preserves cell viability after rehydration, while sudden dehydration involves a lower rate of cell viability, which could be due to membrane vesiculation. The aim of this work is to study cytoplasmic vesicle formation in onion epidermal cells (Allium cepa) as a function of the kinetics of osmotic pressure variation in the external medium. METHODS: Onion epidermal cells were submitted either to an osmotic shock or to a progressive osmotic shift from an osmotic pressure of 2 to 24 MPa to induce plasmolysis. After 30 min in the treatment solution, deplasmolysis was carried out. Cells were observed by microscopy during the whole cycle of dehydration-rehydration. KEY RESULTS: The application of an osmotic shock to onion cells, from an initial osmotic pressure of 2 MPa to a final one of 24 MPa for <1 s, led to the formation of numerous exocytotic and osmocytic vesicles visualized through light and confocal microscopy. In contrast, after application of a progressive osmotic shift, from an initial osmotic pressure of 2 MPa to a final one of 24 MPa for 30 min, no vesicles were observed. Additionally, the absence of Hechtian strand connections led to the bursting of vesicles in the case of the osmotic shock. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that the kinetics of osmotic dehydration strongly influence vesicle formation in onion cells, and that Hechtian strand connections between protoplasts and exocytotic vesicles are a prerequisite for successful deplasmolysis. These results suggest that a decrease in the area-to-volume ratio of a cell could cause cell death following an osmotic shock.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAllium cepa 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3acell death 3acell membranes 3alight microscopy 3aonions 3aosmotic pressure 3aplasmolysis 3apreserves 3aprotoplasts 3arehydration 3asugars 3aviability 3ayeasts 2aCytoplasmic Vesiclesxphysiology 2aDehydration 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aOnionsxcytologyxphysiology. 2aOsmotic Pressure 2aWaterxphysiology1 aMoundanga, Sylvie1 aBeney, Laurent1 aGervais, Patrick0 tAnnals of botany.g2009 Dec., v. 104, no. 7 p.1389-1395dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcp2563Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01498naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002300142245003800165300001600203500002400219520066300243650001700906650001000923650001500933650001500948650001300963650001700976651001100993773010101004852000901105856008201114655001201196IND4464619420221119021257.0121207s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446461942DNAL7 a10.1006/jare.2001.08782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Saqer, Nadia A.10aBirds of the Jahra conserved area  ap. 203-207.  aIncludes references  aEstablishing a natural protected area is one of the means of maintaining the biological diversity in an ecosystem, as the components of a healthy ecosystem can be maintained and conserved.

In yeast and mammals, Lon-type proteases catalyze the ATP-dependent degradation of mitochondrial matrix proteins. The maize gene, which we have designated LON1, is predicted to encode a protein with a molecular mass of 97.7 kDa. Lon1p is more similar in sequence to bacterial Lon proteases than to the yeast and human mitochondrial Lon proteases. LON1 transcripts are present in shoots of 4-day-old etiolated maize seedlings, and transcript levels decrease when these seedlings are heat-shocked. LON1 transcripts are also present at comparable levels in leaves and roots of 2-week-old greenhouse-grown seedlings. In yeast, the mitochondrial Lon-type protease, Pim1p, has been implicated in mitochondrial protein turnover, the assembly of mitochondrial enzyme complexes, and mitochondrial DNA maintenance, and it is essential for respiratory function. We show that maize Lon1p can replace the Pim1p function in yeast for maintaining mitochondrial DNA integrity, but not in the assembly of cytochroma a.a3 complexes. 3amitochondrial DNA 3aseedlings 3aroots 3ashoots 3astructural genes 3aopen reading frames 3aheat stress 3agene expression 3amitochondria 3acytochromes 3aleaves 3aZea mays 3amessenger RNA 3acomplementary DNA 3aamino acid sequences 3agenetic transformation 3aproteinases 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3agenetic complementation 3amutants 2aATP-Dependent Proteases 2aAdenosine Triphosphatasesxgenetics 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aDNA, Fungalxmetabolism 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxmetabolism 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aHeat-Shock Proteinsxgenetics 2aHeat-Shock Response 2aMitochondriaxmetabolism 2aMitochondrial Proteins 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 2aSeedsxenzymologyxgrowth & development. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSerine Endopeptidasesxgenetics 2aZea maysxenzymologyxgenetics. 0alon1 gene 0agenbank/u85494 0amolecular sequence data 0adeletions 0adna modification 0anucleotide sequences1 aPearce, D.A.1 aSherman, F.1 aRapp, W.D.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1998 May, v. 37, no. 1 p.141-154x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01608naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001700149245012000166300001600286500002400302520069700326650001201023650001401035650001301049650001301062650002301075700001901098773010301117852000901220856008901229655001201318IND4464637720221119021508.0121212s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446463772DNAL7 a10.1016/S0140-1963(02)00254-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, S.L.14aThe effect of plant spinescence on the foraging efficiency of bushbuck and boergoats: browsers of similar body size  ap. 150-158.  aIncludes references  aThorn removal experiments quantified the effects of plant spinescence on the foraging efficiency of two mammalian browsers of similar body size, the indigenous bushbuck and the introduced domestic boergoat. Spinescence limited the intake rates of both browsers; the extent being influenced by the animal's feeding technique. Larger bite sizes and rates enabled the bushbuck to increase their intake rate from dethorned branches. Spinescence restricted the feeding style of boergoats. Following thorn removal they attained larger bite sizes, and therefore greater intake rates. Boergoats were intrinsically fast eaters and were more efficient than bushbuck when foraging on spinescent species. 3aanimals 3abody size 3abranches 3aforaging 3arestricted feeding1 aKerley, G.I.H.0 tJournal of arid environments.g2003 Sept., v. 55, no. 1 p.150-158dAcademic Pressx0140-19637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-1963(02)00254-93Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02712naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245014000147300001600287520097900303650001901282650001901301650002101320650001801341650002401359650002601383650001701409650002501426650001901451650002401470650001401494650001201508650004301520650002701563650002501590650002301615650002201638650002801660650003101688650003901719650002901758650003801787650001201825650004401837653001401881653001201895700001601907700001601923700002001939700001701959773008001976852000902056930003302065945001302098946001102111655001202122IND2195973520221119021512.0981214e199805  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219597352DNAL7 a96177932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcClintock, K.10aIdentification of a 37 kDa plant protein that interacts with the turnip mosaic potyvirus capsid protein using anti-idiotypic-antibodies  ap. 197-204.  aExperimental data are provided for the presence of a plant protein that interacts with the capsid protein (CP) of turnip mosaic potyvirus (TuMV). The receptor-like protein was identified by exploiting the molecular mimicry potential of anti-idiotypic antibodies. A single-chain Fv molecule derived from the monoclonal antibody 7A (Mab-7A), which recognizes the CP of TuMV, was produced in Escherichia coli and the recombinant protein was used to raise rabbit antibodies. The immune serum reacted with Mab-7A but not with a monoclonal antibody of the same isotype, indicating that anti-idiotypic antibodies were produced. These anti-idiotypic antibodies recognized a 37 kDa protein from Lactuca sativa. Complex formation between the anti-idiotypic antibodies and the plant protein was inhibited by the CP of TuMV which indicates that the plant protein interacts with the viral protein. The 37 kDa protein was localized in chloroplasts and was detected in other plant species. 3aLactuca sativa 3aplant proteins 3abinding proteins 3acoat proteins 3aTurnip mosaic virus 3amonoclonal antibodies 3achloroplasts 3arecombinant proteins 3aimmunoblotting 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aantiserum 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Anti-Idiotypicximmunology 2aAntibodies, Monoclonal 2aBinding, Competitive 2aBrassicaxvirology 2aCapsidxanalysis. 2aChloroplastsxchemistry 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aImmunoglobulin Fragmentsxgenetics 2aPlant Proteinsxanalysis 2aPotyvirusxchemistryximmunology. 2aRabbits 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsximmunology 0aidiotypes 0abinding1 aLamarre, A.1 aParsons, V.1 aLaliberte, J.F.1 aFortin, M.G.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1998 May, v. 37, no. 2 p.197-204x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02653naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245013500141300001600276520065400292650002500946650002600971650002500997650002501022650002401047650002201071650002001093650001801113650001001131650001401141650001201155650001201167650002001179650002701199650002401226650002601250650002501276650001801301650004701319650002901366650003501395650001301430650005701443650001701500650002001517650001001537650002801547650002801575650001301603650002901616650003601645650002701681653000901708653002301717653002801740653001901768700001701787700001701804773008001821852000901901930003301910945001301943946001101956655001201967IND2195946920221119021657.0981210e199805  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219594692DNAL7 a96202742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRook, F.14aThe light-regulated Arabidopsis bZIP transcription factor gene ATB2 encodes a protein with an unusually long leucine zipper domain  ap. 171-178.  aA light-regulated basic domain/leucine zipper gene, ATB2, was identified in an Arabidopsis thaliana transcription factor gene collection. Both genomic and cDNA clones of ATB2 were isolated. The gene encodes a small protein (18 kDa) which mainly consists of the basic domain and an unusually long leucine zipper. The expression of the ATB2 gene is induced when etiolated or dark-adapted seedlings are transferred to the light. Moreover, its expression is derepressed in dark-grown seedlings of the photomorphogenic mutants cop1 and det1.

The objective of this investigation was to determine whether intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of soy protein hydrolysates decrease food intake and body weight. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 24) received i.c.v. injections of soy hydrolysate I (SH I) or soy hydrolysate II (SH II) three times weekly for 2 weeks. Krebs solution and leptin were used as negative and positive controls respectively. SH I (6.5-20 kDa with a strong band at 14 kDa) was produced by hydrolysis with alcalase, and SH II (~2 kDa) was obtained by hydrolysis and ultrafiltration. Leptin successfully reduced body weight (-1.60 g) 24 h (p = 0.0093) after the third injection. SH I caused significant (p = 0.0009) decreases in body weight (-1.70 g) 24 h after the third injection but not after 48 h. SH II showed a tendency to prevent body weight gain but this effect was short of statistical significance (p < 0.40). Food intake was not affected by any of the soy hydrolysate treatments but leptin injection did cause significant decreases in food intake (p < 0.05). Data suggest that soy alcalase hydrolysate can decrease, in the short term, the rate of body weight gain independently of food consumption. This preliminary data show that soy peptides may play a role on body weight regulation, possibly by increasing energy utilization. 3aadults 3abody weight changes 3aenergy 3afood consumption 3afood intake 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3aleptin 3amales 3amechanism of action 3aprotein hydrolysates 3arats 3asoy protein 3asubtilisin 3aultrafiltration 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aBrainxphysiology 2aCross-Over Studies 2aEnergy Intakexphysiology 2aEnergy Metabolismxdrug effects 2aInjections, Intraventricular 2aLeptinxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aMale 2aObesityxdrug therapy 2aProtein Hydrolysatesxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aRandom Allocation 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSoybean Proteinsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aTime Factors 2aWeight Lossxdrug effects 0aSoy hydrolysate1 aRizzo, Anthony 1 aDoane, Dolores 1 aBeverly, J.

For example, the genus Chamaeleo, which comprises 14 species with large distributions across mainland Africa and parts of Eurasia, exhibits relatively minor phenotypic differentiation between species, leading to speculation regarding the presence of cryptic diversity in the genus. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to construct a robust and comprehensive phylogeny of the genus and highlight potential species-level cryptic diversity. Additionally, we sought to ascertain the most likely biogeographic origin of the genus and understand its spatio-temporal diversification. Accordingly, we made use of species delimitation methods (Bayesian and divergence based) to investigate the extent of cryptic diversity in Chamaeleo, and applied an ancestral area reconstruction to examine the biogeographic origin of the group. Our phylogenetic analyses suggested the presence of at least 18 taxa within Chamaeleo. Notably, three taxa could be recognised within C. dilepis, none of which are equivalent in context with any of the currently described subspecies. There were also three taxa within C. gracilis and two within C. anchietae. The single available tissue specimen identified as C. necasi was embedded within the C. gracilis clade. Our ancestral area reconstruction points to a southern African/Zambezian origin for Chamaeleo, with diversification beginning during the cooling and aridification of Africa that characterised the Oligocene Epoch, ca. 34–23 Mya (Million years ago). Species-level diversification began in the Miocene Epoch (ca. 23–5 Mya), possibly tracking the aridification that triggered the shift from forest to more open, mesic savanna for most clades, but with tectonic events influencing speciation in a Palearctic clade. These findings lay the foundation for a future integrative taxonomic re-evaluation of Chamaeleo, which will be supported with additional lines of evidence before implementing any taxonomic changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aChamaeleo 3aMiocene epoch 3aOligocene epoch 3aPalearctic region 3acooling 3acryptic speciation 3aforests 3ageographical distribution 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3asavannas 3ataxonomy 3atectonics 3aEurasia 3aSouthern Africa 0aBiogeography 0aSpecies delimitation 0aReptile 0aPhylogeny 0aOligocene1 avan Vuuren, Bettine Jansen1 aTilbury, Colin R.1 aTolley, Krystal A.0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2022 Oct., v. 175 p.107578-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2022.1075783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02386naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245010200170300001600272520094400288592002801232650001701260650002101277650001301298650000901311650001301320650001501333650001201348650001801360650001901378650001501397650001301412650001601425650001501441653002101456653001701477653002901494653002801523700001701551700002201568700002201590700002201612700002601634700001501660773012501675856008301800852000901883655001201892IND60713008620221120233530.0211227e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071300862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.10.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuc Chinh, Nguyen10apn-Heterojunction of the SWCNT/ZnO nanocomposite for temperature dependent reaction with hydrogen  ap. 582-591.  aA hydrogen breath test is a non-invasive and safe diagnostic tool to explore the functional gastrointestinal disorders.

Esterification with acetic anhydride and adipic anhydride (E 1422 starch) caused the most pronounced changes in physicochemical parameters compared with native potato starch powder. In native and E 1422 starches, mean granule diameter changed from 23.1 to 25.4μm, shape factor from 1.47 to 1.33, specific surface from 0.2115 to 0.1695m²g⁻¹, porosity from 41.31% to 45.29%, water absorption increased up to 50%, and flow behavior changed from easy to cohesive. A microscopic analysis confirmed also the differences in the surface morphology showing the most rough surface of E 1422 starch. Despite broad variations in the diameter of individual starch granules, it was found that differently sized ridges and valleys on granule surface reflect porosity and water sorption values of the examined starches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aesterification 3agranules 3aphysicochemical properties 3aporosity 3apotato starch 3apowders 3astarch granules 3avalleys1 aSadowska, Jadwiga1 aBłaszczak, Wioletta1 aJeliński, Tomasz1 aStasiak, Mateusz1 aMolenda, Marek1 aHajnos, Mieczysław0 tJournal of food engineering.g2012 Feb., v. 108, no. 4 p.515-522dElsevier Ltdx0260-87747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2011.09.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04222naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245012100205500001400326520218500340592002802525650001302553650001502566650001602581650001902597650001602616650001602632650001302648650001502661650001602676650001402692650001502706650001302721650001602734650001402750650000902764650002102773650001102794650001102805651001002816653001202826653003202838653002302870653004602893653002202939653001802961653002102979653002003000700001703020700001703037700001603054700001403070700001603084700001303100700001503113700001503128700001303143700001603156700001903172700005803191700005703249773012603306856008303432852000903515655001203524IND60696239620221118031257.0210121e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069623962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2020.1069982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lirong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4079-114510aEffect of warming and degradation on phenophases of Kobresia pygmaea and Potentilla multifida on the Tibetan Plateau  aNAL-light  aMany studies have focused on the responses of phenophases to warming in natural, non-degraded grasslands. However, degraded grasslands widely distribute in the world due to climate change and overgrazing. So far, a comprehensive understanding of how plant phenology responds to warming, degradation and their interactions remains elusive. Here, the relative effects of warming and degradation on the phenological sequences of two dominant plant species were tested using a two factorial experiment of warming and moderate degradation (i.e., four treatments: NWND, WND, NWD and WD) during three successive years. We found that WND significantly delayed the onsets of early phenophases (i.e., leaf-out, booting-set, flowering and fruiting-set) and shortened the total activity period (TAP) only for the early spring flowering Kobresia pygmaea compared with NWND. NWD generally did not significantly affect the timing or duration of all phenophases for the two plant species depending on year relative to NWND. Interaction between warming and moderate degradation significantly delayed leaf-out and shortened total activity period of the two plant species. There were negative correlations between plant species richness and onset of vegetation after fruiting-set for K. pygmaea and the duration of fruiting-set for Potentilla multifida (a dominant mid-summer flowering species in degraded plots), but there were positive correlations between plant species richness and leafing duration for P. multifida. Positive correlations were found between first leaf-out and NO₃⁻-N in soils for both species but negative correlations were found between first leaf-out and NH₄⁻-N in soils for P. multifida. There were positive and negative correlations between TAP of P. multifida and NH₄⁻-N and NO₃⁻-N in soils, respectively. Therefore, our results suggest that moderate degradation could weaken the negative effects of warming on reproductive phenophases of K. pygmaea, and that we should take into account grassland degradation and its associated changes in plant species richness and soil inorganic nitrogen when we predict the response of plant phenology to future warming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKobresia 3aPotentilla 3aagriculture 3aclimate change 3acorrelation 3adegradation 3aduration 3aecosystems 3aenvironment 3aflowering 3agrasslands 3anitrogen 3aovergrazing 3aphenology 3asoil 3aspecies richness 3aspring 3asummer 3aChina 0aWarming 0aPlant phenological sequence 0aOnset and duration 0aKobresia pygmaea and Potentilla multifida 0aSpecies diversity 0aSoil nutrient 0aAlpine grassland 0aTibetan Plateau1 aLv, Wangwang1 aCui, Shujuan1 aJiang, Lili1 aLi, Bowen1 aLiu, Peipei1 aWang, Qi1 aZhou, Yang1 aHong, Huan1 aWang, A.1 aLuo, Caiyun1 aZhang, Zhenhua1 aDorji, Tsechoe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3863-07481 aWang, Shiping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5113-71170 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 300 p.106998-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2020.1069983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01423naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245009900155300002000254520042500274592002800699650001200727650001100739650002200750650001800772650001600790700001700806700001400823700001500837700001400852700001200866773012400878856007401002852000901076655001201085IND60640980220221118100747.0190505e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064098022DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra14232j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, J.

Semi-natural grasslands are target habitats for ecological restoration in temperate Europe. Restoration of abandoned semi-natural grasslands often relies on spontaneous colonisation of plant species from the soil seed bank or the surrounding landscape. Although many studies show that the regional species pool is important for upholding local diversity, its effect on restoration outcome in semi-natural grasslands is poorly known. In this multi-landscape study, we examined grassland specialist species occurring in restored grasslands and the effect of specialist species pool, landscape composition and local temporal factors. We found that specialist richness and frequency was positively affected by specialist richness and frequency in the surrounding landscape. Specialist richness in the restored grasslands also increased with time since restoration. Moreover, specialist frequency in the restored grassland increased with the proportion of semi-natural and remnant grassland habitats in the landscape. We also found a positive relationship between the proportion of species occurring in both the restored grassland and its surrounding landscape and time since restoration, in landscapes with high proportions of semi-natural grasslands. This suggests that both temporal factors, as well as the landscape composition and species pool, affect plant recolonisation in restored semi-natural grasslands.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aburied seeds 3aecological restoration 3agrasslands 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3aEurope 0aBiodiversity 0aLandscape composition 0aRecolonisation 0aRestoration 0aSemi-natural grassland 0aSpecies pool1 aÖckinger, Erik1 aWinsa, Marie1 aLindborg, Regina0 tBiological conservation.g2017 Oct., v. 214 p.176-183dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2017.07.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010600165300001300271500001500284520204600299592002802345650001602373650004402389650001002433650001102443650001902454650001202473650001102485650001302496650001402509650000902523650001702532650001102549651001002560653001802570773011702588856008102705852000902786655001202795IND60523838320221120175524.0171214e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052383832DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-016-5853-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xue-Fei10aCharacterization and sources of sedimentary organic matter in Xingyun Lake, Jiangchuan, Yunnan, China  ap. 1054.  a2019-12-06  aXingyun Lake plays a particularly important role in the retention and processing of organic matter in Yuxi City, China. In this study, geochemical analyses (grain size, OC, N, δ¹³C) were carried out. The April 2014 sediment was finer than the October 2013 sediment. OC content was in the range of 1.07–2.68 % showing a increasing OC content with decreasing percent sand from the October 2013 sediment to the April 2014 sediment. TN distribution in surface sediments followed a similar distribution and was commonly correlated with OC. The correlation of δ¹³C values and N/C ratios in sediment reflected a mixing of soil-derived and terrestrial organic matters. The Ali/Aro ratios from the solid-state ¹³C-NMR spectra exhibited more aliphaticity for April 2014 sediments. The isotopic analyses on the fatty acids of sediments from twenty sampling stations in Xingyun Lake indicated that terrigenous components can be assigned as the major sources of the organic matters in the lake sediments. The low yields in lignin in sediment pointed to nontypical terrigenous inputs to the lake sediments. Ratios of p-hydroxyacetophenone to p-hydroxyl phenols (Pon/P) in the surface sediments (0.08–0.22) over the all sampling stations in Xingyun Lake further demonstrated a contribution from soil-derived organic matters. It was observed a plot of the ratio of S/V versus C/V exhibited an organic input attributed to angiosperm nonwoods. The reworking of surficial sediments may result in a difference in organic input between the October 2013 sediment and the April 2014 sediment. Furthermore, the associated ratios of (Ad/Al)ᵥ, P/(V + S) in sediment indicated that the April 2014 sediments had experienced the lower degree of oxidation of lignin than the October 2013 sediments. This can be attributed to the higher fine particle content in the former sediments protecting organic matter than in the latter sediments, as revealed by the lower alkyl C/O–alkyl C ratio (A/O–A) in solid-state ¹³C NMR spectra of April 2014 samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3afatty acids 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3alakes 3amixing 3aorganic matter 3aphenols 3acarbon 3aaluminum 3aoxidation 3asand 3aAngiospermae 3alignin 3aChina 0aMagnoliophyta0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 July, v. 75, no. 13 p.1054-1054dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-5853-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02329naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010000158300002000258520114500278592002801423650001701451650001501468650001501483650002201498650001501520650000901535650001301544650000701557650001701564650001601581650001101597650001201608650001701620700001701637700001701654700001501671700001501686773012301701856007401824852000901898655001201907IND60667537320221121041640.0190919e20150512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066753732DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra05478h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ziyang10aIron-incorporated mesoporous silica for enhanced adsorption of tetracycline in aqueous solution  ap. 42407-42413.  aFe-incorporated SBA15 (Fe-SBA15) with different contents of Fe(iii) was synthesized in order to enhance the adsorption of antibiotic tetracycline (TC) from aqueous solution. The influence of the Fe(iii) content on the structural, textural and morphological properties of the adsorbents and the adsorption process of TC were investigated. The results showed that the adsorbents exhibited mesoporous structural order after co-condensation with different ratios of Fe/Si. As the Fe/Si ratio increased from 0.02 to 0.1, the Fe(iii) incorporated into the mesoporous silica framework offered abundant active sites for the adsorption of TC. The adsorption behavior was systematically studied and the results showed that Fe-SBA15 had higher adsorption capacity for TC than that of SBA15. The optimized solution pH for the adsorption was around 5.0 to 7.0, and the adsorption was endothermic and spontaneous. The adsorption mechanism mainly involved inner-sphere surface complexes formed between functional groups of TC and the Fe(iii) on the adsorbent. The synthesized materials have excellent potential as adsorbents for environmental remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3aendothermy 3airon 3amoieties 3apH 3aporous media 3aremediation 3asilica 3asilicon 3atetracycline1 aLan, Huachun1 aLiu, Huijuan1 aLi, Haiyan1 aQu, Jiuhui0 tRSC advances.g2015 May 12, v. 5, no. 53 p.42407-42413dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra05478h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04040naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245014100163300001600304520253600320592002802856650001302884650002802897650000902925650001802934650001302952650001102965650001002976650000902986650001802995650001503013650001403028650001603042650001703058650002903075650002303104651001103127653001703138653002103155653001403176653002903190700001703219700001803236700002203254700001803276773015203294856007903446852000903525655001203534IND60619077220221118015158.0210105e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061907722DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2018-146542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruinjé, T.C.10aUsing in-line milk progesterone data to characterize parameters of luteal activity and their association with fertility in Holstein cows  ap. 780-798.  aOur objectives were to characterize parameters of luteal activity based on milk progesterone concentration (P4c) data from before and after artificial insemination (AI) and to evaluate their potential association with fertility in Holstein cows. Records of AI events (n = 4,353) and of milk P4c (n = 158,961) obtained through an in-line milk analysis system (Herd Navigator, DeLaval International, Tumba, Sweden) from 1,891 lactations of 1,423 Holstein cows were evaluated. Milk P4c (ng/mL) were measured every 2.2 ± 1.9 d (mean ± standard deviation) between 23.6 ± 7.3 and 185.3 ± 56.7 d in milk. Variations in milk P4c of consecutive records were used to determine onset of luteal phase (increase in P4c from <5.0 to ≥5.0 ng/mL), luteal phase length (period, in days, of P4c ≥5.0 ng/mL), cessation of luteal phase (decline from ≥5.0 to <5.0 ng/mL, designated as P4c-decline), and pregnancy (AI followed by a luteal phase that remained uninterrupted until 50 d post-AI). The length of the luteal phase preceding AI, the highest P4c (P4c peak) during the luteal phase preceding AI, the lowest P4c preceding AI (P4c pre-AI) that followed a P4c-decline, and the interval between P4c-decline and AI were evaluated, as well as the interval between AI and onset of luteal phase, and P4c at early diestrus (4.5 ± 0.6 d post-AI), mid diestrus (10.0 ± 0.6 d post-AI), and late diestrus (14.1 ± 0.6 d post-AI). Data were analyzed using logistic regressions, and comparisons made based on quartiles and cut-points established by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Overall probability of pregnancy was 32.0%. Parameters associated with reduced probability of pregnancy (represented as percentage points decrease in the probability of pregnancy) were (1) luteal phase length >14.4 d (7.6% decrease), (2) P4c peak ≤24.7 ng/mL (4.5% decrease), (3) P4c pre-AI >0.5 ng/mL (5.5% decrease), (4) interval between P4c-decline and AI of >1.6 d (4.0% decrease), (5) interval between AI and onset of luteal phase of <7 or >11 d (9.3 and 12.1% decrease, respectively), and (6) P4c at early diestrus ≤0.7 or >3.5 ng/mL (15.2 and 6.7% decrease, respectively), (7) P4c at mid diestrus ≤12.4 ng/mL (12.5% decrease), and (8) P4c at late diestrus ≤22.7 ng/mL (9.7% decrease). The parameters of luteal activity associated with reduced probability of pregnancy established here could be used as benchmarks while developing recommendations to improve reproductive performance in herds using in-line milk progesterone monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aartificial insemination 3acows 3adata analysis 3adiestrus 3agraphs 3aherds 3amilk 3amilk analysis 3amonitoring 3apregnancy 3aprobability 3aprogesterone 3areproductive performance 3astandard deviation 3aSweden 0aluteal phase 0aovarian activity 0apregnancy 0areproductive performance1 aColazo, M.G.1 aRibeiro, E.S.1 aGobikrushanth, M.1 aAmbrose, D.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2019 Jan., v. 102, no. 1 p.780-798dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-146543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03537naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005100148245016800199500001400367520183300381592002802214650001602242650001102258650001302269650001502282650001502297650002102312650001602333650001102349650001302360650001502373650000702388650001302395650002402408650001102432650001302443650002302456650002502479650001202504650001002516650001802526650001502544651001002559653002202569653003202591653001802623653002902641700001702670700001502687700005102702773012602753856008302879852000902962655001202971IND60696239720221118031244.0210121e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069623972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2020.1069992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Sen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7290-857410aSpatial scale effects of the variable relationships between landscape pattern and water quality: Example from an agricultural karst river basin, Southwestern China  aNAL-light  aUnderstanding the spatially varying relationships between landscape pattern and water quality in the agricultural karst river system is helpful for landscape planning and management to protect water quality. In this study, empirical models were established to examine the impact of landscape pattern on the seasonal water quality at multi-spatial scales in a typical karst river basin in Southwestern China. Water samples from the Chishui River basin were collected and analysed during both the wet and dry seasons. Kruskal–Wallis tests revealed significant seasonal variations in water physic-chemical parameter variables, the values of which were all generally higher in the wet period than those in the dry period except for pH and SO₄²⁻. Moreover, the nutrient indicators including NO₃⁻-N, PO₄³⁻-P, DOC and DSi showed obvious spatial variations, some of which were related to the spatial distribution of cropland that reflected the agricultural activities of the basin. Redundancy analysis results indicated that the landscape pattern metrics can better explain the variation of water physic-chemical parameters in the dry period than in the wet period. The results revealed that the overall variations of water physic-chemical parameters were better explained by landscape pattern metrics at catchment scales. Further, the results of multiple linear regression model showed that the scale effects of the relationship between landscape pattern and water quality varied across different metrics and parameters. The geographical characteristics of catchment had significant relationships with some water physic-chemical parameters, suggesting that it may have impacts on water quality through combining with land use. This study highlights the importance of spatial scale in reflecting land-water interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3abasins 3acropland 3adry season 3aecosystems 3aempirical models 3aenvironment 3akarsts 3aland use 3alandscapes 3apH 3aplanning 3aregression analysis 3arivers 3asampling 3aseasonal variation 3aspatial distribution 3atesting 3awater 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aLandscape pattern 0aGeographical characteristic 0aSpatial scale 0aAgricultural karst basin1 aLi, Si-Liang1 aZhong, Jun1 aLi, Cai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9931-009X0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 300 p.106999-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2020.1069993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01800naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245020000153300001800353520053600371592002800907650001400935650001200949650002000961650002300981650001601004650001301020650001901033650002001052700001901072700001901091700001701110700001601127700001501143700001401158700001301172773013401185856007401319852000901393655001201402IND60741732120221119064540.0210618e20210617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074173212DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc02415a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Bin10aPhotoinduced homolytic decarboxylative acylation/cyclization of unactivated alkenes with α-keto acid under external oxidant and photocatalyst free conditions: access to quinazolinone derivatives  ap. 6050-6053.  aA novel and green strategy for the synthesis of acylated quinazolinone derivatives via photo-induced decarboxylative cascade radical acylation/cyclization of quinazolinone bearing unactivated alkenes has been developed.

Genetic network can be applied to depict the complicated evolution relationships of viral genomes. However, current phylogenetic methods cannot handle the cases with deletions effectively. Therefore, the k-mer natural vector is employed to characterize the compositions and distribution features of k-mers occurring in a viral genome, and construct a one-to-one relationship between a viral genome and its k-mer natural vector. Utilizing the k-mer natural vector, we proposed a novel genetic network to investigate the variations of viral genomes in transmission among humans. With the assistance of genetic network, we identified the super-spreaders that were responsible for the pandemic outbreaks all over the world and chose the parental strains to evaluate the effectiveness of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. The obtaining results fully demonstrated that our genetic network can truly describe the relationships of viral genomes, effectively simulate virus spread tendency, and trace the transmission routes precisely. In addition, this work indicated that the k-mer natural vector has the ability to capture established hotspots of diversities existing in the viral genomes and understand how genomic contents change over time.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiagnostic techniques 3agenomics 3apandemic 3aphylogeny 3atherapeutics 3aviral genome 3aviruses 0aGenetic network 0aBayesian 0aK-mer model 0aSuper-spreader 0aVaccine 0aACE2 0aCOVID-19 0adN 0adS 0aML 0aMSA 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aTMRCA 0atSNE1 aWen, Jia1 aXi, Kun1 aPan, Qiuhui0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2022 Oct., v. 175 p.107583-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2022.1075833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245017600205300001800381520170400399592002802103650001102131650002102142650000902163650002202172653002702194653002802221653002202249653002002271653002602291700002102317700002102338700001602359700006002375773009202435856008502527852000902612655001202621IND60779684120221118115330.0220628e20220830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077968412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2022.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarg, Reeya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7139-801510aSingle-step insertion of M-Nx moieties in commercial carbon for sustainable bifunctional electrocatalysis: Mapping insertion capacity, mass loss, and carbon reconstruction  ap. 1001-1011.  aAtomically dispersed earth-abundant metals in N-doped carbon (M-N-Cs) have emerged as a new class of electroactive materials that can match not only the performance of the precious metals but can catalyze both the cathodic and the anodic reactions due to their bifunctional behaviour. This inspires the development of simpler strategies for scale-up production since the existing ones rely on precursors whose commercial viability is not yet ascertained. Herein, we demonstrate the insertion prospects of M-Nₓ (M = Fe, Co, Ni) moieties, the electrocatalytic centers in the M-N-Cs, into commercial carbon to establish that a single-step heating of the inexpensive precursors is sufficient to generate bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with efficiencies that bypass the majority of the known catalysts. Further importantly, we quantify both the ORR and OER trends and the metal insertion limits for each metal while maintaining an atomic dispersion, without the formation of surface migration-induced clustering, because such clustering is inevitable in the existing processes to necessitate an extra acid-leaching step to remove them. We further quantify and explain for each metal a negative mass balance originating from anomalous mass loss of both metal and carbon content, and a massive reconstruction of the carbon backbone catalyzed by the very metal, an event documented for the first time though it ought to be associated with other M-N-C syntheses too. The study establishes an incredibly simple and inexpensive strategy for the realization of M-N-Cs and outlines the parameters to be considered during mass-production.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aelectrochemistry 3aheat 3aoxygen production 0aBifunctional catalysis 0aOxygen electrocatalysis 0aCommercial carbon 0aMetal insertion 0aCarbon reconstruction1 aSahoo, Lipipuspa1 aKaur, Komalpreet1 aVinod, C.P.1 aGautam, Ujjal K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0731-04290 tCarbon.g2022 Aug. 30, v. 196 p.1001-1011dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2022.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03519naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245013800175300001600313520196400329592002802293650001702321650001002338650001302348650002302361650002402384650001002408650001002418650001502428650001302443650002302456650001502479650001202494650002102506650001402527650001302541650001902554650001202573651001602585653002602601653001202627653001402639653002102653653002102674653002002695653001602715653002402731700002102755773010702776856008502883852000902968655001202977IND60580904620221120094215.0190214e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058090462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2017.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanentzap, Andrew J.10aFencing in nature? Predator exclusion restores habitat for native fauna and leads biodiversity to spill over into the wider landscape  ap. 119-126.  aLarge areas of habitat are being fenced globally to restore and relocate species that can no longer survive in their surrounding landscapes, such as because of introduced predators. Despite their promise, the contributions of fenced and intensively-managed reserves towards achieving wider biodiversity goals are contentious. There has been little empirical evidence that fenced reserves can restore communities or ecological function over larger landscapes in ways that justify their large economic and sometimes social costs. Here we tested whether the exclusion of introduced predators restored mammal-sensitive habitat after 8years within a mainland fenced reserve in southern New Zealand. We also asked whether the abundance of bird-dispersed fruiting trees and frugivorous birds was elevated immediately outside the reserve as compared with the broader landscape. We found that only saplings of fleshy-fruited tree species sensitive to browsing and seed predation by introduced mammals increased over time within the reserve. These mammal-sensitive trees were also more abundant in the surrounding unfenced landscape when close to the reserve, i.e. within 500m. Our results suggested that mammal-sensitive trees were benefitting from increased fruit dispersal that was spilling over the fenced boundary as mammal-sensitive frugivores responded to predator control. Using point count surveys at 278 unique sites throughout the broader region, we found that the native frugivore community that evolved in the absence of mammalian predators was a third more abundant within the reserve and immediately outside the fenced boundary than at sites 20km away in the surrounding landscape. Non-endemic frugivores did not show the same spatial pattern. Our work provides among the first evidence that an intensively-managed wildlife reserve can measurably restore populations of threatened flora and fauna and disperse conservation benefits into wider landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3abrowsing 3aconservation areas 3aecological function 3afauna 3aflora 3afrugivores 3ahabitats 3aintroduced species 3alandscapes 3amammals 3apredator control 3apredators 3asaplings 3aseed predation 3asurveys 3aNew Zealand 0aConservation planning 0aForests 0aHerbivory 0aInvasive species 0aMeta-populations 0aProtected areas 0aRestoration 0aVegetation recovery1 aLloyd, Kelvin M.0 tBiological conservation.g2017 Oct., v. 214 p.119-126dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2017.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100001700135245006400152300001500216520137600231592002801607650001501635650001501650650001401665650001301679650001601692650001401708650001401722650001101736650001301747700002101760700002201781773015301803856006901956856009602025990002302121852000902144655001202153IND60671846120221120122742.0191004e20190928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067184612DNAL7 a10.3791/602612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Alex C.10aTechnical detail for robot assisted pancreaticoduodenectomy  ap. e60261.  aSince its first report in 2003, robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy (RPD) has gained popularity among pancreatic surgeons. Inherent advantages of the robotic platform, including three-dimensional vision, wristed instruments, and improved ergonomics, allow the surgeon to recapitulate the principles of open pancreatoduodenectomy allowing safe oncologic dissection, hemostasis, and meticulous reconstruction. Over the course of the past decade, significant strides have been achieved in outlining the safety, feasibility, and learning curve of the robotic Whipple. When performed by high volume pancreatic surgeons experienced in RPD, recent comparative effectiveness studies show potential advantages compared to the open technique, including reductions in hospital stay and morbidity. National data also show reductions in conversion rates compared to its laparoscopic counterpart. Although long-term oncologic data are still needed, short-term oncologic surrogates of margin resection and lymph node harvest suggest no compromise in oncologic outcomes. As pancreatic surgeons increasingly integrate robotics into their practice, proficiency-based training and credentialing will be necessary for the safe application and dissemination of RPD. Here, we provide the detailed steps of a robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy performed at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.  aPublisher supplied data 3aergonomics 3ahemostasis 3ahospitals 3alearning 3alymph nodes 3amorbidity 3aresection 3arobots 3asurgeons1 aRist, Rebecca C.1 aZureikat, Amer H.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2019 Sept. 28, , no. 151 p.e60261-e60261dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/602613Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/60261/technical-detail-for-robot-assisted-pancreaticoduodenectomy  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010100165300001500266520139700281592002801678650002901706650001901735650001301754650001001767650001001777650001201787650002001799650001601819650001901835650001501854650002201869650001501891650001901906650001001925653001601935653001401951653001101965653001701976653001501993700001602008700001402024700001202038700001702050700001502067700005602082773008702138856008502225852000902310655001202319IND60779684520221118115258.0220830e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077968452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2022.06.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Keke10aNIR-II sensitive Co9S8/S-CDs@PEG nanocomposites with enhanced multi-enzyme mediated phototherapy  ap. 98-111.  aHere, Co₉S₈/S-CDs@PEG (CSCs@PEG) nanocomposites are synthesized by a two-step hydrothermal process. Firstly, sulfur-doped carbon dots (S-CDs) are prepared by using 3-mercaptopropionic acid as a precursor. A region with denser –SH group is regarded as nucleation site on S-CDs for the growth of Co₉S₈ to induce heterostructure. As-synthesized CSCs@PEG possess great harvest in NIR region and hyperthermia (51.5%, 1064 nm) for photothermal (PTT). Besides, hyperthermia can elevate the thermal energy of nanocomposite to assist low-energy NIR-II irradiation (1064 nm, 1.16 eV), realizing the excitation of Co₉S₈ (1.46 eV) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation for photodynamic therapy (PDT). What's more, CSCs@PEG exhibits GOx-like activity that could consume glucose to elevate H₂O₂ level and inhibit intracellular energy supply. In addition, they also show mimic peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) characterization, and the tandem multi-nanozye activities endue the enhanced chemotherapy (CDT) and PDT. CSCs@PEG reveals the greater ROS generation and nanozyme activity compared with pure Co₉S₈@PEG, attributing to the efficient charge separation in heterostructure. The novel biodegradation of CSCs@PEG makes the elimination via feces and urine within 2 weeks.

In this work, the environmental transformation behavior and potential toxicological implications of TBECH stereoisomers under the oxidation of OH· in the gas phase were investigated by computational chemistry. Our results indicate the complexity of the TBECH transformation reactions and the diversity of its transformation products in the atmosphere. Although the reactions of TBECH enantiomers with OH· exhibit highly consistency, it is obvious that the reactions of the four diastereoisomers of TBECH with OH· and their subsequent reactions have both specificity and similarity. The dehydrogenation intermediates produced by H-abstraction of OH· in the initial reactions may undergo oxidative debromination, hydroxylation and decomposition reactions, leading to the transformation into low bromine and monohydroxy substituted compounds, as well as debrominated or unbrominated unsaturated fatty ketones. The toxicity assessments show that all transformation products are less toxic to aquatic organisms than TBECH, but some of them are still classified at toxic or harmful levels. More importantly, some transformation products still exhibit carcinogenic and teratogenic activity. To our knowledge, this study provides, for the first time, a deep insight into the transformation mechanism, kinetics, and environmental impacts of atmospheric TBECH by theoretical calculations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abromine 3acarcinogenicity 3acyclohexanes 3adehydrogenation 3adiastereomers 3aenantiomers 3aenvironmental fate 3aflame retardants 3ahydroxylation 3aoxidation 3apollutants 3arisk 3ateratogenicity 3atoxicology 0aTBECH 0aTransformation 0aRate constant 0aToxicity 0aCarcinogenic and teratogenic1 aHe, Lin1 aLv, Guochun1 aSun, Xiaomin0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Sept. 05, v. 417 p.126031-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1260313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012000166520173600286592002802022650001902050650001202069650002202081650001702103650001402120650001502134650001102149650001102160650001602171650001302187650001602200650001602216650001102232651001202243651001002255651001302265651001302278653001902291653002602310653002602336653001902362653001802381700001802399700001902417700001802436700001702454773010102471856008502572852000902657655001202666IND60782653220221118121954.0220921e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078265322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dendro.2022.1259832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVersace, S.10aLocal environment prevails over population variations in growth-climate relationships of Pinus pinaster provenances  aIn view of the projected decrease in precipitation and increase in temperature, a better understanding on growth-climate responses in different populations of tree species is needed to improve and enhance the conservation and management strategies for major forest tree species. In this study, we assessed differences in growth traits (i.e., stem diameter, tree height, and stem radial growth) and analysed climate-growth relationships in five provenances of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) grown in four replicated common gardens in Sardinia (Italy). Stem radial growth increased under a positive water balance in late winter and early spring. Conversely, high temperature and low precipitation in summer had a negative impact on stem radial growth. At age 40, none of the considered provenances (Portugal, Corsica, Tuscany, Sardinia-Telti, Sardinia-Limbara) showed a substantial advantage in more than one common garden site for tree height and stem diameter. Nevertheless, differences were found among common garden sites in terms of dendrometric parameters, stem radial growth, and growth-climate responses (including sensitivity to summer drought), suggesting a greater site dependent over tree growth. Although in juvenile stages the Portuguese provenance (in particular) showed greater growth than the Sardinian ones, this study showed that, with tree age, the differences among the five provenances tends to narrow. Therefore, irrespective of the seed source, tree growth patterns and growth-climate responses were similar at age 40. This result can be important for implementing forest management strategies to balance adaptation and mitigation potential of maritime pine plantations in harsh environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus pinaster 3adrought 3aforest management 3aforest trees 3ajuveniles 3aprovenance 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3atree age 3atree growth 3atree height 3awinter 3aCorsica 3aItaly 3aPortugal 3aSardinia 0aSummer drought 0aMediterranean climate 0aPhenotypic plasticity 0aPinus pinaster 0aRadial growth1 aAntonucci, S.1 aSantopuoli, G.1 aMarchetti, M.1 aTognetti, R.0 tDendrochronologia.g2022 Oct., v. 75 p.125983-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl71157x1125-78657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dendro.2022.1259833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010800169300001400277520113900291592002801430650001401458650001401472650002301486650001301509650001201522650001101534650001101545650000801556653000801564653001201572653001301584653001601597653001701613653002001630653002101650700002101671700001801692700005601710773010001766856008301866852000901949655001201958IND60649422920221119225548.0190923e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064942292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2019.06.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayek, Naseem S.10aEffect of reaction conditions on the oxidative coupling of methane over doped MnOx-Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst  ap. 25-31.  aThe MnOx-Na2WO4/SiO2 mixed oxide is a highly promising catalyst for the oxidative coupling of methane to ethylene (OCM). But it seems that its catalytic performance still does not meet industrial requirements. Several additives were reported to promote its activity and selectivity such as Ti, Ce, La, etc. However, contradicting results were obtained in the different studies and the additives were not compared under the same reaction conditions. In this study, we tested several reported additives (Ti, Nb, Ce, and Sn) in OCM, which previously showed promising results, as well as additives (Ge and Fe) that were not examined before. Using these doped catalysts, it is shown that the improved performance and the long-term stability of these catalysts are a product of the specific reaction conditions, i.e. the extent of oxygen conversion and time on stream. We show that overall these catalyst systems are unstable and undergo severe deactivation that is masked if tested under conditions were the O2 is totally consumed. Finally, by characterizing spent catalysts, several possible deactivation mechanisms are briefly discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aethylene 3amethane 3aoxygen 3asilica 3atin 0aOCM 0aMethane 0aEthylene 0aMetal oxide 0aCristobalite 0aManganese oxide 0aSodium tungstate1 aKhlief, Grace J.1 aHorani, Faris1 aGazit, Oz M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8193-25010 tJournal of catalysis.g2019 Aug., v. 376 p.25-31dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2019.06.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01447naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245004700206300001600253520037800269592002800647650001300675650002100688650001100709650001400720650001300734650002800747653002000775653001600795653000800811653002300819700001900842700001500861773011400876856008600990852000901076655001201085IND60782653420221118122022.0220914e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078265342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tplants.2022.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Huibin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8758-475210aCLE peptides join the plant longevity club  ap. 961-963.  aLeaf senescence, the final step of leaf development, is an essential adaptive process that involves intricate regulatory networks mediated by various developmental and environmental clues.

This defect is found in the spermatozoa of many livestock species. The aim of the study was to assess the morphometry of the heads of normal sperm and sperm with the Dag defect in the semen of Duroc breeding boars. Sperm morphology was examined in ten ejaculates each from 12 Duroc boars. In total, 3,600 morphologically normal sperm and 838 sperm with the Dag defect were evaluated. The area, perimeter, length and width of the sperm head were measured and these basic morphometric parameters were used to calculate four additional shape indices characterising the sperm head, i.e. ellipticity, elongation, roughness and regularity. Sperm with this defect had markedly smaller heads, 0.32 μm shorter and 0.19 μm narrower than the heads of sperm with normal morphological structure. The heads of sperm with the Dag defect also had a 1.1μm smaller perimeter and a 2.5 μm² smaller surface area than the heads of morphologically normal sperm. The Dag defect is found in boar sperm irrespective of the age of the individual. It affects the morphology of the sperm head.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDuroc 3aboars 3amorphometry 3aroughness 3asemen 3aspermatozoa 3asurface area 3aveterinary medicine 0aboar 0aDag defect 0asperm 0atail of spermatozoon1 aAndraszek, Katarzyna0 tJournal of Veterinary Research.g2021 Apr. 23, v. 65, no. 2 p.239-244dSciendowJournal:23185x2450-86087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/jvetres-2021-00193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02050naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245006900170500002200239520091600261592002801177650002101205650001001226650002901236650001401265650001401279653002901293653001101322653001301333653001401346653002301360653002501383700002601408700006101434773008601495856008601581852000901667655001201676IND60782653620221118122004.0220802s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078265362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tplants.2022.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacquet, Joris10aGenetic co-option into plant–filamentous pathogen interactions  aPre-press version  aPlants are engaged in a coevolutionary arms race with their pathogens that drives rapid diversification and specialization of genes involved in resistance and virulence. However, some major innovations in plant–pathogen interactions, such as molecular decoys, trans-kingdom RNA interference, two-speed genomes, and receptor networks, evolved through the expansion of the functional landscape of genes. This is a typical outcome of genetic co-option, the evolutionary process by which available genes are recruited into new biological functions. Co-option into plant–pathogen interactions emerges generally from (i) cis-regulatory variation, (ii) horizontal gene transfer (HGT), (iii) mutations altering molecular promiscuity, and (iv) rewiring of gene networks and protein complexes. Understanding these molecular mechanisms is key for the functional and predictive biology of plant–pathogen interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3agenes 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3apathogens 3avirulence 0aplant disease resistance 0afungus 0aoomycete 0aevolution 0avirulence effector 0atransposable element1 aMounichetty, Shantala1 aRaffaele, Sylvain1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2442-96320 tTrends in plant science.g2022, dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl53669x1360-13857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2022.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04028naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245015900168300001600327520189300343592002802236650002202264650002402286650003202310650002802342650002602370650001602396650001702412650000902429650002002438650001702458650001802475650001902493650002302512650001702535650000902552650002002561650001602581650002502597650001702622650001002639650003302649650001702682650002502699650001702724650001502741650003702756650002802793650000902821650003002830650001802860650002202878650001702900651000902917653002002926653000802946653000802954653001202962653001602974700002802990700001903018700002403037700003903061773011503100856008203215852000903297655001203306IND60741733120221119064519.0210623e20210423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074173312DNAL7 a10.2478/jvetres-2021-00202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatiraee, Farzad10aMolecular identification and antifungal susceptibility patterns of dermatophytes isolated from companion animals with clinical symptoms of dermatophytosis  ap. 175-182.  aDermatophytosis is a common skin disease in cats and dogs caused by Microsporum and Trichophyton fungi. Species identification and knowledge of their antifungal susceptibility are therapeutically and epidemiologically important. This study assessed the prevalence of feline and canine dermatophytosis in Iran, identified the aetiological agents molecularly and tested their antifungal susceptibility. A total of 308 companion animals (134 dogs and 174 cats) with skin lesions were examined from March 2015 to March 2018. Hair and skin samples were examined by microscopy with 20% KOH and cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar with cycloheximide and chloramphenicol. Fungal isolates were confirmed by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) r-DNA region. The antifungal susceptibility of dermatophytes was tested by broth microdilution assay using standard drugs. Dermatophytes were found in 130 (42.2%) samples, 62 of them feline and 68 canine. Based on sequencing of all strains, M. canis (78.5%, P<0.05), M. gypseum (10.7%), and T. mentagrophytes (10.7%) were the dermatophytes isolated. The non-dermatophyte species Nannizziopsis vriesii was also isolated from two feline dermatomycosis cases. Dogs and cats younger than one year (61.5%) showed a statistically significantly higher prevalence of infection (P<0.05). Caspofungin produced the lowest geometric mean MIC at 0.0018 μg/mL, followed by ketoconazole, terbinafine, itraconazole, miconazole, griseofulvin, clotrimazole and fluconazole, in a 0.038–1.53 μg/mL range. This is the first molecular study to identify the causes of pet dermatophytosis in north-western Iran. ITS-PCR was shown to be a useful and reliable method for the identification of closely related species of dermatophytes in clinical and epidemiological settings. The lowest MIC of caspofungin indicated that this drug was the most potent in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrosporum canis 3aMicrosporum gypseum 3aTrichophyton mentagrophytes 3aanimal pathogenic fungi 3aantifungal properties 3acaspofungin 3acat diseases 3acats 3achloramphenicol 3aclotrimazole 3acycloheximide 3adermatomycoses 3adisease prevalence 3adog diseases 3adogs 3adrug resistance 3afluconazole 3afungicide resistance 3agriseofulvin 3ahairs 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aitraconazole 3akeratinophilic fungi 3aketoconazole 3amiconazole 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3apathogen identification 3apets 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3askin lesions 3aIran 0adermatophytosis 0acat 0adog 0aITS-PCR 0aantifungals1 aKouchak Kosari, Yasaman1 aSoltani, Minoo1 aShokri, Hojjatollah1 aHassan Minooieanhaghighi, Mohammad0 tJournal of Veterinary Research.g2021 Apr. 23, v. 65, no. 2 p.175-182dSciendowJournal:23185x2450-86087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/jvetres-2021-00203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011600164300001600280520181800296592002802114650002202142650000902164650001402173650001202187650001402199650002302213650001302236653003402249653001602283653001802299653002402317653001502341653002802356653002602384700001802410773012502428856008302553852000902636655001202645IND60713009820221120233503.0211227e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071300982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.10.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Xinyi10aMolecular dynamics simulations of the colloidal interaction between smectite clay nanoparticles in liquid water  ap. 610-621.  aColloidal interactions between clay nanoparticles have been studied extensively because of their strong influence on the hydrology and mechanics of many soils and sedimentary media. The predominant theory used to describe these interactions is the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) model, a framework widely applied in colloidal and interfacial science that accurately predicts the interactions between charged surfaces across water films at distances greater than ~ 3 nm (i.e., ten water monolayers). Unfortunately, the DLVO model is inaccurate at the shorter interparticle distances that predominate in most subsurface environments. For example, it inherently cannot predict the existence of equilibrium states wherein clay particles adopt interparticle distances equal to the thickness of one, two, or three water monolayers. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have the potential to provide detailed information on the free energy of interaction between clay nanoparticles; however, they have only been used to examine clay swelling and aggregation at interparticle distances below 1 nm. We present the first MD simulation predictions of the free energy of interaction of smectite clay nanoparticles in the entire range of interparticle distances from the large interparticle distances where the DLVO model is accurate (>3 nm) to the short-range swelling states where non-DLVO interactions predominate (<1 nm). Our simulations examine a range of salinities (0.0 to 1.0 M NaCl) and counterion types (Na, K, Ca) and establish a detailed picture of the breakdown of the DLVO model. In particular, they confirm previous theoretical suggestions of the existence of a strong non-DLVO attraction with a range of ~ 3 nm arising from specific ion-clay Coulomb interactions in the electrical double layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aclay 3ahydrology 3aliquids 3amechanics 3amolecular dynamics 3asmectite 0aMolecular dynamics simulation 0aDLVO theory 0aClay swelling 0aDisjoining pressure 0aAdsorption 0aElectrical double layer 0aColloidal aggregation1 aBourg, Ian C.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 584 p.610-621dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.10.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02126naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245016100172300001400333500001900347520072000366592002801086650001801114650001001132650001701142650001901159650001101178650002501189650001901214650001801233650001801251650001901269653001401288653002501302653002401327653001201351700001901363700001601382700002901398700002101427700001801448773011001466856008301576852000901659655001201668IND60713009920221120233555.0201125e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071300992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcpa.2020.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbd-Ellatieff, Hoda10aCorrelation of Immunomodulatory Cytokine Expression with Histopathological Changes and Viral Antigen in a Hamster Model of Equine Herpesvirus-9 Encephalitis  ap. 46-54.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA group of hamsters (n = 25) was intranasally infected with equine herpesvirus-9 (EHV-9) and mRNA transcription levels of several proinflammatory (IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-6) and anti-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-β) cytokines were investigated in brain tissue using RT-qPCR.

Both the mobile and stationary phases are liquids, so no solid support matrix is used. CCC has gained wide acceptance as a preparative technique in a variety of fields. Because the mobile and stationary phases are both liquids, gradient elution is difficult to perform with CCC. Phase equilibrium must be maintained, so any change in the composition of one phase may induce a compositional change in the other. In this work, a new linear gradient elution method was developed for CCC. Biphasic solvent systems containing heptane, ethyl acetate, methanol, and water (HepEMWat) in various ratios were prepared and used to optimize both isocratic and linear gradient CCC separation with methanol. We first separated a test mixture of four standard compounds with partition coefficients ranging from 0.8 to 7.8. The separation resembled a reversed-phase process, and elution was performed while progressively decreasing the polarity of the mobile phase. Target molecules with small partition coefficients eluted first in the lower phase of the optimized HepEMWat solvent system. Elution of constituents with large partition coefficients was quite slow under isocratic conditions. Separation time was significantly reduced when elution was performed with a linear gradient using methanol and the optimal HepEMWat system. Elution with a 3:7:4:6 (v/v/v/v) HepEMWat system took approximately 200 min. This included an 80-min isocratic step, followed by gradient elution with methanol from 0% to 30%. The optimized methanol linear gradient CCC method was then used to separate a complex mixture of natural products isolated from Sinopodophyllum hexandrum (Royle) Ying roots. Twelve compounds with a wide range of polarities were well-resolved in a single separation. We have developed a convenient and cost-effective strategy for the separation of complex mixtures. No tedious mobile phase preparation step is required. The volume of unused mobile phase is minimal, so little solvent is wasted. The method is an important advance for the separation of mixtures that contain many compounds with a large range of polarities and partition coefficients, which are common features of natural products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPodophyllum hexandrum 3acost effectiveness 3acountercurrent chromatography 3aethyl acetate 3aheptane 3amethanol 3apartition coefficients 3aroots 3asolvents 0aCounter-current chromatography 0aGradient elution 0aSinopodophyllum hexandrum 0aPodophyllotoxins 0aFlavones1 aGuo, Peipei1 aHan, Rui1 aWu, Dingfang1 aGao, Jin-Ming1 aWu, Shihua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1669-75220 tJournal of chromatography.g2019 Oct. 11, v. 1603 p.251-261dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2019.06.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03318naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245012100153300001800274500002000292520162000312592002801932596005901960596005702019596005902076650002702135650001902162650002102181650003002202650002402232650002902256650001602285650001202301650001502313650003102328650001002359650003702369650001102406650002002417650001402437650001302451650001402464700001402478700001402492700001202506700006702518773013302585856007302718852000902791655001202800IND60688526120221118033817.0200415e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068852612DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.145682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, T.10aAntibacterial potential of Juglomycin A isolated from Streptomyces achromogenes, an endophyte of Crocus sativus Linn  ap. 1366-1377.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: To evaluate the antimicrobial potential of Juglomycins isolated from Streptomyces achromogenes E91CS4, an endophyte of Crocus sativus Linn. METHODS AND RESULTS: The extract from E91CS4 displayed significant antimicrobial activity against several pathogens. The endophyte was identified as S. achromogenes on by 16S ribosomal gene analysis. Chemical investigation of the extract led to the isolation of two naphthoquinone antibiotics, Juglomycin A and B. Juglomycin A inhibited several pathogens, with an MIC value of 13·7µg ml⁻¹, whereas it was most potent against Escherichia coli, Bacillus thuringiensis and Xanthobacter flavus with MIC values of 6·8, 3·4 and 6·8 µg ml⁻¹ respectively. It was found to reduce the biofilm formation in E. coli through inhibition of swimming and swarming motilities and downregulation of fimH gene. The α‐haemolysin‐related gene (hlyA) was also downregulated indicating that the compound is also reducing the virulence in E. coli. In vitro time kill kinetics showed efficient bactericidal activity of this compound. Furthermore, Juglomycin A inhibited bacterial transcription/translation in vitro, while also inducing postantibiotic effect in E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: Juglomycin A is a potential antimicrobial compound against several bacterial pathogens, particularly, E. coli. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study showed the promising potential of Juglomycin A as an antimicrobial agent. Efforts should be made to scale up the production of this compound and conduct further studies to explore its efficacy as an antibiotic, using in vivo models.  aPublisher supplied data  aMLP1008cCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research  a00107cCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research  cDepartment of Science and Technology, New Delhi, India 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aCrocus sativus 3aEscherichia coli 3aStreptomyces achromogenes 3aXanthobacter flavus 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3abiofilm 3aendophytes 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amodels 3anaphthoquinones 3apathogens 3aswimming 3avirulence1 aArora, P.1 aNalli, Y.1 aAli, A.1 aRiyaz‐Ul‐Hassan, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8475-34690 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2020 May, v. 128, no. 5 p.1366-1377dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.145683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245009100169300001600260520139400276592002801670650000801698650001401706650002301720650001301743650002201756650002201778650001301800650001301813650001101826650002601837650002501863650001401888650000701902650001801909650001901927650001801946650001301964653000901977653000801986653000901994653002202003653000902025653001002034653002402044653001502068700001602083700001802099700001902117700002202136700005602158773010302214856008702317852000902404655001202413IND60545726720221118074620.0160902e20150901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054572672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.04.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xiaofen10aImpact of mitigation strategies on acid sulfate soil chemistry and microbial community  ap. 215-221.  aPotential acid sulfate soils contain reduced iron sulfides that if oxidized, can cause significant environmental damage by releasing large amounts of acid and metals. This study examines metal and acid release as well as the microbial community capable of catalyzing metal sulfide oxidation after treating acid sulfate soil with calcium carbonate (CaCO3) or calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2). Leaching tests of acid sulfate soil samples were carried out in the laboratory. The pH of the leachate during the initial flushing with water lay between 3.8 and 4.4 suggesting that the jarosite/schwertmannite equilibrium controls the solution chemistry. However, the pH increased to circa 6 after treatment with CaCO3 suspension and circa 12 after introducing Ca(OH)2 solution. 16S rRNA gene sequences amplified from community DNA extracted from the untreated and both CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2 treated acid sulfate soils were most similar to bacteria (69.1% to 85.7%) and archaea (95.4% to 100%) previously identified from acid and metal contaminated environments. These species included a Thiomonas cuprina-like and an Acidocella-like bacteria as well as a Ferroplasma acidiphilum-like archeon. Although the CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2 treatments did not decrease the proportion of microorganisms capable of accelerating acid and metal release, the chemical effects of the treatments suggested their reduced activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aThiomonas 3aacid sulfate soils 3abacteria 3acalcium carbonate 3acalcium hydroxide 3ajarosite 3aleaching 3ametals 3amicrobial communities 3anucleotide sequences 3aoxidation 3apH 3aribosomal RNA 3asoil chemistry 3asoil sampling 3asulfides 0aPASS 0aASS 0aRFLP 0aAcid sulfate soil 0aAcid 0aMetal 0aMolecular phylogeny 0aAcidophile1 aSten, Pekka1 aEngblom, Sten1 aNowak, Paweł,1 aÖsterholm, Peter1 aDopson, Mark1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9622-33180 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Sept. 01, v. 526 p.215-221dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.04.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01097naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245011900155300001400274520017300288592002800461653003000489653001400519653001800533653001700551653001600568700002200584773011700606856007500723852000900798655001200807IND60129441420221120214616.0151124e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012944142DNAL7 a10.3956/2011-23.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamesha, B.14aThe genus Mecobaris Marshall (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Baridinae) from India with description of one new species  ap. 22-34.  aThe genus Mecobaris Marshall (Curculionidae: Baridinae) is revised.

The perilous effects of nitrate present in the environment pose a major threat to human and animal health. Bioremediation provides a cost‐effective and environmental friendly method to deal with this problem. The process of aerobic denitrification can reduce nitrate compounds to harmless dinitrogen gas. This review provides a brief view of the exhaustive role played by aerobic denitrifiers for tackling nitrate pollution under different ecological niches and their dependency on various environmental parameters. It also provides an understanding of the enzymes involved in aerobic denitrification. The role of aerobic denitrification to solve the issues faced by the conventional method (aerobic nitrification–anaerobic denitrification) in treating nitrogen‐polluted wastewaters is elaborated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal and human health 3abioremediation 3acost effectiveness 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying bacteria 3aenvironmental factors 3aenzymes 3aniches 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen compounds 3apollution 3awastewater1 aBhatia, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3879-54221 aSetia, H.1 aPathania, P.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2020 May, v. 128, no. 5 p.1261-1278dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.144763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006400168300001300232520138300245592002801628650001601656650001101672650001401683650002001697650001001717650002101727650003501748650001201783650001801795650002301813650001401836650002201850650002201872650001201894650001101906650001601917650002501933650001701958650001501975650001301990651001102003700001502014700002602029700002402055700002302079773013002102856008202232852000902314655001202323IND50067121520221119074424.0220206e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006712152DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-013-1586-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíaz-Torres, E.10aEndocrine Disruptors in the Xochimilco Wetland, Mexico City  ap. 1586.  aThe concentration of a range of endocrine disruptors: 17-β-estradiol, estrone, 17-α-ethinylestradiol, bisphenol-A, pentachlorophenol, triclosan, and butylbenzylphthalate, was analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in the Wetland zone of Xochimilco, a periurban area of Mexico City, during an annual cycle. Samples were taken based on their level of use and by selecting sampling points related with activities such as agriculture, livestock, and urban, as well as their potential presence in water at the Cerro de la Estrella Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) which supplies the majority of water (>90 %) to the study area. The compounds analyzed are present in a wide range of products from cosmetics to home care, pharmaceuticals, and subproducts of the food industry. The importance of identifying these compounds lies in the fact that they can disrupt the endocrine system of vertebrates, in particular reproductive gland function, affecting the development of organisms and their offspring. Pentachlorophenol, triclosan, bisphenol-A, butylbenzylphthalate, estrone, and 17-β-estradiol were detected in concentrations in nanogram-per-liter levels; 17-α-ethinylestradiol was always below the detection limit. The compounds showed a trend toward greater concentrations in the rainy season, probably due to the runoff that carries these compounds into the system.  aPublisher supplied data 3abisphenol A 3acities 3acosmetics 3adetection limit 3adrugs 3aendocrine system 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aestrone 3afood industry 3agas chromatography 3alivestock 3amass spectrometry 3apentachlorophenol 3aprogeny 3arunoff 3avertebrates 3awastewater treatment 3awater supply 3awet season 3awetlands 3aMexico1 aGibson, R.1 aGonzález-Farías, F.1 aZarco-Arista, A.

It has, however, been notoriously difficult to find conclusive empirical support for these predictions. We performed a comprehensive test of the energy budget rule in the honeybee, Apis mellifera, by constructing empirical utility functions and by testing the choice of bees for a constant or variable reward with an olfactory conditioning assay subsequent to manipulating their energy budgets. We demonstrate that a decline in energetic state leads to an increasing choice for a variable reward, while an increase in energetic state leads to an increased choice for a constant reward. We then show that subjects maintained on constant high or low energy budgets are risk indifferent, which suggests that an animal must perceive a change in its energetic state to be risk sensitive. We discuss the challenges of finding empirical evidence for the energy budget rule and the necessity of integrating physiological assays in these tests. Based on our previous results showing that parasitic infections cause an energetic stress in honeybees, we also discuss the possibility of energetic shortfall being responsible for the observed display of risky behaviour in infected bees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aanimal behavior 3aanimals 3aenergy 3ahoney bees 3aparasitoses 3aprediction 3arisk 3arisk behavior 3autility functions1 aNaug, Dhruba0 tAnimal behaviour.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 82, no. 3 p.595-600dElsevier Ltdx0003-34727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.06.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03598naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245010300160300001600263500002000279520223600299592002802535650001902563650001102582650001202593650001302605650002202618650001202640650001302652650001102665650001602676650001402692650001702706650001102723650001502734650001202749650002202761650001202783650001202795651001202807651001402819651001502833700002002848700002502868773013002893856007203023852000903095655001203104IND60587537220221122113012.0180319e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058753722DNAL7 a10.1890/04-00592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBjorndal, Karen A.10aEvaluating trends in abundance of immature green turtles, chelonia mydas, in the greater caribbean  ap. 304-314.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMany long‐lived marine species exhibit life history traits that make them more vulnerable to overexploitation. Accurate population trend analysis is essential for development and assessment of management plans for these species. However, because many of these species disperse over large geographic areas, have life stages inaccessible to human surveyors, and/or undergo complex developmental migrations, data on trends in abundance are often available for only one stage of the population, usually breeding adults. The green turtle (Chelonia mydas) is one of these long‐lived species for which population trends are based almost exclusively on either numbers of females that emerge to nest or numbers of nests deposited each year on geographically restricted beaches. In this study, we generated estimates of annual abundance for juvenile green turtles at two foraging grounds in the Bahamas based on long‐term capture–mark–recapture (CMR) studies at Union Creek (24 years) and Conception Creek (13 years), using a two‐stage approach. First, we estimated recapture probabilities from CMR data using the Cormack‐Jolly‐Seber models in the software program MARK; second, we estimated annual abundance of green turtles at both study sites using the recapture probabilities in a Horvitz‐Thompson type estimation procedure. Green turtle abundance did not change significantly in Conception Creek, but, in Union Creek, green turtle abundance had successive phases of significant increase, significant decrease, and stability. These changes in abundance resulted from changes in immigration, not survival or emigration. The trends in abundance on the foraging grounds did not conform to the significantly increasing trend for the major nesting population at Tortuguero, Costa Rica. This disparity highlights the challenges of assessing population‐wide trends of green turtles and other long‐lived species. The best approach for monitoring population trends may be a combination of (1) extensive surveys to provide data for large‐scale trends in relative population abundance, and (2) intensive surveys, using CMR techniques, to estimate absolute abundance and evaluate the demographic processes driving the trends.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChelonia mydas 3aadults 3abeaches 3abreeding 3acomputer software 3afemales 3aforaging 3ahumans 3aimmigration 3ajuveniles 3alife history 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anesting 3apopulation growth 3astreams 3asurveys 3aBahamas 3aCaribbean 3aCosta Rica1 aBolten, Alan B.1 aChaloupka, Milani Y.0 tEcological applications.g2005 Feb., v. 15, no. 1 p.304-314dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/04-00593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245012800204300001600332520134400348592002801692650001901720650002101739650002001760650002001780650001301800650001101813650001101824650001901835650001901854650000801873650000901881650001701890700001701907700001801924700001201942700001401954700001701968700001701985700005402002700005502056700005202111700001802163700005702181773012002238856008302358852000902441655001202450IND60767318320221120163909.0220214e20210811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076731832DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.1c007002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Qingrui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9133-803910aStrong Hydration Ability of Silk Fibroin Suppresses Formation and Recrystallization of Ice Crystals During Cryopreservation  ap. 478-486.  aThe cryopreservation (CP) of cell/tissue is indispensable in medical science. However, the formation of ice during cooling and ice recrystallization/growth in time of thawing present significant risk of cell/tissue damage upon analysis of CP process. Herein, the natural and biocompatible silk fibroin (SF) with regular hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains, were first employed as a cryoprotectant (CPA), to the CP of human bone-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs), which has been routinely cyropreserved for cell-based therapies. Addtion of SF can regulate the formation of ice crystals during cooling process because of its strong hydration ability in the comparation to the cryopreservation medium (CM) without SF. Moreover, the devitrification-induced recrystallization/growth of ice during the thawing process is suppressed. Most importantly, the addition of 10 mg mL–¹ SF can achieve 81.28% cell viability of cryopreserved hBMSCs as similar as those with the addition of 180 mg mL–¹ Ficoll 70 (commercial CPA), and the functions of the cryopreserved hBMSCs are maintained as good as that of the fresh ones. This work is not only significant for meeting the ever-increasing demand of cell therapy, but also trailblazing for designing materials in controlling ice formation and growth during the CP of other cells and tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell viability 3acryopreservation 3acryoprotectants 3acrystallization 3afibroins 3aficoll 3ahumans 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aice 3arisk 3atherapeutics1 aDou, Mengjia1 aMao, Junqiang1 aHou, Yi1 aLiu, Shuo1 aZhao, Lishan1 aLv, Jianyong1 aLiu, Zhang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8433-62891 aWang, Yilin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8455-390X1 aRao, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4168-02981 aJin, Shenglin1 aWang, Jianjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1704-99220 tBiomacromolecules.g2021 Aug. 11, v. 23, no. 2 p.478-486dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.1c007003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245010800170300001600278520154900294592002801843650001901871650002901890650001101919650001501930650001601945650001501961650001501976650000901991650002002000650001102020650001402031650001702045651001202062653001602074653002002090653001402110653001502124653001702139700002502156700001702181700001802198773010602216856008702322852000902409655001202418IND60545726920221118075238.0160902e20150815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054572692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.04.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarx, Conrad10aEnvironmental risk assessment of antibiotics including synergistic and antagonistic combination effects  ap. 269-279.  aThe interaction-based hazard index (HIint) allows a prediction of mixture effects different from linear additivity by including information on binary mixtures between the chemicals. The aim of this study is to make a solid estimate on the possible synergistic potential of combined antibiotics and to quantify the subsequent effect for the case of the receiving river Elbe, Germany. Pieces of information on binary interactions between antibiotic groups were used from literature and from knowledge on human antibiotic combination therapy. Applying a moderate and a worst-case scenario, in terms of the interaction magnitude, resulted in 50 to 200% higher environmental risks, compared to the classical assessment approach applying simple concentration addition. A subsequent sensitivity analysis revealed that the data strength for some binary antibiotic combinations is too low to be considered for a solid estimate of synergistic effects. This led to the definition of certain preconditions in order to decide whether or not to include certain interaction information (e.g. the necessary number of interaction studies). The exclusion of information with low data strength resulted in an attenuated risk increase of 20 to 50%, based on the currently available scientific information on binary antibiotic mixtures. In order to include antibiotics with the highest share in the overall risk (macrolides, quinolones, and cephalosporins) as well as their corresponding metabolites, investigations should focus on binary interactions between them.  aPublisher supplied data 3acephalosporins 3aenvironmental assessment 3ahumans 3amacrolides 3ametabolites 3aprediction 3aquinolones 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3asynergism 3atherapeutics 3aGermany 0aAntibiotics 0aRisk assessment 0aSynergism 0aAntagonism 0aHazard index1 aMühlbauer, Viktoria1 aKrebs, Peter1 aKuehn, Volker0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Aug. 15, v. 524-525 p.269-279dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.04.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245012700204300001600331520098600347592002801333650002301361650002001384650002001404650001701424650002301441650000801464650001901472650001701491700001901508700006201527773012001589856008301709852000901792655001201801IND60767318420221120163924.0220214e20211116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076731842DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.1c011262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajan, Robin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6610-966110aDesign of an Ice Recrystallization-Inhibiting Polyampholyte-Containing Graft Polymer for Inhibition of Protein Aggregation  ap. 487-496.  aFreezing-induced damage to proteins, through osmotic stress and ice recrystallization, during protein processing and long-term storage is a serious concern and may lead to loss of protein activity owing to denaturation. In this study, graft copolymers composed of a cryoprotective polymer (capable of preventing osmotic stress) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA; known for its high ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) property) were developed. The polymers had high IRI activity, albeit slightly lower than that of PVA alone, but substantially higher than that of succinylated ε-poly-l-lysine (PLLSA) alone. The graft polymers showed an efficiency higher than that of PVA or PLLSA alone in protecting proteins from multiple freeze–thaw cycles, as well as during prolonged freezing, indicating a synergy between PVA and PLLSA. The PLLSA-based graft polymer is a promising material for use in protein biopharmaceutics for the long-term storage of proteins under freezing conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3acryoprotectants 3acrystallization 3adenaturation 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3aice 3aosmotic stress 3astorage time1 aKumar, Nishant1 aMatsumura, Kazuaki1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9484-30730 tBiomacromolecules.g2021 Nov. 16, v. 23, no. 2 p.487-496dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.1c011263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002400148245009600172300001600268520186600284592002802150650002002178650001802198650001402216650001502230650002802245650001502273650001502288650001302303650001002316700001702326700002002343700001902363700002402382700002202406700002302428773011102451856008402562852000902646655001202655IND4462364320221123043450.0141112e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446236432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2011.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLascano, Cecilia I.10aOrganophosphorus insecticides affect normal polyamine metabolism in amphibian embryogenesis  ap. 240-247.  aThe objective of the present study was to evaluate the concentration- and time-dependent effects of the organophosphorus insecticides malathion and azinphos-methyl on polyamine metabolism, and relate them to normal and altered embryonic development of the common toad Rhinella arenarum. Control embryos showed that the higher polyamines spermidine and spermine acquired importance with respect to the diamine putrescine as embryonic development progressed. The activity of ornithine decarboxylase significantly decreased in complete operculum embryos. Continuous exposure to malathion caused a decrease in polyamine levels during embryonic development. However, there was an increase in putrescine levels in complete operculum embryos exposed to a sublethal concentration of the insecticide. Embryos exposed to malathion displayed a decrease in fresh weight and size, along with an increase in the number of malformed individuals. R. arenarum embryos exposed to a lethal concentration of azinphos-methyl showed an increase in putrescine levels and a decrease in spermidine and spermine levels, accompanied by an increase in ornithine decarboxylase activity. In conclusion, as the embryonic development of the toad R. arenarum progresses, polyamine metabolism shifts to higher polyamine levels with a more preponderant contribution of spermidine and spermine with respect to putrescine and involves a dramatic change in ornithine decarboxylase activity, one of the key regulatory enzymes of the pathway. Organophosphorus insecticides are capable of altering polyamine metabolism, slowing embryo development in parallel with a reduction in spermidine and spermine levels. An increase in the oxidative degradation of polyamines might be involved in the toxic action of organophosphorus insecticides and might also be related to other effects such as teratogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aazinphos-methyl 3aembryogenesis 3amalathion 3ametabolism 3aornithine decarboxylase 3aputrescine 3aspermidine 3aspermine 3atoads1 aFerrari, Ana1 aGauna, Lidia E.1 aCocca, Claudia1 aCochón, Adriana C.1 aVerrengia, Noemí1 aVenturino, Andrés0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2011 Nov., v. 101, no. 3 p.240-247dElsevier Inc.x0048-35757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2011.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03159naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245008900157300001600246500002000262520180000282592002802082650002402110650001602134650001502150650001002165650000902175650001502184650000902199650001402208650001702222650003402239650001402273650001602287650002902303650002502332650002302357650001802380650002802398650001202426700001802438700002202456773013002478856007202608852000902680655001202689IND60587537420221122081008.0180319e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058753742DNAL7 a10.1890/03-53392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Barry D.12aA clutch and brood survival model that discriminates random and correlated mortality  ap. 281-293.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aQuantitative conservation methodologies such as Population Viability Analysis (PVA) require reliable estimates of life history parameters such as breeding success. The utility of such metrics for egg‐laying species is complicated by the fact that the mortality of eggs and juveniles can occur both randomly and independently over time, or catastrophically, as in the sudden loss of a clutch or brood. Not knowing the nature of mortality caused by either or both of abiotic (e.g., weather) and biotic (e.g., predation) events limits our ability to confidently assess a population's demography and sustainability, or rank competing hypotheses. To address this deficiency, we describe a statistical model that estimates egg and juvenile survival rates continuously from laying to fledging based on periodic observations of individual clutches and broods. Adjunct data on environmental or predation threats can be included in the model as covariate series potentially affecting juvenile survival. Our model can statistically characterize mortality between the extremes of random and catastrophic mortality and can determine if unwitnessed mortalities occurred independently or were correlated (i.e., overdispersed, where catastrophe is extreme overdispersion). Overdispersion is estimated as a parameter of the beta‐binomial probability distribution of survival outcomes, which differs from its treatment in Program MARK where overdispersion is an a posteriori diagnostic referred to as ĉ. We used data for the sea duck Barrow's Goldeneye to illustrate our model. Specifically, we contribute to the argument that a larger brood confers a fitness advantage to a tending hen by concluding that brood size on hatch day is positively correlated with a juvenile's probability of surviving to fledge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBucephala islandica 3acorrelation 3ademography 3aducks 3aeggs 3afledglings 3ahens 3ajuveniles 3alife history 3apopulation viability analysis 3apredation 3aprobability 3aprobability distribution 3areproductive success 3astatistical models 3asurvival rate 3asustainable development 3aweather1 aBoyd, W.

High temperature conditions cause a reduction of fertility due to alterations in meiotic processes and gametogenesis. The male gametophyte development has been shown to be particularly sensitive to heat stress, and even short-term and modest temperature shifts cause alterations in crossover formation. In line with previous reports, we observed that male meiosis in the monocot barley exposed for 24–45 h to heat stress (32–42 °C) partially or completely eliminates obligate crossover formation and causes unbalanced chromosome segregation and meiotic abortion. Depending on the severity of heat stress, the structure and organization of the chromosomes were altered. In addition to alterations in chromosome structure and dynamics, heat treatment abolished or reduced the formation of a callose wall surrounding the meiocytes and interrupted the cell cycle progression leading to cytokinesis defects and microspore cell death.  aPublisher supplied data  a11G7421NcResearch Foundation Flanders - FWO (BE) 3aLiliopsida 3aabortion (plants) 3abarley 3acallose 3acell death 3acell walls 3achromosome segregation 3achromosomes 3acytokinesis 3agametogenesis 3agametophytes 3aheat stress 3aheat treatment 3amale sterility 3amales 3ameiosis 3aplant reproduction 3atemperature1 aDrozdowska, Zofia1 aDe Mooij, Len1 aGeelen, Danny1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8105-39370 tPlant reproduction.g2021 Sept., v. 34, no. 3 p.243-253dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:12165x2194-79537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00497-021-00415-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01448naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245013200156300001800288500001900306520038600325592002800711650001200739650001700751650002000768650002200788650001400810650001900824650001800843650002100861700002000882773012500902856007401027852000901101655001201110IND60738990020221119162819.0210526e20210524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073899002DNAL7 a10.1039/d1gc00753j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMori, Shogo10aC(sp³)–H bond functionalization with styrenes via hydrogen-atom transfer to an aqueous hydroxyl radical under photocatalysis  ap. 3575-3580.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe redox-neutral addition of α-C–H bonds of acetonitrile and acetone to styrenes was enabled via the hydrogen-atom transfer from relatively acidic and water-miscible C(sp³)–H bonds to an aqueous hydroxyl radical generated cleanly and iteratively by the oxidation of water under silver-nanoparticle-loaded titania photocatalysis without using stoichiometric oxidation agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aacetonitrile 3agreen chemistry 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3astoichiometry 3atitanium dioxide1 aSaitō, Susumu,0 tGreen chemistry.g2021 May 24, v. 23, no. 10 p.3575-3580dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1gc00753j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02337naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245009300173300001600266520081300282592002801095650001501123650001401138650001401152650002301166650001601189650001601205650001001221650002301231653001401254653002101268653002901289653003001318653003101348653002101379700002301400700002201423700002201445700002501467700002401492700002301516700002201539700002501561700001801586700001801604700002801622773007901650856008101729852000901810655001201819IND60529213820221119080736.0170713e20160128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052921382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2015.11.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllingham, Matthew T.10aSynthesis, applications and mechanistic investigations of C2 symmetric guanidinium salts  ap. 496-503.  aA range of guanidinium catalysts was prepared in six or seven synthetic steps and applied to the phase transfer alkylation of a glycinate Schiff's base in 21–86% ee as well as the phase transfer epoxidation of some chalcones in 85–94% ee.

A counterion effect was apparent in these reactions, but no enantioselectivity was observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkylation 3acatalysts 3achalcones 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aenantiomers 3aguanidinium 3asalts 3aspectrophotometers 0aGuanidine 0aGuanidinium ions 0aPhase transfer catalysis 0aPhase transfer alkylation 0aPhase transfer epoxidation 0aMichael addition1 aBennett, Elliot L.1 aDavies, Deniol H.1 aHarper, Philip M.1 aHoward-Jones, Andrew1 aMehdar, Yassin T.H.1 aMurphy, Patrick J.1 aThomas, Dafydd A.1 aCaulkett, Peter W.R.1 aPotter, David1 aLam, Casey M.1 aO'Donoghue, AnnMarie C.0 tTetrahedron.g2016 Jan. 28, v. 72 p.496-503dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2015.11.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03177naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001100152245011800163520165500281592002801936650002201964650000801986650001501994650003002009650001202039650002002051650002202071650001002093650001002103650001302113650002002126650001602146650002102162650001502183650001402198650001302212653001602225653002002241653001702261653001302278653003302291700001702324700001502341700001602356700001802372700001302390700005202403773009602455856008702551852000902638655001202647IND60742956420221123015001.0210926e20211215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074295642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.1153112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Mu10aPhosphorus deficiency in soils with red color: Insights from the interactions between minerals and microorganisms  aPhosphorus (P) deficiency limits agricultural productivity in many tropical and subtropical soils. The aim of this study was to investigate the influences of typical mineral components and microorganisms on P availability in soil. Three representative soil minerals, i.e., montmorillonite (Mt), calcium carbonate (Cal) and goethite (Gt) were incubated with phosphate-solubilizing fungus (PSF, Aspergillus niger) and apatite (the dominant P source on Earth) in soil. In the control treatment, the fungus promoted phosphate dissolution and P release (from < 1 to 370.40 mg kg⁻¹), primarily via secreting oxalic acid. Mt addition promoted fungal respiration and up-regulated oxaloacetate acetylhydrolase (regulating organic acid secretion, based on RNA sequencing analysis). However, strong adsorption of organic acids by Mt finally caused decline of P availability (from ~ 400 to 24 mg kg⁻¹). Cal addition decreased fungal counts (down to < 5% of the value for the control treatment). Additionally, the consumption of organic acids (by Cal dissolution) further reduced P release. Gt stimulated fungal respiration, whereas its toxicity significantly decreased fungal abundance. Moreover, Gt demonstrated the maximal P adsorption capacity, i.e., 1.266 mg g⁻¹. Therefore, Gt demonstrated evident negativity on P release. Despite the strong sorption of organic acids, Mt showed high potential to promote P release in the long-term due to the enhanced fungal bioactivity. Our results hence indicated that different minerals had totally distinct effects on P release, which should be addressed when investigating biogeochemistry in soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aRNA 3aadsorption 3aagricultural productivity 3aapatite 3abiogeochemistry 3acalcium carbonate 3acolor 3afungi 3agoethite 3amontmorillonite 3aoxalic acid 3aoxaloacetic acid 3aphosphorus 3asecretion 3atoxicity 0aPhosphorous 0aArtificial soil 0aClay mineral 0aFe oxide 0aPhosphate-solubilizing fungi1 aMeng, Lingzi1 aZhao, Lang1 aTang, Yukai1 aQiu, Jingjing1 aTian, Da1 aLi, Zhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2335-37440 tGeoderma.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 404 p.115311-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.1153113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245008600157300001600243500002000259520132800279592002801607650001301635650001301648650001501661650001701676650001101693650001501704650002501719650001601744700002401760700002401784773013001808856007201938852000902010655001202019IND60587537520221122080941.0180319e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058753752DNAL7 a10.1890/03-51682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJonzén, Niclas10aTrend detection in source–sink systems: when should sink habitats be monitored?  ap. 326-334.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe determine the power of population monitoring in source or sink habitat to detect declining reproductive success in source habitat using a stochastic population model. The relative power to detect a trend in the source by monitoring either the source or the sink varies with life history parameters, environmental stochasticity, and observation uncertainty. The power to detect a decline monitoring either source or sink habitat is maximized when the reproductive surplus in the source is low. The power to detect a decline by monitoring the sink increases with increasing reproductive deficit in the sink. If environmental stochasticity in the source increases, the power in the sink goes down due to a lower signal‐to‐noise ratio. However, the power in the sink increases if environmental stochasticity is increased further, because increasing stochasticity reduces the geometric mean growth rate in the source. Intriguingly, it is often most efficient to monitor the sink even though the actual reproductive decline occurs in the source. If reproductive success is declining in both habitats, censusing the sink will always have higher power. However, the probability of Type 1 error is always higher in the sink. Our results clearly have implications for optimal population monitoring in source–sink landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageometry 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3alife history 3amodels 3amonitoring 3areproductive success 3auncertainty1 aRhodes, Jonathan R.1 aPossingham, Hugh P.0 tEcological applications.g2005 Feb., v. 15, no. 1 p.326-334dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/03-51683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245012700153300001800280500001900298520101300317592002801330650001201358650001201370650002201382650002001404650001801424650002601442650001601468650001001484650001601494650001401510650001901524650001701543650002001560650001801580700001501598700001501613700001801628700001901646700001801665700001501683700001801698700001801716773012501734856007401859852000901933655001201942IND60738990120221119162632.0210526e20210524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073899012DNAL7 a10.1039/d1gc00762a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Bo10aConjugated microporous polymers as a visible light driven platform for photo-redox conversion of biomass derived chemicals  ap. 3607-3611.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPhotocatalytic conversion of biomass derived chemicals to valuable products is a highly sustainable process. Herein we report the photocatalytic hydrogenation of maleic acid to succinic acid and oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5-diformylfuran using the same conjugated porous polymers (CMPs). The CMPs were constructed from 2,4,6-(tri-2-thienyl)-1,3,5-triazine as the knots and different benzene derivatives as linkers, and their morphologies, redox potentials, charge separation efficiency, and the consequent photocatalytic performance have been controlled. As a result, the CMP with benzene as the linker features the highest photocatalytic activities with production rates of 4.66 mmol g⁻¹ h⁻¹ for succinic acid and 0.53 mmol g⁻¹ h⁻¹ for 2,5-diformylfuran, respectively. Most importantly, high photocatalytic activity has also been achieved under natural sunlight irradiation, implying its feasibility as an efficient photocatalytic platform for solar-to-chemical energy conversion.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzene 3abiomass 3aenergy conversion 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrogenation 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3airradiation 3alight 3amaleic acid 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3aporous media 3asolar radiation 3asuccinic acid1 aChen, Lang1 aYan, Zijun1 aKang, Jinyang1 aChen, Shanyong1 aJin, Yongdong1 aMa, Lijian1 aYan, Hongjian1 aXia, Chuanqin0 tGreen chemistry.g2021 May 24, v. 23, no. 10 p.3607-3611dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1gc00762a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001100139245013700150300001800287500002000305520130900325592002801634596006901662596003301731596005301764650002801817650002501845650002201870650001801892650002301910650002801933650001501961650002301976650002501999650001202024650001702036650001502053650002102068650002802089650001902117650001902136650000702155650001202162650003602174650001402210650002502224700001702249700005402266773013302320856007302453852000902526655001202535IND60688526720221118033754.0200415e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068852672DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.145512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe B.,10aSynbiotic fermented soymilk with Weissella cibaria FB069 and xylooligosaccharides prevents proliferation in human colon cancer cells  ap. 1486-1496.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Studies on the anticancer effects of synbiotic fermented soymilk are rare. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of synbiotic fermented soymilk supplemented with xylooligosaccharides and inoculated with Weissella cibaria FB069 (FSMXW) in the proliferation of colon cancer cell and compare it with the effect of soymilk inoculated with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG). METHODS AND RESULTS: Both FB069 and LGG were able to grow in soy‐based products and rapidly reduce their pH as a result of fermentation. The addition of XOS significantly enhanced the acidification rate, viscosity and total cell concentration in fermented soymilk inoculated with W. cibaria FB069. However, the same effect was not observed following inoculation with LGG. Moreover, the synbiotic FSMXW showed higher dextran, folate, GABA and aglycone content. FSMXW inhibited the proliferation of Caco‐2 and HCT116 cell lines, by reducing the transcription of MD2, TLR4, MyD88, and NF‐κb. CONCLUSIONS: The synbiotic soymilk containing XOS and W. cibaria FB069 increase nutrient and functional compounds through fermentation process. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our finding suggests that W. cibaria and XOS can be potentially employed in developing functional foods and health‐related products.  aPublisher supplied data  aNRF‐2017R1D1A3B03027816cNational Research Foundation of Korea  cNational Research Foundation  aNRF‐2017R1D1A3B03027816cMinistry of Education 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aWeissella cibaria 3aacidification 3aactive ingredients 3aantineoplastic activity 3acell lines 3acell proliferation 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adextran 3afermentation 3afolic acid 3afunctional foods 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3ahuman diseases 3aneoplasm cells 3apH 3asoymilk 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3aviscosity 3axylooligosaccharides1 aNgoc, A.P.T.1 aYang, S.H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0603-22090 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2020 May, v. 128, no. 5 p.1486-1496dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.145513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245011100163520156100274592002801835650000801863650001501871650002801886650002601914650002801940650001401968650001101982650001301993650003002006650004202036650001102078650002802089650001802117650001302135650001102148650003502159651001302194651001802207651001102225700002002236700002002256700002202276700002602298773011902324856007702443852000902520655001202529IND60703010020221121192701.0200719e20200227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070301002DNAL7 a10.3390/genes110302522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatino, Luz  H.10aIntraspecific Genomic Divergence and Minor Structural Variations in <i>Leishmania (Viannia) panamensis</i>  a<i>Leishmania (Viannia) panamensis</i> is one of the most important <i>Leishmania</i> species associated with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Latin America. Despite its wide geographic distribution and pathogenic potential in humans and animals, the genomic variability of this species is low compared with other <i>Leishmania</i> species circulating in the same geographical area. No studies have reported a detailed analysis of the whole genome of <i>L. panamensis</i> from clinical isolates using DNA high-throughput sequencing to clarify its intraspecific genomic variability or plausible divergence. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the intraspecific genomic variability of <i>L. panamensis</i> from Colombia and Panama. A total of 22 genomes were analyzed, 19 from Colombian patients with CL and three genomes from Panama obtained from public databases. The phylogenomic analysis revealed the potential existence of three well-supported clades as evidence of intraspecific divergence. Additionally, the whole-genome analysis showed low structural variations in terms of ploidy, copy number variations, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). SNPs shared among all clades were identified, revealing their importance in different biological processes of <i>L. panamensis</i>. The findings not only expand our knowledge of intraspecific genomic variability of one of the most important <i>Leishmania</i> species in South America but also highlights the possible existence of different clades/lineages/subpopulations across a geographic scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aLeishmania 3aLolliguncula panamensis 3acopy number variation 3acutaneous leishmaniasis 3adatabases 3agenome 3agenomics 3ageographical distribution 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahumans 3aintraspecific variation 3apathogenicity 3apatients 3aploidy 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aColombia 3aLatin America 3aPanama1 aMuñoz, Marina 1 aMuskus, Carlos 1 aMéndez, Claudia,1 aRamírez, Juan  David0 tGenes.g2020 Feb. 27, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes110302523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03659naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003200135040001800167100002400185245015100209300001200360506007600372520202600448592002802474506003702502650001302539650002002552650001002572650001802582650001702600650001902617650002002636650001602656650001302672650001602685650001502701650001002716650001202726650001202738650002302750650001002773650000802783650002102791650001302812650001802825650001502843650001002858700002202868700002802890700002502918773009602943856004503039852000903084655001203093IND50061442120221207090600.0130324e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006144212DNAL7 a229717862pmid7 aPMC35179002pmcid7 a10.1186/1743-7075-9-822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrepanowski, John F12aA 21-day Daniel fast with or without krill oil supplementation improves anthropometric parameters and the cardiometabolic profile in men and women  ap. 478.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The Daniel Fast is a vegan diet that prohibits the consumption of animal products, refined foods, white flour, preservatives, additives, sweeteners, flavorings, caffeine, and alcohol. Following this dietary plan for 21 days has been demonstrated to improve blood pressure, LDL-C, and certain markers of oxidative stress, but it has also been shown to lower HDL-C. Krill oil supplementation has been shown to increase HDL-C. METHODS: We investigated the effects of following a Daniel Fast dietary plan with either krill oil supplementation (2 g/day) or placebo supplementation (coconut oil; 2 g/day) for 21 days. The subjects in this study (12 men and 27 women) were heterogeneous with respect to body mass index (BMI) (normal weight, overweight, and obese), blood lipids (normolipidemic and hyperlipidemic), blood glucose (normal fasting glucose, impaired fasting glucose, and type 2 diabetic), and blood pressure (normotensive and hypertensive). RESULTS: Krill oil supplementation had no effect on any outcome measure (all p > 0.05), and so the data from the krill oil group and the placebo group were collapsed and analyzed to examine the effects of following a 21-day Daniel Fast. Significant reductions were observed in LDL-C (100.6 ± 4.3 mg/dL vs. 80.0 ± 3.7 mg/dL), the LDL:HDL ratio (2.0 ± 0.1 vs. 1.7 ± 0.1), fasting blood glucose (101.4 ± 7.5 mg/dL vs. 91.7 ± 3.4 mg/dL), fasting blood insulin (7.92 ± 0.80 μU/mL vs. 5.76 ± 0.59 μU/mL), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (2.06 ± 0.30 vs. 1.40 ± 0.21), systolic BP (110.7 ± 2.2 mm Hg vs. 105.5 ± 1.7 mm Hg), and body weight (74.1 ± 2.4 kg vs. 71.5 ± 2.3 kg) (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Following a Daniel Fast dietary plan improves a variety of cardiometabolic parameters in a wide range of individuals in as little as 21 days, and these improvements are unaffected by krill oil supplementation.

The soil nematode metabolic carbon footprint, based on nematode biomass and respiration, can be used to indicate ecosystem function and the response of nematodes to nutrient enrichment in the ecosystem. However, it is unclear whether or how climate warming and litter removal affect the metabolic carbon footprint of soil nematodes and soil food webs. In this study, we investigated four warming and litter removal treatments in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China, to determine the effects of climate warming and litter removal on soil microbial food webs. The treatments included: (1) control (CK), (2) warming, (3) litter removal, (4) warming + litter removal. We found that warming and litter removal had significant negative effects on the diversity and richness of soil nematodes. In addition, our results showed warming indirectly and directly affected vegetation diversity, thereby altering soil nematode diversity. Vegetation played an important role in the maintenance of soil nematode community diversity. The enrichment and structural footprints reflected nematodes that could respond most rapidly to resource enrichment and those with higher trophic levels in soil food webs, respectively. Overall, warming and litter removal significantly negatively affect the enrichment metabolic footprint, indicating they could significantly reduce the external resource inputs into the food web. Both warming and litter removal reduced the structural metabolic footprint of the soil food web, although the changes were not significant, indicating that the metabolic activity of nematodes of high nutrient levels decreased and the ability to regulate the food web from top-bottom effects was weakened under warming and litter removal. The nematode functional metabolic footprints indicated that litter removal could aggravate the effect of warming on the soil food web and result in more severe degradation. The combination of warming and litter removal significantly inhibited the connectance of the bacterial channel, but had no significant effect on the fungal channel. These results suggest that the soil food web enhanced resistance to the environment by increasing the proportion of the fungal channel. It is critical to understand the responses of soil food webs to climate warming and litter removal to better predict how ecosystem functions will change in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNematoda 3abiochemical pathways 3abiomass 3acarbon footprint 3aclimate 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3afungi 3asoil 3asoil food webs 3asoil nematodes 3avegetation 3aChina 0aSoil nematode 0aNematode metabolic footprint 0aSoil food web 0aQinghai-Tibet Plateau 0aWarming and litter removal1 aZhou, HuaKun1 aChen, WenJing1 aZhang, Yue1 aWang, Jie1 aLiu, Hongfei,1 aZhao, ZiWen1 aLi, YuanZe1 aYou, QiMing1 aYang, Bing1 aLiu, Guobin,1 aXue, Sha0 tGeoderma.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 401 p.115318-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.1153183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02401naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245007200155300001800227520121600245592002801461650002101489650002301510650001601533650002301549650001501572650001401587650000901601650001401610650001301624650000901637650001701646650001301663650001301676700001401689700002001703700001601723700001501739773014201754856007401896852000901970655001201979IND60621963120221119075742.0181123e20181121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062196312DNAL7 a10.1039/c8tb01698d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yanxi10aEnhanced cellular uptake by non-endocytic pathway for tumor therapy  ap. 7411-7419.  aEndosome/lysosome, as the potential risk of therapeutic inactivation resulting from physical obstruction and a number of acid hydrolases, is a bottleneck in effective intracellular delivery which needs to be overcome. One promising strategy to avoid this barrier is to deliver therapeutic agents directly into the cytoplasm. In this study, CLIP6 peptide (KVRVRVRVᴰPPTRVRERVK-NH₂) which can facilitate non-endosomal cell entry and anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) were covalently grafted to N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) backbone (P-DOX-CLIP6). As a result, CLIP6 peptide modification increased the cellular uptake of DOX-loaded HPMA copolymers. Importantly, it effectively reduced lysosomal accumulation, leading to stronger proliferation inhibition and superior growth inhibition effect on three-dimensional tumor spheroids, compared to unmodified HPMA copolymer conjugates. Furthermore, P-CLIP6-DOX induced the highest therapeutic efficacy in HeLa tumor-bearing nude mice. Meanwhile, no significant systemic toxicity was observed during the treatment. In conclusion, this study provided a promising strategy to efficiently deliver drug candidates which were limited by endo/lysosomal trapping.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3acomposite polymers 3adoxorubicin 3agrowth retardation 3ahydrolases 3alysosomes 3amice 3aneoplasms 3apeptides 3arisk 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 3atrapping1 aLi, Qiuyi1 aXiong, Xiaofeng1 aHuang, Yuan1 aZhou, Zhou0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2018 Nov. 21, v. 6, no. 45 p.7411-7419dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8tb01698d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02143naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245002900165520125900194592002801453650000801481650001801489650002001507650002801527650002201555650001101577650002901588700001901617773011901636856007701755852000901832655001201841IND60703010320221121192612.0200719e20200227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070301032DNAL7 a10.3390/genes110302552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrosh, Robert  M.10aHistory of DNA Helicases  aSince the discovery of the DNA double helix, there has been a fascination in understanding the molecular mechanisms and cellular processes that account for: (i) the transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next and (ii) the remarkable stability of the genome. Nucleic acid biologists have endeavored to unravel the mysteries of DNA not only to understand the processes of DNA replication, repair, recombination, and transcription but to also characterize the underlying basis of genetic diseases characterized by chromosomal instability. Perhaps unexpectedly at first, DNA helicases have arisen as a key class of enzymes to study in this latter capacity. From the first discovery of ATP-dependent DNA unwinding enzymes in the mid 1970’s to the burgeoning of helicase-dependent pathways found to be prevalent in all kingdoms of life, the story of scientific discovery in helicase research is rich and informative. Over four decades after their discovery, we take this opportunity to provide a history of DNA helicases. No doubt, many chapters are left to be written. Nonetheless, at this juncture we are privileged to share our perspective on the DNA helicase field – where it has been, its current state, and where it is headed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA helicases 3aDNA replication 3achromosomal instability 3agenetic disorders 3agenome 3atranscription (genetics)1 aMatson, Steve,0 tGenes.g2020 Feb. 27, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes110302553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011900157300001800276500002000294520144400314592002801758596006001786596004801846650002301894650002701917650001501944650001001959650001201969650001301981650002001994650001102014650001602025650002202041700001402063700002802077700001502105700001702120700005402137773013302191856007302324852000902397655001202406IND60688526920221118033727.0200415e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068852692DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.145732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamilleri, E.10aMechanisms of killing of Bacillus thuringiensis Al Hakam spores in a blast environment with and without iodic acid  ap. 1378-1389.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: To determine the mechanism of killing of spores of Bacillus thuringiensis Al Hakam, a Bacillus anthracis spore surrogate, in a blast environment with or without HIO₃ and whether the spores are truly dead. METHODS AND RESULTS: Spores exposed to an aluminium‐based blast environment with or without HIO₃ with dynamic peak gas phase temperatures near 1000°C persisting for 10’s of ms, were killed 97 and 99·99% without and with HIO₃ respectively and the spores were truly dead. The survivors of the detonations did not acquire mutations, did not become wet heat sensitive, became sensitive to elevated NaCl but not lack of glucose in recovery media, and many dead spores remained phase bright and retained their Ca‐dipicolinic acid. A large fraction of the dead spores could germinate, but most of these germinated spores were dead. CONCLUSIONS: Most spores exposed to a blast environment are truly dead, and HIO₃ increases spore death. The likely mechanism of spore killing in these blast environments is damage to some essential spore protein, although spore inner membrane damage could contribute. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This work shows that spores of a surrogate for B. anthracis spores are killed in a blast environment without or with HIO₃ present, this approach could inactivate up to 99·99% of dry B. anthracis spores, and the spores are likely killed by damage to some essential spore protein.  aPublisher supplied data  aHDTRA1‐18‐1‐0008cDefense Threat Reduction Agency  cConsejo De Ciencia, Y Tecnología in Mexico 3aBacillus anthracis 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3acell death 3agases 3aglucose 3amutation 3asodium chloride 3aspores 3atemperature 3athermosensitivity1 aKorza, G.1 aHuesca‐Espita, L.d.C.1 aSetlow, B.1 aStamatis, D.1 aSetlow, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3119-26690 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2020 May, v. 128, no. 5 p.1378-1389dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.145733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02316naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007500166300001600241520131400257592002801571650001501599650002501614650000801639650001101647700002601658700006101684700005701745773012001802856008301922852000902005655001202014IND60767318720221120164058.0220214e20211220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076731872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.1c012472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamat, Kartik10aDiffusion Attachment Model for Long Helical Antifreeze Proteins to Ice  ap. 513-519.  aSome of the most potent antifreeze proteins (AFPs) are approximately rigid helical structures that bind with one side in contact with the ice surface at specific orientations. These AFPs take random orientations in solution; however, most orientations become sterically inaccessible as the AFP approaches the ice surface. The effect of these inaccessible orientations on the rate of adsorption of AFP to ice has never been explored. Here, we present a diffusion-controlled theory of adsorption kinetics that accounts for these orientational restrictions to predict a rate constant for adsorption (kₒₙ, in m/s) as a function of the length and width of the AFP molecules. We find that kₒₙ decreases with length and diameter of the AFP and is almost proportional to the inverse of the area of the binding surface. We demonstrate that the restricted orientations create an entropic barrier to AFP adsorption, which we compute to be approximately 7 kBT for most AFPs and up to 9 kBT for Maxi, the largest known AFP. We compare the entropic resistance 1/kₒₙ to resistances for diffusion through boundary layers and across typical distances in the extracellular matrix and find that these entropic and diffusion resistances could become comparable in the small confined spaces of biological environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aextracellular matrix 3aice 3amodels1 aNaullage, Pavithra M.1 aMolinero, Valeria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8577-46751 aPeters, Baron1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1935-60850 tBiomacromolecules.g2021 Dec. 20, v. 23, no. 2 p.513-519dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.1c012473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02046naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007800168300001400246520087800260592002801138650001401166650002201180650002101202650001801223650001801241650001101259650002201270650002001292651001401312651001101326653002701337653001701364653002801381653002601409700001901435773010001454856008501554852000901639655001201648IND60537797120221119112641.0190412e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053779712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecocom.2015.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolobov, A.N.10aIndividual-based model of spatio-temporal dynamics of mixed forest stands  ap. 29-39.  aThis research presents the results of constructing and parameterizing an individual-based model of spatiotemporal dynamics of mixed forest stands.

Realizing a regular array with precisely positioned ice-binding motifs on synthetic proteins, (macro)molecular ice-binders are thus challenging. Here, we exploit the predictable assembly of cyclic peptides into nanotubes as a starting point to prepare large, rigid ice-binders bearing an ice-binding site that is found in hyperactive ice-binding proteins in insects. First, we designed, synthesized, and purified cyclic octapeptide Lys2CP8 bearing a TaT motif to promote ice binding and investigated their solution assembly and activity using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, light scattering (LS), cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), and ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) assays. The cyclic peptide Lys2CP8 was synthesized in good yield using Fmoc chemistry and purified by reversed-phase HPLC. Upon dissolution in aqueous solutions, Lys2CP8 was observed to assemble in a pH- and concentration-dependent manner into objects with nanoscopic dimensions. LS revealed the presence of small and large aggregates at pH 3 and 11, held together through a network of intermolecular antiparallel β-sheets as determined by FTIR and CD spectroscopy. Cryo-TEM revealed the presence of one-dimensional objects at pH 3 and 11. These are mostly well-dispersed at pH 3 but appear to bundle at pH 11. Interestingly, the pH-dependent self-assembly behavior translates into a marked pH dependence of IRI activity. Lys2CP8 is IRI-active at pH 3 while inactive at pH 11 hypothetically because the ice-binding sites are inaccessible at pH 11 due to bundling.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acrystallization 3acyclic peptides 3aice 3ananotubes 3apH 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aHogervorst, Tim P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4686-62511 aSchoenmakers, Sandra M.

All presently known lissorchiid and deropristid life cycles have gastropods as first intermediate hosts, whereas those of monorchiids involve bivalves. Here, we report an unexpected intermediate host for monorchiids; two species of Hurleytrematoides Yamaguti, 1954 use gastropods as first intermediate hosts. Sporocysts and cercariae were found infecting two species of the family Vermetidae, highly specialised sessile gastropods that form calcareous tubes, from two locations off the coast of Queensland, Australia. These intramolluscan infections broadly corresponded morphologically to those of known monorchiids in that the cercariae have a spinous tegument, oral and ventral suckers, a simple tail and distinct eye-spots. Given the simplified morphology of intramolluscan infections, genetic data provided a definitive identification. ITS2 rDNA and cox1 mtDNA sequence data from the gastropod infections were identical to two species of Hurleytrematoides, parasites of butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae); Hurleytrematoides loi McNamara & Cribb, 2011 from Moreton Bay (south-eastern Queensland) and Heron Island (southern Great Barrier Reef) and Hurleytrematoides morandi McNamara & Cribb, 2011 from Heron Island. Notably, species of Hurleytrematoides are positioned relatively basal in the phylogeny of the Monorchiidae and are a sister lineage to that of species known to infect bivalves. Thus, the most parsimonious evolutionary hypothesis to explain infection of gastropods by these monorchiids is that basal monorchiids (in our analyses, species of Cableia Sogandares-Bernal, 1959, Helicometroides Yamaguti, 1934 and Hurleytrematoides) will all prove to infect gastropods, suggesting a single host switching event into bivalves for more derived monorchiids (17 other genera in our phylogenetic analyses). A less parsimonious hypothesis is that the infection of vermetids will prove to be restricted to species of Hurleytrematoides, as an isolated secondary recolonisation of gastropods from a bivalve-infecting lineage. Regardless of how their use arose, vermetids represent a dramatic host jump relative to the rest of the Monorchiidae, one potentially enabled by their specialised feeding biology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChaetodontidae 3aGastropoda 3aTrematoda 3acercariae 3acoasts 3aintermediate hosts 3aislands 3aparasitology 3aphylogeny 3atail 3aGreat Barrier Reef 3aQueensland 0aAustralia 0aLife cycle 0aVermetidae 0aHurleytrematoides 0aHost switch1 aCribb, Thomas H.1 aCorner, Richard D.1 aWard, Selina1 aCutmore, Scott C.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2021 Nov., v. 51, no. 12 p.1035-1046dElsevier LtdaAustralian Society for ParasitologywJournal:jnl1441x0020-75197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2021.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03931naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012500165300001800290520166000308592002801968596014301996596007802139596007802217596005302295596009602348596008802444596008802532596009402620650002102714650001802735650002002753650002502773650001602798650002402814650002402838650002302862650002102885650001902906650002202925650002002947650001502967650002602982650001003008650001103018651001003029700005303039700001503092700001503107700001803122773013403140856008203274852000903356655001203365IND60747509520221121055349.0210813e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074750952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-021-02547-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYue, Maofeng10aWinter low temperature disturbance in the southern subtropics of China promotes the competitiveness of an invasive plant  ap. 2913-2925.  aWinter low temperature disturbance in the southern subtropics has important effects on the weed community structure, but the role of uniquely low temperatures in biological invasions is unclear. Here, we examined the competitive effects of an invasive plant, Bidens pilosa L., and its native congener, Bidens biternata (Lour.) Merr. et Sherff, during high and low temperature seasons to determine whether low temperatures promote the competitiveness of B. pilosa in the southern subtropics of China. The growth and physiological responses of the two Bidens species to low (10/5 °C) and optimum (30/25 °C) temperatures were examined to determine how the invasive B. pilosa responds to low temperature stress. Our results showed that the competitive balance index values of B. pilosa in low temperature seasons were significantly higher than those in high temperature seasons, which implied that low temperatures may be more beneficial to the competitiveness of B. pilosa than high temperatures in the southern subtropics. The smaller decline in the relative growth rate and the photosynthetic ability of B. pilosa compared with B. biternata under low temperature stress indicated that the former was less negatively affected by low temperature than the latter. A higher DPPH· (1.1-diphenyl-2-picrylhy-drazyl) scavenging rate and greater heat-stable protein content in B. pilosa under low temperatures might help the invasive plant to maintain more effective physiological functions and thus a higher growth rate. Overall, the uniquely low temperature in the southern subtropics of China is expected to promote the invasiveness of the exotic B. pilosa.  aPublisher supplied data  aGML2019ZD0408cKey Special Program for Introduced Talents Team of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou)  a2019KJCX015cGuangdong Forestry Science and Technology Innovation Program  a2017KJCX036cGuangdong Forestry Science and Technology Innovation Program  aKJ030cScience and Technology Program of Maoming  a2019KZDZX2009cSpecial Projects in Key Areas of Ordinary Universities of Guangdong Province  a2017A020217001cScience and Technology Planning Program of Guangdong Province China  a2016A020210052cScience and Technology Planning Program of Guangdong Province China  a2018RC58cTalent Introduction Project of Guangdong University of Petrochemical Technology 3aBidens biternata 3aBidens pilosa 3aair temperature 3aantioxidant activity 3acold stress 3acommunity structure 3aecological invasion 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant competition 3aprotein content 3asubtropics 3athermostable proteins 3aweeds 3awinter 3aChina1 aShen, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1321-93031 aYe, Wanhui1 aLi, Weihua1 aChen, Jinfeng0 tBiological invasions.g2021 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.2913-2925dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl66237x1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-021-02547-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03610naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002100188245009900209300001600308520133500324592002801659650001501687650001101702650003101713650002401744650001601768650002501784650001301809650002001822650001201842650001301854650001201867650002401879650002201903650001501925650001001940650002501950650001201975650004801987650002702035650004702062650002802109650001102137650002502148650007302173650002502246650004502271650002502316650003202341650002302373650002602396650002402422650003002446650003302476650003602509650002202545700001902567700002002586700002202606700002502628700001902653773009102672856008102763990002302844852000902867655001202876IND60093841620221118031553.0141104e20110524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009384162DNAL7 a215495992pmid7 aPMC37410642pmcid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2011.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeugnet, Laurent10aNotch Signaling Modulates Sleep Homeostasis and Learning after Sleep Deprivation in Drosophila  ap. 835-840.  aThe role of the transmembrane receptor Notch in the adult brain is poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that bunched, a negative regulator of Notch, is involved in sleep homeostasis. Genetic evidence indicates that interfering with bunched activity in the mushroom bodies (MBs) abolishes sleep homeostasis. Combining bunched and Delta loss-of-function mutations rescues normal homeostasis, suggesting that Notch signaling may be involved in regulating sensitivity to sleep loss. Preventing the downregulation of Delta by overexpressing a wild-type transgene in MBs reduces sleep homeostasis and, importantly, prevents learning impairments induced by sleep deprivation. Similar resistance to sleep loss is observed with Notchˢᵖˡ⁻¹ gain-of-function mutants. Immunohistochemistry reveals that the Notch receptor is expressed in glia, whereas Delta is localized in neurons. Importantly, the expression in glia of the intracellular domain of Notch, a dominant activated form of the receptor, is sufficient to prevent learning deficits after sleep deprivation. Together, these results identify a novel neuron-glia signaling pathway dependent on Notch and regulated by bunched. These data highlight the emerging role of neuron-glia interactions in regulating both sleep and learning impairments associated with sleep loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aadults 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3ahomeostasis 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alearning 3amushroom bodies 3amutants 3amutation 3aneurons 3asignal transduction 3asleep deprivation 3atransgenes 2aAdult 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDrosophilaxphysiology 2aDrosophila Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHomeostasisxphysiology 2aHumans 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aIntracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aLearningxphysiology 2aMembrane Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aMushroom Bodiesxmetabolism 2aMutationxgenetics 2aNeurogliaxmetabolism 2aNeuronsxmetabolism 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aReceptors, Notchxmetabolism 2aSignal Transductionxphysiology 2aSleepxphysiology1 aSuzuki, Yasuko1 aMerlin, Gabriel1 aGottschalk, Laura1 aDuntley, Stephen P.1 aShaw, Paul J.0 tCurrent biology.g2011 May 24, v. 21, no. 10 p.835-840dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2011.04.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245019000174300001600364520154000380592002801920650002201948650002901970650001101999650001102010650001802021650001302039650001802052650001502070650003002085650003702115650002402152650001402176650003002190650001502220651001202235653000902247653000902256653002602265653001702291700002002308700002302328700002202351700002102373700002102394700002002415700002002435700002702455773010302482856008702585852000902672655001202681IND60545727520221118074636.0160902e20150901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054572752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.04.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiuliani, Silvia10aRecognizing different impacts of human and natural sources on the spatial distribution and temporal trends of PAHs and PCBs (including PCB-11) in sediments of the Nador Lagoon (Morocco)  ap. 346-357.  aThe Nador Lagoon holds a major interest in present-day Moroccan socioeconomic development. This environment is exposed to a number of potential polluting sources, such as mine tailings, urban and industrial dumping, and untreated wastewater inputs from surrounding cities. The aim of this study was to assess concentrations and trends of persistent contaminants such as PCBs and PAHs and to identify their origin. The non-Aroclor PCB-11 was determined for the first time in the lagoon sediments. Chronology and source assessment helped identifying the timing and nature of inputs and post-depositional processes controlling the two classes of contaminants: PAHs present a typical mixed petrogenic signature, with the exception of sediments deposited in the period 1930–1960 near the city of Nador, when pyrogenic inputs prevailed; PCBs show signs of microbial anaerobic degradation from 1950 to 1990, probably linked to changing hydrodynamic conditions in the South-Western part of the lagoon where agricultural inputs are dominant. The presence of PCB-11 is linked to specific productions and might be affected by degradation processes. Presently, different land uses (e.g., urban and agricultural areas) appear to be the key factors in controlling the level and composition of PAHs and PCBs in lagoon sediments. Total PAH and PCB levels are low (from 21.6 to 108ngg−1 and from 2.50 to 20.7ngg−1, respectively) but recent increasing values and the potential threat to humans and biota require continuous and constant monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aanthropogenic activities 3acities 3ahumans 3ahydrodynamics 3aland use 3amine tailings 3amonitoring 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asediment deposition 3asediments 3asocioeconomic development 3awastewater 3aMorocco 0aPCBs 0aPAHs 0aContamination sources 0aNador Lagoon1 aPiazza, Rossano1 aEl Moumni, Bouchta1 aPolo, Fabio Paolo1 aVecchiato, Marco1 aRomano, Stefania1 aZambon, Stefano1 aFrignani, Mauro1 aBellucci, Luca Giorgio0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Sept. 01, v. 526 p.346-357dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.04.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02415naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245009500195300001600290500001900306500001100325520102200336592002801358596003701386650001801423650001101441650001801452650001801470650001101488650002601499650001501525650001801540700007601558700005901634700002501693700003101718700005801749773011601807856007301923852000901996655001202005IND60688527220221118033820.0200415e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068852722DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.134932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuiz, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5281-199710aU‐shaped response Unifies views on temperature dependency of stoichiometric requirements  ap. 860-869.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLETTER  aTemperature and nutrient availability, which are major drivers of consumer performance, are dramatically affected by global change. To date, there is no consensus on whether warming increases or decreases consumer needs for dietary carbon (C) relatively to phosphorus (P), thus hindering predictions of secondary production responses to global change. Here, we investigate how the dietary C:P ratio optimising consumer growth (TERC:P: Threshold Elemental Ratio) changes along temperature gradients by combining a temperature‐dependent TERC:P model with growth experiments on Daphnia magna. Both lines of evidence show that the TERC:P response to temperature is U‐shaped. This shape indicates that consumer nutrient requirements can both increase or decrease with increasing temperature, thus reconciling previous contradictive observations into a common framework. This unified framework improves our capacity to forecast the combined effects of nutrient cycle and climatic alterations on invertebrate production.  aPublisher supplied data  cI‐site Clermont UCA CAP‐2025 3aDaphnia magna 3acarbon 3aglobal change 3ainvertebrates 3amodels 3anutrient availability 3aphosphorus 3astoichiometry1 aKoussoroplis, Apostolos‐Manuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5218-56041 aDanger, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9874-49421 aAguer, Jean‐Pierre1 aMorel‐Desrosiers, Nicole1 aBec, Alexandre1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4353-37660 tEcology letters.g2020 May, v. 23, no. 5 p.860-869dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774062x1461-023X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.134933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03367naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245013000173300001500303520186100318592002802179650002702207650002602234650002202260650001002282650002402292650001702316650001702333650001102350650001502361650002602376650001802402650002302420650002202443650001102465650002202476653002202498653002102520653002602541653001702567653001902584700002602603700002702629700002302656773010002679856008502779852000902864655001202873IND60537797420221119112849.0190412e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053779742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecocom.2016.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia, Adriano G.10aPredicting evolution of insect resistance to transgenic crops in within-field refuge configurations, based on larval movement  ap. 94-103.  aThe selection pressure imposed by the widespread use of transgenic technologies can lead to the evolution of insect resistance, and the availability of refuge areas that allow susceptible homozygous insects to survive is a key factor in delaying the evolution of resistance in agricultural landscapes. Different strategies to exploit refuge areas exist, but several insect-related ecological traits may directly affect the efficiency of refuges in slowing the development of resistance. Insect larval movement is one such trait that may affect the management of resistance, depending on the refuge strategy adopted. We developed a computational model to simulate how larval movement would affect the spatio-temporal dynamics of the evolution of resistance of insect pests to Bt crops, under different refuge configurations. In order to test the model, we used population data for Spodoptera frugiperda, one of the main target pests for control with Bt toxins. Simulations were run for spatial arrangements composed of three refuge configurations (seed mixture, blocks, and strips), with sizes ranging from 20% to 50% for two types of resistance (incomplete and complete) and three rates of larval movement (proportion of larvae moving per time step), equal to 0, 0.1 and 0.5. We demonstrated that with a seed mixture, in most cases the higher the rate of larval movement, the higher the proportion of resistant insects in the population in an area, regardless of the type of resistance tested. Strip configurations showed the opposite trend. In a block configuration, the number of resistant larvae was highest at an intermediate dispersal rate (0.1). We concluded that larval movement is an important variable affecting the evolution of resistance to Bt crops, but its effect depends on the type of resistance and the configuration and size of the refuge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aSpodoptera frugiperda 3aagricultural land 3acrops 3agenetic engineering 3ahomozygosity 3ainsect pests 3alarvae 3aprediction 3aresistance management 3aseed mixtures 3aselection pressure 3asimulation models 3atoxins 3atransgenic plants 0aCellular automata 0aTransgenic crops 0aResistance management 0aRefuge areas 0aInsect ecology1 aFerreira, Cláudia P.1 aCônsoli, Fernando L.,1 aGodoy, Wesley A.C.0 tEcological complexity.g2016 Dec., v. 28 p.94-103dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2171x1476-945X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecocom.2016.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03306naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245015600170520212800326592002802454650001102482650001702493650002402510650002202534650001102556651001002567653002002577653002402597653003302621653001502654653004702669700001802716700001402734773010102748856008602849852000902935655001202944IND60760109820221123034101.0220118e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076010982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1084552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hongjiang10aTowards low-carbon cities: Patch-based multi-objective optimization of land use allocation using an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II  aThe rational land use allocation is of great significance to the construction of low-carbon cities. The optimization model of land use allocation is an important tool that helps urban planners to quantitatively trade-off among the multi-objectives and achieve optimal land use schemes. For multi-objective optimization of low-carbon land use allocation, the models conducted by existing studies generally tend to be based on gridded data, lack of comprehensive consideration of quantitative and spatial objectives, and efficient algorithms to execute the optimization process. Therefore, this paper proposed a patch-based low carbon multi-objective land use allocation (LC-MLUA) optimization model involving both quantitative and spatial optimization targets. The LC-MLUA optimization model was solved with an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), and the weighted-sum method was used to make the final selection under different preferences. The LC-MLUA optimization model was then applied to a case study of Changxing, a county-level city in east China, and there were three key results. (1) The LC-MLUA optimization model had a remarkable outperform of the land use allocation than the original land use plan, and the optimized values of economic benefit, emission reduction, and accessibility increased by 27.0%, 6.2% and 8.3%, respectively. (2) The LC-MLUA optimization model generated a series of optimal schemes to support suggestion-making for the low-carbon adjustment of the land use structure and spatial layout. (3) The LC-MLUA optimization model based on vector land patch data was proved more efficient as the unit number was reduced by 5 times than gridded data and better reflected the land use planning practice. (4) Compared with other algorithms, the improved NSGA-II had better performance in the number of solutions, target optimization rate, and comprehensive performance. Based on these results, it suggests that the patch-based LC-MLUA optimization model method can provide good technical support for low-carbon land use planning, and can be flexibly applied to other cities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acase studies 3afinancial economics 3aland use planning 3amodels 3aChina 0aLow carbon city 0aLand use allocation 0aMulti-objective optimization 0aLand patch 0aNon-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II1 aYan, Fengying1 aTian, Hua0 tEcological indicators.g2022 Jan., v. 134 p.108455-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1084553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012900163300001600292520139700308592002801705650002201733650002101755650002001776650003801796650001001834650001701844650001701861650002001878650001001898650002701908650001901935650001501954650001901969650001801988650002902006700001802035700001602053700001102069700001802080773009102098856008102189852000902270655001202279IND60572662020221119114331.0170717e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057266202DNAL7 a10.1007/s10126-017-9736-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, Fanna10aConstruction of Plastid Expression Vector and Development of Genetic Transformation System for the Seaweed Pyropia yezoensis  ap. 147-156.  aPyropia yezoensis, belonging to the Rhodophyta, is an economically important seaweed. In this study, we developed a high-efficiency plastid transformation platform for P. yezoensis. In the plastid transformation vector, psbA UTR of P. yezoensis, including the promoter and 3′ UTR, was used to express foreign genes. The integration site was a transcriptionally active intergenic region between the rrsB and trnI genes, located in the inverted repeat regions of the plastid genome. The CAT and eGFP genes were integrated into the plastid genome at this site. The expression of CAT in the transformants confers resistance to chloramphenicol through the action of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, which inactivates the drug, thereby allowing the plant to grow well under selective pressure. The eGFP fluorescence signal was also observed in transformed cells and the transformants. The average survival rate of treated cells was estimated to be approximately 4.2‰ (4 transplastomic colonies per 1000 gametophyte cells). Multiple-PCR analyses confirmed that the CAT and eGFP genes were successfully integrated in the site between rrsB and trnI. Western blot also showed eGFP expression in the cells of transformants. Thus, this study presents the first convenient plastid gene expression system for P. yezoensis and provides an important platform for studying gene function in P. yezoensis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPyropia yezoensis 3aWestern blotting 3achloramphenicol 3achloramphenicol acetyltransferase 3adrugs 3afluorescence 3agametophytes 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetic transformation 3aintergenic DNA 3amacroalgae 3aplastid genome 3asurvival rate 3atranscription (genetics)1 aZhao, Hailong1 aLiu, Weixun1 aLi, Na1 aMao, Yunxiang0 tMarine biotechnology.g2017 Apr., v. 19, no. 2 p.147-156dSpringer USx1436-22287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10126-017-9736-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03564naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245005400157300001600211500002000227520246600247592002802713650002102741650002802762650002502790650002302815650002902838650001302867650002302880651001802903700002502921700002202946700002302968773013002991856007203121852000903193655001203202IND60587538320221122081007.0180319e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058753832DNAL7 a10.1890/03-50292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPayne, Laura X.10aQuantifying spatial pattern with evenness indices  ap. 507-520.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aQuantifying the spatial distributions of organisms in simple and meaningful ways is important for understanding the ecology and habitat needs of species subject to anthropogenic disturbances. Most multi‐species conservation and management programs do not yet account for the variation of space‐use patterns exhibited by species preferring the same habitat type. To measure species' space‐use patterns as a step toward determining habitat needs, we suggest using evenness indices. Although commonly used in characterizing communities (i.e., as a measure of species diversity), these indices are suitable for characterizing many other ecological patterns, including patterns of site use by individuals. We investigate the statistical properties of five indices (Camargo's index of evenness, E′; Simpson's index of evenness, E₁/D^; Lloyd's index of mean crowding, J; Smith‐Wilson index Eᵥₐᵣ; and Dispersion index, DL, a variant of the Shannon diversity index) to evaluate their utility for quantifying broad‐scale spatial patterns of migratory shorebirds. We use a Monte Carlo simulation approach to compare these indices for their (1) ability to characterize a wide range of spatial patterns (from even to patchy); (2) ability to discriminate among distributions; and (3) robustness to incomplete sampling. In addition, we compare the ability of these indices to characterize spatial dispersion for four species of shorebirds migrating through the United States: Killdeer (Charadrius vociferus), Semipalmated Plover (C. semipalmatus), Sanderling (Calidris alba), and Red Knot (C. canutus). Overall, we recommend Camargo, Simpson, and Lloyd indices for quantifying spatial dispersion. All three indices gave precise and unbiased estimates once 35 or more sites (3.5% of 1000 simulated sites) were sampled randomly, regardless of the degree of patchiness. Nonrandom sampling resulted in biased estimates until a much greater proportion of sites (at least 30–50%) were sampled, highlighting the importance of site selection in sampling programs. Our analysis of shorebird spatial patterns revealed that evenness indices discriminate well among the species we considered, ranking Killdeer as most dispersed and Red Knot as most aggregated. Our results agree with earlier (independent) assessments of these species' migration strategies and illustrate how simple univariate metrics may be useful tools for characterizing complex spatial patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalidris canutus 3aCharadrius semipalmatus 3aCharadrius vociferus 3aMonte Carlo method 3aanthropogenic activities 3ahabitats 3amigratory behavior 3aUnited States1 aSchindler, Daniel E.1 aParrish, Julia K.1 aTemple, Stanley A.0 tEcological applications.g2005 Apr., v. 15, no. 2 p.507-520dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/03-50293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245008300209300001800292520165500310592002801965650002201993650002402015650002602039650001902065650001202084650001002096650002102106650001402127650002102141650001002162650001402172651001202186700002102198700002602219700002702245700002302272700002302295773013402318856008202452961001202534852000902546655001202555IND60747510020221119071819.0210813e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074751002DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-021-02545-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrouch, Connor D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0353-582010aOystershell scale: an emerging invasive threat to aspen in the southwestern US  ap. 2893-2912.  aOystershell scale (OSS; Lepidosaphes ulmi) is an emerging invasive insect that poses a serious threat to conservation of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) in the southwestern US. Although OSS has been an urban pest in the US since the 1700s, it has recently spread into natural aspen stands in northern Arizona, where outbreaks are causing dieback and mortality. We quantified the ongoing outbreak of OSS at two scales: (1) local severity at two sites and (2) regional distribution across northern Arizona. Our regional survey indicated that OSS is widespread in lower elevation aspen stands and is particularly pervasive in ungulate exclosures. Advanced regeneration had the highest levels of infestation and mortality, which is concerning because this size class is an underrepresented component of aspen stands in northern Arizona. If OSS continues to spread and outbreaks result in dieback and mortality like we observed, then aspen in the southwestern US, and perhaps beyond, will be threatened. Three interacting factors contribute to OSS’s potential as a high-impact invasive insect that could spread rapidly: (1) its hypothesized role as a sleeper species, (2) potential interactions between OSS and climate change, and (3) the species’ polyphagous nature. Invasive pests like OSS pose an imminent threat to native tree species and, therefore, represent an immediate research and monitoring priority. We conclude with recommendations for future research and monitoring in order to understand OSS’s biology in natural aspen stands, quantify impacts, limit future spread, and mitigate mortality and loss of aspen and other host species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepidosaphes ulmi 3aPopulus tremuloides 3aadvanced regeneration 3aclimate change 3adieback 3ahosts 3ainvasive species 3amortality 3aregional surveys 3atrees 3aungulates 3aArizona1 aGrady, Amanda M.1 aWilhelmi, Nicholas P.1 aHofstetter, Richard W.1 aDePinte, Daniel E.1 aWaring, Kristen M.0 tBiological invasions.g2021 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.2893-2912dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl66237x1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-021-02545-03Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245013600195300001600331500001900347500001100366520115200377592002801529596006401557596003401621596003201655650001901687650002301706650001801729650002601747650001701773650001401790650000901804650001601813700001901829700005901848700005501907700005501962700005702017700005402074700002102128773011602149856007302265852000902338655001202347IND60688527620221118033859.0200415e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068852762DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.134942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStudd, E.

We assess daily activity responses to long‐term variation in temperature, resources and mating opportunities to examine whether individuals choose to be active or inactive according to an optimisation of the relative energetic and reproductive gains each state offers. We show that this simplified behavioural decision approach predicts most activity variation (R² = 0.83) expressed by free‐ranging red squirrels over 4 years, as quantified through accelerometer recordings (489 deployments; 5066 squirrel‐days). Recognising activity as a determinant of energetic status, the predictability of activity variation aggregated at a daily scale, and the clear signal that behaviour is environmentally forced through optimisation of gain, provides an integrated approach to examine behavioural variation as an intermediary between environmental variation and energetic, life‐history and ecological outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada  cW.

Theory proposes that the placenta evolves in response to high performance‐demanding conditions by shifting maternal investment from pre‐ to post‐fertilisation, thereby reducing a female’s reproductive burden during pregnancy. We test this hypothesis by studying populations of the fish species Poeciliopsis retropinna in Costa Rica. We found substantial variation in the degree of placentation among natural populations associated with predation risk: females from high predation populations had significantly higher degrees of placentation compared to low predation females, while number, size and quality of offspring at birth remained unaffected. Moreover, a higher degree of placentation correlated with a lower reproductive burden and hence likely an improved swimming performance during pregnancy. Our study advances an adaptive explanation for why the placenta evolves by arguing that an increased degree of placentation offers a selective advantage in high predation environments.  aPublisher supplied data  aEco/1710cKoninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen  cSICB graduate research grant  a1523666cNSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Biology  a864.14.008cNederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek  aSBP2012/61cNederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek  cUniversidad de Costa Rica  cStanford University  cUniversity of California  cWageningen University0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPoeciliopsis 3aRetropinna 3afemales 3afish 3alife history 3aplacenta 3apredation 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3arisk 3aCosta Rica1 aFurness, Andrew I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7596-96231 aReznick, David N.1 aDekker, Myrthe L.1 aPollux, Bart J.

To understand the physiological and molecular mechanisms for this process, here we comparatively investigated the physiological characteristics and transcriptome patterns of M. micrantha stem under low light (30%) and full light (100%) conditions. The results showed that M. micrantha stem had photosynthetic capacity, which was highly plastic to light intensities, constituting an indispensable part of the plastic response of M. micrantha to shading. M. micrantha had longer internodes, epidermal cells, and consequently longer stems under low light than full light conditions, which could proximally be attributed to phytohormone production and reduction of photoprotective substances as potential metabolic trade-off, as observed here under shading treatment. The transcriptome sequencing and qPCR verified the results from physiological investigation, and showed that under low light condition the expression levels of genes involved in photosynthesis (e.g. MmPsaA, MmPsbO1 and MmFd3) were generally down-regulated in comparison to full light condition, as were genes related to the photoprotective substances synthesis (e.g. MmCHS, and MmF3H1) and the negative regulators of phytohormone (e.g. MmAUX1, MmRR1 and MmGAI). It was concluded that the regulation of phytohormones and photoprotective substances are important material basis for the rapid elongation of M. micrantha stems with high plasticity, which facilitates the vine's invasiveness in the forest understory.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFC1200105cthe National Key Research and Development Program of China 3aMikania micrantha 3ainvasive species 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant hormones 3aradiation resistance 3astem elongation 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aunderstory 3avines1 aWang, Yutao1 aZheng, Yaping1 aCai, Minling1 aPeng, Changlian1 aLi, Weihua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6707-25920 tBiological invasions.g2021 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.2927-2943dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl66237x1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-021-02546-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02967naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245014800163300001600311520161800327592002801945650001001973650002101983650002402004650001102028650002202039650001702061650003002078653002002108653003502128653002502163653002402188653002602212700001402238700001802252700001902270700001802289700002102307773012502328856008302453852000902536655001202545IND60713006720221121001506.0211227e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071300672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.09.1212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Zi Yu10aIn situ investigating the size-dependent scattering signatures and sensing sensitivity of single silver nanocube through a multi-model approach  ap. 253-262.  aInsightful understanding of size-dependent optical signatures and precise regularity of nanosensors is critical for developing applications of plasmonic sensing. This work presents a systematic study on localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)-based nanosensors of plasmonic silver nanocubes (AgNCs) with the edge lengths of 59.84 ± 7.97 nm (no. 1 AgNCs), 75.70 ± 9.05 nm (no. 2 AgNCs) and 110.32 ± 14.63 nm (no. 3 AgNCs), respectively. The effects of different sizes on the scattering signatures and refractive index (RI) sensitivities of AgNCs were in situ determined using the multi-model co-localization approach of single AgNC by dark-field microscope (DFM), LSPR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The scattering light colour of single AgNC took place bathochromic shift from monocolour to multicolour with the growth of edge length of single AgNC. The LSPR scattering spectra of no. 1 and 2 AgNCs exhibited singlet and singlet with the shoulder peak from quadrupolar resonance mode, respectively. Compared with the scattering signatures of no. 1 and 2 AgNCs, the interesting LSPR effect of plasmon line shape with two distinct peaks was observed on single no. 3 AgNC. In situ studies on the scattering spectral response of single AgNC to the ambient solvents and probing the small-molecule adsorbates on the surface of single silver nanocube reveal that no. 2 AgNC is more suitable as nanosensor due to strong regularity and higher sensitivity. The mechanism involved in optical signatures was elaborated clearly by combining with the experiments and theoretical simulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3arefractive index 3asensors (equipment) 3asilver 3asimulation models 3aspectroscopy 3asurface plasmon resonance 0aSilver colloids 0aRainbow single silver nanocube 0aMulti-model approach 0aSensing sensitivity 0aScattering signatures1 aZhou, Jun1 aZou, Hong Yan1 aLi, Yuan-Fang,1 aGao, Peng Fei1 aHuang, Cheng Zhi0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 584 p.253-262dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.09.1213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02386naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245012000159300001800279520102800297592002801325650002201353650001201375650001301387650001401400650001601414650002001430650001301450650002301463650001201486650001101498650001501509650001201524650002301536650001301559650002101572650002701593650000901620650001901629700001701648700001601665700001801681700001301699773010201712856008101814852000901895655001201904IND60523836020221120234028.0160628e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052383602DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-016-1730-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Kao10aThermal and Rheological Properties of Mung Bean Starch Blends with Potato, Sweet Potato, Rice, and Sorghum Starches  ap. 1408-1421.  aBlending diverse starches is green and easy to diversify starch functionalities and to lower the cost of food production. Mung bean starch is commonly used to make starch noodles with good quality. Other starches may replace the mung bean starch to reduce the production cost. Four common starches (potato, sweet potato, rice, and sorghum) were added to mung bean starch with the mixing ratio up to 100 %. The gelling, thermal, pasting, steady shear, and dynamic rheological properties of these starch systems were studied and compared. One thermal endotherm was found in all starch blends, but individual components still tended to gelatinize separately based on calculations of melting enthalpy data. However, nonlinear changes in rheological and gelling properties were mostly found, and the data can be fitted by polynomial equations (order 2), indicating the existence of interactions among components during these tests. Granule size and amylose content of starch played important roles in the nonadditive behaviors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum (Poaceae) 3aamylose 3aenthalpy 3aequations 3afood prices 3afood production 3agelation 3agelling properties 3amelting 3amixing 3amung beans 3anoodles 3apasting properties 3apotatoes 3aproduction costs 3arheological properties 3arice 3asweet potatoes1 aDai, Shuhong1 aGan, Renyou1 aCorke, Harold1 aZhu, Fan0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2016 Aug., v. 9, no. 8 p.1408-1421dSpringer USx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-016-1730-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03616naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013700166520204300303592002802346650002002374650002202394650001902416650002902435650002902464650001102493650000702504650001402511650000902525650000902534650002002543650000902563650001102572650001902583650002102602650001602623650001802639650002102657650002202678650001102700651001002711653002002721653002102741653001102762653001802773653002702791700005502818773011802873856008602991852000903077655001203086IND60737722820221117175427.0211219e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073772282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1127492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Ruolan10aEarly warning of water quality degradation: A copula-based Bayesian network model for highly efficient water quality risk assessment  aIn the context of global climate change and increasingly severe environmental pollution, drinking water quality risk assessments to provide crucial early warnings have become essential routine work. At present, traditional water quality assessment methods are commonly used without considering the correlation among different indicators and the substantial uncertainty from multiple sources, which limit their applications. To address this issue, a copula-based Bayesian network (CBN) method was proposed in this study to concretely evaluate the water quality risk with multiple environmental risk indicators in a large drinking water reservoir in Tianjin city, China. Taking rainfall and water temperature (WT) as external environmental risk indicators and pH, ammonia nitrogen (NH₃–N), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and permanganate index (CODMₙ) as internal environmental risk indicators, the CBN model was constructed to investigate the interaction between the indicators and water quality state and assess the contingent risk. Our results showed that TN and NH₃–N should be considered key risk indicators. Additionally, we performed forward and backward risk analyses to assess water quality risk during different seasons and determined the distributions of key indicators under different water quality risk grades. From a time perspective, the reservoir's water quality risk is much higher in winter and spring than in other seasons affected by winter snowfall. From a spatial perspective, the water quality risk is much higher at the reservoir's entrance than at other locations affected by water diversion. Furthermore, we found that the probability of water quality risk events may be relatively high when the TN concentration is 3.6 mg/L to 6.4 mg/L at the reservoir's entrance. The results reveal that the CBN method could be an invaluable decision-support tool for reservoir managers and scientists, which could provide an early warning of water quality degradation by only inputting monitoring data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aammonium nitrogen 3aclimate change 3adecision support systems 3aenvironmental management 3amodels 3apH 3apollution 3arain 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asnow 3aspring 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 3auncertainty 3awater quality 3awater reservoirs 3awater temperature 3awinter 3aChina 0aRisk assessment 0aBayesian network 0aCopula 0aWater quality 0aMultiple uncertainties1 aZhang, Chen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3212-42700 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 292 p.112749-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1127493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245011600163300001600279520126000295592002801555650000801583650002801591650001401619650001001633650002001643650002101663650001701684650001201701650001601713650003701729650002101766653000801787653000801795653001001803653001601813653000901829653002601838700003001864700002201894700006001916700005601976773012502032856008302157852000902240655001202249IND60713006920221121001310.0211227e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071300692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.09.1232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Maoqi10aModulating transparency and colour of cellulose nanocrystal composite films by varying polymer molecular weight  ap. 216-224.  aCellulose nanocrystals (CNC) can produce photonic composite films that selectively reflect light based on their periodic cholesteric structure. The hypothesis of this research is that by incorporating water-soluble polymer, photonic properties of CNC composite film can be designed by manipulating the polymer molecular weight.Flexible free-standing composite films of five different poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) molecular weights were prepared via air drying under a controlled environment, and characterised by reflectance UV–vis spectrometer, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Films with each molecular weight were investigated over a concentration range.The colour and transmission haze of the composite films was modified by varying both the PEG molecular weight and concentration. Depending on the molecular weight, the films were able to reflect light from the UV region (242 nm) across the visible spectrum to the near-infrared region (832 nm). Different trends in variation of the reflected light based on the molecular weight was found with increasing PEG concentration and was explained by weak depletion interactions occurring between CNC and PEG, which was reduced with increasing PEG molecular weight.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aatomic force microscopy 3acellulose 3acolor 3acomposite films 3amolecular weight 3ananocrystals 3aphotons 3areflectance 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awater solubility 0aCNC 0aPEG 0aFilms 0aIridescence 0aHaze 0aDepletion interaction1 aRaghuwanshi, Vikram Singh1 aBrowne, Christine1 aSimon, George P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8832-11641 aGarnier, Gil1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3512-00560 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 584 p.216-224dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.09.1233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245015500170300001800325520138200343536014201725592002801867596014801895650001902043650001402062650001502076650002302091650001102114650002102125650001602146650001502162650001502177650001602192650001302208650001302221650001402234650001302248650002102261650002002282650001302302650001102315653003302326653002402359700002302383700002002406700002102426773014702447856008502594852000902679655001202688IND60671844420200305000000.0191004e20191206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067184442DNAL7 a10.1080/03650340.2019.15921632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPraus, Lukáš10aRapeseed (Brassica napus L.) biofortification with selenium: How do sulphate and phosphate influence the efficiency of selenate application into soil?  ap. 2059-2072.  aThe connection between sulphur (S) and selenium (Se) metabolism makes rapeseed (Brassica napus) an attractive candidate for Se fortification. Unfortunately, fertilizers may interfere with the availability of selenate (SeO₄²⁻) in numerous ways, including both soil and physiological processes. Experiments on two agricultural soils amended with SeO₄²⁻ (32 μg Se kg⁻¹ soil), sulphate and phosphate (each at three levels of supply) were established to elucidate the effect of these anions on the selenization efficiency. Maximal efficiency in Chernozem soil was roughly two-fold higher (455 μg Se kg⁻¹ seed) than in Cambisol. Sulphate significantly decreased (up to 28%) the seed Se contents in Cambisol, while an enhancement (up to 33%) was found in Chernozem. In the Chernozem, the induction of collective S and Se translocation toward the seed more than compensated for any competition effects due to the highest sulphate supply. In Cambisol, plant Se distribution did not follow that of S as closely as in Chernozem. Phosphate did not significantly alter the fortification efficiency. Resistance of rapeseed proteins to protease hampered a quantitative investigation of changes in Se speciation under different S supplies. Nevertheless, protein-bound selenomethionine was the predominant Se storage form and traces of other Se species were also identified.  aThis work was supported by the The University Internal Grant Competition at Czech University of Life Sciences Prague [CIGA no. 20172019].  aPublisher supplied data  aCIGA no. 20172019cThe University Internal Grant Competition at Czech University of Life Sciences Praguedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100006206 3aBrassica napus 3aCambisols 3aChernozems 3aagricultural soils 3aanions 3abiofortification 3afertilizers 3ametabolism 3aphosphates 3aproteinases 3aproteins 3arapeseed 3aselenates 3aselenium 3aselenomethionine 3asoil amendments 3asulfates 3asulfur 0arapeseed (Brassica napus L.) 0achemical speciation1 aSzáková, Jiřina1 aSteiner, Oliver1 aGoessler, Walter0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2019 Dec. 6, v. 65, no. 14 p.2059-2072dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4585x1476-35677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2019.15921633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03970naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006700153245011700220300001600337520196600353592002802319650001802347650001802365650002502383650001202408650001202420650001602432650001802448650002002466650002202486650001702508650001702525650001902542650001802561650000902579650002102588653000902609653000902618653000802627653000702635653001102642653000902653653001002662653001402672653001602686653001202702653001402714653001202728653001402740653001202754653002102766653003202787653002202819653004002841653001902881653001502900700001802915700002402933700001702957700002202974700003002996700001803026773011903044856008803163852000903251655001203260IND60598011420221116181127.0201125e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059801142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurrión, María-Belén1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5146-441X10aEffects on soil phosphorus dynamics of municipal solid waste compost addition to a burnt and unburnt forest soil  ap. 374-382.  aThe main aim of this research was to assess the effects of municipal solid waste compost (MSWC) addition to a burnt and unburnt calcareous soil, on the distribution of soil P forms in particle-size and extractable fractions. Three MSWC doses (1, 2 and 4% w/w) were added to burnt and unburnt soil samples and were incubated for 92 days at 29 °C and 75% of field capacity moisture. A particle-size fractionation followed by a sequential P extraction procedure was carried out. The burnt soil showed significantly lower concentrations of organic P forms (Pₒᵣg) and significantly higher concentrations of stable P forms than the unburnt soil. Besides, in both burnt and unburnt soils, most P-forms presented higher concentrations in the clay fractions than in the sand and silt fractions, possibly due to the different proportions of microbial synthesized and plant-derived substances in the different particle-size fractions. Finer fractions of MSWC showed higher total P and Pₒᵣg concentrations than coarser fractions. Our results showed that the highest dose of MSWC` was the most effective one for the rehabilitation of the burnt soil. MSWC amendment also caused an increase in soil P availability in the unburnt soil which initially contained relatively low levels of P. During the incubation process, a high proportion of organic P contained in the MSWC was mineralized into inorganic P forms. These forms were precipitated with Ca cations which are very abundant in these calcareous soils, significantly increasing the P fraction extracted by HCl in both amended soils. Hence, adding compost to the soil involved an increase in the available P reservoir in the long term. The combination of particle-size fractionation, chemical sequential extraction and incubation experiments can be a valuable tool for splitting soil phosphorus into different fractions regarding their availability in relation to short and long-term transformations in soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay fraction 3afractionation 3ainorganic phosphorus 3acalcium 3acations 3aburnt soils 3aparticle size 3asoil amendments 3ahydrochloric acid 3aMSW composts 3aforest soils 3afield capacity 3asoil sampling 3asand 3acalcareous soils 0aMSWC 0aCorg 0aAEM 0aPi 0aPtotal 0aPorg 0aP_AEM 0aPi_NaHCO3 0aPorg_NaHCO3 0aPi_NaOH 0aPorg_NaOH 0aP_HCl1M 0aP_HClconc 0aP_HClO4 0aSoil remediation 0aParticle-size fractionation 0aOrganic amendment 0aPhosphorus sequential fractionation 0aRehabilitation 0aIncubation1 aBueis, Teresa1 aLafuente, Francisco1 aLópez, Olga1 aSan José, Esther1 aEleftheriadis, Alexandros1 aMulas, Rafael0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 642 p.374-382dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02964naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245010100208520157200309592002801881650001801909650001201927650002901939650001901968650001501987650001502002650001502017650002402032650001802056650002502074653003002099653001702129653002602146653003702172700001702209700007102226700001402297700001802311773011802329856008602447852000902533655001202542IND60737723020221117175406.0211219e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073772302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1127552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Tingting1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2475-137010aDivergent vertical distributions of microbial biomass with soil depth among groups and land uses  aSoil microbial biomass is key to improving the prediction of soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics by modeling. However, the driving mechanism of microbial biomass of different groups with soil depth is poorly understood across sites. Here, we compiled the biomass of different microbial groups (i.e., fungi, bacteria, gram-positive bacteria G⁺, and gram-negative bacteria G⁻) from the surface to a soil depth of 1 m from 71 soil profiles across three continents. We found that the biomass of microbial groups all decreased with soil depth but at different magnitudes, while the relative abundance of microbial groups, except G⁻, was relatively stable along soil profiles. Soil fungal biomass had a shallower vertical distribution than bacteria, especially G⁺, with 89% fungi and 76% G⁺ in the top 10 cm soils. In addition, a greater proportion of microbial biomass (71–89%) compared to SOC (64%) was in the top 10 cm soils, suggesting that microbes and SOC exhibited different vertical distributions. The vertical distributions of microbial biomass of different groups were significantly correlated with SOC and clay content but not with climate, and these distributions were different among land uses, highlighting the great influences of edaphic factors on vertical distributions of microbial biomass. The relationship between microbial biomass and soil depth provides a feasible way to estimate microbial biomass at different soil depths, which can serve as a benchmark to improve the prediction of SOC dynamics of entire soil profile at large scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay fraction 3aclimate 3aenvironmental management 3afungal biomass 3aprediction 3asoil depth 3asoil fungi 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil profiles 3aspatial distribution 0aSoil organic carbon (SOC) 0aSoil texture 0aMicrobial communities 0aPhospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs)1 aWang, Yugang1 aLucas-Borja, Manuel Esteban1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6270-84081 aJing, Xin1 aFeng, Wenting0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 292 p.112755-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1127553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01471naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245009000152300001800242520046600260592002800726650002300754650001300777650001300790650001300803650002100816650001500837700001200852700001500864700002100879700001600900773013400916856007401050852000901124655001201133IND60741730220221119064626.0210618e20210617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074173022DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc01404h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Gao10aCucurbit[8]uril facilitated Michael addition for regioselective cysteine modification  ap. 6086-6089.  aUtilizing the interactions between tryptophan, methyl viologen and cucurbit[8]uril, we found that the distance between the targeted peptides/protein and the reactive peptide was shortened, which facilitated the Michael addition reaction between cysteine and dehydroalanine.

We conducted this outdoor SALSCS based real-world quasi-interventional study to examine the associations of the SALSCS intervention and changes in air pollution levels with the biomarkers of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress in healthy elders. We measured the levels of 8-hydrox-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), Interlukin-6 (IL-6), as well as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) from urine samples, and IL-6 from saliva samples of 123 healthy retired participants from interventional/control residential areas in two sampling campaigns. We collected daily 24-h PM₂.₅ samples in two residential areas during the study periods using mini-volume samplers. Data on PM₁₀, gaseous pollutants and weather factors were collected from the nearest national air quality monitoring stations. We used linear mixed-effect models to examine the percent change in each biomarker associated with the SALSCS intervention and air pollution levels, after adjusting for time trend, seasonality, weather factors and personal characteristics. Results showed that the SALSCS intervention was significantly associated with decreases in the geometric mean of biomarkers by 47.6% (95% confidence interval: 16.5–67.2%) for 8-OHdG, 66% (31.0–83.3%) for TNF-α, 41.7% (0.2–65.9%) and 43.4% (13.6–62.9%) for urinary and salivary IL-6, respectively. An inter-quartile range increase of ambient PM₂.₅ exposure averaged on the day of the collection of bio-samples and the day before (34.1 μg/m³) was associated, albeit non-significantly so, with 22.8%–37.9% increases in the geometric mean of these biomarkers. This study demonstrated that the SALSCS intervention and decreased ambient air pollution exposure results in lower burden of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress in older adults.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3abiomarkers 3aconfidence interval 3aenvironment 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3aoxidative stress 3aparticulates 3asaliva 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aurine 3aweather 3aChina 0a8-OHdG 0aBMI 0aCI 0aCO 0aELISA 0aLME 0aIL-6 0aIQR 0aNO2 0aO3 0aPM2.5 0aRH 0aSALSCS 0aSO2 0aTNF-α 0aSolar-assisted large-scale cleaning system 0aBiomarker 0aInflammation 0aOxidative stress 0aQuasi-interventional study1 aNiu, Xin-Yi1 aCao, Jun-Ji1 aXu, Hong-Mei1 aXiao, Shun1 aZhang, Ning-Ning1 aXia, Xi1 aShen, Zhen-Xing1 aHuang, Yu1 aLau, Gabriel Ngar-Cheung1 aYim, Steve Hung-Lam1 aHo, Kin-Fai0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 806 p.151217-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1512173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012600160300002000286520129500306592002801601650002201629650001401651650001401665650002301679650001101702650002201713650001701735650003301752650001301785650001701798650003701815700001801852700001701870700001501887700001701902700001501919700001801934773012501952856007402077852000902151655001202160IND60640978420221118104314.0190505e20160928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064097842DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra14191a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jingchao10aFacile synthesis of ZnCo₂O₄ mesoporous structures with enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction properties  ap. 92699-92704.  aRecently, as one kind of ternary spinel metal oxide, ZnCo₂O₄ has attracted extensive attention in the energy storage and conversion field due to it being cost-effective, scalable, and environmentally friendly. Herein, porous ZnCo₂O₄ micro-spindles and truncated drums were synthesized by a solvent thermal route first and then with an annealing treatment with the precursors. The morphology and structure of ZnCo₂O₄ were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). It is worth noting that ZnCo₂O₄ porous micro-spindles show a high surface area of 65.85 m² g⁻¹ with an average pore diameter of ∼6.34 nm. The as-prepared ZnCo₂O₄ materials, especially micro-spindles, exhibited good electrocatalytic water-splitting performance with excellent activity and stability. The ZnCo₂O₄ micro-spindle catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 0.389 V at the benchmark of a current density of 10 mA cm⁻². The Tafel slope is 59.54 mV dec⁻¹ and the OER overpotential of the catalyst shows no obvious increase during 7200 s. The high activity, low Tafel slope, and good stability will pave the way for the use of ZnCo₂O₄ micro-spindles in practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aannealing 3acatalysts 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy 3aoxygen production 3aporous media 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3asurface area 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aZhang, Daojun1 aYang, Yujing1 aMa, Jingyu1 aCui, Shufang1 aLi, Yanmei1 aYuan, Baiqing0 tRSC advances.g2016 Sept. 28, v. 6, no. 95 p.92699-92704dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra14191a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009700168300001800265520134700283592002801630650000801658650002501666650001601691650001301707650002001720650001101740650001901751650002001770650000901790650001001799650001301809650001801822700003001840700002601870700002801896773010201924856008102026852000902107655001202116IND60523836520221121015643.0160628e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052383652DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-016-1720-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalamanit, Arkom10aPerformance Evaluation of Top-Spray Fluidized Bed Coating for Healthy Coated Rice Production  ap. 1317-1326.  aCoating with top-spray fluidized bed at inappropriate operating condition not only provides low product quality but also leads to low coating efficiency and improper energy consumption. The objective of this study was therefore to study the effects of superficial air velocity (Vf), atomization air pressure (Ap), and recycled exhaust air (Ra) on the performance of top-spray fluidized bed coating (TSFBC) in terms of product quality, coating efficiency (CE), and energy consumption for producing turmeric extract coated rice (TECR). The experimental results showed that the operation of TSFBC without Ra provided the final moisture content (MC) of TECR lower than 12 % (wet basis (w.b.)) for all Vf’s and Ap’s. The lowering final MC of TECR below 11.8 % (w.b.) led to the fissure of all TECR kernels. The Ra with 80 % could significantly reduce the number of fissured kernels and the energy consumption of electric heater by 41.7–46.5 %. The operation of TSFBC at low Vf, i.e., 2 m/s, resulted in high number of uncoated white rice kernels (UCWR) for all Ap’s and Ra. When the Vf was increased to 2.5 or 3 m/s, the number of UCWR was significantly reduced and the value of CE was higher than that at 2 m/s. At such both velocities, the Ap and Ra insignificantly affected the CE but the Ra slightly affected the number of UCWR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aatmospheric pressure 3aatomization 3acoatings 3acrop production 3aenergy 3afluidized beds 3aproduct quality 3arice 3aseeds 3aturmeric 3awater content1 aPrachayawarakorn, Somkiat1 aTungtrakul, Patcharee1 aSoponronnarit, Somchart0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2016 Aug., v. 9, no. 8 p.1317-1326dSpringer USx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-016-1720-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245008100170300001300251520104200264592002801306650002001334650001801354650003401372650002601406650002001432650000901452650001201461650001401473650001001487650001001497650001701507650001301524653000801537653002501545653000901570653001301579700001701592700002101609700001901630773010901649856008301758852000901841655001201850IND60619075620221118015149.0190312e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061907562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcpa.2018.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeite-Filho, R.V.10aPathological Characterization of Lymphoma with Pulmonary Involvement in Cats  ap. 6-12.  aStudies evaluating histological patterns of lung infiltration by lymphoma in cats are lacking.

Membrane fusion processes are also of interest in synthetic cell research, where cell-mimicking behavior often requires dynamically interacting compartments. For these applications, triggered fusion compatible with transcription-translation systems is key in achieving complexity. Recently, a photosensitive surfactant, azobenzene trimethylammonium bromide (AzoTAB), has been reported to induce membrane fusion by a photoinduced conformational change. Using imaging flow cytometer (IFC) and confocal microscopy we quantitatively investigated photoinduced AzoTAB-mediated fusion of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine vesicles. The IFC analysis result showed that the fusion rate could reach about 40% following AzoTAB addition and UV irradiation in optimized conditions. We confirmed the compatibility between AzoTAB-induced vesicle fusion and a synthetic cell-free protein translation system using green fluorescent protein as reporter. With the techniques presented, cell-sized vesicle fusion can be quantitatively analyzed and optimized, paving the way to controllable synthetic cells with fundamental biological functions like the ability to express proteins from encapsulated plasmids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial cells 3aconfocal microscopy 3aencapsulation 3aflow cytometry 3agreen fluorescent protein 3alipids 3amembrane fusion 3aphotosensitivity 3aplasmids 3aresearch 3asurfactants 3aultraviolet radiation 0aGiant vesicle 0aLiposome 0aVesicle fusion 0aIrradiation 0aCell-free system1 aDing, Jinquan1 aCaliari, Adriano1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6315-34051 aLu, Nan1 aHan, Fuhai1 aXia, Yang1 aXu, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1816-41291 aYomo, Tetsuya0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2022 Aug. 27, v. 618 p.113-118dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.06.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03479naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163072000900181072000900190072000900199072000900208100002100217245010700238300001600345500002400361506007600385520138400461506003701845650002101882650001401903650001801917650002401935650001101959650003001970650002202000650002302022650002302045650002302068650002302091650001402114650001402128650005902142650001202201650002502213650002102238650001102259650005902270650000902329650001602338650002602354653002302380653002602403700002102429700002002450700002002470700002302490773012002513852000902633856008002642930003302722945002502755946001302780655001202793IND4420415520221207135046.0090514e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442041552DNAL7 a194964122pmid7 aPMC27197952pmcid7 a10.1603/033.046.03062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL600 0aL001 0aL3001 aGavotte, Laurent10aWolbachia Infection and Resource Competition Effects on Immature Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae)  ap. 451-459.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWolbachia pipientis Hertig and Wolbach (Rickettsiales: Rickettsiaceae) are intracellular α-proteobacteria that occur naturally in Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) and numerous other invertebrates. These endosymbionts can invade host populations by manipulating host reproduction. Wolbachia infections have been shown to impart both costs and benefits to hosts in terms of development, survival, and fecundity. Here, we monitor intraspecific competition among independent cohorts of infected or uninfected larvae. Levels of competition are manipulated by varying initial larval densities and food levels. Although larval density is observed to have major impacts on immature survivorship, sex ratio of eclosing adults, and developmental rates, the Wolbachia infection status had minimal impact on male immatures and no effect on immature females under these experimental conditions. Female and male immatures were observed to respond differently to competitive pressure, with the functional relationships of females and males consistent with scramble and contest competition, respectively. The results are discussed in relation to the evolution of naturally occurring Wolbachia infections in Ae. albopictus (i.e., natural population replacement events) and public health strategies that propose the manipulation of Wolbachia infections in Ae. albopictus populations.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAedes albopictus 3aimmatures 3aendosymbionts 3aWolbachia pipientis 3alarvae 3aintraspecific competition 3afood availability 3apopulation density 3agender differences 3alarval development 3ainsect development 3amortality 3asex ratio 2aAedesxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aCompetitive Behavior 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aLarvaxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aMale 2aSex Factors 2aWolbachiaxphysiology 0alarval competition 0aresource availability1 aMercer, David R.1 aVandyke, Rhonda1 aMains, James W.1 aDobson, Stephen L.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2009 May, v. 46, no. 3 p.451-459dEntomological Society of Americax0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/033.046.03063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090605b20090703c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/06/05  aOther US 7aarticle03757naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003200153245009500185520212500280592002802405650001902433650001902452650001502471650001902486650001602505650001502521650001502536650002802551650001602579650001002595650001802605650001002623650001502633650001902648650001202667650000702679650002202686650002502708650001602733650002002749650001102769650001402780653001002794653001902804653003702823700002902860700004102889700002802930700002902958773011902987856008803106852000903194655001203203IND60755225020221122233259.0211227e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075522502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1512212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrdoñez-Arévalo, Berenice10aHemicellulolytic bacteria in the anterior intestine of the earthworm Eisenia fetida (Sav.)  aTropical agriculture produces large amounts of lignocellulosic residues that can potentially be used as a natural source of value-added products. The complexity of lignocellulose makes industrial-scale processing difficult. New processing techniques must be developed to improve the yield and avoid this valuable resource going to waste. Hemicelluloses comprise a variety of polysaccharides with different backbone compositions and decorations (such as methylations and acetylations), and form part of an intricate framework that confers structural stability to the plant cell wall. Organisms that are able to degrade these biopolymers include earthworms (Eisenia fetida), which can rapidly decompose a wide variety of lignocellulosic substrates. This ability probably derives from enzymes and symbiotic microorganisms in the earthworm gut. In this work, two substrates with similar C/N ratios but different hemicellulose content were selected. Palm fibre and coffee husk have relatively high (28%) and low (5%) hemicellulose contents, respectively. A vermicomposting mixture was prepared for the earthworms to feed on by mixing a hemicellulose substrate with organic market waste. Xylanase activity was determined in earthworm gut and used as a selection criterion for the isolation of hemicellulose-degrading bacteria. Xylanase activity was similar for both substrates, even though their physicochemical properties principally pH and electrical conductivity, as shown by the MANOVA analysis) were different for the total duration of the experiment (120 days). Xylanolytic strains isolated from earthworm gut were identified by sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. Our results indicate that the four Actinobacteria, two Proteobacteria, and one Firmicutes isolated are active participants of the xylanolytic degradation by microbiota in the intestine of E. fetida. Most bacteria were more active at pH 7 and 28 °C, and those with higher activities are reported as being facultatively anaerobic, coinciding with the microenvironment reported for the earthworm gut. Each strain had a different degradative capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aEisenia fetida 3aFirmicutes 3aProteobacteria 3abiopolymers 3acell walls 3aearthworms 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenvironment 3agenes 3ahemicellulose 3ahulls 3aintestines 3alignocellulose 3amarkets 3apH 3asequence analysis 3atropical agriculture 3avalue added 3avermicomposting 3awastes 3axylanases 0aXylan 0aHemicellulases 0aHemicellulose-degrading bacteria1 aHuerta-Lwanga, Esperanza1 aCalixto-Romo, María de los Ángeles1 aDunn, Michael Frederick1 aGuillén-Navarro, Karina0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 806 p.151221-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1512213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01543naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245007000159300001800229520049100247592002800738650001300766650001200779650001500791650001300806650000900819700001500828700001500843700001400858700001500872700001500887700001700902700002000919700001300939773013400952856007401086852000901160655001201169IND60741730620221119064458.0210618e20210617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074173062DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc01652k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xiaotong10aNarcissistic self-sorting in anion-coordination-driven assemblies  ap. 6078-6081.  aThree tris-bis(urea) ligands with triphenylamine-based C₃-symmetric spacers were synthesized, which assembled with sulfate or phosphate to form anionic A₃L₂ pinwheel helices (A = anion and L = ligand) and A₄L₄ tetrahedra, respectively.

In the context of campsite choice, this previous research has almost exclusively used stated preference data and aspatial methods to understand decision-making. This present research seeks to understand how recreationists reach decisions on the selection of campsites and what aspects of the recreational setting drive demand through an examination of a big dataset of revealed preference data using a spatial regression. Specifically, we examine which managerial, social, and ecological aspects of the setting influence demand for campsites in Zion National Park's (USA) Watchman Campground using reservation data from the Recreation Information Database (RIDB). Results indicate that price, access to electricity, ease of access, and proximity to the Virgin River are significantly predictive of demand. Study implications for park management, including campsite allocation and distributive justice, are provided. Additionally, implications for future research methodology, including the use of transaction-style big data in protected area management research, are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acampgrounds 3aconservation areas 3adata collection 3adatabases 3adecision making 3aelectricity 3aenvironmental management 3alandscapes 3anational parks 3aoutdoor recreation 3aprices 3arivers 0aBig data 0aCampgrounds 0aRecreation decision-making 0aProtected area management 0aSpatial regression1 aPark, Soyoung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2810-33220 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 292 p.112773-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1127733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03896naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245011500182520188100297592002802178650001902206650002002225650001702245650001002262650002002272650001702292650000902309650001702318650001002335650001302345650001002358650001902368650001702387650001702404650001602421650001402437650004302451650001302494650002002507651001102527651001802538653002502556653001702581653002102598653001402619653000702633653000702640653001502647653000702662653000902669653001102678653000702689653001302696653000702709653000802716653000802724653001002732700005002742700002402792700003202816700002902848700002902877700003102906700001902937773011102956856008603067852000903153655001203162IND60649420920221119225435.0190705e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064942092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2019.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCunha, Eleonora Lima Alves10aBenznidazole, itraconazole and their combination in the treatment of acute experimental chagas disease in dogs  aChagas disease (CD) is a serious public health problem in Latin America and its treatment remains neglected. Benznidazole (BZ), the only drug available in Brazil, presents serious side effects and low therapeutic efficacy, especially at the chronic phase. The last clinical trials demonstrated that the first generation of azole compounds were less successful than BZ in CD chemotherapy, which stimulated studies of these compounds associated to BZ and nifurtimox (NF). This study evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of BZ, itraconazole (ITZ) and their combination (BZ + ITZ) in dogs infected with the VL-10 T. cruzi strain in the acute phase of the disease. Twenty young mongrel dogs were inoculated with 2.0 × 103 blood trypomastigotes/kg and divided into four groups: treated with BZ, ITZ and BZ + ITZ for 60 days, and control group (INT). The parasitemia of the BZ + ITZ and BZ groups were similar and showed significant reduction compared to the INT group. The group treated with ITZ also showed significant parasitemia reduction compared to the INT group. The global analysis of hemoculture (HC), blood PCR, conventional serology (CS-ELISA), heart qPCR and histopathology techniques, used in the post-treatment evaluation, revealed that BZ + ITZ combination lead to a more reduction of parasitemia during the acute phase and heart qPCR positivity, less cardiac damage (inflammation and fibrosis in the left ventricle) and total survival. According to the classical cure criteria one animal treated with BZ + ITZ can be considered cured in its final evaluation and two other dogs, one of this group and one treated with ITZ were in process of cure. At least for BZ-resistant T. cruzi strains such as VL-10, BZ + ITZ was not effective to induce parasitological cure or a profound and sustained reduction of the parasite burden in blood and infected organs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChagas disease 3aadverse effects 3abenznidazole 3ablood 3aclinical trials 3adog diseases 3adogs 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3afibrosis 3aheart 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3aitraconazole 3aparasitemia 3aparasites 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aserology 3atrypomastigotes 3aBrazil 3aLatin America 0aAcute chagas disease 0aChemotherapy 0aDrug combination 0aDog model 0aAP 0aBZ 0aBZ + ITZ 0aCD 0aCEUA 0aCONCEA 0aCP 0aCS-ELISA 0aHC 0aINT 0aITZ 0am.a.t1 aTorchelsen, Fernanda Karoline Vieira da Silva1 aCunha, Lucas Maciel1 ade Oliveira, Maykon Tavares1 aFonseca, Kátia da Silva1 aVieira, Paula Melo Abreu1 aCarneiro, Cláudia Martins1 ade Lana, Marta0 tExperimental parasitology.g2019 Sept., v. 204 p.107711-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45466x0014-48947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2019.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03626naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006400151245009300215520228500308592002802593650002702621650001402648650000902662650002902671650000902700650002202709650002002731650001102751650002002762650001202782650002502794651001302819653002502832653001602857653001902873653001302892653002802905700005802933773011802991856008603109852000903195655001203204IND60737723620221117175412.0211219e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073772362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1127742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbeyrathna, W.A.N.U.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0370-156110aEffect of Daylight Saving Time clock shifts on white-tailed deer-vehicle collision rates  aTo devise effective measures for reducing hazardous wildlife-vehicle collisions, it is necessary to know when during the year accidents occur most frequently, and what factors cause the seasonal patterns. Daylight Saving Time (DST) 1-h clock-shifts around the spring and fall equinoxes at temperate zone latitudes are associated with increased vehicle accidents, attributed to driver error caused by disrupted sleep patterns and changes in visibility during peak driving times. Collision with deer is a significant cause of motor vehicle accidents in North America; in New York State alone, 65,000 vehicle accidents annually are caused by collision with white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We asked whether white-tailed deer-vehicle collisions (DVC) increased in frequency after DST clock shifts in New York State, by analyzing 35,167 New York State DVC reports from 2005 to 2007. For the spring, when the clock is shifted an hour forward relative to sunrise (i.e. later sunrise and sunset), there was either no change or possibly a small decrease in workweek evening DVC after the clock shift. For fall, when the clock is shifted an hour back relative to sunrise (i.e. earlier sunrise and sunset), the DVC rate was far higher than spring. The DVC rate was higher after the clock shift than before, caused in part by an ongoing seasonal trend for increasing DVC associated with deer behavior around the time of rut, peaking about two weeks after the clock shift. However, there was also a reduction in workweek morning DVC after clock-shift, but an even greater increase in DVC in the evening. DVC rates are highest around dusk and during the fall, and the fall DST clock-shift caused more workweek commuter traffic to coincide with the annual hourly period of peak risk of DVC. We conclude that in New York State, DST clock-shift results in an increase in the number of DVC, and therefore injuries and property damage associated with such accidents. The justification for DST clock-shifts is controversial; when evaluating the benefits and costs, one should include the consequences for risk of wildlife-vehicle collisions, especially in regions where ungulate-vehicle accidents are frequent, and clock-shifts coincide with the rut or other periods of peak accident risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3aaccidents 3adeer 3aenvironmental management 3arisk 3asleep deprivation 3asolar radiation 3aspring 3atemperate zones 3atraffic 3avehicles (equipment) 3aNew York 0aDaylight saving time 0aHot moments 0aTraffic safety 0aUngulate 0aDeer-vehicle collisions1 aLangen, Tom A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4267-820X0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 292 p.112774-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1127743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001900189245010100208300001400309506007600323520144200399592002801841506003701869650001101906650002901917650002201946650001101968650002701979650000902006650001702015650002502032650001602057650001002073650001302083650001202096650001402108650002202122650001002144650001002154650001302164650001902177650001202196653000802208653001102216653002502227653001602252700001602268700001502284700001502299700001602314700001702330773011002347856008302457852000902540655001202549IND60619075920221207115116.0190312e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061907592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcpa.2018.09.0042doi7 aPMC63021482pmcid7 a305027922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDagleish, M.P.12aA Fatal Case of Louping-ill in a Dog: Immunolocalization and Full Genome Sequencing of the Virus  ap. 23-32.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLouping-ill (LI), caused by louping-ill virus (LIV), results in a frequently fatal encephalitis primarily affecting sheep and red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica), but it does occur in other species. An adult male Border collie dog was definitively diagnosed with fatal LI and the lesion profile, LIV antigen distribution and full genome sequence of the LIV responsible were investigated to determine if this differed significantly from sheep-derived LIV. No gross lesions were present. The histological lesions were confined to the central nervous system and comprised of lymphocytic perivascular cuffs, glial foci, neuronal necrosis and neuronophagia. Immunolocalization of viral antigen showed small amounts present in neurons only. These histological and immunohistochemical findings were similar to those reported in affected sheep. Compared with published full genome sequences of sheep-derived LIV, only very minor differences were present and phylogenetically the virus clustered individually between a subclade containing Scottish strains, LIV 369/T2 and G and another subclade containing an English isolate LIV A. The LIV isolated from the dog shares a common progenitor with LIV A. These findings suggest there is no canine-specific LIV strain, dogs are susceptible to sheep-associated strains of LI and with the increase in tick prevalence, and therefore exposure to LIV, a safe, effective vaccine for dogs may be required.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCollie 3aLagopus lagopus scoticus 3aLouping ill virus 3aadults 3acentral nervous system 3adogs 3aencephalitis 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alouping ill 3amales 3anecrosis 3aneurons 3aphylogeny 3asequence analysis 3asheep 3aticks 3avaccines 3aviral antigens 3aviruses 0adog 0agenome 0aimmunohistochemistry 0alouping-ill1 aClark, J.J.1 aRobson, C.1 aTucker, M.1 aOrton, R.J.1 aRocchi, M.S.0 tJournal of comparative pathology.g2018 Nov., v. 165 p.23-32dElsevier LtdwJournal:1946x0021-99757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2018.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245010300188300001600291520140300307592002801710650001701738650001301755650002001768650002401788650002001812650003701832650002601869650006101895650004401956650002002000650003602020700001602056700001802072700002002090700002002110700001802130700001702148700001802165773010702183856008102290990002302371852000902394655001202403IND60090683420221120202127.0141102e20120115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009068342DNAL7 a222096472pmid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2011.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolli, Shylaja D.10aStructure–activity relationship of α hormones, the mating factors of phytopathogen Phytophthora  ap. 681-686.  aThe mating hormones α1 and α2 induce sexual reproduction of the phytopathogenic genus Phytophthora. To demonstrate the structural elements responsible to hormonal activity, 17 derivatives of α1 and α2 were synthesized and their hormonal activity (oospore-inducing activity) was evaluated. The terminal ester derivatives of α1 (diacetate and dibenzoate) retained the hormonal activity, whereas a dicarbamate derivative completely suppressed the activity. Even monocarbamates showed weak activities; among them the 1-O-carbamate was less active than 16-O-carbamate, suggesting that the 1-OH group is a little more important than 16-OH. Dihydro, dehydro, and demethyl derivatives exhibited the minimum level of activity. Surviving activity of 15-epi-α1 suggested a less importance of this stereochemistry. Contrary to α1, not only the terminal diacetate derivative but also monoacetates of α2 exhibited no or little activity. Among the monoacetates, 1-O-acetyl-α2 exhibited little yet relatively better activity than the others. No activity was observed for mono- and dicarbamoyl derivatives of α2. Dihydro α2 with the saturated double bond lost most of the activity. These findings suggest that both the mating hormones α1 and α2 require most of the functional (hydroxyl, keto, and olefinic) groups they possess in their natural form for inducing the sexual reproduction of Phytophthora.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytophthora 3ahormones 3aplant pathogens 3asexual reproduction 3astereochemistry 3astructure-activity relationships 2aCarbamatesxchemistry 2aDiterpenesxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPhytophthoraxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aStereoisomerism 2aStructure-Activity Relationship1 aQi, Jianhua1 aYajima, Arata1 aShikai, Keisuke1 aImaoka, Tadashi1 aNukada, Tomoo1 aYabuta, Goro1 aOjika, Makoto0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry.g2012 Jan. 15, v. 20, no. 2 p.681-686dElsevier Ltdx0968-08967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2011.12.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245015500171520105200326592002801378650001601406650001401422650002401436650001301460650002701473650001901500650002201519650002601541650001501567650001101582650001301593650001301606650001501619653002401634653001201658653002201670653002201692653003901714700001901753700001801772700005701790773009101847856009001938852000902028655001202037IND60746552520221121062220.0211114e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074655252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1317792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJing, Zhen,10aEffects of ferroferric oxide on azo dye degradation in a sulfate-containing anaerobic reactor: From electron transfer capacity and microbial community  aAnaerobic decolorization of azo dye in sulfate-containing wastewater has been regarded as an economical and effective method, but it is generally limited by the high concentration of azo dye and accumulation of toxic intermediates. To address this problem, Fe₃O₄ was added to one of the anaerobic reactors to investigate the effects on system performances. Results showed that AO7 removal rate, COD removal rate, and sulfate reduction were enhanced with the addition of Fe₃O₄ under various influent AO7 concentrations (153 mgCOD/L – 1787 mgCOD/L). According to the proposed pathway for the degradation of AO7, more intermediates (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, phthalide, 4-methylphenol) were produced in the presence of Fe₃O₄. The electron transfer capacity of sludge was also increased since Fe₃O₄ could stimulate to secrete humic acid-like organics in EPS. Microbial analysis showed that iron-reducing bacteria like Clostridium and Geobacter were also enriched, which were capable of azo dye and aromatic compounds degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium 3aGeobacter 3aanaerobic digesters 3aazo dyes 3achemical oxygen demand 3adecolorization 3aelectron transfer 3amicrobial communities 3aphthalides 3asludge 3asulfates 3atoxicity 3awastewater 0aAnaerobic treatment 0aAzo dye 0aSulfate reduction 0aFerroferric oxide 0aExtracellular polymeric substances1 aZhao, Zhiqiang1 aLiang, Lianfu1 aZhang, Yaobin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6052-05080 tChemosphere.g2022 Jan., v. 286 p.131779-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1317793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03614naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245013800170300001600308520187400324592002802198650001402226650001802240650001902258650002102277650001802298650001102316650002602327650002002353650002702373650002202400650002402422650001302446650002102459650001502480650001602495650001602511650001702527650001902544650001202563650001802575650001102593650001102604653001102615653002502626653002502651653002802676653002802704700001702732700001902749700001902768700001702787700001602804773009602820856008702916852000903003655001203012IND60649421120221119225216.0190809e20191101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064942112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.06.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yulan,10aStoichiometric analyses of soil nutrients and enzymes in a Cambisol soil treated with inorganic fertilizers or manures for 26 years  ap. 382-390.  aThe biogeochemical interactions between soil nutrients and microbial enzymes in agroecosystems remain poorly understood. The objective of this study was to determine effects of long-term (26 years) application of chemical fertilizers (NPK) or adding manure (M) on the elemental and the enzymatic functional stoichiometric characters in a brown soil. The concentrations of soil elements, i.e. carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) and the activities of soil hydrolases including α (β)‑galactosidase (α-GAL and β-GAL), α (β)‑glucosidase(α-GLU and β-GLU), urease, protease (PR), phosphomonoesterase (PM), Phosphodiesterase (PD) and arylsulfatase (AS) were investigated.Results showed that the NPK additions alone led to a decrease in soil pH and increased the acidification of the soils, while M additions could buffer the acidification. With doubling application rate of M, the concentrations of soil C, N, P and S, and soil enzymes activities increased significantly, but P concentrations increased stronger (doubled) than C and N contents (increased by 30%), leading to shifts in element stoichiometry in response to fertilizer and manure applications. The manure additions led to a relatively constant C:N ratio, a low C:P ratio and a high C:S ratio but lower functional ratios of ln (β-GLU + α-GLU + α-GAL + β-GAL): ln(urease + PR); ln(GLU + GAL): (PM + PD); and ln(GLU + GAL):ln(AS), which implied high availability of P and low availability of S. The comparison of element and enzyme stoichiometry indicated that N and S were limited in the manure plots, and C and P were limited in the NPK and No-NPK fertilizer treatment (WF) plots. The increase in enzyme activities in manure plots was caused primarily by the accumulation of soil nutrients with M treatment and not by a buffering effect on the pH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCambisols 3aacidification 3aagroecosystems 3aapplication rate 3aarylsulfatase 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aenzyme activity 3afertilizer application 3amicrobial enzymes 3amineral fertilizers 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aphosphorus 3aproteinases 3asoil carbon 3asoil enzymes 3asoil nutrients 3asoil pH 3astoichiometry 3asulfur 3aurease 0aManure 0aInorganic fertilizer 0aBalance of nutrients 0aElemental stoichiometry 0aEnzymatic stoichiometry1 aSun, Caixia,1 aChen, Zhenhua,1 aZhang, GuangNa1 aChen, Lijun,1 aWu, Zhijie,0 tGeoderma.g2019 Nov. 01, v. 353 p.382-390dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.06.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01367naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245010600166300001800272520034900290592002800639650005200667650001900719650001900738700002400757700002300781700002300804700002100827773013400848856007400982852000901056655001201065IND60741730920221119064545.0210618e20210617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074173092DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc01747k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerraz, Matheus V.

However, important questions remain regarding biodiversity offsets to such anthropogenic modifications. Generally, while formal and accurate quantifications of the residual impacts from development and the gain from offsets are essential, they are usually designated on an arbitrary score. Particularly, a general baseline with uncertainties defined across a dynamic scope has rarely been reported. In this study, a mathematical model was developed to quantify the loss from coastal land reclamation and gain from offsets. It considered the correlation between biodiversity effect size and reclamation, and the risk of failure in restoration based on the offset ratios theory, to determine the optimal amount of offsetting by calculating the biodiversity ratios between damaged and compensated habitat areas. The Yellow River Delta in China was used as a case study. Fuzzy sets or discrete intervals of references were used as the baseline. Minimum offset ratios were calculated for different baselines and values of counterfactual scenarios accounting for time lags for different types of coastal land reclamation. Therefore, no net loss was feasible when biodiversity could be compensated within the offset delay time. In this study, unlike previous methods, designation of an arbitrary score to measure the habitat or biodiversity value was avoided. Instead, this method was based on the change in biodiversity and was grounded in ecological theory. A more science-based approach is proposed, which is supported with a novel formula and existing data sets. These findings will help in the design of biodiversity offsets for coastal land reclamation based on their different impacts on biodiversity. This will inform policy makers about realistic minimal offsetting ratios or offset area requirements accounting for the offsetting delay time, the value of counterfactual scenarios, the correlation between biodiversity effect size and reclamation, the risk of failure in restoration, and the gross quantity of restoration. These results have important implications for the ecological restoration and compensation of coastal wetlands in the face of coastal land reclamation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3adata collection 3ahabitats 3aissues and policy 3aland restoration 3amathematical models 3anatural resources conservation 3arisk 3ariver deltas 3auncertainty 3awetlands 3aChina 3aYellow River 0aBiodiversity offsets 0aCoastal land reclamation 0aEcological compensation 0aMitigation 0aNo net loss 0aRestoration1 aCui, Baoshan1 aGibbons, Philip1 aYan, Jiaguo1 aMa, Xu1 aXie, Tian1 aSong, Guoxiang1 aZou, Yuxuan1 aShao, Xiaojing0 tBiological conservation.g2017 Oct., v. 214 p.35-45dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2017.07.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03961naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006700153245013900220300001600359520191800375592002802293650001602321650001302337650002002350650001802370650002302388650001802411650001502429650001802444650003802462650001702500650001102517650003102528650001902559650000902578650002002587650001102607650002002618650002102638650002102659650001802680650001402698650002502712650002802737651001302765653002002778653001802798653001002816653001502826653002002841700004002861700002202901700003002923700002202953700002302975700003402998700006303032773011903095856008803214852000903302655001203311IND60598012020221116181151.0201125e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059801202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPraveena, Sarva Mangala1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0159-439510aPharmaceuticals residues in selected tropical surface water bodies from Selangor (Malaysia): Occurrence and potential risk assessments  ap. 230-240.  aThis study investigated the occurrence of nine pharmaceuticals (amoxicillin, caffeine, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, dexamethasone, diclofenac, nitrofurazone, sulfamethoxazole, and triclosan) and to evaluate potential risks (human health and ecotoxicological) in Lui, Gombak and Selangor (Malaysia) rivers using commercial competitive Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit assays. Physicochemical properties of these rivers showed the surface samples belong to Class II of Malaysian National Water Quality Standards which requires conventional treatment before consumption. All the pharmaceuticals were detected in all three rivers except for triclosan, dexamethasone and diclofenac which were not detected in few of sampling locations in these three rivers. Highest pharmaceutical concentrations were detected in Gombak river in line of being as one of the most polluted rivers in Malaysia. Ciprofloxacin concentrations were detected in all the sampling locations with the highest at 299.88 ng/L. While triclosan, dexamethasone and diclofenac concentrations were not detected in a few of sampling locations in these three rivers. All these nine pharmaceuticals were within the levels reported previously in literature. Pharmaceutical production, wastewater treatment technologies and treated sewage effluent were found as the potential sources which can be related with pharmaceuticals occurrence in surface water samples. Potential human risk assessment showed low health risk except for ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone. Instead, ecotoxicological risk assessment indicated moderate risks were present for these rivers. Nevertheless, results confirmation using instrumental techniques is needed for higher degree of specificity. It is crucial to continuously monitor the surface water bodies for pharmaceuticals using a cost-effective prioritisation approach to assess sensitive sub-populations risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamoxicillin 3acaffeine 3achloramphenicol 3aciprofloxacin 3acost effectiveness 3adexamethasone 3adiclofenac 3aecotoxicology 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprioritization 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3asewage effluent 3asewage treatment 3asulfamethoxazole 3asurface water 3atriclosan 3awastewater treatment 3awater quality standards 3aMalaysia 0aPharmaceuticals 0aSurface water 0aELISA 0aOccurrence 0aPotential risks1 aShaifuddin, Siti Norashikin Mohamad1 aSukiman, Syazwani1 aNasir, Fauzan Adzima Mohd1 aHanafi, Zanjabila1 aKamarudin, Norizah1 aIsmail, Tengku Hanidza Tengku1 aAhmad Zaharin Aris,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4827-07500 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 642 p.230-240dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014700163300001600310520173100326592002802057650005702085650003202142650003702174650000802211650002002219650001302239650001902252700001302271700001602284700001502300773009502315856008102410852000902491655001202500IND60523837120221120201606.0160628e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052383712DNAL7 a10.1007/s12250-015-3675-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, He-Lin10aPlutella xylostella granulovirus late gene promoter activity in the context of the Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus genome  ap. 229-239.  aWithin Baculoviridae, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of replication in betabaculoviruses, despite extensive studies in alphabaculoviruses. In this study, the promoters of nine late genes of the betabaculovirus Plutella xylostella granulovirus (PlxyGV) were cloned into a transient expression vector and the alphabaculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) genome, and compared with homologous late gene promoters of AcMNPV in Sf9 cells. In transient expression assays, all PlxyGV late promoters were activated in cells transfected with the individual reporter plasmids together with an AcMNPV bacmid. In infected cells, reporter gene expression levels with the promoters of PlxyGV e18 and AcMNPV vp39 and gp41 were significantly higher than those of the corresponding AcMNPV or PlxyGV promoters, which had fewer late promoter motifs. Observed expression levels were lower for the PlxyGV p6.9, pk1, gran, p10a, and p10b promoters than for the corresponding AcMNPV promoters, despite equal numbers of late promoter motifs, indicating that species-specific elements contained in some late promoters were favored by the native viral RNA polymerases for optimal transcription. The 8-nt sequence TAAATAAG encompassing the ATAAG motif was conserved in the AcMNPV polh, p10, and pk1 promoters. The 5-nt sequence CAATT located 4 or 5 nt upstream of the T/ATAAG motif was conserved in the promoters of PlxyGV gran, p10c, and pk1. The results of this study demonstrated that PlxyGV late gene promoters could be effectively activated by the RNA polymerase from AcMNPV, implying that late gene expression systems are regulated by similar mechanisms in alphabaculoviruses and betabaculoviruses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAutographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aPlutella xylostella granulovirus 3aRNA 3agene expression 3aplasmids 3areporter genes1 aHu, Yuan1 aGuo, Ya-Jun1 aLi, Lu-Lin0 tVirologica Sinica.g2016 June, v. 31, no. 3 p.229-239dSpringer Singaporex1674-07697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12250-015-3675-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245014100168300001600309520166000325592002801985650002202013650002202035650001702057650002302074650001402097650001302111700002402124700006102148773011502209856008402324852000902408655001202417IND60769015520221122005302.0220301e20220113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076901552DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.1c006962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan, Chun Kit10aAnionic Lipids Confine Cytochrome c₂ to the Surface of Bioenergetic Membranes without Compromising Its Interaction with Redox Partners  ap. 385-397.  aCytochrome c₂ (cyt. c₂) is a major element in electron transfer between redox proteins in bioenergetic membranes. While the interaction between cyt. c₂ and anionic lipids abundant in bioenergetic membranes has been reported, their effect on the shuttling activity of cyt. c₂ remains elusive. Here, the effect of anionic lipids on the interaction and binding of cyt. c₂ to the cytochrome bc₁ complex (bc₁) is investigated using a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) and Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations. MD is used to generate thermally accessible conformations of cyt. c₂ and membrane-embedded bc₁, which were subsequently used in multireplica BD simulations of diffusion of cyt. c₂ from solution to bc₁, in the presence of various lipids. We show that, counterintuitively, anionic lipids facilitate association of cyt. c₂ with bc₁ by localizing its diffusion to the membrane surface. The observed lipid-mediated bc₁ association is further enhanced by the oxidized state of cyt. c₂, in line with its physiological function. This lipid-mediated enhancement is salinity-dependent, and anionic lipids can disrupt cyt. c₂–bc₁ interaction at nonphysiological salt levels. Our data highlight the importance of the redox state of cyt. c₂, the lipid composition of the chromatophore membrane, and the salinity of the chromatophore in regulating the efficiency of the electron shuttling process mediated by cyt. c₂. The conclusions can be extrapolated to mitochondrial systems and processes, or any bioenergetic membrane, given the structural similarity between cyt. c₂ and bc₁ and their mitochondrial counterparts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectron transfer 3alipid composition 3amitochondria 3amolecular dynamics 3aoxidation 3asalinity1 aSingharoy, Abhishek1 aTajkhorshid, Emad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8434-10100 tBiochemistry.g2022 Jan. 13, v. 61, no. 5 p.385-397dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.1c006963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245014400164300002000308520143400328592002801762650004401790650002201834650001501856650001501871650002201886650001801908650001701926650003701943650002001980650000902000650000702009650001302016650003302029650002302062650001902085650001602104650002502120650002102145650001302166700002102179700001902200773012302219856007402342852000902416655001202425IND60667536220221121062545.0190919e20150512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066753622DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra05447h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJamiu, Zakariyah A.10aSynthesis of a unique cross-linked polyzwitterion/anion with an aspartic acid residue and its use for Pb²⁺ removal from aqueous solution  ap. 42222-42232.  aIn this work, a unique cross-linked polyzwitterion/anion with an aspartic acid residue was synthesized via butler's cyclopolymerization protocol involving N,N-diallylaspartic acid hydrochloride, 1,1,4,4-tetraallylpiperazinium dichloride and sulfur dioxide in the presence of azoisobutyronitrile. The structure and morphology of the polymer were characterized by using FTIR, TGA, EDX and SEM. The adsorption performance of the resin was evaluated using lead Pb(ii) as a model. The effect of various parameters such as contact time, pH, initial concentration and temperature were investigated to arrive at optimum conditions. An optimum pH of 6.0 and dosage of 1.5 g L⁻¹ were obtained. The mechanism of adsorption was investigated using kinetic, diffusion, isotherm and thermodynamic models. The adsorption kinetic data were described well by the pseudo-second order model with R² of 0.999. The activation energy (Eₐ) of the adsorption process was calculated as 39.29 kJ mol⁻¹. The negative ΔGᵒ values indicate a spontaneous adsorption process while the negative ΔHᵒ (−43.87 kJ mol⁻¹) suggests an exothermic reaction. Adsorption data were described well by the Langmuir and Temkin models. EDX analysis confirmed the adsorption of Pb²⁺ on the polymer. The overall results suggest that the polymer could be employed as an efficient adsorbent for the adsorption of toxic Pb²⁺ from polluted aqueous solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aactivation energy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3aaspartic acid 3acrosslinking 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aheat production 3alead 3apH 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3asulfur dioxide 3atemperature 3athermodynamic models 3athermogravimetry 3atoxicity1 aSaleh, Tawfik A.1 aAli, Shaikh A.0 tRSC advances.g2015 May 12, v. 5, no. 53 p.42222-42232dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra05447h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04636naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005400153245017400207520213700381592002802518650002802546650002702574650001702601650002102618650002702639650002402666650001402690650002302704650002202727650002402749650001902773650001602792650001702808650001102825650001302836650003602849650001902885650002202904650002502926650002302951650001802974650000902992650001803001650002203019650001303041653001803054653002403072653001903096653001903115653002303134653004303157700005903200700005803259700001703317700007003334700005503404700006303459700005803522700006303580700006103643700001803704773011903722856008803841852000903929655001203938IND60755225520221122233102.0220307e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075522552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1512272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNag, Rajat1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0956-877010aQuantitative microbial risk assessment associated with ready-to-eat salads following the application of farmyard manure and slurry or anaerobic digestate to arable lands  aFarmyard manure and slurry (FYM&S) and anaerobic digestate are potentially valuable soil conditioners providing important nutrients for plant development and growth. However, these organic fertilisers may pose a microbial health risk to humans. A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) model was developed to investigate the potential human exposure to pathogens following the application of FYM&S and digestate to agricultural land. The farm-to-fork probabilistic model investigated the fate of microbial indicators (total coliforms and enterococci) and foodborne pathogens in the soil with potential contamination of ready-to-eat salads (RTEs) at the point of human consumption. The processes examined included pathogen inactivation during mesophilic anaerobic digestion (M-AD), post-AD pasteurisation, storage, dilution while spreading, decay in soil, post-harvest washing processes, and finally, the potential growth of the pathogen during refrigeration/storage at the retail level in the Irish context. The QMRA highlighted a very low annual probability of risk (Pₐₙₙᵤₐₗ) due to Clostridium perfringens, norovirus, and Salmonella Newport across all scenarios. Mycobacterium avium may result in a very high mean Pₐₙₙᵤₐₗ for the application of raw FYM&S, while Cryptosporidium parvum and pathogenic E. coli showed high Pₐₙₙᵤₐₗ, and Listeria monocytogenes displayed moderate Pₐₙₙᵤₐₗ for raw FYM&S application. The use of AD reduces this risk; however, pasteurisation reduces the Pₐₙₙᵤₐₗ to an even greater extent posing a very low risk. An overall sensitivity analysis revealed that mesophilic-AD's inactivation effect is the most sensitive parameter of the QMRA, followed by storage and the decay on the field (all negatively correlated to risk estimate). The information generated from this model can help to inform guidelines for policymakers on the maximum permissible indicator or pathogen contamination levels in the digestate. The QMRA can also provide the AD industry with a safety assessment of pathogenic organisms resulting from the digestion of FYM&S.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium perfringens 3aCryptosporidium parvum 3aEnterococcus 3aEscherichia coli 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aMycobacterium avium 3aNorovirus 3aSalmonella Newport 3aagricultural land 3aanaerobic digestion 3aanimal manures 3aenvironment 3afarm to fork 3ahumans 3aindustry 3amicrobiological risk assessment 3apasteurization 3aplant development 3aprobabilistic models 3aready-to-eat foods 3arefrigeration 3arisk 3arisk estimate 3asafety assessment 3aslurries 0aBiogas plants 0aAnaerobic digestate 0aFood pathogens 0aHuman exposure 0aReady-to-eat foods 0aQuantitative microbial risk assessment1 aRussell, Lauren1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3993-56231 aNolan, Stephen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1219-40361 aAuer, Agathe1 aMarkey, B.

The IVM resistant isolate was obtained from sheep naturally infected with H. contortus, and the susceptible isolate (with no pressure to IVM) conserved since 1990. The lethal effect of IVM was evaluated under in vitro conditions, which showed significant differences between susceptible and resistant H. contortus L₃ isolates (P < 0.01). The IVM susceptible isolate revealed a lethal effect of 79.22% at 11.42 mM, whereas that resistant isolate showed no lethal effect at any of the four assessed concentrations (1.43, 2.85, 5.71 and 11.42 mM) of IVM. The expression levels of ten Hco-pgp genes (1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 16) were evaluated in the resistant isolate of H. contortus and compared to the susceptible isolate (as control), using two constitutive genes (GAPDH and β-tubulin). Up-regulation at two statistical significant values (P ≤ 0.05, 0.1) was the criterion to associate IVM resistance with the free life and endoparasitic stages of H. contortus. The expression levels in H. contortus adult nematodes showed 5.64 to 127.56-fold increase for Hco-pgp genes 1, 9, 12, 14, and 16, followed by an increase for Hco-pgp-2 (49.75-fold) and Hco-pgp-10 (106.40-fold) in L₄, and for Hco-pgp-16 (2.90-fold) in eggs (P ≤ 0.05). In addition, high expression levels with P < 0.1 were detected in H. contortus L₃, L₄, and adults for Hco-pgp genes 1, 4, 11, 12, and 16, with changes ranging from 2.17 to 29.72-fold. In conclusion, the highest expression was observed in the adult stage of H. contortus, and the most frequent gene with a significant P-value was Hco-pgp-16, revealing it plays an important role in IVM resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aP-glycoproteins 3aadults 3acomparative study 3aendoparasites 3agenes 3aivermectin 3alarvae 3aparasitology 3asheep 0aABC 0aAH 0aAR 0aATP 0aBZ 0a°C 0acDNA 0aCO2 0aCt 0aDMSO 0aGAPDH 0aGIN 0aGluCl 0ah 0aHBSS 0aHco-pgp 0aIVM 0am 0aMDR 0amg 0aML 0amM 0aMOX 0amRNA 0aNBD 0ang 0aPBS 0aPCR 0aP-gp 0aRNA 0aRPM 0aRT-qPCR 0as 0aTRNA 0aμL 0aμm 0aμM 0aVyM 0aH. contortus 0aP-glycoprotein 0aRelative expression1 aCedillo-Borda, Marilyn1 aAlonso-Morales, Rogelio A.1 aAlonso-Díaz, Miguel A.1 aOlmedo-Juárez, Agustín1 aMendoza-de-Gives, Pedro1 aLópez-Arellano, Ma.

The throw distance of drops from an impact sprinkler were simulated with the drag coefficient dependent on drop size and velocity, and show that simulated throw distances are greater for small drops than if the velocity exponent has a typically used constant value of two. 3avelocity 3adroplets 3aequations 0adrag0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g1991 Jan., v. 7, no. 1 p.75-80x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02514naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001700141245013000158300001600288500001500304520125400319650002801573650002601601650001501627650002501642650002701667650001901694653002401713653001801737653002201755653001001777653001301787653002101800653002301821700001401844773008701858852000901945856008101954930003302035945001302068946001102081655001202092IND2063101120221120033150.0980414s1997    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206310112DNAL7 a10.1007/s0035900500782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHennig, R.M.10aFiltering of temporal parameters of the calling song by cricket females of two closely related species: a behavioral analysis  ap. 621-630.  a2019-12-04  aThe phonotactic response of cricket females was investigated on a locomotion compensator to determine the temporal parameters of the male's calling song which are important for species recognition. Two sympatric species (Teleogryllus commodus, T. oceanicus) that show different syllable periods in the chirp and trill parts of their calling songs were used. By their responses T. commodus females exhibited two temporal filters for syllable periods, which were tuned to the species-specific syllable periods occurring during chirp and trill. For song recognition both filters had to be activated and for both a minimum number of three to five consecutive syllable periods was necessary. In contrast, T. oceanicus females showed only one sharply tuned filter corresponding to the chirp part of the male's calling song. This filter was sufficient for calling song recognition. Syllable periods of the trill part also influenced calling song recognition, but these played only a minor role. Carrier frequency was also important for positive phonotaxis. Calling song recognition by T. commodus females is largely based on central nervous processing, while for T. oceanicus both peripheral frequency filtering and central temporal filtering is important. 3ainterspecific variation 3aTeleogryllus commodus 3aphonotaxis 3aanimal communication 3aTeleogryllus oceanicus 3anervous system 0aspecies differences 0asong patterns 0aneural processing 0asongs 0apatterns 0asong recognition 0ataxis (physiology)1 aWeber, T.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1997, v. 180, no. 6 p.621-630x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0035900500783Available from publisher's Web site  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle01692naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245005800125300001600183500001500199520068600214650002600900650002400926650004400950650001300994650002401007650001401031650001601045650001601061653000901077653001401086700002001100700001601120700002201136773010501158852000901263939003301272946001301305655001201318IND9205834420221120033349.0920918e199101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920583442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTimm, E.J.10aPotential methods for detecting pits in tart cherries  ap. 103-109.  a2019-12-04  aApproximately 98% of the U.S. tart cherry crop is pitted and processed into canned, frozen, and dried fruit or made into juice. U.S. Grade A pitted tart cherries are currently allowed to contain up to 1 pit per 1.1 kg (2.5 lb) of finished cherries. To minimize product liability, and maximize end-user and consumer acceptance of pitted cherries, a finished pack having not over 1 pit per 28.3 kg (62.4 lb) of cherries is desired. Potential methods for the automatic detection and rejection of unpitted cherries and loose pits were investigated.

One set was made entirely of No. 2 Dense Southern Pine, while the second set was made of No. 2 Dense Southern Pine except for the long center member which was Dense Select Structural (DSS) Southern Pine. The addition of one DSS member to the columns of the second set provided the basis for a treatment and control comparison. Twenty gage steel high-strength truss plates were installed on the outside wide faces of the butt joints. Third-point loading was applied to a 3.66 m (12 ft) test span and the specimens were loaded to failure. No differences were reported in the allowable bending stress of the two groups. Test results from comparison of control to treatment sets provided evidence of significant nail slip. Subsequent testing of nails used in the column assemblies indicated the nails had a MIBANT angle of only two degrees from the "soft" category. Additional tests were conducted on the "hardened stock" columns with nails added and a MIBANT angle of 16 degrees. These renailed columns had a bending strength equivalent to the original strength even though the reinforcing metal plates had been failed in the first test. Nail characteristics are found to be of vital importance to the performance of nail-laminated wall columns. The MIBANT test for nail quality is recommended when conducting research on nail-laminated wall columns. 3alumber 3alaminated wood 0anails 0acolumns 0aposts1 aWoeste, F.E.1 aMcLain, T.E.1 aRichardson, G.E.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g1991 Jan., v. 7, no. 1 p.113-116x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01581naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005600126300001600182500001500198520064400213650001400857650001100871650001200882650001300894650001500907650001300922650001300935650001300948650002300961653001600984653001501000653001501015700001701030773010501047852000901152939003301161946001301194655001201207IND9205835020221120025514.0920918e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920583502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhate, S.R.12aA compressed air direct injection pesticide sprayer  ap. 158-162.  a2019-12-04  aThis article describes a compressed air sprayer designed to apply desired amounts of chemical or biological pesticides to crops.

In subsequent tests they were given a choice between the trained disc and an alternative disc that differed either in its chromatic properties, or in the amount of achromatic green contrast that it produced against the background. Tests were conducted in two experimental situations: one in which discs subtended a visual angle of 30 degrees (as viewed by the bee at the decision point in the Y-maze), and another in which the angle was 6.5 degrees or 5 degrees (depending on the experiment). At the visual angle of 30 degrees the bees' choice behaviour was governed by the differences in chromatic properties, and not by the differences in the amount of green contrast. With the 6.5 degrees- and 5 degrees- discs, on the other hand, it was governed by the differences in the amount of green contrast, and not by the differences in chromatic properties. Consequently, in the present discrimination task, bees use either chromatic or achromatic cues, depending on the visual angle subtended by the stimuli at the eye. Results of a further experiment, in which the trained disc was tested against discs that produced various amounts of green contrast, confirm the above conclusion and show, in addition, that bees learn the green-contrast difference between a trained and a non-rewarded alternative. 3aApis mellifera 3avision 3alearning 0avisual stimuli 0adiscrimination 0achromatic contrast 0aachromatic contrast 0avisual angle1 aVorobyev, M.1 aBrandt, R.1 aPosner, B.1 aMenzel, R.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1997, v. 180, no. 3 p.235-243x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0035900500443Available from publisher's Web site  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02447naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003100110040001800141100002500159245009600184300001600280520094400296650002501240650002801265650002101293650001301314650001001327650002201337650001901359650001201378650001001390650002301400650001201423650002501435650001501460650002401475650002501499650004801524650005501572653002601627653001901653700001701672700001801689773008701707852000901794856008101803930003301884945001301917946001101930655001201941IND2060193420221120022143.0971020s1997    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206019342DNAL7 a90110672pmid7 a10.1007/s0035900500352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiesgo-Escovar, J.R.14aThe maxillary palp of Drosophila: ultrastructure and physiology depends on the lozenge gene  ap. 143-150.  aThe ultrastructure and physiology of the maxillary palp of Drosophila melanogaster have been studied in wild-type and lozenge mutants. Olfactory physiology in the maxillary palp is shown to depend upon the lozenge(lz) gene. Reduced response amplitudes were recorded for all odorants tested, and the physiological defect was shown to map to the lz locus. The structure of the maxillary palp sensilla is described by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at high magnification, initially in the wild-type. A linear arrangement of pores, connected by furrows, was found in one class of sensilla, the basiconic sensilla. In the lz3 mutant, morphological alterations in the basiconic sensilla and duplications of sensilla are documented by SEM. The correlation of structural abnormalities in the lz sensilla and physiological abnormalities in odorant response are consistent with an olfactory role for the basiconic sensilla of the maxillary palp. 3aabnormal development 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aolfactory organs 3asensilla 3asmell 3aelectrophysiology 3aultrastructure 3amutants 3agenes 3achromosome mapping 2aAnimals 2aDNA-Binding Proteins 2aDrosophila 2aDrosophila Proteins 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aOlfactory Bulbxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aTranscription Factorsxphysiologyxultrastructure. 0aolfactory stimulation 0alozenge mutant1 aPiekos, W.B.1 aCarlson, J.R.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1997, v. 180, no. 2 p.143-150x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0035900500353Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02559naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002000141245010400161300001400265500001500279520137500294650001901669650002001688650002301708650001201731650001101743650002301754650002201777650002101799650001401820653001601834653001901850653002001869653002801889773008501917852000902002856008102011930003302092945001302125946001102138655001202149IND2059819020221120022129.0970923s1997    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205981902DNAL7 a10.1007/s0035900500302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStevenson, P.A.10aReflex activation of locust flight motoneurones by proprioceptors responsive to muscle contractions  ap. 91-98.  a2019-12-04  aThis report investigates the reflex activation of locust flight motoneurones following their spiking activity. As shown elsewhere an electrical stimulus applied to a flight muscle produces multiple waves of delayed excitation in wing elevator and depressor motoneurones. Nerve ablation experiments show that this response is initiated by the mechanical movement of the stimulated muscle, and not the antidromic spike evoked in the motoneurone. The delayed excitation still occurs in the absence of inputs from the wing receptor systems, and also when all other sources of afferent feedback are abolished. excepting thoracic nerve 2. Following complete deafferentation, spikes in flight motoneurones had no influence on other flight motoneurones. Numerous afferents in the purely sensory nerve 2 are excited by flight muscle contractions. The responses are consistent for repeated contractions of the same muscle, but differ when other muscles are stimulated. During tethered flight, changes in the activation of single flight muscles are reflected in changes of the nerve 2 discharge pattern. Electrical stimulation of this nerve causes delayed excitation of flight motoneurones, and can initiate flight activity. It is suggested that internal proprioceptors, such as those associated with nerve 2, will contribute to shaping the final motor output for flight behaviour. 3aflight muscles 3aneurophysiology 3amuscle contraction 3aneurons 3aflight 3aLocusta migratoria 3aelectrophysiology 3aelectromyography 3areceptors 0adenervation 0anervous system 0adeafferentation 0aproprioceptive feedback0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1997, v. 180, no. 1 p.91-98x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0035900500303Available from publisher's Web site  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle01464naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007600127300001200203500001500215520073100230650002500961650001900986650001201005653001401017653001301031773008701044852000901131939003301140946001301173655001201186IND9205832820221117163542.0920918e199101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920583282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParish, R.L.10aEffect of an adjustable drop point on turf fertilizer spreader patterns  ap. 5-9.  a2019-12-04  aAdjusting the distribution pattern of a rotary spreader by moving a deflector linearly to radially move the drop point on the impeller is a new concept in commercial turf spreaders, although the concept has previously been incorporated in large agricultural spreaders. A spreader using this concept was tested extensively in the laboratory. The results showed that this method can effectively reduce pattern skewing and, thus, provide acceptable pattern uniformity at a somewhat greater swath width than can be obtained without the deflector. The spreader did not deliver a uniform pattern even with the deflector; the deflector merely eliminated skewing. The pattern was very sensitive to small changes in deflector position. 3afertilizer spreaders 3alawns and turf 3atesting 0aspreaders 0apatterns0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g1991 Jan., v. 7, no. 1 p.5-9x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01650naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245006500128300001400193520093400207650001301141650001501154650004101169650001201210700001801222773008901240852000901329939003301338946001301371655001201384IND9205833020221117163543.0920918e199101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920583302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilhoit, J.H.12aA powered cutting device for selectively harvesting broccoli  ap. 14-20.  aA pneumatically powered, manually directed cutting device for selectively harvesting broccoli has been developed and tested. In 1987 harvest tests, with the device operated on one double or one triple row of broccoli, the harvest rate was not affected by the method of operation (walking or seated) or by different constant population planting patterns, but it increased significantly with successive harvests. The overall average harvest rate with the device (11.1 heads/min) was 50% faster than the average hand harvest rate measured at two farms (7.4 heads/min). A new cutting device was tested harvesting two double rows of broccoli in one pass using the walking method in 1988. Modifications made to the cutting device substantially improved handling and leaf-stripping and contributed to a faster harvest rate early in the harvest season. The overall average harvest rate with the cutting device in 1988 was 11.4 heads/min. 3abroccoli 3aharvesting 3aagricultural machinery and equipment 3acutting1 aVaughan, D.H.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g1991 Jan., v. 7, no. 1 p.14-20x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01823naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245005700127300001400184520109600198650001701294650001101311650001501322650001101337653001001348700001501358700001601373773008901389852000901478939003301487946001301520655001201533IND9205833320221117163625.0920918e199101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920583332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTremblay, D.10aReducing forage harvester peak power with a flywheel  ap. 41-45.  aA flywheel was installed on the main axis of a cylinder type forage harvester in order to evaluate power reduction potential for silage harvesting. A three factor factorial experiment, including two theoretical lengths of cut, two types of windrow (regular and irregular density) and two flywheel settings (engaged and disengaged), was designed to evaluate the performance of the flywheel. The longer length of cut significantly reduced the average energy requirement. The flywheel did not reduce average energy requirement, but significantly reduced the ratio of peak to mean power requirement. The flywheel reduced the instantaneous peak power by 6% in irregular windrows and by 20% in regular windrows. Since these power reductions apply only to PTO power and not to tractive power, they are likely to represent momentary total power reductions in the order of 4 to 14%. The addition of a flywheel will not result in a reduction of the actual tractor size for a given throughput. However it would improve the uniformity of power demand and should increase the harvest capacity by 3 to 4%. 3aforage crops 3asilage 3aharvesters 3adesign 0apower1 aSavoie, P.1 aLe Phat, Q.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g1991 Jan., v. 7, no. 1 p.41-45x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle05169naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155072000900164072000900173100002100182245012600203300001400329500002400343500001500367520341800382650002103800650002403821650001803845650001503863650001403878650001603892650001203908650001903920650001703939650002103956650001103977650002003988650002304008650002804031650002504059650001104084650001904095650001404114650002004128651001104148653001804159653002404177700001604201700001904217700001704236700002404253773010204277852000904379856008604388930003304474945002504507946001104532655001204543IND4418979820221123025413.0090410e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441897982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2008.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aB200 0aX150 0aJ7101 aDíaz-Solís, H.10aAdaptive management of stocking rates to reduce effects of drought on cow-calf production systems in semi-arid rangelands  ap. 43-50.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe used simple ecological sustainability simulator (SESS) [Díaz-Solís, H., Kothmann, M.M., Hamilton, W.T., Grant, W.E., 2003. A simple ecological sustainability simulator (SESS) for stocking rate management on semi-arid grazinglands. Agric. Syst. 76, 655-680. <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2005.07.008>], modified to represent each of five management strategies (sets of decision rules) for adjusting stocking rates, to identify strategies that could reduce effects of drought on cow-calf production systems in semi-arid rangelands. We parameterized the model to represent a region of extensive cow-calf production in the northeastern portion of the Mexican state of Coahuila, and evaluated animal performance (animal body condition, cow mortality, and calf production) and range condition resulting from each strategy under random precipitation conditions typical of the region. To evaluate the validity of the randomly generated precipitation, we conducted the simulations under an historical (1950-1994) precipitation regime. The five management strategies included one with no adjustments to stocking rate (CONTROL, most common current practice), one with stocking rate adjustment rules based on changes in animal body condition (BCS), and three with different stocking rate adjustment rules based on various comparisons of recent-year precipitation with long-term mean precipitation during the growing season (March-November) (REPLA, PPT 1Y, PPT 2Y). Each strategy was evaluated at each of three initial base-level stock cow stocking rates (125, 250 and 500 AUY·5000ha⁻¹). Stocking rate adjustments consisted of partial or total de-stocking, with the re-establishment, or not, of the initial number of stock cows before the beginning of the subsequent breeding season. Results of 45-year simulations under both random and historical precipitation suggest CONTROL and PPT 2Y (based on comparison of current year and previous year precipitation with the long-term mean) strategies, combined with the high base-level stocking rate, are the worst and best, respectively. Under the historical precipitation regime, in the last period of time simulated (1980-1994) these two strategies resulted, respectively, in poor (0.5) versus good range condition (1.0), animal body condition scores of 2.6 versus 5.2, annual cow mortalities of 76 versus 5%, and calf production rates of 0.9 versus 10.6kgha⁻¹ year⁻¹ at weaning. The PPT 1Y strategy (based on comparison of current year precipitation with the long-term mean) produced results fairly similar to PPT 2Y, with BCS and REPLA strategies producing results intermediate between CONTROL and PPT 2Y. Our results suggest it is advantageous to adjust stocking rates based on precipitation during the current growing season since it improves cattle production without damaging range condition. Considering the practical feasibility of the strategies, we recommend the PPT 1Y strategy because it maintains range condition at moderate stocking rates, results in good animal performance and does not require total de-stocking of the ranch. The simple method we developed to stochastically generate monthly precipitation produces a time series of precipitation values that were representative of general historical precipitation patterns and provided realistic levels of uncertainty in simulated forage production to evaluate alternative management strategies. 3arange management 3acow-calf operations 3astocking rate 3arangelands 3afecundity 3abeef cattle 3adrought 3asemiarid zones 3awater stress 3amodel validation 3aforage 3abreeding season 3agrazing management 3asustainable agriculture 3aenvironmental impact 3acalves 3abody condition 3amortality 3adecision making 3aMexico 0aprecipitation 0aadaptive management1 aGrant, W.E.1 aKothmann, M.M.1 aTeague, W.R.1 aDíaz-García, J.A.0 tAgricultural systems.g2009 Apr., v. 100, no. 1-3 p.43-50dElsevier Science Ltd.x0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2008.12.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/07/30  aNon-US 7aarticle03112naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001500142245012200157300001800279520189900297650002202196650001602218650001802234650000902252650001902261650001302280650001602293650001202309650001402321650001002335650001202345650001002357650001402367650001402381650001702395700002902412700001302441773008902454852000902543856008202552939003302634946001102667655001202678IND4464064520221123025538.0120910e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446406452DNAL7 a10.5713/ajas.2003.17892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErener, G.10aGrowth and Laying Performance of Japanese Quail Fed Graded Levels of Hazelnut Kernel Oil Meal Incorporated into Diets  ap. 1789-1794.  aTwo experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of substituting different levels of hazelnut kernel oil meal (HKOM) for dehulled soyabean meal (DSBM) in diets for Japanese quail. Five diets in which HKOM was replaced with 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% of DSBM protein in a growing diet for a 5 week period using 450 Japanese quails of initial age of 1 week and in a layer diet for a 112 days period using 180 Japanese laying quails of initial age of 7 week were examined in experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Hence, treatment groups were: control (0 HKOM), 0.25 HKOM, 0.50 HKOM, 0.75 HKOM and 1HKOM. In the experiment 1, 1 HKOM decreased BWG compared with the 0 HKOM and 0.25 HKOM, while it increased FCR compared with the 0HKOM at day 21 (p<0.05). Compared with the other groups, 0.75 HKOM and 1 HKOM decreased BWG (p<0.01) at day 28. While the FCR of 1 HKOM was higher (p<0.01) than that of 0 HKOM, 0.25 HKOM and 0.50 HKOM, respectively, that of 0.75 HKOM was higher than that of 0 HKOM and 0.25 HKOM diets at day 28. However, at day 42 of age, BWG, FCR and the feed intake (FI) were not affected (p>0.05) by inclusion of HKOM. Mortality rate, carcase yield and liver, heart and gizzard weight (% of body weight) were not affected (p>0.05) by inclusion of HKOM to the diet. In the experiment 2, egg production was decreased (p<0.05) by the 1 HKOM diet compared with the 0.50 HKOM diet. While FCR increased by the 1 HKOM diet compared with the 0.25 HKOM and 0.50 HKOM diets (p<0.05). Feed intake for quails fed with the 0 HKOM diet was higher (p<0.05) than for quails fed with 0.50 HKOM diet. The egg yolk weight for 0 HKOM diet group was lower (p<0.05) than for quails in 1 HKOM diet group. In conclusion, the results indicate that DSBM can be replaced by HKOM in diets for growing and laying Japanese quails. However 50% HKOM has higher laying performance than 100% HKOM in the laying period. 3aCoturnix japonica 3abody weight 3acarcass yield 3adiet 3aegg production 3aegg yolk 3afeed intake 3agizzard 3ahazelnuts 3aheart 3ahulling 3aliver 3amortality 3aseed oils 3asoybean meal1 aÖzer, A.

Viral RNA was detected by in situ hybridization, and five viral proteins were localized using immunohistochemical staining in leaf sections. Initial systemic infection foci were found at the vicinity of major and minor veins. In these infection foci, the viral coat protein, cylindrical inclusion protein, and helper component-proteinase colocalized with viral RNA in parenchyma and mesophyll cells, but none of these were detected in companion cells (CC). In contrast, VPg, which is the N-proximal half of the NIa protein (separated from the C-terminal proteinase domain, NIapro, by an autocatalytic cleavage) and acts as a viral genome-linked protein, was detected in CC in the infection foci, but only at an early stage of virus unloading. Outside the infection foci, conspicuous signals for VPg were readily and exclusively detected in CC of many veins in all vein classes in the absence of signals for NIapro, other viral proteins, and viral RNA. Taken together, our data indicate that both major and minor veins may unload PVA in the sink leaves of potato. The data suggest that VPg is translocated from inoculated source leaves to the sink leaves, where it accumulates in CC at an early stage of systemic infection. These findings suggest that VPg may be a ‘phloem protein’ that specifically acts in CC in the sink leaves to facilitate virus unloading. 3acoat proteins 3ain situ hybridization 3aSolanum commersonii 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aproteinases 3amesophyll 3aphloem 3apotatoes 3aleaves 3aviruses 3aRNA 3aPotato virus A 2aCapsid Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aPlant Leavesxcytologyxgeneticsxvirology. 2aPlant Virusesxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPotyvirusxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aRNA, Viralxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSolanum tuberosumxchemistryxgeneticsxvirology. 2aViral Core Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aViral Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aparenchyma1 aValkonen, Jari P.T.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2003 Jan., v. 16, no. 1 p.25-34dAPS Pressx0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.1.253Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03546naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001600142245010000158300001800258520230600276650001602582650001902598650001402617650001802631650002302649650001802672650001002690650001402700650000902714650001302723650002002736650001802756650002002774650001902794650001802813651001002831700001602841700001902857773008902876852000902965856008202974939003303056946001103089655001203100IND4464067320221123013555.0120911e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446406732DNAL7 a10.5713/ajas.2003.14752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalabro, S.10aEvaluation of Diet for Buffalo Dairy Cows Using the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System  ap. 1475-1481.  aThe aim of this paper was to use the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS), that reports diet energy and protein value and animal requirements, as net energy for lactation (NEl) and metabolizable protein (MP) respectively, to evaluate some rations for lactating Italian Mediterranean buffaloes. The investigation was carried out on six farms in the province of Caserta (southern Italy), where the milk production was controlled four times monthly on 10 animals (changing every time) chosen at different lactation days (5 categories): <2 months (A), 2-4 months (B), 4-6 months (C), 6-8 months (D), >8 months (E). Milk fat and protein were determined. Diet NEl and MP were estimated with the CPM-Dairy program (1998) using diet component chemical characteristics; then energy and protein intakes were estimated. NEl and MP requirements were estimated with two methods: 1) using CPM-Dairy that considers produced milk, fat and protein content, lactation phase and body condition score as main factors; 2) by applying the theory that to produce 1 kg of energy corrected milk, the buffalo needs 3.56 MJ of NEl and the efficiency to convert the absorbed aminoacids into milk protein is lower than cow (CNCPS). As regards energy, with method 1 the requirements were satisfactory starting from category A (4 out of 6 farms) and category B (5/6 farms); however, a surplus resulted for category E (5/6 farms). With method 2 a deficit in category A (5/6 farms) and B (3/6 farms) was observed, while the energy requirements were satisfied for all categories except E, where on only one buffalo farm had a surplus of energy intake. As regards protein, with method 1 the requirements were substantially satisfied for all the categories except E (3/6 farms); with method 2 the MP trend was much less favourable than with method 1. Indeed, a protein deficit was observed for all animals in categories A and B (5/6 farms). Moreover, on one farm the protein intake never satisfied animal requirements. In our experimental conditions, the use of the CNCPS to characterise diets for lactating buffalo and to calculate their requirements led to satisfactory results. By contrast, we cannot say the same for method 2, which applies a lower use efficiency of NE and MP for lactation in buffalo compared to cow. 3aamino acids 3abody condition 3abuffaloes 3acarbohydrates 3adigestible protein 3aenergy intake 3afarms 3alactation 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amilk production 3amilk proteins 3aprotein content 3aprotein intake 3aprotein value 3aItaly1 aPiccolo, V.1 aInfascelli, F.0 pAsian-Australas. j. anim. scig2003 Oct., v. 16, no. 10 p.1475-1481x1011-23677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5713/ajas.2003.14753Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120911  aNon-US 7aarticle02956naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182072000900191100001600200245010600216300001600322500002400338520137700362650000901739650002601748650002301774650002101797650001501818650002001833650002601853650001201879650001601891650001401907650002301921650001401944650001901958650002001977650001701997650001902014650002402033650002702057651001202084700001802096700002202114773009102136852000902227856008502236930003302321945002502354946001102379655001202390IND4434428120221123013501.0100323e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443442812DNAL7 a224438712pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311099911702doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL200 0aL600 0aS1001 aKoivula, M.10aGenetic and phenotypic parameters of age at first mating, litter size and animal size in Finnish mink  ap. 183-188.  aIncludes references  aMink skin size in Finland, as well as in other countries, has increased considerably during last decade. However, there are signs that selection for large body size has a negative impact on litter size (LS) and also for survival of kits. Therefore, it is important to study the genetic relationships among fertility traits and animal size (AS). The variance components for age at first mating (AFM) and first three parity LS and AS were estimated using multi-trait restricted maximum likelihood animal model. Data included 82 945 animals born during 1990 to 2004, originating from nine farms. Heritability estimates for the fertility traits were from 0.10 to 0.15. For AS, heritability was estimated to be 0.18. Genetic correlation between AS and all fertility traits was estimated to be negative (varying from −0.004 to −0.38). It is important to recognize this antagonistic relationship and include the reproductive traits into breeding goals to maintain good reproductive performance when selecting for increased body size and hence larger pelts in fur animals. Genetic correlations between the traits should be accounted in breeding value evaluations by using a multi-trait model. Including AFM into breeding value estimation would also improve the accuracy of breeding value estimation for fertility, because females missing the first LS still have record on AFM. 3amink 3afarmed animal species 3aanimal performance 3afemale fertility 3aanimal age 3asexual maturity 3aparity (reproduction) 3aprogeny 3alitter size 3aviability 3aselection criteria 3abody size 3afurs and pelts 3arisk assessment 3aheritability 3abreeding value 3agenetic correlation 3aphenotypic correlation 3aFinland1 aStrandén, I.1 aMäntysaari, E.A.0 tAnimal.g2010 Feb., v. 4, no. 2 p.183-188dCambridge University Pressx1751-73117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311099911703Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/04/29  aNon-US 7aarticle03445naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245008800181300001400269500002400283520175400307650002502061650002902086650000802115650001402123650001602137650001002153650002302163650001702186650001202203650001302215650002202228650002702250650001402277650003702291650006202328650002502390650002402415650003802439650003302477650003302510650004402543650003102587650004202618700001802660700002202678773012102700852000902821856008502830655001202915IND4477681220221123013543.0140228s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447768122DNAL7 a125802802pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.1.352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Weichang10aDifferential Induction of Symptoms in Arabidopsis by P6 of Cauliflower mosaic virus  ap. 35-42.  aIncludes references  aThe gene VI protein (P6) of Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) functions as a virulence factor in crucifers by eliciting chlorotic symptoms in infected plants. The ability to induce chlorosis has been associated previously with P6 through gene-swapping experiments between strains and through the development of transgenic plants that express P6. The primary role that has been identified for P6 in the CaMV infection cycle is to modify the host translation machinery to facilitate the translation of the polycistronic CaMV 35S RNA. This function for P6 has been designated as the translational transactivator (TAV) function. In the present study, we have characterized an unusual variant of P6, derived from CaMV strain D4, that does not induce chlorosis upon transformation into Arabidopsis thaliana. The level of D4 P6 produced in transgenic Arabidopsis line D4-2 was comparable to the amount found in transgenic plants homozygous for W260 and CM1841 P6, two versions of P6 that induce strong chlorotic symptoms and stunting in Arabidopsis. A complementation assay proved that P6 expressed in the D4-2 line was functional, as it could support the systemic infection of a CM1841 mutant that contained a lethal frame-shift mutation within gene VI. This complementation assay allowed us to separately assess the contribution of CM1841 gene VI to symptom development versus the contribution of other CM1841 genes. Furthermore, a previous study had shown that the TAV activity of D4 P6 was comparable to that of W260 P6. That comparative analysis of TAV function, coupled with the characterization of the D4-2 transgenic line in the present paper, indicates that the TAV function of P6 may play only a minor role in the development of chlorotic symptoms. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aCauliflower mosaic virus 3aRNA 3achlorosis 3acorrelation 3agenes 3agrowth retardation 3ahomozygosity 3amutants 3amutation 3atransgenic plants 3atranslation (genetics) 3avirulence 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxvirology. 2aCaulimovirusxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aDNA, Viralxgenetics 2aFrameshift Mutation 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aTrans-Activatorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscriptional Activation 2aViral Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aMurfett, Jane1 aSchoelz, James E.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2003 Jan., v. 16, no. 1 p.35-42dAPS PresswJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.1.353Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03240naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001500142245014400157300001800301520192400319650002302243650001702266650001102283650001802294650001402312650001502326650001802341650000902359650001802368650002202386650001102408650001102419650002502430650001902455650001402474650001502488650000902503700001702512700001402529773010402543852000902647856008202656939003302738946001102771655001202782IND4464066920221123003956.0120911e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446406692DNAL7 a10.5713/ajas.2003.14552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabu, L.K.10aEffect of Individual versus Group Rearing and Feeding of Different Levels of Milk and Skim Milk on Nutrient Utilization in Crossbred Calves  ap. 1455-1459.  aA 2x3 factorial design was used to study the impact of rearing systems, individual (I) vs. group (G) and different levels of milk/skim milk feeding (three schedules, F1, F2 and F3) on performance of crossbred (Bos indicus x Bos taurus) calves. Six calves (three from each sex) were taken in each group on the basis of their birth weight. All the calves were fed colostrum for three days and thereafter, were allotted to three different milk feeding schedules (F), i.e. milk fed upto 8 weeks of age (F1), milk upto 4 weeks followed by 50% (F2) and 100% (F3) replacement of milk with skim milk in the next 4 weeks. Calf starter and cereal green fodder were fed ad libitum to all the calves beginning from second week of age. A digestibility trial was conducted at 15th week of age to assess nutrient utilization during postweaning period. The digestibilty of dry matter (DM), organic matter, total carbohydrate, ether extract and crude protein (CP) were nonsignificant between the rearing systems and the feeding schedules. There was significantly higher digestibility of NDF and ADF in G than I and in F3 than F1 and F2. The concentration CP and total digestible nutrients of the diet ranged from 17.18 to 17.75% and 66.32 to 70.14%, respectively. The DM intake (kg/100 kg body weight) ranged from 1.74 to 2.14 kg during 0 to 8 weeks and 3.19 to 3.41 kg during 0 to 14 weeks of age. The effects during postweaning phase (9-14 weeks of age) showed increased performance in group housed calves compared to individually housed ones with a superior average daily gain (590 vs. 443 g) and dry matter intake (1.79 vs. 1.64 kg). Above all, replacement of milk with skim milk at 50% level after 4th week followed by complete removal after 6th week of age (F2) seemed to suit better in coping with immediate energy starvation due to sole feeding of skim milk (F3) and they performed the best under group housed system of rearing. 3aaverage daily gain 3abirth weight 3acalves 3acarbohydrates 3acolostrum 3acrossbreds 3acrude protein 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adry matter intake 3aenergy 3aforage 3anutrient utilization 3aorganic matter 3askim milk 3astarvation 3azebu1 aPandey, H.N.1 aSahoo, A.0 pAsian-Australas. j. anim. scig2003 Oct., v. 16, no. 10 p.1455-1459wJournal:18450x1011-23677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5713/ajas.2003.14553Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120911  aNon-US 7aarticle03601naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100002000163245010000183300001300283500002400296500001500320520147500335650001401810650003001824650002601854650002001880650002701900650001601927650001401943650001301957650002901970650001001999650001002009650001702019650001302036650001402049650002802063650002002091650006302111650003002174650002302204650004102227650003702268650003002305650003702335650003502372650002702407650005802434650002902492650003102521650002302552650002302575650005902598653001602657653001602673700001802689700001902707773012002726852000902846856008402855655001202939IND4477680920221123003814.0140228s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447768092DNAL7 a125802772pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.1.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamoun, Sophien10aAgrosuppression: A Bioassay for the Hypersensitive Response Suited to High-Throughput Screening  ap. 7-13.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aWe describe a novel method, agrosuppression, that addresses the need for an assay of the hypersensitive response (HR) in intact plants that is rapid and adapted to high-throughput functional screening of plant and pathogen genes. The agrosuppression assay is based on inoculation of intact plants with a mixture of Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains carrying (i) a binary plasmid with one or more candidate HR-inducing genes and (ii) a tumor-inducing (oncogenic) T-DNA. In the absence of HR induction, tumor formation is initiated, resulting in a typical crown gall phenotype. However, upon induction of the HR, tumor formation by the oncogenic T-DNA is suppressed, resulting in a phenotype that can be readily scored. We tested and optimized agrosuppression in Nicotiana benthamiana using the inf1 elicitin gene from the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans, which specifically induces the HR in Nicotiana spp., and the gene-for-gene pair Avr9/Cf-9 from the fungal pathogen Cladosporium fulvum and Lycopersicon pimpinellifolium (currant tomato), respectively. Agrosuppression protocols that can be rapidly performed using simple mechanical wounding of petioles of intact N. benthamiana plants were developed and appeared particularly adapted to intensive high-throughput screening. This assay promises to greatly facilitate the cloning of novel plant R genes and pathogen Avr genes and to accelerate functional analyses and structure-function studies of these genes. 3aphenotype 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aplant pathogens 3aPhytophthora infestans 3acrown galls 3abioassays 3aplasmids 3aSolanum pimpinellifolium 3afungi 3agenes 3atransfer DNA 3apetioles 3ascreening 3ahypersensitive response 3aPassalora fulva 2aAgrobacterium tumefaciensxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aBiological Assayxmethods 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Plantxchemistryxgenetics. 2aFungal Proteinsxgenetics 2aMembrane Glycoproteinsxgenetics 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aPhytophthoraxgenetics 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxmicrobiologyxultrastructure. 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPlant Tumorsxmicrobiology 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aStress, Mechanical 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aHamada, Walid1 aHuitema, Edgar0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2003 Jan., v. 16, no. 1 p.7-13dAPS PresswJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.1.73Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02348naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245013300127300001600260520128100276650000901557650002201566650001401588650001801602650001401620650001701634650002301651650002001674650001201694650001801706700001501724700001501739700001401754773008601768852000901854856006701863939003301930946001101963655001201974IND60343895720221122225700.0140708e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034389572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoon, S.S.14aThe effect of tumbling time on the quality and binding ability of restructured beef M. pectoralis profundus with alginate binder  ap. 418-423.  aMeats with alginate binders including sodium alginate, glucono-delta-lactone and calcium carbonate were tested in restructured steaks made from M. pectoralis profundus of beef steers in terms of meat quality and binding ability by tumbling time. The treatment with 25 min tumbling time was significantly lower (p<0.05) for crude protein than 5 and 15 min, while higher (p<0.05) for moisture content. This corresponded with sensory panel juiciness ratings, which showed the treatment for longer tumbling times to be significantly juicier (p<0.05) than that for a shorter time. Cooking loss decreased (p<0.05) linearly with an increased tumbling time, and Kramer shear force also significant decreased (p<0.05) with tumbling time. This corresponded with sensory panel tenderness ratings, which showed that the treatment for longer tumbling times was more tender (p<0.05). The texture results indicated that longer tumbling time had lower (p<0.05) hardness and chewiness values. Sensory panels ranked binding ability in the order 5 min, 15 min and 25 min from best to worst, and the overall acceptability for slices from roasts of treatments for 5 and 15 min were rated by the sensory panelists as moderate to very acceptable, but those for 25 min were rated as fair to moderate. 3abeef 3acalcium carbonate 3achewiness 3acrude protein 3ajuiciness 3ameat quality 3asensory evaluation 3asodium alginate 3atexture 3awater content1 aYang, H.S.1 aPark, G.B.1 aJoo, S.T.0 pAsian-Australas. j. anim. scig2007 Mar., v. 20, no. 3 p.418-423x1011-23677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.ajas.info/articles/archive.php3electronic resource  a00000000b00000000c20140710  aNon-US 7aarticle03681naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100001800182245006200200300001600262500005300278500002400331500001500355520200400370650002302374650001102397650002702408650001302435650001702448650002002465650002802485650001502513650001302528650002502541650002202566650001402588650001302602650001502615650003502630650002402665650001302689650002302702650001902725653002302744653002202767653002202789653002602811773009102837852000902928856008502937930003303022945002503055946001103080655001203091IND4434428520221122225813.0100323e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443442852DNAL7 a224438682pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311099913522doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aX1001 aCalus, M.P.L.10aGenomic breeding value prediction: methods and procedures  ap. 157-164.  aPaper presented at the EAAP Annual Meeting 2008.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAnimal breeding faces one of the most significant changes of the past decades – the implementation of genomic selection. Genomic selection uses dense marker maps to predict the breeding value of animals with reported accuracies that are up to 0.31 higher than those of pedigree indexes, without the need to phenotype the animals themselves, or close relatives thereof. The basic principle is that because of the high marker density, each quantitative trait loci (QTL) is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with at least one nearby marker. The process involves putting a reference population together of animals with known phenotypes and genotypes to estimate the marker effects. Marker effects have been estimated with several different methods that generally aim at reducing the dimensions of the marker data. Nearly all reported models only included additive effects. Once the marker effects are estimated, breeding values of young selection candidates can be predicted with reported accuracies up to 0.85. Although results from simulation studies suggest that different models may yield more accurate genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) for different traits, depending on the underlying QTL distribution of the trait, there is so far only little evidence from studies based on real data to support this. The accuracy of genomic predictions strongly depends on characteristics of the reference populations, such as number of animals, number of markers, and the heritability of the recorded phenotype. Another important factor is the relationship between animals in the reference population and the evaluated animals. The breakup of LD between markers and QTL across generations advocates frequent re-estimation of marker effects to maintain the accuracy of GEBVs at an acceptable level. Therefore, at low frequencies of re-estimating marker effects, it becomes more important that the model that estimates the marker effects capitalizes on LD information that is persistent across generations. 3aselection response 3agenome 3alinkage disequilibrium 3avalidity 3aheritability 3agenetic markers 3aquantitative trait loci 3aestimation 3agenotype 3aprobabilistic models 3asimulation models 3alivestock 3aaccuracy 3aprediction 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aquantitative traits 3agenomics 3aselection criteria 3abreeding value 0aliterature reviews 0agenomic selection 0aselection methods 0aquantitative genetics0 tAnimal.g2010 Feb., v. 4, no. 2 p.157-164dCambridge University Pressx1751-73117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311099913523Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/04/29  aNon-US 7aarticle03629naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002100141245013100162300001600293520214600309650001302455650001102468650001602479650001802495650000902513650002502522650001802547650002202565650001202587650002802599650001202627650002302639650001602662650001002678650001602688650001902704650001702723650001102740650001202751650001802763700002102781700001802802773008602820852000902906856008102915856008302996939003303079946001103112655001203123IND4482868520221122225635.0140708e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448286852DNAL7 a10.5713/ajas.2007.3852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujita, Tadahisa10aEffects of dietary starch and sucrose on tissue responsiveness and sensitivity to insulin in goats fed a high-concentrate diet  ap. 385-392.  aA glucose clamp technique was used to compare dietary starch (ST), starch plus sucrose (ST+SU) and sucrose (SU) with regard to the effect on tissue responsiveness and sensitivity to insulin in intact adult male goats. The goats were fed diets containing 1.2 times of ME and CP for maintenance requirements twice daily for 21 d. Of the energy intake, 30% was offered with ST, ST+SU or SU for the respective diets, and 70% as alfalfa hay, ground corn and ground soybean meal at the respective weight ratio of 1, 1, and 0.3 for all diets. Tissue responsiveness and sensitivity to insulin were evaluated using a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp technique with four levels of insulin infusion beyond 13 h after feeding. The concentrations of plasma metabolites and insulin were also determined at 3, 6 and 13 h after feeding to evaluate the effects of different carbohydrates on metabolic states in the body. Plasma glucose concentration was higher (p = 0.01) for SU diet than for ST and ST+SU diets. Increasing SU intake decreased (p<0.01) plasma acetate concentration across the time. At 3 h but not 6 and 13 h after feeding, high lactate (p = 0.01), and non-significant high propionate (p = 0.14) and low urea nitrogen (p = 0.19) concentrations were observed in plasma on SU compared with ST and ST+SU diets. Plasma insulin concentration was not different (p = 0.44) between ST and SU fed animals. In the glucose clamp experiment, considering the effects on the maximal glucose infusion rate (tissue responsiveness to insulin, p = 0.54) and the plasma insulin concentration at half-maximal glucose infusion rate (insulin sensitivity, p = 0.54), SU was not different from ST. It is concluded that SU may not be greatly different from ST with regard to the effect on tissue responsiveness and sensitivity to insulin in adult goats when fed twice daily as part of a high-concentrate diet. The possible greater effects of SU on plasma metabolites concentrations at 3 h than at 6 and 13 h after feeding suggest that a lack of persistency of SU effects during the postfeeding period may be associated with the poor response to SU in insulin action. 3aacetates 3aadults 3aalfalfa hay 3ablood glucose 3acorn 3adietary carbohydrate 3aenergy intake 3afeed concentrates 3aglucose 3aglucose clamp technique 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3alactic acid 3amales 3ametabolites 3apropionic acid 3asoybean meal 3astarch 3asucrose 3aurea nitrogen1 aKajita, Masahiro1 aSano, Hiroaki0 pAsian-Australas. j. anim. scig2007 Mar., v. 20, no. 3 p.385-392x1011-23677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5713/ajas.2007.3853Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.ajas.info/articles/archive.php3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140715  aNon-US 7aarticle01534naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245010900132300001600241520063400257650001800891650001900909650001200928650001300940653001600953653001900969653002300988653003001011700002201041773007901063852000901142930003301151945001301184946001101197655001201208IND2327698520221122225801.0020625e200111  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232769852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, L.H.M. de.10aPhase equilibrium and protein partitioning in aqueous mixtures of maltodextrin with polypropylene glycol  ap. 267-274.  aEquilibrium data were obtained for polypropylene glycol, PPG (400 and 3500)/maltodextrin, MD (1000 and 2000) aqueous two-phase systems at 25 degrees C.

Batsch) production in France. Six indicators were used: gross yield (Yield), percentage of fruit size above or equal to grade A (GradesA), fresh marketable yield in GradesA (MYieldA), total working time (Hours in hha⁻¹), total working time per gross yield (HoursYield) and total working time per fresh marketable yield in GradesA (HoursMYieldA). The database contained 24,737 year-plots over the period 2000-2005, representing nearly 30% of the French peach-nectarine production. References based on the median and the 20th and 80th percentiles were developed for ~100 of the most commonly-grown cultivars and presented for yellow-fleshed peach cultivars. The growers who recorded their data in the EFI database were then able to carry out an assessment of each plot in their orchards by comparison with the reference values of the six indicators. The analyse of EFI database on the country scale showed that the maturity period was the main factor which strongly affected agronomic performances and labour efficiency ratios, but not total working times. Nectarine genetic traits reduced only fruit size. Working times for the main manual operations were very significantly affected by region factor partly because orchard height differed according to regions. Tree height strongly influenced the performances. Low trees decreased yield (-4.9Mgha⁻¹) and high trees increased total working time about 190hha⁻¹ compared to mid-high trees. The use of the EFI information system by the growers is discussed in relation with the participatory process in which technical advisers make it possible to build a tool to support the decision-making process in accordance with users' expectations. 3aPrunus persica 3apeaches 3anectarines 3afruit crops 3acrop yield 3afarm labor 3acrop management 3adata analysis 3aInternet 3adiameter 3afruit quality 3atemporal variation 3aorchards 3adatabases 3agenetic variation 3ageographical variation 3aheight 3adecision making 3aFrance 0alabor efficiency1 aGiauque, Pierre1 aNavarro, Eric1 aMillan, Muriel1 aHilaire, Christian1 aHostalnou, Eric1 aLyoussoufi, Abder1 aSamie, Jean-François0 tAgricultural systems.g2009 Apr., v. 100, no. 1-3 p.1-10dElsevier Science Ltd.x0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2008.11.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/07/30  aNon-US 7aarticle01452naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002100115245009300136300001600229300002400245520056300269650002400832650001100856650001500867650001100882650002000893650002300913653001900936700001700955773009300972852000901065939003301074945000801107946001101115655001201126991609118700742620221122213026.0850717e198311  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850074642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevi, P.

Maximum destruction of lysine and tryptophan occurred in deep fat frying (35 and 22%, respectively), while open baking produced the least destruction (10 and 9%, respectively). Longer cooking time, higher cooking temperature, and higher relative levels of reducing sugars accelerated the destruction of both amino acids.

Of 20 vegetables examined, brinjal was found to be the most popular vegetable (especially in the East and South) while the potato was the second most popular (especially in the East and North). Total mean vegetable consumption was 350 g/day (compared to the recommended level of 235 g/day), and was the same for vegetarians and non-vegetarians, alike. People of north Indian origin consume more potatoes, brinjal, and cabbage than people of other regions. No difference was found in the consumption of onion, tomato, brinjal, or cabbage by people of different earning capacities (6 income groups examined), but the total consumption of all other vegetables was greater by the higher income groups.

This study was performed to analyze the effects of the diets containing cloned-cattle (Korean native beef, Hanwoo) meat on the reproductive physiology in rats. The male and female rats were fed with the diets containing 5% or 10% of normal- (N-5 or N-10) or cloned- (C-5 or C-10) cattle meat during test periods. The rats fed with commercial pellets were used as control. Lower food consumption in normal- and cloned-cattle meat diet groups is detected in both male and female rats compared with that of control (P < 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001). No signs of cloned-cattle meat diets on male reproductive parameters are found in all groups, except for lower sperm deformity in C-5 group (P < 0.05) and higher testosterone concentration in C-10 group (P < 0.05), respectively. There are no significant test substance-related differences of Caesarean section and delivery in dams and external examination and physiological development test in neonate compared with control and normal meat groups. Based on these results, it can be postulated that there are no obvious negative effects on the reproductive physiology in rats fed with cloned-cattle meat diets compared to their comparators. 3ahuman reproduction 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahormone secretion 3ano observed adverse effect level 3abeef cattle 3asomatic cells 3aclones 3anuclear transplantation 3arisk assessment 3afemale fertility 3abeef 3aanimal models 3amale fertility 3arats 3atoxicity testing 3aspermatozoa 3afood safety 3atestosterone 0asomatic cell nuclear transfer 0atoxicity1 aLee, N.J.1 aHwang, J.S.1 aYang, B.C.1 aIm, G.S.1 aKo, Y.G.1 aPark, E.W.1 aPark, S.B.1 aKang, J.K.1 aSeong, H.H.0 tAnimal.g2010 Feb., v. 4, no. 2 p.218-223dCambridge University Pressx1751-73117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311099909663Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/04/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02918naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002800165245012500193300001600318500002400334500001500358520110400373650001301477650001701490650003701507650001101544650002201555650001401577650001201591650002901603650002201632650001601654650001401670650001001684650004301694650004401737650003101781650005001812650001301862650003801875650004401913650004101957653002401998700001802022700002102040700001702061700001602078700002102094700002002115773012202135852000902257856008602266655001202352IND4477900720221122152916.0140303s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447790072DNAL7 a127445082pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.5.3822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavid-Schwartz, Rakefet10aIsolation of a Premycorrhizal Infection (pmi2) Mutant of Tomato, Resistant to Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungal Colonization  ap. 382-388.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aArbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) represent an ancient symbiosis between mycorrhizal fungi and plant roots which co-evolved to exhibit a finely tuned, multistage interaction that assists plant growth. Direct screening efforts for Myc¯ plant mutants resulted in the identification of a tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L. cv. Micro-Tom) mutant, M20, which was impaired in its ability to support the premycorrhizal infection (pmi) stages. The Myc¯ phenotype of the M20 mutant was a single Mendelian recessive trait, stable for nine generations, and nonallelic to a previously identified M161 pmi mutant. The M20 mutant was resistant to infection by isolated AM spores and colonized roots. Formation of Glomus intraradices appressoria on M20 roots was normal, as on wild-type (WT) plants, but in significantly reduced numbers. A significant reduction in spore germination was observed in vitro in the presence of M20 exudates relative to WT. Our results indicate that this new mutant shares similar physiological characteristics with the M161 pmi mutant, but has a more suppressive Myc¯ phenotype response. 3atomatoes 3aplant growth 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aspores 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aphenotype 3amutants 3aRhizophagus intraradices 3aspore germination 3aappressoria 3ascreening 3aroots 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 2aFungal Structuresxgrowth & development 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aMutation 2aMycorrhizaexgrowth & development 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Rootsxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 0aGlomus intraradices1 aGadkar, Vijay1 aWininger, Smadar1 aBendov, Roza1 aGalili, Gad1 aLevy, Avraham A.1 aKapulnik, Yoram0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2003 May, v. 16, no. 5 p.382-388dAPS PresswJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.5.3823Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03363naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100002200193245011800215300001800333506007600351520131800427506003701745650002501782650001101807650002201818650002001840650001001860650002101870650001301891650004401904650001401948650001301962650002201975650002001997650002802017650002002045653001102065653003102076653001802107653003402125653002402159700002102183700002102204700002202225700001802247700001902265700002302284700001702307700001802324700001602342700002002358700002002378700002102398700002402419773011302443852000902556856009202565930003302657946001102690655001202701IND4412812220221207133458.0081121e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441281222DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06717.x2doi7 aPMC27022122pmcid7 a190217632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakeda, Mitsuhiro10aStructure of the putative 32 kDa myrosinase-binding protein from Arabidopsis (At3g16450.1) determined by SAIL-NMR  ap. 5873-5884.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe product of gene At3g16450.1 from Arabidopsis thaliana is a 32 kDa, 299-residue protein classified as resembling a myrosinase-binding protein (MyroBP). MyroBPs are found in plants as part of a complex with the glucosinolate-degrading enzyme myrosinase, and are suspected to play a role in myrosinase-dependent defense against pathogens. Many MyroBPs and MyroBP-related proteins are composed of repeated homologous sequences with unknown structure. We report here the three-dimensional structure of the At3g16450.1 protein from Arabidopsis, which consists of two tandem repeats. Because the size of the protein is larger than that amenable to high-throughput analysis by uniform ¹³C/¹⁵N labeling methods, we used stereo-array isotope labeling (SAIL) technology to prepare an optimally ²H/¹³C/¹⁵N-labeled sample. NMR data sets collected using the SAIL protein enabled us to assign ¹H, ¹³C and ¹⁵N chemical shifts to 95.5% of all atoms, even at a low concentration (0.2 m m) of protein product. We collected additional NOESY data and determined the three-dimensional structure using the cyana software package. The structure, the first for a MyroBP family member, revealed that the At3g16450.1 protein consists of two independent but similar lectin-fold domains, each composed of three β-sheets.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3acarbon 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3agenes 3aisotope labeling 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apathogens 3aproteins 3asequence homology 3astable isotopes 3atandem repeat sequences 3athioglucosidase 0alectin 0amyrosinase-binding protein 0aNMR structure 0astereo-array isotope labeling 0astructural genomics1 aSugimori, Nozomi1 aTorizawa, Takuya1 aTerauchi, Tsutomu1 aOno, Akira M.1 aYagi, Hirokazu1 aYamaguchi, Yoshiki1 aKato, Koichi1 aIkeya, Teppei1 aJee, JunGoo1 aGüntert, Peter1 aAceti, David J.1 aMarkley, John L.1 aKainosho, Masatsune0 tFEBS journal.g2008 Dec., v. 275, no. 23 p.5873-5884dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06717.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081121b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01783naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245007000132300001600202300003000218500001500248520080500263650001801068650001601086650001201102650001301114650002001127650002101147650001201168650001501180651001001195653001101205653000801216700001901224773009301243852000901336939003301345945000801378946001101386655001201397991609116780742620221122152933.0850717e198312  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850074652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeervani, P.10aStructure, composition and physical properties of legume starches  ap. 372-377.  ap. 372-377. ill., charts.  a2019-12-05  aThe composition, structure, and physical properties of starches (characteristics that influence the sensory properties of legumes) in 4 high-yielding legume varieties were examined including the red gram (cajanus cajan), the black gram (P. mungo), the green gram (P. aureus), and the Bengal gram (Cicer arietinum). The indigestible residence (after enzymatic digestion) of raw and processed legumes ranged from 19-27%, while the starch content varied from 40-47%. Fiber content was below 3% in all legumes studied. Negligible differences were found for amylose, nitrogen, ash, phosphorus, and crude fat. It appears that physical property differences may be attributed to slight differences in the amylose content and to differences in the size of the starch granules for these different legumes.

In recent years, the need to improve digestible fiber and dry matter intake of forages to meet the nutrient requirements of high yielding dairy cows and the willingness to plant corn specifically for silage has led plant breeders to focus on the brown mid-rib (BMR) trait. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of different ratio of alfalfa to BMR corn silage and ration level of forage neutral detergent fiber (NDF) on animal performance of lactating cows in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This study was conducted at the Upper Peninsula Experiment Station of Michigan State University in Chatham, Michigan, USA. Two different ratios of forage type (high alfalfa silage/low BMR corn silage, AS, and high BMR corn silage/low alfalfa silage, BMRCS) and two different dietary NDF contents (27% NDF, 27 = low forage/high grain feeding, and 33% NDF, 33 = high forage/low grain feeding) were used. The experimental design was a 4×4 Latin Square with 20 milking cows (12 multiparous and 8 primiparous). This trial had four 21-day periods with 14 d adaptation and 7 d data collection. Milk yield and body condition score (BCS) on the AS-27, BMRCS-27 and BMRCS-33 treatments were significantly (p<0.05) higher than on the AS-33 treatment. Dry matter intake of the AS-27 and BMRCS-27 treatments was significantly (p<0.05) higher than for the AS-33 and BMRCS-33 treatments. Milk urea nitrogen (MUN) on the AS-33 treatment was significantly (p<0.05) higher than on the other diet treatments. A key finding of this study was that the BMRCS-33 (higher amounts of brown mid-rib corn silage than alfalfa silage, high forage and low grain feeding diet at 33% NDF) led to the equal highest milk production whilst having the equal lowest dry matter intake. This study demonstrated that the diet with higher ratio of highly digestible NDF forage such as brown mid-rib corn silage to alfalfa silage could lower grain feeding in the ration. 3aalfalfa 3aalfalfa silage 3abody condition 3acorn 3acorn silage 3adata collection 3adiet 3adry matter intake 3aexperimental design 3aforage 3amilk 3amilk yield 3aneutral detergent fiber 3aurea nitrogen 3aMichigan1 aBucholtz, Herb1 aNaasz, Paul0 pAsian-Australas. j. anim. scig2007 Mar., v. 20, no. 3 p.373-377x1011-23677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5713/ajas.2007.3733Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.ajas.info/index.php?v_type=33Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140701  aNon-US 7aarticle04307naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002400165245021700189300001600406500002400422520221900446650002502665650002302690650002802713650001502741650001202756650001002768650002002778650001002798650001102808650001802819650002102837650001202858650001702870650001902887650002402906650001202930650001302942650004102955650003202996650004403028650004703072650003103119650005003150650005303200650001303253650004403266650005203310650003303362650003403395650003703429700002203466773012203488852000903610856008603619655001203705IND4477900920221122115725.0140303s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447790092DNAL7 a127445102pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.5.3982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMellersch, Denny G.13aAn Investigation into the Involvement of Defense Signaling Pathways in Components of the Nonhost Resistance of Arabidopsis thaliana to Rust Fungi Also Reveals a Model System for Studying Rust Fungal Compatibility  ap. 398-404.  aIncludes references  aSeventeen accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana inoculated with the cowpea rust fungus Uromyces vignae exhibited a variety of expressions of nonhost resistance, although infection hypha growth typically ceased before the formation of the first haustorium, except in Ws-0. Compared with wild-type plants, there was no increased fungal growth in ndr1 or eds1 mutants defective in two of the signal cascades regulated by the major class of Arabidopsis host resistance genes. However, in the Col-0 background, infection hyphae of U. vignae and two other rust fungi were longer in sid2 mutants defective in an enzyme that synthesizes salicylic acid (SA), in npr1 mutants deficient in a regulator of the expression of SA-dependent pathogenesis related (PR) genes, and in NahG plants containing a bacterial salicylate hydroxylase. Infection hyphae of U. vignae and U. appendiculatus but not of Puccinia helianthi were also longer in jar1 mutants, which are defective in the jasmonic acid defense signaling pathway. Nevertheless, haustorium formation increased only for the Uromyces spp. and only in sid2 mutants or NahG plants. Rather than the hypersensitive cell death that usually accompanies haustorium formation in nonhost plants, Arabidopsis typically encased haustoria in calloselike material. Growing fungal colonies of both Uromyces spp., indicative of a successful biotrophic relationship between plant and fungus, formed in NahG plants, but only U. vignae formed growing colonies in the sid2 mutants and cycloheximide-treated wild-type plants. Growing colonies did not develop in NahG tobacco or tomato plants. These data suggest that nonhost resistance of Arabidopsis to rust fungi primarily involves the restriction of infection hypha growth as a result of defense gene expression. However, there is a subsequent involvement of SA but not SA-dependent PR genes in preventing the Uromyces spp. from forming the first haustorium and establishing a sufficient biotrophic relationship to support further fungal growth. The U. vignae-Arabidopsis combination could allow the application of the powerful genetic capabilities of this model plant to the study of compatibility as well as nonhost resistance to rust fungi. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aPuccinia helianthi 3aUromyces appendiculatus 3acell death 3acowpeas 3afungi 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahyphae 3ajasmonic acid 3amicrobial growth 3amutants 3apathogenesis 3asalicylic acid 3asignal transduction 3atobacco 3atomatoes 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aCycloheximidexpharmacology 2aFungal Structuresxgrowth & development 2aFungixdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aMixed Function Oxygenasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMutation 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Leavesxcytologyxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aSignal Transductionxgenetics 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxmicrobiology.1 aHeath, Michele C.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2003 May, v. 16, no. 5 p.398-404dAPS PresswJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.5.3983Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01590naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245007700170300001600247500002800263520060100291650001000892650001100902650002200913653003500935653002300970653002100993700001701014700001501031773010601046852000901152856009201161946001101253655001201264IND4413059220221122115732.0081128s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441305922DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2818.2008.02123.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRAKOCEVIC, Z.10aSurface roughness of ultra-thin silver films sputter depositedon a glass  ap. 595-600.  aPublisher supplied data  aSilver was sputter deposited on a glass with a thin film thickness ranging from 10 to 80 nm.

Root samples were collected from 8 individuals of M. hildebrandtii and 2 individuals of M. drouhardii in Madagascar and from 21 individuals of M. oleifera in Uganda. Total DNA was extracted from the root samples, and partial nSSU rDNA of AM fungi was amplified using a universal eukaryotic primer NS31 and an AM fungalspecific primer AM1. The PCR products were cloned and divided by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis with HinfI and RsaI. Some representatives in each RFLP types were sequenced, and a neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis was conducted for the obtained sequences with analogous sequences of AM fungi. The RFLP and phylogenetic analyses showed that AM fungi closely related to Glomus intraradices or G. sinuosum were detected in many samples. The AM fungal groups frequently detected in the Moringa spp. might be widely distributed species in semiarid environments. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3acommunity structure 3aribosomal DNA 3adrought tolerance 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asemiarid zones 3aRhizophagus intraradices 3aMoringa 3aroots 3aMadagascar 3aUganda 0aGlomus intraradices 0aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 0aMoringa hildebrandtii 0aMoringa drouhardii1 aIkeda, Shiho 1 aIwase, Koji 0 tMycoscience.g2009 Mar., v. 50, no. 2 p.100-105dJapan : Springer Japanx1340-35407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10267-008-0459-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20090327b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03864naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155100001700164245016700181300001600348500002400364500001500388520231800403650001202721650001802733650001002751650001802761650002302779650002002802650001702822650001302839650002602852650002302878650001502901650001802916650002002934650001402954650001702968653001002985700001402995700001603009700001703025700002003042773010803062852000903170856008603179930003303265945002503298946001103323655001203334IND4418969920221122115724.0090410e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441896992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2009.01.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aW0001 aO'Shea, C.J.10aAmmonia emissions and dry matter of separated pig manure fractions as affected by crude protein concentration and sugar beet pulp inclusion of finishing pig diets  ap. 154-160.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIt was hypothesised that decreasing dietary crude protein (CP) and including sugar beet pulp (SBP) would reduce the urine:faeces nitrogen (N) excretion ratio of finisher boars and decrease ammonia emissions from separated liquid and solid manure fractions. A 2x2 factorial experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of dietary CP concentration (150gkg⁻¹ vs. 200gkg⁻¹) and SBP (0gkg⁻¹ vs. 200gkg⁻¹) inclusion on nutrient digestibility, N excretion and manure output from finisher boars (63±1.3kg). Urine and faeces collections were pooled in original excretion ratios. Manure samples were separated into liquid and solid fractions using separating-cloth. A 2x2x2 factorial design was used to investigate the interaction of CP concentration (150gkg⁻¹ vs. 200gkg⁻¹), SBP (0gkg⁻¹ vs. 200gkg⁻¹) and manure treatment (unseparated manure vs. cumulated separated fractions) on ammonia emissions from unseparated manure and cumulated fractions. There was an interaction between SBP and manure treatment (P <0.01) on manure dry matter. Dietary SBP increased the dry matter of unseparated manure compared with pigs offered diets containing no SBP. However there was no effect of dietary SBP on dry matter of the separated fractions. Dietary SBP decreased ammonia emissions from 0 to 240h (P <0.05) from unseparated manure and separated fractions compared with unsupplemented diets. Decreasing dietary CP to 150gkg⁻¹ reduced total N excretion (P <0.001) and ammonia emissions from 0 to 240h (P <0.1) from unseparated manure and separated fractions. There was an interaction between CP and SBP on N retention (P <0.05). Pigs offered the 150gkg⁻¹ CP diet containing SBP decreased N retention compared with pigs offered the 150gkg⁻¹ CP diet containing no SBP. However there was no effect of SBP in pigs offered the high CP diets on N retention. Pigs offered diets containing SBP reduced manure volume (P <0.05) compared with pigs offered diets containing no SBP. In conclusion, increasing dietary SBP and reducing CP concentrations decreased ammonia emissions from unseparated manure and separated liquid and solid fractions. Furthermore, dietary SBP increased the dry matter of unseparated manure however SBP inclusion had no effect on the dry matter of the separated manure fractions. 3aammonia 3agas emissions 3aboars 3aswine feeding 3adry matter content 3adietary protein 3afood animals 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3anutrient retention 3apig manure 3acrude protein 3asugar beet pulp 3afinishing 3afeed rations 0aswine1 aLynch, B.1 aLynch, M.B.1 aCallan, J.J.1 aO'Doherty, J.V.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2009 June, v. 131, no. 3-4 p.154-160dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2009.01.0193Available from publisher's Web site  a20090611b20090703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/05/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02308naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001700142245015900159300001800318520120500336650000901541650001001550650002301560650002301583650002701606650001101633650001401644700002001658700002101678700002001699773010401719852000901823856008201832939003301914946001101947655001201958IND4464068220221122092425.0120911e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446406822DNAL7 a10.5713/ajas.2003.15292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Sung Ki10aEffects of Dietary Vitamin E Supplementation on Color Stability, Lipid Oxidation and Reducing Ability of Hanwoo (Korean Cattle) Beef during Retail Display  ap. 1529-1534.  aThe effects of dietary vitamin E supplementation (control; 200 IU/head/day, 500 IU/head/day and 1,000 IU/head/day) on color stability, lipid oxidation and total reducing ability in M. longissimus and M. semimembranosus from Hanwoo (Korean cattle) steer during retail display (3±1°C, 1,200 lux) were investigated.

Consequently, the meat from 1,000 IU vitamin E-supplemented Hanwoo steer extended retail display life compared to the control and 500 IU/head/day. 3abeef 3acolor 3alipid peroxidation 3alongissimus muscle 3asemimembranosus muscle 3asteers 3avitamin E1 aKim, Yŏng-sun.1 aLiang, Cheng Yun1 aSong, Young Han0 pAsian-Australas. j. anim. scig2003 Oct., v. 16, no. 10 p.1529-1534wJournal:18450x1011-23677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5713/ajas.2003.15293Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120911  aNon-US 7aarticle02586naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001600141245013400157300001600291520146800307650002601775650001001801650001201811650002201823650002001845650002801865650001401893650001601907653001501923700002001938700001601958773009101974852000902065856008102074930003302155945001302188946001102201655001202212IND2196032420221122060357.0981216e199805  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219603242DNAL7 a10.1007/s0035900502122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, M.10aPatch-clamp analysis of voltage- and ligand-activated whole-cell currents in freshly dissociated neurons of the locust optic lobe  ap. 677-686.  aWhole-cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from 116 freshly dissociated neuronal somata from the optic lobe of adult locusts (Schistocerca gregaria). Prerequisites were a papain treatment and the directed transfer of somata to the recording chamber by dabbing. Of the recorded somata. 65 were from lamina and 51 from other optic lobe neurons. All somata supported voltage-activated outward currents and some (24% of optic lobe. 3% of lamina neurons) also fast inward currents. Most lamina neurons supported an outward current that activated (V1/2= -8.5 mV) and inactivated rapidly and a sustained outward current. Some lamina and most optic lobe neurons expressed only a sustained outward current (V12= -9.4 mV). GABA and histamine elicited inward currents at negative holding potentials. Most optic lobe (95%) but only 18% of lamina neurons showed a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) current, whereas a similar percentage of optic lobe (50%) and lamina neurons (67%) expressed a histamine current. Both currents reversed near the chloride equilibrium potential. were reversibly reduced by picrotoxin. and did not show rundown. Thus. they likely represent chloride currents mediated by ionotropic receptors. Our data indicate that the lamina neurons recorded mainly represent monopolar cells postsynaptic to histaminergic photoreceptors. The optic lobe neurons. on which GABA and histamine apparently act as inhibitory neurotransmitters, are more heterogeneous. 3aSchistocerca gregaria 3abrain 3aneurons 3aelectrophysiology 3aneurophysiology 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3ahistamine 3aneurotoxins 0apicrotoxin1 aBenkenstein, C.1 aGewecke, M.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1998 May, v. 182, no. 5 p.677-686x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0035900502123Available from publisher's Web site  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02392naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001600141245013600157300001600293520123000309650001601539650001701555650001901572650002101591650002301612650002201635650002001657650001701677650001401694653002701708653001501735700001801750773009101768852000901859856008101868930003301949945001301982946001101995655001202006IND2196032220221122060216.0981216e199805  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219603222DNAL7 a10.1007/s0035900502102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmitz, H.14aThe photomechanic infrared receptor for the detection of forest fires in the beetle Melanophila acuminata (Coleoptera: Buprestidae)  ap. 647-657.  aWe recorded from single units of individual sensilla of the thoracic infrared (IR) pit organs of Melanophila acuminata. When the organ was stimulated with a thermal radiator whose emission spectrum was similar to that of a typical forest fire, units responded phasically with up to seven spikes within 30-40 ms at a radiation power of 24 mW cm-2. In the experiments all wavelengths shorter than 1.6 ~m were excluded by a longpass IR filter. Response latencies were about 4 ms and initial impulse frequencies were up to 250 impulses per second (ips). A single spike could be generated even when stimulus duration was only 2 ms. Reduction of total radiation power from 24 mW cm-2 to 5 mW cm-2 resulted in increased response latencies of 5-6 ms and the occurrence of only two to three spikes. Initial impulse frequencies decreased to 125 ips. According to our physiological results and calculations. Melanophila should be able to detect a 10-hectare fire from a distance of 12 km. Mechanical stimuli also evoked responses of the IR sensilla. All present morphological and physiological findings lead to the conclusion that the IR receptors of Melanophila must function by means of a hitherto undescribed photomechanic mechanism. 3aMelanophila 3asense organs 3aphotoreceptors 3amechanoreceptors 3ainfrared radiation 3aelectrophysiology 3aneurophysiology 3aforest fires 3adetection 0amechanical stimulation 0apit organs1 aBleckmann, H.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1998 May, v. 182, no. 5 p.647-657x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0035900502103Available from publisher's Web site  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle03415naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160100003400169245014300203300001400346500002400360500001500384520137300399650002801772650002201800650001501822650002001837650002501857650002301882650001101905650001301916650001501929650002401944650001301968650002401981650002402005650001302029650003502042650001902077650002202096651000902118653003602127653001602163653001602179653006102195700001902256700003202275700002002307700002502327700002002352700002002372700001902392700002502411700001702436700002002453773009902473852000902572856009102581930003302672945002502705946001102730655001202741IND4418969220221122060251.0090410e20090501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441896922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2009.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL8101 aNgandolo, Bongo Naré Richard10aComparative assessment of fluorescence polarization and tuberculin skin testing for the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis in Chadian cattle  ap. 81-89.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEffective surveillance of bovine tuberculosis (BTB) in developing countries where reliable data on disease prevalence is scarce or absent is a precondition for considering potential control options. We conducted a slaughterhouse survey to assess for the first time the burden of BTB in Southern Chad. Altogether, 954 slaughter animals were consecutively sampled and tested using the single intra-dermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) test, a recently developed fluorescence polarization assay (FPA) and routine abattoir meat inspection after slaughter. Gross visible lesions were detected in 11.3% (CI: 9.4-13.5%) of the animals examined and they were mostly located in the lymph nodes and the lung. Significantly more Mbororo zebus (15.0%) were affected by lesions than Arab zebus (9.9%; OR=2.20, CI: 1.41-3.41%; p <0.001). Of all animals tested, 7.7% (CI: 6.2-9.6%) reacted positively to SICCT if OIE guidelines were applied. However, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis using Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) infected animals as the positive population and lesion negative animals as the negative population, revealed a better SICCT performance if the cut-off value was decreased to >2mm. SICCT reactor prevalence rose to 15.5% (CI: 13.3-18.0%) and FPA did not perform better than SICCT, when this setting adapted cut-off was applied. 3aepidemiological studies 3adisease detection 3atuberculin 3aslaughterhouses 3adisease surveillance 3adisease prevalence 3acattle 3avalidity 3askin tests 3abovine tuberculosis 3anecropsy 3areference standards 3aMycobacterium bovis 3aaccuracy 3afluorescent antibody technique 3adisease course 3adisease diagnosis 3aChad 0afluorescence polarization assay 0amethodology 0anew methods 0asingle intra-dermal comparative cervical tuberculin test1 aMüller, Borna1 aDiguimbaye-Djaïbe, Colette1 aSchiller, Irene1 aMarg-Haufe, Beatrice1 aCagiola, Monica1 aJolley, Michael1 aSurujballi, Om1 aAkakpo, Ayayi Justin1 aOesch, Bruno1 aZinsstag, Jakob0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2009 May 1, v. 89, no. 1-2 p.81-89dElsevierx0167-58777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2009.02.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20090622b20090703c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/05/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02230naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155100002400164245009400188300001600282500002400298520085500322650001301177650002601190650001101216650002001227650002201247650001901269650002601288650002101314650001501335650002501350651001001375653002201385700001901407700001701426700001501443700003001458773010801488852000901596856008601605930003301691945002501724946001101749655001201760IND4418971620140725000000.0090410e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441897162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2009.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aF6001 aBello, Francesco de10aRelating plant species and functional diversity to community δ¹³C in NE Spain pastures  ap. 303-307.  aIncludes references  aThe relationship of plant species and functional diversities to community-level δ¹³C, as a proxy for water carbon relations, was assessed in pastures from two climatic regions in NE Spain. Overall, community δ¹³C was negatively related to species diversity, but positively related to functional diversity. However, pronounced differences between climatic regions were found: smaller variations in δ¹³C and thus carbon-water relations were observed for communities under humid conditions, which had higher species diversity but were more functionally redundant than communities under arid conditions. Thus, if species and functional diversities affect plant carbon-water relations at the community and hence at the ecosystem level seems to depend strongly on functional redundancy, i.e., the overlap in plant traits among the species present. 3apastures 3abotanical composition 3acarbon 3astable isotopes 3aplant communities 3apasture plants 3aplant-water relations 3aclimatic factors 3aecosystems 3afunctional diversity 3aSpain 0aecological niches1 aBuchmann, Nina1 aCasals, Pere1 aLepš, Jan1 aSebastiá, María Teresa.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2009 June, v. 131, no. 3-4 p.303-307dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2009.02.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20090930b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/05/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02045naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002200146245005700168300001600225500002400241520102500265650003801290650001301328650001201341650001601353650001201369650001201381650001501393650001701408650001401425700001801439700002001457773012301477852000901600856008601609655001201695IND4477900120221122060311.0140303s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447790012DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.4.3352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarris, Jeanne M.10aRhizobium-Induced Calcium Spiking in Lotus japonicus  ap. 335-341.  aIncludes references  aLegumes and rhizobium bacteria form a symbiosis that results in the development of nitrogen-fixing nodules on the root of the host plant. The earliest plant developmental changes are triggered by bacterially produced nodulation (Nod) factors. Within minutes of exposure to Nod factors, sharp oscillations in cytoplasmic calcium levels (calcium spiking) occur in epidermal cells of several closely related legumes. We found that Lotus japonicus, a legume that follows an alternate developmental pathway, responds to both its bacterial partner and to the purified bacterial signal with calcium spiking. Thus, calcium spiking is not restricted to a particular pathway of nodule development and may be a general component of the response of host legumes to their bacterial partner. Using Nod factor-induced calcium spiking as a tool to identify mutants blocked early in the response to Nod factor, we show that the L. japonicus Ljsym22-1 mutant but not the Ljsym30 mutant fails to respond to Nod factor with calcium spiking. 3aLotus corniculatus var. japonicus 3abacteria 3acalcium 3ahost plants 3alegumes 3amutants 3anodulation 3aroot nodules 3asymbiosis1 aWais, Rebecca1 aLong, Sharon R.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2003 Apr., v. 16, no. 4 p.335-341dAPS PresswJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.4.3353Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03411naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002600181245021800207300001800425500002400443506007600467520180800543506003702351650001702388650002402405650001402429650001402443650001702457650003902474650001602513650002302529650002502552650002702577650001402604650001802618650001202636651001102648700002102659773013602680852000902816856008002825856004802905655001202953IND4390475220221207134407.0070416e20070415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439047522DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02158-062doi7 aPMC18555782pmcid7 a172935162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKołodziej, Karolina.10aCellular Identification of a Novel Uncultured Marine Stramenopile (MAST-12 Clade) Small-Subunit rRNA Gene Sequence from a Norwegian Estuary by Use of Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization-Scanning Electron Microscopy  ap. 2718-2726.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRevealing the cellular identity of organisms behind environmental eukaryote rRNA gene sequences is a major objective in microbial diversity research. We sampled an estuarine oxygen-depleted microbial mat in southwestern Norway and retrieved an 18S rRNA gene signature that branches in the MAST-12 clade, an environmental marine stramenopile clade. Detailed phylogenetic analyses revealed that MAST-12 branches among the heterotrophic stramenopiles as a sister of the free-living Bicosoecida and the parasitic genus BLASTOCYSTIS: Specific sequence signatures confirmed a relationship to these two groups while excluding direct assignment. We designed a specific oligonucleotide probe for the target sequence and detected the corresponding organism in incubation samples using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Using the combined FISH-scanning electron microscopy approach (T. Stoeck, W. H. Fowle, and S. S. Epstein, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 69:6856-6863, 2003), we determined the morphotype of the target organism among the very diverse possible morphologies of the heterotrophic stramenopiles. The unpigmented cell is spherical and about 5 μm in diameter and possesses a short flagellum and a long flagellum, both emanating anteriorly. The long flagellum bears mastigonemes in a characteristic arrangement, and its length (30 μm) distinguishes the target organism from other recognized heterotrophic stramenopiles. The short flagellum is naked and often directed posteriorly. The organism possesses neither a lorica nor a stalk. The morphological characteristics that we discovered should help isolate a representative of a novel stramenopile group, possibly at a high taxonomic level, in order to study its ultrastructure, physiological capabilities, and ecological role in the environment.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBlastocystis 3aelectron microscopy 3aestuaries 3aflagellum 3afluorescence 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3amajor genes 3amarine environment 3anucleotide sequences 3aoligonucleotide probes 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asisters 3aNorway1 aStoeck, Thorsten0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2007 Apr. 15, v. 73, no. 8 p.2718-2726dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02158-063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle01691naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245006000122300001600182520071400198650001600912650001200928650002100940650001300961650001100974650001900985650003001004651001301034700001901047700001601066700001701082700002301099700001501122700002001137773010501157852000901262939003301271946001301304655001201317IND9205836520221122010911.0920918e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920583652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, Y.10aHybrid expert system for beef-forage grazing management  ap. 262-272.  aA beef-forage grazing model was developed to assist livestock producers with pasture grazing management decisions.

Management recommendations provided by the grazing model include proper pasture size, stocking rate, earliest grazing date, and animal nutrition for a specified single-pasture grazing schedule. 3abeef cattle 3agrazing 3arange management 3aforaging 3amodels 3aexpert systems 3aadministrative management 3aNebraska1 aThompson, T.L.1 aMoser, L.E.1 aWaller, S.S.1 aKlopfenstein, T.J.1 aWard, J.K.1 aWilkerson, V.A.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g1991 Mar., v. 7, no. 2 p.262-272wJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02138naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100001800186245012400204300001600328520100400344650001401348650002001362650001301382650001101395650001301406650001301419650001301432650001701445700002001462700002501482773011901507852000901626856008501635930003301720946001101753655001201764IND4429074320221122004647.0091120e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442907432DNAL7 a10.1007/s10858-009-9382-32doi7 aPMC27772332pmcid7 a198989422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtten, Renee 10aComprehensive determination of ³JHNHα for unfolded proteins using ¹³C′-resolved spin-echo difference spectroscopy  ap. 343-349.  aAn experiment is presented to determine ³JHNHα coupling constants, with significant advantages for applications to unfolded proteins. The determination of coupling constants for the peptide chain using 1D ¹H, or 2D and 3D ¹H-¹⁵N correlation spectroscopy is often hampered by extensive resonance overlap when dealing with flexible, disordered proteins. In the experiment detailed here, the overlap problem is largely circumvented by recording ¹H-¹³C′ correlation spectra, which demonstrate superior resolution for unfolded proteins. J-coupling constants are extracted from the peak intensities in a pair of 2D spin-echo difference experiments, affording rapid acquisition of the coupling data. In an application to the cytoplasmic domain of human neuroligin-3 (hNlg3cyt) data were obtained for 78 residues, compared to 54 coupling constants obtained from a 3D HNHA experiment. The coupling constants suggest that hNlg3cyt is intrinsically disordered, with little propensity for structure. 3acouplings 3adata collection 3aextracts 3ahumans 3ajournals 3apeptides 3aproteins 3aspectroscopy1 aWood, Kathleen 1 aMulder, Frans A.

Further simplifications and assumptions are applied to overcome this issue. Using 3-dimensional (3D) scanners might simplify this step and make it more realistic to obtain accurate results from simulations. Hence, a NextEngine 3D scanner (Next Engine Inc., Santa Monica, CA) was used to obtain 3D images of food products. This led to acquire 3D digital images of irregular shaped food products (pears, strawberries, bananas, apples and eggs) by saving laborious efforts and decreased the errors due to experimental measurements to generate given geometries. Then, to simulate a cooling process, digital images of pears were imported to a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program, and simulation results were compared with the experimental temperature data. Perfect spheres and eggs were, on the other hand, used to demonstrate surface area and volume estimation properties of the 3D scanning processes. With all these features and user-friendly properties, 3D scanners were demonstrated to promise a wide application area in food process engineering studies. 3asimulation models 3aimage analysis 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3afluid mechanics 3asurface area 3avolume 3anew products 3afood industry 3afood processing 3aproduct development 3aalgorithms 3adimensions 0afood technology 0aconfocal scanning laser microscopy1 aErdogdu, Ferruh.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2009 Aug., v. 93, no. 3 p.337-343dElsevier Science Pub.

The aim of the study was to investigate how starter cultures influenced the baking-technological, nutritional and sensory properties of barley bread. Could degradation of beta-glucans caused by sour dough admixture result in bread that was more easy to chew? The starter culture influenced the volume yield, the total titratable acidity (S degrees) and the sensory properties. The amounts of lactate and acetate ranged from 0.20 to 0.26 and 0.03 to 0.08 g/100 g sour dough bread, respectively. The total titratable acidity in the sour dough breads varied between 4.1 and 5.4 ml 0.1 N NaOH/10 g bread. There were negative correlations between barley taste and total titratable acidity (S degrees). The acidulous taste of the sour dough breads seemed to mask the barley taste. The phytate of the barley sour dough breads was reduced below 0.5 micromole/g, which does not inhibit mineral absorption, irrespective of starter culture. There was no significant difference in the total content of beta-glucans between bread made with and without admixture of sour dough, irrespective of starter culture, rejecting the hypothesis that barley bread made with sour dough would be more easy to chew. 3aphysicochemical properties 3asensory evaluation 3abarley flour 0abarley meal1 aHaglund, A.1 aJohansson, L.0 tFood quality and preference.g1996 , v. 7, no. 3/4 p.285-292x0950-32937nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03265naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100002400185245011900209300001600328500002400344520134700368650002301715650001401738650001901752650002301771650001701794650002501811650002401836650001701860650001901877650001701896650002301913650001601936650001501952650001801967650002501985650005902010650002802069650002302097650001102120650002702131650001102158650002502169650002302194650002502217650002202242650002102264700002602285700002302311700002602334773009902360852000902459856008802468930003302556945002502589946001302614655001202627IND4418976320221121235353.0090410e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441897632DNAL7 a193589282pmid7 a10.1016/j.nutres.2009.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aT2001 aCourville, Amber B.10aPlasma or red blood cell phospholipids can be used to assess docosahexaenoic acid status in women during pregnancy  ap. 151-155.  aIncludes references  aThe suitability of using plasma phopholipids (PLs) to assess docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) status during pregnancy is well accepted. Recent discussions have centered around whether red blood cells (RBCs) can be used to indicate DHA status. We tested the hypothesis that in pregnant women participating in an intervention study when fed a functional food containing DHA, maternal plasma PL DHA would be positively associated with maternal RBC PL and umbilical cord blood RBC PL DHA. Maternal and umbilical cord blood samples were obtained at delivery from women whose mean dietary intake was 187 mg/d (including the amount consumed from the DHA-functional food). Maternal plasma and RBCs and cord blood RBC lipids were extracted and PLs separated by thin-layer chromatography. Phopholipid lipids were methylated, and fatty acids were identified using gas chromatography. Fifty-nine maternal samples and 30 cord blood samples were analyzed. There were moderate to strong correlations between DHA in all compartments (maternal plasma vs maternal RBC PL DHA weight percent [wt%], r = 0.633, P <= .001; maternal plasma vs cord blood RBC PL DHA wt%, r = 0.458, P <= .01; maternal RBCs vs cord blood RBC PL DHA wt%, r = 0.376, P <= .01). These results support the practice of using either plasma PLs or RBC PLs to assess maternal and infant DHA status. 3amaternal nutrition 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3anutritional status 3ablood lipids 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aerythrocytes 3aumbilical cord 3ahealth foods 3anutrition research 3adietary fat 3afat intake 3aphospholipids 3anutrition assessment 2aDocosahexaenoic Acidsxadministration & dosagexblood. 2aErythrocytesxchemistry 2aFatty Acidsxblood 2aFemale 2aFetal Bloodxchemistry 2aHumans 2aNutrition Assessment 2aNutritional Status 2aPhospholipidsxblood 2aPlasmaxchemistry 2aPregnancyxblood1 aKeplinger, Melissa R.1 aJudge, Michelle P.1 aLammi-Keefe, Carol J.0 tNutrition research.g2009 Mar., v. 29, no. 3 p.151-155dElsevier Science Inc.x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2009.02.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20090522b20090608c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/05/22  aOther US 7aarticle03563naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100002000185245008800205300001600293500002400309500001500333520120100348650002101549650002201570650001401592650001901606650002301625650001601648650002401664650002301688650001301711650002401724650001301748650001801761650002501779650001001804650004901814650007501863650002601938650007301964650002402037650003302061650002502094650001802119650002602137650001102163650001102174650000902185650001602194650003602210650001602246653001302262700002002275700002002295700001602315700002102331700001802352700002102370700001902391700002402410700002402434700002002458700002402478773009902502852000902601856008802610930003302698945002502731946001302756655001202769IND4418976220221121224627.0090410e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441897622DNAL7 a193589272pmid7 a10.1016/j.nutres.2009.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aT2001 aMizuma, Hiroshi10aDaily oral administration of crocetin attenuates physical fatigue in human subjects  ap. 145-150.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study compared the effects of placebo with a carotenoid compound, crocetin, as well as an antioxidant, ascorbic acid, on physical fatigue in humans. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-way crossover study, 14 Japanese healthy volunteers (7 men and 7 women) were randomized to oral administration of crocetin (15 mg), ascorbic acid (3,000 mg), or placebo for 8 days. Subjects performed workload tests on a bicycle ergometer at fixed workloads for 120 minutes at 2 times (a total of 240 minutes) as a fatigue-inducing physical task. During the physical task, subjects performed nonworkload tests at maximum velocity (MV) of 10 seconds at 30 minutes (30-minute test) after the start of the physical task and at 30 minutes before the end of the task (210-minute test). The change in MV from the 30- to the 210-minute test was significantly higher in men who received crocetin compared with men who received placebo (P < .05). This effect of crocetin was specific to males. Administration of ascorbic acid did not change in MV from the 30-minute to the 210-minute test on males or females. These results suggest that daily administration of crocetin may attenuate physical fatigue in men. 3afatigue strength 3astrength training 3abicycling 3amuscle fatigue 3agender differences 3acarotenoids 3avitamin supplements 3adicarboxylic acids 3avelocity 3aoral administration 3amegadose 3aascorbic acid 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAdult 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aAscorbic Acidxadministration & dosagexpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aBicyclingxphysiology 2aCarotenoidsxadministration & dosagexpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aDrug Administration Schedule 2aExercisexphysiology 2aExercise Test 2aFatiguexdrug therapy 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPhysical Exertionxdrug effects 2aSex Factors 0aexercise1 aTanaka, Masaaki1 aNozaki, Satoshi1 aMizuno, Kei1 aTahara, Tsuyoshi1 aAtaka, Suzuka1 aSugino, Tomohiro1 aShirai, Tomoko1 aKajimoto, Yoshitaka1 aKuratsune, Hirohiko1 aKajimoto, Osami1 aWatanabe, Yasuyoshi0 tNutrition research.g2009 Mar., v. 29, no. 3 p.145-150dElsevier Science Inc.x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2009.02.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20090522b20090608c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/05/22  aOther US 7aarticle04394naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185100002000194245015200214300001600366500002400382500001500406520226900421650002902690650001702719650001602736650002802752650001902780650001302799650001702812650001602829650002802845650002302873650001602896650003802912650002202950650002302972650002502995650002603020650000903046650002203055650001203077650001803089650002303107650002803130650004203158650002303200650002603223650002303249650002203272650000903294650001703303653001503320653001303335700001603348700002303364700001803387773009903405852000903504856008803513930003303601945002503634946001303659655001203672IND4418977020221121211943.0090410e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441897702DNAL7 a193589352pmid7 a10.1016/j.nutres.2009.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aT200 0aX3801 aHuang, Zhiliang10aTrans fat intake lowers total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels without changing insulin sensitivity index in Wistar rats  ap. 206-212.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEpidemiologic studies have demonstrated that trans fat intake increases the risk of some chronic diseases. We hypothesize that trans fat intake would increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus by changing the lipid profile in plasma, the secretion of adipokines in adipose tissue, and the insulin sensitivity. Accordingly, the major objective of present study was to investigate the effect of dietary intake of trans fat on lipid profile, insulin sensitivity, and adipokine levels in plasma. Two groups of Wistar rats were fed a diet containing 4.5% trans fat or a control diet containing no trans fat for 16 weeks. Fasting glucose level was monitored every 2 weeks. At the end of feeding experiment, blood, heart, kidney, liver, omental adipose tissue, and semitendinosus muscle were collected. The trans fat content in organs, lipid profile, adipokine, insulin, and glucose levels in plasma were analyzed. The trans fat content in adipose tissue, heart, kidney, liver, and muscle of rats fed trans fat were 169.9, 0.6, 1.2, 1.7, and 2.5 mg/g samples, respectively. The trans fat content in these organs contributed to 15.9%, 1.2%, 2.3%, 4.3%, and 6.1% of the total fat, respectively. The plasma glucose level, insulin level, and insulin sensitivity index were not significantly different between the trans fat and control groups. The results indicated that trans fat intake might not be related to insulin resistance. However, lipid profile and plasma adipokine levels were significantly changed after trans fat feeding. The trans fat fed group showed significantly lower total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels than the control group. The decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level may indicate the detrimental effect of trans fat intake on lipid profile. Adiponectin and resistin levels were significantly higher in the trans fat group than the control group. Leptin levels were significantly lower in the trans fat group than the control group. The results indicated that dietary intake of trans fat can significantly change the adipokine levels, but the possible links between adipokine level change caused by trans fat intake and metabolic effects of this change need further investigations. 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ablood lipids 3adietary fat 3acardiovascular diseases 3aadipose tissue 3aresistin 3arisk factors 3acholesterol 3alow density lipoprotein 3ainsulin resistance 3alipogenesis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3atrans fatty acids 3ahormone metabolism 3acholesteremic effect 3aanimal disease models 3arats 2aAdipokinesxblood 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucose 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCholesterol, HDLxblood 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aFatsxpharmacology 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aInsulin Resistance 2aRandom Allocation 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 0aadipokines 0ahormones1 aWang, Baowu1 aPace, Ralphenia D.1 aYoon, Seokjoo0 tNutrition research.g2009 Mar., v. 29, no. 3 p.206-212dElsevier Science Inc.x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2009.01.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20090522b20090608c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/05/22  aOther US 7aarticle03394naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001800167245018400185300001600369500002400385500001500409520156800424650001501992650002002007650001402027650002502041650002102066650001402087650002202101650002802123650002202151650002102173650001502194650001102209650002002220650002502240650001502265650002502280650002002305650001902325650002602344650001702370650003602387650001802423653003402441700001702475700001702492700001502509773010102524852000902625856008902634930003302723945002502756946001102781655001202792IND4418977420221121212003.0090410e20090519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441897742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2008.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF840 0aF6001 aWei, Guo-Ping10aChanges in oxidative damage, antioxidant enzyme activities and polyamine contents in leaves of grafted and non-grafted eggplant seedlings under stress by excess of calcium nitrate  ap. 443-451.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of 80 mmolL⁻¹ stress by excess of calcium nitrate [Ca(NO₃)₂] on biomass production, oxidative damage, antioxidant enzymes activities and polyamine contents in leaves of grafted and non-grafted eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) seedlings were studied, in which grafted plants were grafted on a salinity tolerant rootstock (Solanum torvum Swartz). The results showed that on the 15th day of treatment, the biomass production reduction of non-grafted seedlings was significantly higher than that of grafted seedlings. Under stress by excess of Ca(NO₃)₂, superoxide anion radical (O₂ ⁻) producing rate, electrolyte leakage percentage, contents of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and malondialdehyde (MDA) of non-grafted seedlings were significantly higher than those of grafted seedlings, but activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1), peroxidase (POD, EC 1.11.1.7), ascorbate peroxidase (APX, EC 1.11.1.11) and glutathione reductase (GR, EC 1.6.4.2) of grafted seedlings were significantly higher than those of non-grafted seedlings, moreover, contents of free, soluble conjugated and insoluble bound polyamines of grafted seedlings were significantly higher than those of non-grafted seedlings, and activities of diamine oxidase (DAO, EC 1.4.3.6) and polyamine oxidase (PAO, EC 1.5.3.3) of grafted seedlings were significantly lower than those of non-grafted seedlings.

Bovine oocytes matured in vitro for 22 h were in vitro fertilized or parthenogenetic activated. By reverse transcription-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR, we found that germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes, metaphase II (MII) oocytes, 4-cell and 8-cell embryos, morulae, and blastocysts were all shown to express mRNA for BDNF. The mRNA levels for BDNF gene were different in bovine oocytes and IVF embryos at different stages (P < 0.01), with the highest expression in MII oocytes and the lowest expression in 8-cell embryos. The mRNA for BDNF was highly expressed in the PA and IVF blastocysts compared to the NT blastocysts (P < 0.01). Supplementation of culture media with BDNF at the concentration of 40 μg/l caused a significant increase in the rates of in vitro-fertilized blastocyst formation (P < 0.05) and parthenogenetic blastocyst formation (P < 0.05). However, the rate of oocyte cleavage in BDNF groups was not significantly different from that in the BDNF-free control (P > 0.05) after IVF or PA. We have also investigated the effects of BDNF on the growth of granulosa cells, which were used for co-culture of bovine early embryos. The results revealed that supplementation of culture media with 20 μg/l BDNF promoted the growth of granulosa cells (P < 0.01). Taken together, these results provided evidence for the role of neurotrophins in promoting early embryonic development as well as in the growth of granulosa cells by the co-culture system, indicating that BDNF can directly or indirectly promote bovine early embryo development. 3atemporal variation 3aneurophysiology 3amessenger RNA 3aparthenogenesis 3acoculture 3acattle 3aembryo (animal) 3anuclear transplantation 3agene expression 3agranulosa cells 3aneurotrophins 3aembryogenesis 3acell cycle 3aoocytes 3ain vitro studies 3ain vitro fertilization 0abrain-derived neurotrophic factor 0aparthenogenetic activation 0agrowth factors1 aZhou, X.1 aShi, D.S.1 aChen, H.H.1 aQin, Q.L.1 aChen, Y.1 aLi, C.J.1 aZhao, Z.H.1 aXing, S.Y.0 tAnimal.g2008 Dec., v. 2, no. 12 p.1786-1794dCambridge University Pressx1751-73117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311080028383Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/04/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02377naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182100001700191245007400208300001800282500002400300520095300324650002601277650001801303650001201321650001301333650001801346650002401364650001501388650002301403650002401426650001301450653002901463653001901492653001801511700001301529700001301542700001701555700001501572700001501587773009401602852000901696856008501705930003301790945002501823946001101848655001201859IND4434431420221121211909.0100323e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443443142DNAL7 a224440862pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311080029662doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL400 0aX1001 aCorson, A.M.10aPercentile growth charts for biomedical studies using a porcine model  ap. 1795-1801.  aIncludes references  aIncreasing rates of obesity and heart disease are compromising quality of life for a growing number of people. There is much research linking adult disease with the growth and development both in utero and during the first year of life. The pig is an ideal model for studying the origins of developmental programming. The objective of this paper was to construct percentile growth curves for the pig for use in biomedical studies. The body weight (BW) of pigs was recorded from birth to 150 days of age and their crown-to-rump length was measured over the neonatal period to enable the ponderal index (PI; kg/m3) to be calculated. Data were normalised and percentile curves were constructed using Cole’s lambda-mu-sigma (LMS) method for BW and PI. The construction of these percentile charts for use in biomedical research will allow a more detailed and precise tracking of growth and development of individual pigs under experimental conditions. 3apostnatal development 3aanimal models 3apiglets 3aneonates 3aanimal growth 3abody weight changes 3aanimal age 3atemporal variation 3areference standards 3aontogeny 0apercentile growth curves 0aponderal index 0agrowth charts1 aLaws, J.1 aLaws, A.1 aLitten, J.C.1 aLean, I.J.1 aClarke, L.0 tAnimal.g2008 Dec., v. 2, no. 12 p.1795-1801dCambridge University Pressx1751-73117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311080029663Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/04/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03425naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182072000900191100001500200245012600215300001800341500002400359500001500383520170800398650002102106650001202127650002302139650001002162650002702172650003202199650002202231650001502253650002302268650002002291650001302311650002302324650001602347650002202363650001402385650001002399653001702409653001802426700001202444700001602456700001402472700001502486700001402501700001302515700001402528773009402542852000902636856008502645930003302730945002502763946001102788655001202799IND4434431720221121211930.0100323e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443443172DNAL7 a224440832pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311080031212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aF600 0aF200 0aL6001 aTang, S.X.10aMorphological fractions, chemical composition and in vitro fermentation characteristics of maize stover of five genotypes  ap. 1772-1779.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFive morphological fractions (leaf blade, leaf sheath, stem, husk and cob) of stover of five maize genotypes, namely waxy, conventional, fodder, sweet and high-oil maize, respectively, were used to test the effects of genotype and morphological fractions on chemical composition and in vitro fermentation characteristics. The waxy maize had a higher (P < 0.05) stem but lower (P < 0.05) leaf blade proportion and fodder maize had a higher (P < 0.05) leaf blade but lower (P < 0.05) leaf sheath proportion than other genotypes, respectively. Maize genotype had a significant effect (P < 0.001) on the chemical composition of stover parts except for organic matter (OM) concentration. Chemical composition of stover parts was affected (P < 0.001) by morphological fractions. The interaction effects between genotype and morphological fraction on the fiber content of stover parts were significant. Over 0.40 and 0.50 of phosphorus (P) and crude protein (CP) of whole-plant maize stover were averagely contributed by leaf blade. Leaf blade, stem and cob contributed over 0.75 of OM, CP, P and fiber in the whole plant. There were significant effects of genotype and morphological fraction on both in vitro gas production parameters and in vitro organic matter disappearance of maize stovers. The genotype and morphological fraction of maize stover and their interaction had significant effects on NH3-N and total volatile fatty acid concentration and the molar proportion of volatile fatty acid in the supernatant after 72 h of incubation except for valeric acid. The present data indicated that the genotype and morphological fraction of maize resulted in variation in the nutritive value of maize stover. 3anutrient content 3ahybrids 3ain vitro digestion 3afeeds 3ain vitro digestibility 3agas production (biological) 3agenetic variation 3aleaf blade 3astrain differences 3anutritive value 3agenotype 3arumen fermentation 3acorn stover 3aforage evaluation 3aruminants 3ahulls 0afeed quality 0adigestibility1 aGan, J.1 aSheng, L.X.1 aTan, Z.L.1 aTayo, G.O.1 aSun, Z.H.1 aWang, M.1 aRen, G.P.0 tAnimal.g2008 Dec., v. 2, no. 12 p.1772-1779dCambridge University Pressx1751-73117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311080031213Available from publisher's Web site  a20100524b20100605c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/04/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02847naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100001700175245007600192300001600268500002400284500001500308520124400323650001601567650002201583650002201605650002201627650003001649650002001679650001401699650001001713650002701723650001401750650002001764650001001784650001301794650002201807651001301829653001201842653002401854700002101878700001501899700001601914700001901930700001901949700002001968773011501988852000902103856008802112930003302200945002502233946001102258655001202269IND4418972820221121160937.0090410e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441897282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2009.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aX600 0aX1001 aMarkom, M.A.10aIntelligent electronic nose system for basal stem rot disease detection  ap. 140-146.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe agricultural industry has been, for a long time, dependent upon human expertise in using odour for classification, grading, differentiating and discriminating different types of produce. Odour as a parameter of differentiation can also be used to determine the state of health of crops, although this is not favourable when dealing with detecting plant disease that may pose health threats to human beings. In addition to these, human experts may take years of training and can be inconsistent, as well as prone to fatigue. This paper presents a work conducted on utilising an electronic nose incorporating artificial intelligence to detect plant disease, specifically basal stem rot (BSR) disease that is caused by Ganoderma boninense fungus affecting oil palm plantations in South East Asia. This study used a commercially available electronic nose, Cyranose 320, as the front end sensors and artificial neural networks for pattern recognition. The odour samples were captured on site at Besout oil palm plantation, Perak, Malaysia, and the classification performed on a PC.

Canada's most endangered salmon stock, the Thompson River coho salmon, is being studied extensively as managers attempt to reverse these population declines. Investigators are using acoustic telemetry to track the migratory behaviour and survival of the Thompson River (and other) coho salmon stocks. Coho salmon pre-smolts are relatively small compared with salmonid species that are typically studied using acoustic telemetry; therefore the identification of the appropriate sizes of fish and tags to use is critical. This study tested the effects of surgically implanting the three smallest sizes of acoustic tags currently available on the growth, survival, tag retention, swimming performance and physical condition of coho salmon pre-smolts for 300 days post-surgery. Maximum tag size to body size ratios ranged from 15-17% by fork length and 7-8% by mass for the three tag sizes (11 cm fork length for a 6 x 19 mm tag, 12.5 cm for a 7 x 19 mm tag, and 14 cm for a 9 x 21 mm tag). Based on our results, it is unlikely that coho salmon pre-smolts implanted with acoustic transmitters following these size guidelines would have poor survival in studies of freshwater migratory behaviour as a result of the surgery or the tag. 3aOncorhynchus kisutch 3abody size 3aendangered species 3aexercise 3afreshwater 3amanagers 3amortality 3apopulation dynamics 3arivers 3asalmon 3asurgery 3aswimming 3atelemetry 3aCanada 0aPre-smolts 0aAcoustic telemetry 0aTag effects1 aButterworth, Kevin G.1 aCubitt, K.

These starch ethers are cyanoethylated and carbamoylethylated starch. The different factors affecting the preparation of these ethers have been studied. These factors include mode of adding the different ingredients, reaction medium, sodium hydroxide/anhydroglucose unit molar ratio, monomer concentration, reaction temperature and duration. The extent of etherification and the etherification reaction efficiency (ERE) were traced by estimating nitrogen content, carboxyl and total ether contents. Comparison of the ERE on using the semi-dry state and the wet state processes indicates the privilege of the former. The highest degrees of substitution (DS) values obtained were 0.66 and 0.52 of carbamoylethylated and cyanoethylated starch samples, respectively, within the studied range. Conditions are described giving high DS at reaction times short enough to keep hydrolysis of polymer bound nitrile and amide groups low. At longer reaction times, the major side reaction during carbamoylethylation is hydrolysis and during cyanoethylation deetherification. 3aethers 3achemical reactions 0amodified starches 0acyanoethylation 0acrbamoylethylation1 aBeliakova, M.K.1 aAly, A.A.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2001 Nov., v. 46, no. 3 p.217-226x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02167naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100002000168245005200188300001600240500002400256500001500280520073000295650002701025650001601052650001301068650001501081650002201096650001801118650001801136650001101154650003701165650003601202650003501238653001801273653001901291653002301310653001601333700001901349700002501368773011201393852000901505856009001514930003301604945002501637946001101662655001201673IND4418974620221121135013.0090410e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441897462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2009.01.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ105 0aQ4051 aMattea, Facundo10aCarotenoid processing with supercritical fluids  ap. 255-265.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aRecent developments in carotenoids particle formation and coprecipitation with biodegradable polymers using supercritical fluids as antisolvent have been reviewed.

A requirement was taken as the sum of the needs for maintenance, for gain in carcass weight without feathers, and for the feathers. The maintenance requirement was considered to be the sum of the needs for replacing skin and intestinal losses and for the obligatory creatinine excretion in the urine. A comparative slaughter trial and nitrogen balance trials with growing and adult Taihe silky fowls, respectively, were conducted to estimate the parameters in the model. The amino acid requirements were then calculated with the constructed models. The results showed as following: the replacement needs for skin nitrogen loss was determined at 213.41 mg/d for adult male fowls (body weight 1.60 kg); creatinine excretion in these birds was 4.04 mg/d. when fed an nitrogen-free diets, the adult male fowls with body weight 1.60 kg excreted a total of 246.10 mg/d endogenous nitrogen. The net protein requirement for maintenance was estimated at 11.24 mg/wg0.75/d. Per gram of body weight gain contained 27.18 mg carcass nitrogen for growing birds in early stage, but feathers nitrogen in per gram of body weight gain increased with age. The amino acid requirements for growing Taihe silky fowls were slightly higher than for starting and growing pullets, but lower than that of broiler chicks. The amino acid requirements patterns changed with weeks of age. 3aadults 3aamino acids 3abody weight changes 3acarcass weight 3acreatinine 3aexcretion 3aintestines 3amales 3amathematical models 3anitrogen 3anitrogen balance 3aslaughter 3aurine1 aQu, Mingren1 aZhu, Nianhua1 aYan, Xianghua0 pAsian-Australas. j. anim. scig2003 Dec., v. 16, no. 12 p.1782-1788x1011-23677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5713/ajas.2003.17823Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120910  aNon-US 7aarticle02438naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002000142245010800162300001800270520125900288650001301547650000901560650002201569650001101591650002201602650002401624650002001648650000701668650001801675650001001693650002401703700001601727700002201743700002001765700001901785773008901804852000901893856008201902939003301984946001102017655001202028IND4464064020221121135103.0120910e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446406402DNAL7 a10.5713/ajas.2003.17552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchroeder, M.M.10aEffect of Total Mixed Ration Particle Size on Rumen pH, Chewing Activity, and Performance in Dairy Cows  ap. 1755-1762.  aTwo experiments were conducted to determine effects of particle size in total mixed ration (TMR) on performance of lactating cows. Three rumen cannulated Holstein cows were used in a 3x3 Latin square design for the metabolic experiment. The particle size of the diets was determined using the Penn State Particle Size Separator (PSPSS) and weighing the proportion of sample remaining on the top screen (19 mm diameter). The 3 treatments were short, medium or long diets (4.9, 24.2 and 27.8% of sample remaining on the top screen of the PSPSS, respectively). Nine farms in the Edmonton area were surveyed and the farms were placed into groups based on the particle size of the ration fed. The groups were short <6%, medium 7-12% and long >13% of sample weight remaining on the top screen of the PSPSS. Dry matter intake was greater (p=0.07) for the medium diet than the long diet in the metabolic study and resulted in a higher (p=0.07) efficiency of milk production. On the commercial farms, a significantly (p=0.002) lower milk fat percentage was observed for the long diet compared to the short diet. The results of these studies confirm that forage particle size influences milk composition and milk fat was negatively correlated to TMR particle size. 3aHolstein 3adiet 3adry matter intake 3aforage 3ametabolic studies 3amilk fat percentage 3amilk production 3apH 3aparticle size 3arumen 3atotal mixed rations1 aSoita, H.W.1 aChristensen, D.A.1 aKhorasani, G.R.1 aKennelly, J.J.0 pAsian-Australas. j. anim. scig2003 Dec., v. 16, no. 12 p.1755-1762x1011-23677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5713/ajas.2003.17553Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120910  aNon-US 7aarticle03856naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182100001600191245009200207300001800299500002400317500001500341520214700356650001302503650001402516650002602530650001602556650002702572650002002599650001902619650002502638650001302663650002002676650001802696650002102714650000902735650002802744650001402772650001402786650002402800650001902824650002202843650001202865650001702877653001102894653001602905700001702921700001902938700001602957773009402973852000903067856008503076930003303161945002503194946001103219655001203230IND4434430720221121104013.0100323e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443443072DNAL7 a224440912pmid7 a10.1017/S175173110800308X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL210 0aL2001 aQuesnel, H.10aInfluence of some sow characteristics on within-litter variation of piglet birth weight  ap. 1842-1849.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWithin-litter variation of piglet birth weight (BW0) is associated with an increased piglet mortality and a high variability in pig weight at weaning and weight or age at slaughter. Data collected in two experimental herds were used to quantify within-litter variability in BW0 and to assess the influence of factors mainly related to the sow. Within 24 h after birth, piglets born alive were individually weighed and stillborn piglets were collectively (first data set) or individually (second data set) weighed. The first data set was restricted to litters with no or only one stillborn piglet (3338 litters). It was used to assess the influence of genetic selection on BW0 variation by comparing litter characteristics before (1994 to 1996) and after (2001 to 2004) the development of hyperprolific sows in this herd. The second data set included all litters (n = 1596) from sows born between 2000 and 2004. For each litter, mean BW0 (mBW0) and its coefficient of variation (CV(BW0)) were calculated. Then, variance analyses were performed to test the influence of litter size, parity, year of sow birth and season at conception. Prolificacy improvement was associated with an increased CV(BW0) in litters from pure Large White (LW) and Landrace × Large White (LR × LW) crossbred sows. The CV(BW0) averaged 21% and was significantly influenced by litter size and parity. It increased from 15% to 24% when litter size varied from less than 10 piglets to more than 15 piglets. The proportion of small piglets (i.e. weighing less than 1 kg) increased concomitantly. The CV(BW0) was not repeatable from a parity to the following. It was lowest for first and second parities (20%) and thereafter increased progressively. The CV(BW0) was positively related to sow’s backfat thickness gain during gestation. Taking into account litter size, parity, year of sow birth and season at conception explained 20% of BW0 variation. Thus, major part of heterogeneity is due to other factors, presumably including embryo genotype, on the one hand, and factors that influence embryo and foetus development, such as epigenetic factors, on the other hand. 3aneonates 3afarrowing 3aparity (reproduction) 3afetal death 3aphenotypic correlation 3aliveweight gain 3aweaning weight 3aphenotypic variation 3abody fat 3amaternal effect 3ahealth status 3afemale fertility 3asows 3alitters (young animals) 3amortality 3aviability 3agenetic correlation 3adams (mothers) 3agenetic variation 3apiglets 3abirth weight 0atraits 0abody weight1 aBrossard, L.1 aValancogne, A.1 aQuiniou, N.0 tAnimal.g2008 Dec., v. 2, no. 12 p.1842-1849dCambridge University Pressx1751-73117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S175173110800308X3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/04/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03075naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245016300171300001800334500002400352520168600376650001602062650002002078650001902098650002202117650001502139650001302154650002502167650001402192650001902206650002502225651001002250653001702260653002002277653003302297653002702330653001902357653002302376700001502399700001502414700002002429773010402449852000902553856005502562655001202617IND4412782220221121065723.0081121e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441278222DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03976.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Fusheng.10aExtensive population expansion of Pedicularis longiflora (Orobanchaceae) on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and its correlation with the Quaternary climate change  ap. 5135-5145.  aIncludes references  aThe Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) is thought to be more strongly affected by the Quaternary glaciations than most other regions of the same latitude. It would be of great interest to investigate the population genetic structure of organisms distributed on the platform and its correlation with the Quaternary climatic oscillations. Here we used the chloroplast (cp)DNA trnT-trnF sequence to study genetic variation and phylogeography of Pedicularis longiflora, an alpine herb with extensive distribution on the QTP. Based on a range-wide sampling comprising 41 populations and 910 individuals, we detected 30 cpDNA haplotypes that were divided into five clades by phylogenetic and network analyses and a strong phylogeographical structure. All haplotypes but one in the three basal clades occur exclusively in the southeast QTP, whereas haplotypes in the young clade V occupy almost the whole species range. In particular, the young haplotype H18 occurs in 420 individuals, even at a frequency of 100% in some QTP platform populations and the Altai population. The haplotype distribution pattern, together with molecular clock estimation and mismatch distribution analysis, suggests that the southeast QTP was either a refuge for P. longiflora during the Quaternary climatic change or is the place of origin of the species. The present wide distribution of the species on the QTP platform has resulted from recent population expansions which could be dated back to 120 000-17 000 years ago, a period mostly before the last glacial maximum. The possible relationships among geographic genetic structure, climatic change and species diversification in Pedicularis are also discussed. 3aPedicularis 3achloroplast DNA 3aclimate change 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3alatitude 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3apopulation structure 3aChina 0acolonization 0acpDNA trnT-trnF 0aHimalayan-Hengduan Mountains 0aPedicularis longiflora 0aphylogeography 0aQuaternary glacier1 aLi, Yufei.1 aDing, Xin.1 aWANG, XIAO-QUAN0 tMolecular ecology.g2008 Dec., v. 17, no. 23 p.5135-5145dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03976.x 7aarticle03393naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002600181245010300207300001800310500002400328506007600352520175700428506003702185650002402222650001102246650002002257650001502277650002002292650001002312650001202322650001502334650001402349650002202363650001302385650001402398650001202412650002702424700001802451700002002469700002002489700001902509700001902528700002302547700001902570773013702589852000902726856008002735856004802815655001202863IND4392499620221207133835.0070617e20070615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439249962DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.00097-072doi7 aPMC19327092pmcid7 a174682652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoekema, Bouke K.H.L.10aHexadecane and Tween 80 Stimulate Lipase Production in Burkholderia glumae by Different Mechanisms  ap. 3838-3844.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBurkholderia glumae strain PG1 produces a lipase of biotechnological relevance. Lipase production by this strain and its derivative LU8093, which was obtained through classical strain improvement, was investigated under different conditions. When 10% hexadecane was included in the growth medium, lipolytic activity in both strains could be increased ~7-fold after 24 h of growth. Hexadecane also stimulated lipase production in a strain containing the lipase gene fused to the tac promoter, indicating that hexadecane did not affect lipase gene expression at the transcriptional level, which was confirmed using lipA-gfp reporter constructs. Instead, hexadecane appeared to enhance lipase secretion, since the amounts of lipase in the culture supernatant increased in the presence of hexadecane, with a concomitant decrease in the cells, even when protein synthesis was inhibited with chloramphenicol. In the presence of olive oil as a carbon source, nonionic detergents, such as Tween 80, increased extracellular lipase activity twofold. Like hexadecane, Tween 80 appeared to stimulate lipase secretion, although in a more disruptive manner, since other, normally nonsecreted proteins were found in the culture supernatant. Additionally, like olive oil, Tween 80 was found to induce lipase gene expression in strain PG1 in medium containing sucrose as a carbon source but not in glucose-containing medium, suggesting that lipase gene expression is prone to catabolite repression. In contrast, lipase production in the lipase-overproducing strain LU8093 was independent of the presence of an inducer and was not inhibited by glucose. In conclusion, hexadecane and Tween 80 enhance lipase production in B. glumae, and they act via different mechanisms.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBurkholderia glumae 3acarbon 3achloramphenicol 3adetergents 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglucose 3ahexadecane 3aolive oil 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3asecretion 3asucrose 3atriacylglycerol lipase1 aBeselin, Anke1 aBreuer, Michael1 aHauer, Bernhard1 aKoster, Margot1 aRosenau, Frank1 aJaeger, Karl-Erich1 aTommassen, Jan0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2007 June 15, v. 73, no. 12 p.3838-3844dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00097-073Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle01964naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245008200175300001600257520084000273650001301113650002101126650002301147650001301170650002201183650001301205650002301218653001201241653001601253653003001269700002101299773013701320852000901457856009201466930003301558946001101591655001201602IND4419829820221121055241.0090501e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441982982DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1470-6431.2009.00748.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarcketti, Sara B.10aConsumer concern, knowledge and attitude towards counterfeit apparel products  ap. 327-337.  aThe purpose of this paper was to explore the relationship of three variables (concern with apparel industry issues, knowledge about counterfeiting and attitude towards counterfeit apparel products) with consumer willingness towards paying a premium for non-counterfeit goods. The intent of the research was to develop a theoretically based foundation from which educators and apparel industry leaders can develop policy regarding counterfeit goods. Will consumer concern and knowledge influence the behavioural intent of paying more for non-counterfeit goods? We surveyed 244 undergraduate students within a fashion and apparel programme at a large Midwestern university. In this study, willingness to pay more for non-counterfeit goods increased directly with greater concern, knowledge and attitude towards counterfeit apparel goods. 3aclothing 3acollege students 3aconsumer attitudes 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3ateachers 3awillingness to pay 0aconcern 0acounterfeit 0atheory of reasoned action1 aShelley, Mack C.0 tInternational journal of consumer studies.g2009 May, v. 33, no. 3 p.327-337dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1470-64237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1470-6431.2009.00748.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090501b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03435naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001700157245006800174300001800242500002400260500001500284520135800299650002501657650001501682650001901697650001501716650001001731650001601741650001201757650001301769650002001782650001401802650002601816650001801842650001901860650002401879650003901903650007201942650005902014650002502073650001602098650002802114650002402142650001402166650007902180650005402259650005502313650007402368650003602442650002602478653001102504700001802515700002102533700002302554700002402577773010902601852000902710856007802719655001202797IND4448203720221121055302.0110126e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444820372DNAL7 a210628712pmid7 a10.1093/pcp/pcq1712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSahr, Tobias10aO-Carboxyl- and N-Methyltransferases Active on Plant Aquaporins  ap. 2092-2104.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMethylation of biologically active molecules is achieved by methyltransferases (MTases). MTases can act on proteins through N- or O-carboxylmethylation reactions. Methylation of lysine and glutamic acid residues was recently described on the N-terminal tail of AtPIP2;1, a plasma membrane aquaporin of plants. In this study, we combine a bioinformatic and a biochemical screen and identify two MTases of Arabidopsis thaliana, SDG7 (At2g44150) and OMTF3 (At3g61990), as acting on the N-terminal tail of AtPIP2;1, at Lys3 and Glu6, respectively. Confocal microscopy imaging showed the two enzymes to be associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. An in vitro assay using various AtPIP2;1 N-terminal peptides as a bait allowed characterization of the enzymatic properties of recombinant SDG7 and OMTF3. The two enzymes showed minimal apparent Km values for their substrates, S-adenosylmethionine and peptide, in the range of 5-8 and 2-9 μM, respectively. SDG7 was shown to almost exclusively mono- or di-methylate Lys3. In contrast, OMTF3 specifically methylated Glu6, this methylation being dependent on the methylation profile of the neighboring Lys3 residue. In conclusion, this study allows the characterization of the first MTases able to methylate plant transmembrane proteins and provides the first identification of a glutamate-MTase in eukaryotes. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amicroscopy 3aimage analysis 3aaquaporins 3abaits 3amethylation 3aenzymes 3apeptides 3aplasma membrane 3ascreening 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aglutamic acid 3aplant proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAquaporinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsisxchemistryxcytologyxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBiological Transport 2aMethylation 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeptidesxchemistry 2aPhylogeny 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxchemistryxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Methyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein O-Methyltransferasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aS-Adenosylmethioninexchemistry 2aSubstrate Specificity 0aplants1 aAdam, Thibaud1 aFizames, Cécile1 aMaurel, Christophe1 aSantoni, Véronique0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2010 Dec., v. 51, no. 12 p.2092-2104dOxford University Pressx0032-07817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcq1713Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02769naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245009000171300001400261520110200275650001101377650002001388650001601408650001301424650001901437650004101456650001101497650001901508650002501527650002601552650001301578650001701591650003501608650001801643653005001661653003501711653004101746653006101787700002201848700002101870700002101891700002301912700002001935700002401955700002401979773009802003852000902101856008502110930003302195946001102228655001202239IND4414591920221121044403.0090105e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441459192DNAL7 a10.1365/s10337-008-0679-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaruházi, Ágnes E. 10aGC-MS Identification and GC-FID Quantitation of Terpenoids in Ononidis spinosae Radix  ap. 71-76.  aA GC-MS method has been developed for the qualitative analysis of sterol and triterpene (terpenoid) constituents of Ononis spinosa L.

A validated GC-FID quantitative method was developed for measuring β-sitosterol, the main sterol component, in various extracts of this plant, obtained with organic solvents and by supercritical fluid extraction. The extracts were cleaned by saponifying and then the β-sitosterol was quantified in the non-saponifiable fractions by GC-FID with an internal standard. In addition, the relative concentrations of the other terpenoids were also determined. The β-sitosterol content in the non-saponifiable solvent extraction fractions was 0.19-5.5%, that of the supercritical fractions were 4.8-9.2%, depending on the experimental conditions. The hexane and the pilot scale SFE extracts were considered as main sources of terpenoids (71.8%; 93.3%, respectively). 3aOnonis 3abeta-sitosterol 3acampesterol 3acleaning 3aderivatization 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahexane 3aplant extracts 3aqualitative analysis 3aquantitative analysis 3asolvents 3astigmasterol 3asupercritical fluid extraction 3atriterpenoids 0aGas chromatography-flame ionization detection 0aSupercritical-fluid extraction 0aOnonis spinosa L.

The main muscles were cut into 1.2-cm cubes after being frozen. Muscle cubes were cooked for 20 minutes to an internal temperature of 70 degrees C and evaluated by a trained panel. Dynamic analysis showed that tough regions of meat cuts had a relatively high frequency of narrow fluorescence peaks subtending a small area under the fluorescence signal. Thus, for probe measurements made perpendicularly across muscles, the area under the fluorescence signal was correlated (p < 0.01) positively with tenderness (r = 0.57), and negatively with chewiness (r = -0.61) and residual tissue (r = -0.58). Thus, despite variation in post-mortem treatment and cooking, connective tissue toughness may contribute to the overall toughness of commercially competitive cuts of beef, and sensory responses may be partly predicted from rapid, relatively non-destructive measurements on the raw meat. 3ameat products 3alibraries 3afood quality 3afood composition 3acomputer science 0ainformation science1 aFindlay, C.J.0 tFood quality and preference.g1997 May, v. 8, no. 3 p.233-239x0950-32937nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02878naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002900164245006900193300001400262500002400276520105500300650002501355650001701380650001201397650002001409650001001429650001801439650001201457650001301469650001401482650001301496650002401509650006101533650004801594650003201642650006501674650005701739650001001796650002501806650002801831650005901859650006101918650004201979650005502021650005202076650005902128773010402187852000902291856004802300655001202348IND4408490820221120233548.0080801e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440849082DNAL7 a185166872pmid7 a10.1007/s11103-008-9350-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMüller-Moulé, Patricia13aAn expression analysis of the ascorbate biosynthesis enzyme VTC2  ap. 31-41.  aIncludes references  aThe vtc2 mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana is vitamin C deficient and is defective in the ascorbate biosynthesis enzyme GDP-l-Galactose phosphorylase/l-Galactose guanylyltransferase. The connection between the VTC2 gene and this enzyme has only recently been established, and little is known about the molecular characteristics of the VTC2 gene. In this paper, the expression of the VTC2 gene was characterized on both the RNA and the protein level. The VTC2 gene was expressed in all developmental stages, and the mRNA was expressed at a higher level in green tissues than in the root. VTC2 mRNA expression was induced strongly by exposing dark-grown seedlings to light, to levels higher than found in light-grown seedlings. A VTC2:GUS fusion protein was detected only in green tissues. Unexpectedly, a VTC2:YFP fusion protein was found not only in the cytosol, but also in the nucleus, which suggests that GDP-l-Galactose phosphorylase/l-Galactose guanylyltransferase might be a dual-function protein, which has both enzymatic and regulatory function. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3abiosynthesis 3aenzymes 3agene expression 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3amutants 3aproteins 3aseedlings 3avitamins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAscorbic Acidxbiosynthesis 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmentalxradiation effects 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxradiation effects 2aLight 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhosphoric Monoester Hydrolasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSeedlingsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism.0 tPlant molecular biology.g2008 Sept., v. 68, no. 1-2 p.31-41dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-008-9350-4 7aarticle03042naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100003300152245008100185300001600266520175700282650002902039650001702068650001102085650002702096650001502123650002502138650001302163650001502176650001302191650002102204650001702225650002002242650001602262650001602278650001702294653001502311653001802326773011702344852000902461856009202470930003302562946001302595655001202608IND4413078820221120200926.0081128e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441307882DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1526-100X.2008.00486.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavao-Zuckerman, Mitchell A.14aThe Nature of Urban Soils and Their Role in Ecological Restoration in Cities  ap. 642-649.  aCurrent and predicted trends indicate that an increasing proportion of the world's population is living in urban and suburban places. The nature of the urban environment becomes an important factor if we are concerned with the restoration and preservation of biodiversity and ecosystems in and around cities. This article highlights the varied impacts of cities on soils and their implications for restoration planning and expectations of restoration "success." Urban soils exist in different historical and formational trajectories than their local nonurbanized counterparts due to direct anthropogenic disturbance and indirect environmental impacts from urbanization. Therefore, urban soils often exhibit altered physical, chemical, and biological characteristics in comparison to local nonurbanized soils. Several unique features of urban soils and urban ecosystems pose particular issues for ecological restoration or the improvement of degraded soil conditions in cities. The creation of novel soil types, conditions that promote invasion by non-natives, the strong influence of past land use on soil properties, and the presence of strong interactions and alternative stable states set up unique difficulties for the restoration of urban soils. Soils in urban restorations are a medium that can be deliberately manipulated to improve site conditions or in the monitoring of soil conditions as indices of ecosystem status. Including an explicit role for strong manipulations of soils in urban ecosystems changes how we approach baselines, management, and reference conditions in urban ecological restoration. With an understanding of urban soil ecological knowledge, we can guide aspects of urban ecological restoration toward successful outcomes. 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiodiversity 3acities 3aecological restoration 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3aland use 3amonitoring 3aplanning 3asoil degradation 3asoil ecology 3asoil properties 3aurban areas 3aurban soils 3aurbanization 0aresilience 0aurban ecology0 tRestoration ecology.g2008 Dec., v. 16, no. 4 p.642-649dMalden, USA : Blackwell Publishing Incx1061-29717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2008.00486.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081128b20081206c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02941naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245007500179300001600254520135300270650002301623650002401646650001001670650001601680650001701696650001401713650001101727650001201738650000901750650001701759650001101776650003101787650000901818650002401827650002301851650001401874650003401888650002201922653001701944653001901961653001201980653003101992653002402023653002502047700001602072700001802088700001302106773009302119852000902212856008502221930003302306945001302339946001102352655001202363IND2327578420221120191018.0020617e200112  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232757842DNAL7 a118000352pmid7 a10.1007/s00359-001-0249-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFisher, S.10aInteraction of vibrational and visual cues in parasitoid host location  ap. 785-791.  aFemale parasitoids are guided by multisensory information during host finding. Individual cues are used in an interactive or a hierarchical manner according to the relative importance on the spatial scale of their effect. Unlike most studies that concentrate on single cues, the present paper investigates the interaction of two physical cues. The interaction of mechanosensory and visual cues was studied in the pupal parasitoid Pimpla turionellae (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae). This species uses, amongst other senses, vibrational sounding (echolocation in a solid substrate) to find its mainly endophytic hosts. Location and frequency of ovipositor insertions were scored on cylindrical plant stem models with single or combined cues. Single-cue experiments show that parasitoids use both visual and mechanosensory cues and achieve a similar precision of host location with either cue. The combination of vision and vibrational sounding increased the precision of host location by a factor of approximately two to three. We conclude that the two senses interact, resulting in an additive accuracy. Neither the visual nor the mechanosensory cue was favored when offered adjacent to each other on the same stem model. On the investigated spatial scale, both physical cues are used and seem to be equally important for host location in this species. 3aPimpla turionellae 3aGalleria mellonella 3apupae 3aparasitoids 3ahost seeking 3avibration 3avision 2aAnimals 2aCues 2aEcholocation 2aFemale 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aMale 2aMothsxparasitology 2aPupaxparasitology 2aVibration 2aVisual Perceptionxphysiology 2aWaspsxphysiology 0ainteractions 0avisual stimuli 0astimuli 0amultisensory host location 0amechanosensory cues 0avibrational sounding1 aSamietz, J.1 aWackers, F.L.1 aDorn, S.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2001 Dec., v. 187, no. 10 p.785-791x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-001-0249-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02038naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007200127300001600199520121300215650001101428650002501439650001401464650001101478650002301489650002301512700001901535700001901554773008501573852000901658930003301667945001301700946001101713655001201724IND2290666620221120181603.0010427e200007  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND229066662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaeger, S.R.10aBehavioural extensions to preference mapping: the role of synthesis  ap. 349-359.  aIt is suggested to tackle unsolved methodological problems in preference mapping by taking account of the behavioural processes underlying preference formation. To this end an information processing model of preference formation is proposed. Within this model we particularly consider the process of synthesis, which is the way sensory information about product similarities and differences is analysed and processed. Although current applications of external preference mapping assume that consumers and trained judges synthesise sensory stimuli similarly, accumulating evidence in the literature suggests that this is not so. We, therefore, propose that analysing preference data in terms of a product space that accurately reflects how consumers see products will improve preference mapping methodology. Differences in synthesis are accounted for by applying sets of synthesis weights reflecting differences in the relative weighting given to each sensory attribute. An empirical analysis of sensory and preference data pertaining to eating apples supports the hypothesis that consumers use only a few key sensory attributes rather than synthesise a large number of attributes during preference formation. 3aapples 3aconsumer preferences 3aingestion 3amodels 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties1 aWakeling, I.N.1 aMacfie, H.J.H.0 tFood quality and preference.g2000 July, v. 11, no. 4 p.349-359x0950-32937nnas  aDNAL  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01007naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008800127300001600215520030000231650001700531650003100548650002300579773008500602852000900687930003300696945001300729946001100742655001200753IND2290666520221120181716.0010427e200007  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND229066652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Calve, G.10aAbout some problems arising in sensory analysis and some propositions to solve them  ap. 341-347.  aSensory analysis is an experimental science where statistical science and its techniques can make a major contribution.

Their innervation by cochlear cholinergic efferent fibers and the presence of contractile proteins suggest that hyaline cells may actively regulate basilar membrane mechanics. The cholinergic pharmacology of hyaline cells was studied by measuring the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) of fura2-loaded cells in the chicken cochlea in vitro. Superfusion of the cholinergic agonist carbachol produced a dose-dependent increase in hyaline cell [Ca2+]i (EC50=1.05 micromol l-1) and small responses in short hair cells. Calcium increases in hyaline cells were evoked by the muscarinic agonists oxotremorine (100 micromol l-1) and muscarine (100 micromol l-1) whereas nicotine (100 micromol l-1, 200 micromol l-1) was without effect. Carbachol-evoked responses were blocked by the muscarinic antagonist atropine (greater than or equal to 10(-13) mol l-1) and were unaffected by the nicotinic antagonists d-tubocurare (100 micromol l-1, 1 mmol l-1) and hexamethonium (100 micromol l-1). Responses persisted in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and were abolished by thapsigargin (1 micromold l-1). These results indicate that the cholinergic-stimulated increase in hyaline cell [Ca2+]i is due to a muscarinic-mediated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. This is the first evidence that hyaline cells possess a muscarinic receptor whose activation causes mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. 3achickens 3ahearing 3aepithelium 3acells 3aears 3aion transport 3acarbachol 3anicotine 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3ainorganic ions 3acalcium 3acholinergic receptors 2aAnimals 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aChickens 2aEpithelial Cellsxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aIntracellular Membranesxmetabolism 2aOrgan of Cortixcytologyxmetabolism. 2aPregnancy 2aReceptors, Muscarinicxmetabolism 0amodulation 0acholinergic mechanisms 0acochlea 0athapsigargin1 aZirpel, L.1 aStone, J.S.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2002 June, v. 188, no. 5 p.381-395x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-002-0312-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030101b20030107c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle03544naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001900165245013500184300001600319500002400335520129300359650001501652650002301667650002201690650001901712650003601731650002501767650003101792650001901823650002201842650001601864650001501880650001101895650000701906650002201913650001401935650005301949650004602002650004002048650003502088650004202123650003302165650003102198650002802229650002902257650001302286650003402299650002102333650002802354650003002382650002402412650002402436650002402460650002202484700002702506700002602533700002202559700003202581700002702613773012302640852000902763856008602772655001202858IND4477902620221120181738.0140303s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447790262DNAL7 a125757502pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.2.1592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVinuesa, Pablo10aGenetic Analysis of a pH-Regulated Operon from Rhizobium tropici CIAT899 Involved in Acid Tolerance and Nodulation Competitiveness  ap. 159-168.  aIncludes references  aRhizobium tropici CIAT899 is highly acid tolerant and a good competitor for Phaseolus vulgaris nodule occupancy at low pH values. Using Tn5 mutagenesis, we identified an operon required for acid tolerance and nodulation competitiveness. The insertion was mapped to the 5′ end of atvA, encoding a product with high sequence identity to the agrobacterial AcvB virulence protein. Complementation analyses indicated that atvA is an ortholog of acvB, both genes being required for acid tolerance. A Ser/Ala substitution in the LIPASE_SER motif of AtvA resulted in an acid sensitive Fix+ but very poorly competing strain, demonstrating that Ser-313 is essential for AtvA function. atvA is the second gene in an operon that is transcriptionally upregulated by acid shock. The acid-responsive promoter was mapped to a 469-bp intergenic region located upstream of lpiA, the first gene in the operon. lpiA-like genes are found in several α, β, and γ Proteobacteria that interact with eukaryotic host cells, and they are predicted to encode membrane proteins related to the FmtC/MprF family from low G+C Firmicutes. The latter proteins are involved in resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides. A nonpolar deletion in lpiA caused a sevenfold decrease in relative nodulation competitiveness. 3aFirmicutes 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aRhizobium tropici 3aacid tolerance 3aantimicrobial cationic peptides 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3agene expression regulation 3aintergenic DNA 3amembrane proteins 3amutagenesis 3anodulation 3aoperon 3apH 3asequence analysis 3avirulence 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA Transposable Elementsxgenetics 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aMutation 2aOpen Reading Framesxgenetics 2aOperonxgenetics 2aPhaseolusxmicrobiology 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiology 2aRestriction Mapping 2aRhizobiumxgenetics 2aSymbiosisxgenetics 2aVirulence Factors1 aNeumann-Silkow, Frauke1 aPacios-Bras, Cristina1 aSpaink, Herman P.1 aMartínez-Romero, Esperanza1 aWerner, D.q(Dietrich)0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2003 Feb., v. 16, no. 2 p.159-168dAPS PresswJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.2.1593Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01725naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245006200124300001600186520101800202650001701220650001401237650001101251700001801262700001601280773008501296852000901381930003301390945001301423946001101436655001201447IND2290666020221120181555.0010427e200007  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND229066602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLange, C.10aExpected versus experienced quality: trade-off with price  ap. 289-297.  aThis study was conducted in order to compare the behaviour of consumers who had to choose products under economic constraint in two conditions: when perceived quality was based on expectation generated by packaging images, versus when perceived quality was based on sensory experience in presence of packaging images. Randomly selected participants were endowed with a real budget and placed in five different price/budget situations. They stated their choice among six orange juices in each price/budget situation. This task was performed for the two different information conditions. Results demonstrate that participants who chose products without tasting made their choices more rapidly, chose a larger number of variants and their choices tended to be less influenced by liking scores, as compared to participants who chose products after tasting. The comparison between these two conditions permitted us to understand behaviour differences when consumers were in a total or restricted information situation. 3aorange juice 3apackaging 3aprices1 aIssanchou, S.1 aCombris, P.0 tFood quality and preference.g2000 July, v. 11, no. 4 p.289-297x0950-32937nnas  aDNAL  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01537naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012200128300001600250520070500266650000900971650001700980650001000997650001401007650001401021650001101035650001001046700001701056773008401073852000901157930003301166945001301199946001101212655001201223IND2290665320221120181607.0010427e200005  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND229066532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcebron, L.B.14aThe importance of intrinsic and extrinsic cues to expected and experienced quality: an empirical application for beef  ap. 229-238.  aThis study explains how consumers form in-store expectations about beef quality, and how these insights can help us to determine optimum levels of beef quality. Consumers infer the quality of beef on the basis of intrinsic (colour, freshness and visible fat) and extrinsic (price, promotion, designation of origin and presentation) quality cues. During consumption consumers evaluate experienced quality based on expected quality and quality attributes such as taste, tenderness and juiciness, confirming or disproving their previously formed expectations. Expected quality is a partial predictor of experienced quality, which confirms the importance of sensory perception at the time of consumption. 3abeef 3abeef quality 3acolor 3afreshness 3ajuiciness 3aprices 3ataste1 aDopico, D.C.0 tFood quality and preference.g2000 May, v. 11, no. 3 p.229-238x0950-32937nnas  aDNAL  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01551naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002700181245006800208300001800276500002400294506007600318520031100394506003700705650001800742650001500760650001000775650001400785650001200799650001300811650001400824700002100838700001900859700002300878700002700901773013600928852000901064856008001073655001201153IND4401643120221207121809.0080217e20080215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440164312DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02347-072doi7 aPMC22585922pmcid7 a180838862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakravorty, Adityarup10aSensitivity of an Acinetobacter baylyi mpl Mutant to DNA Damage  ap. 1273-1275.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA mutant derived from Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 was isolated from a screen for genes involved in the response to DNA damage.

The incidence is variable, depending on the definition used and the intensity of the search for a primary tumour. From a biological and prognostic point of view, it is helpful to distinguish eight clinical entities of the CUP syndrome; four of these entities can be subdivided histologically. Histopathologic diagnosis should be performed using a diagnostic algorithm based on the HE morphology and supplemented by immunohistochemistry. With the use of a broad spectrum of immunohistochemical markers, many tumour entities can be diagnosed, so in most cases molecular genetic investigations are not necessary. 0aCUP syndrome 0aUnknown primary tumour 0aHistopathologic diagnosis 0aImmunohistochemical characterisation1 aHorn, L.-C. 0 tPathologe.g2009 Mar., v. 30, no. 2 p.125-130dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0172-81137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00292-008-1117-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20090327b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01745naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008000128300001600208520093800224650001701162650001201179650001001191650000901201650002401210700001601234700001701250700001301267773008501280852000901365930003301374945001301407946001101420655001201431IND2290667420221120172937.0010427e200011  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND229066742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCristovam, E.10aGender preference in hedonic ratings for espresso and espresso-milk coffees  ap. 437-444.  aEspresso, cappuccino and latte are new coffee products entering the daily lives of many consumers. There is increasing consumption of such speciality coffees by no sensory basis for new product development. This study was designed to meet this need. Preference in 100 consumers was studied using six espresso blends of coffee beans. Blends specifically developed to match key European and North American styles. Products prepared were both espresso and espresso-milk coffees. It was observed that females and males had different preferences for espresso coffee but that this effect was reduced on addition of milk. Gender of target consumer, and end use of espresso, should be thus considered in developing coffee blends. In this way acceptability in specific or target groups of consumers can be maximised. In addition individuals may experience a development of appreciation of coffee character reflected in a change in preference. 3acoffee beans 3afemales 3amales 3amilk 3aproduct development1 aRussell, C.1 aPaterson, A.1 aReid, E.0 tFood quality and preference.g2000 Nov., v. 11, no. 6 p.437-444x0950-32937nnas  aDNAL  a20010601b20010612c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle04122naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001700165245020800182300001600390500002400406520186800430650002502298650002102323650002702344650004002371650001802411650002302429650001302452650001002465650002002475650001002495650001802505650001202523650001402535650001902549650006702568650004802635650004502683650001402728650004102742650002202783650003802805650001302843650005102856650001402907650004402921650003102965650002802996650005103024650004603075650002403121700002103145700002403166700002503190700002303215700001603238773012303254852000903377856008603386655001203472IND4477903920221120151022.0140303s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447790392DNAL7 a128484242pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.7.5882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNandi, Ashis10aEthylene and Jasmonic Acid Signaling Affect the NPR1-Independent Expression of Defense Genes Without Impacting Resistance to Pseudomonas syringae and Peronospora parasitica in the Arabidopsis ssi1 Mutant  ap. 588-599.  aIncludes references  aSalicylic acid (SA), ethylene, and jasmonic acid (JA) are important signaling molecules in plant defense to biotic stress. An intricate signaling network involving SA, ethylene, and JA fine tunes plant defense responses. SA-dependent defense responses in Arabidopsis thaliana are mediated through NPR1-dependent and -independent mechanisms. We have previously shown that activation of an NPR1-independent defense mechanism confers enhanced disease resistance and constitutive expression of the pathogenesis-related (PR) genes in the Arabidopsis ssi1 mutant. In addition, the ssi1 mutant constitutively expresses the defensin gene PDF1.2. Moreover, SA is required for the ssi1-conferred constitutive expression of PDF1.2 in addition to PR genes. Hence, the ssi1 mutant appears to target a step common to SA- and ethylene- or JA-regulated defense pathways. In the present study, we show that, in addition to SA, ethylene and JA signaling also are required for the ssi1-conferred constitutive expression of PDF1.2 and the NPR1-independent expression of PR-1. Furthermore, the ethylene-insensitive ein2 and JA-insensitive jar1 mutants enhance susceptibility of ssi1 plants to the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea. However, defects in either the ethylene- or JA-signaling pathways do not compromise ssi1-conferred resistance to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola and the oomycete pathogen Peronospora parasitica. Interestingly, ssi1 exhibits a marginal increase in the levels of ethylene and JA, suggesting that low endogenous levels of these phytohormones are sufficient to activate expression of defense genes. Taken together, our results indicate that although cross talk in ssi1 renders expression of ethylene- or JA-responsive defense genes sensitive to SA and vice versa, it does not affect downstream signaling leading to resistance. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aPeronospora parasitica 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola 3abiotic stress 3adisease resistance 3aethylene 3afungi 3agene expression 3agenes 3ajasmonic acid 3amutants 3apathogens 3asalicylic acid 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxgeneticsximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCyclopentanesxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aDefensins 2aEthylenesxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aFungixphysiology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aMutation 2aNucleotidyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOxylipins 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPseudomonasxphysiology 2aReceptors, Cell Surfacexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSalicylic Acidxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aSignal Transduction1 aKachroo, Pradeep1 aFukushige, Hirotada1 aHildebrand, David F.1 aKlessig, Daniel F.1 aShah, Jyoti0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2003 July, v. 16, no. 7 p.588-599dAPS PresswJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.7.5883Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03756naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002300165245009700188300001600285500002400301520178200325650002502107650002502132650001602157650001902173650003702192650001702229650001202246650001402258650001402272650002702286650002402313650006502337650004602402650003802448650003002486650002702516650003202543650003102575650002202606650002802628650003102656650001402687650002902701650005002730650002302780651001502803700002002818700003302838700002102871700002102892700002302913773012302936852000903059856008603068655001203154IND4477904120221120151133.0140303s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447790412DNAL7 a128484262pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.7.6082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRevers, Frédéric10aMultiple Resistance Phenotypes to Lettuce mosaic virus Among Arabidopsis thaliana Accessions  ap. 608-616.  aIncludes references  aWith the aim to characterize plant and viral factors involved in the molecular interactions between plants and potyviruses, a Lettuce mosaic virus (LMV)-Arabidopsis thaliana pathosystem was developed. Screening of Arabi-dopsis accessions with LMV isolates indicated the existence of a large variability in the outcome of the interaction, allowing the classification of Arabidopsis accessions into seven susceptibility groups. Using a reverse genetic approach, the genome-linked protein of LMV, a multifunc-tional protein shown to be involved in viral genome amplification and movement of potyviruses, was established as the viral determinant responsible for the ability to overcome the resistance of the Niederzenz accession to LMV-0. Preliminary genetic analyses from F2 and recombinant inbred lines available between susceptible and resistant Arabidopsis accessions revealed the existence of at least three resistance phenotypes to LMV with different genetic bases. One dominant resistance gene, designated LLM1, involved in blocking the replication or cell-to-cell movement of the LMV-0 isolate in the Columbia accession, was mapped to chromosome I and shown to be linked to the marker nga280. At the same time, genetic analyses of segregating F2 populations were consistent with the restriction of the systemic movement of the LMV-AF199 isolate in Columbia being controlled by two dominant genes and with the complete resistance to all tested LMV isolates of the Cape Verde islands (Cvi) accession being conferred by a single recessive resistance gene. Sequencing of the eu-karyotic translation initiation factor 4E genes from the different LMV-resistant Arabidopsis accessions showed that these factors are not directly involved in the characterized resistance phenotypes. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aLettuce mosaic virus 3achromosomes 3adominant genes 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3ainbred lines 3aislands 3aphenotype 3ascreening 3atranslation (genetics) 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxclassificationxgeneticsximmunologyxvirology. 2aEukaryotic Initiation Factorsxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Dominantxgenetics 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aGenetic Variationxgenetics 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aLettucexvirology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMosaic Virusesximmunology 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Diseasesxvirology 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsximmunologyxvirology. 2aSequence Alignment 3aCape Verde1 aGuiraud, Thomas1 aHouvenaghel, Marie-Christine1 aMauduit, Thierry1 aLe Gall, Olivier1 aCandresse, Thierry0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2003 July, v. 16, no. 7 p.608-616dAPS PresswJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.7.6083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02856naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245009300190300001600283520119900299650001601498650001001514650002001524650003101544650001001575650001601585650001501601650002101616650001301637650002901650650001801679650002201697650003301719650004101752650003001793650003801823650002901861650004401890650005801934650002501992653001302017653002402030700001602054773012302070852000902193856009202202930003302294946001102327655001202338IND4417648120221120140909.0090313e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441764812DNAL7 a192228082pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-7652.2009.00398.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdeen, Ashraf14aThe pleiotropic effects of the bar gene and glufosinate on the Arabidopsis transcriptome  ap. 266-282.  aThe Arabidopsis transcriptome was studied using the Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChip in wild-type plants and glufosinate-tolerant transgenic plants expressing the bialaphos resistance (bar) gene. Pleiotropic effects were specifically generated in the transcriptomes of transgenic plants by both the bar gene and glufosinate treatments. In the absence of glufosinate, four genes were differentially expressed in the transgenic lines and another 80 genes were differentially expressed in the presence of glufosinate, 29 of which were specific to transgenic plants. In contrast, the number of differentially expressed genes specific to wild-type plants was 194 during the early response at 6 h of glufosinate treatment, and increased to 3711 during the late response at 48 h. Although the wild-type plants undergo extensive transcriptional reprofiling in response to herbicide-induced stress and, finally, plant death, the transgenic plants appear to activate other detoxification processes to offset the toxic effects of the residual herbicide or its derivatives. This study provides the first description of the pleiotropic effects of the bar gene and glufosinate on the plant transcriptome. 3aArabidopsis 3adeath 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglufosinate 3apleiotropy 3aresidual effects 3atoxicity 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3atransgenic plants 2aAminobutyratesxpharmacology 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aHerbicidesxpharmacology 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 0abar gene 0apleiotropic effects1 aMiki, Brian0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2009 Apr., v. 7, no. 3 p.266-282dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-76447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-7652.2009.00398.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090314b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02437naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147072000900156100001700165245005700182300001400239500002400253500001500277520111100292650001301403650001301416650001201429650000901441650002101450650001501471650001601486650002501502650004101527651001001568653001801578653002701596700001701623700001801640700001701658700001701675773009801692852000901790856008701799930003301886945002501919946001101944655001201955IND4434554120221120105429.0100326e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443455412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2010.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aN200 0aJ7101 aJia, Honglei10aCombined stalk-stubble breaking and mulching machine  ap. 42-48.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe stalk-stubble breaking and mulching process is a core technique for some conservation tillage system. Over the past 10 years, this technique has been widely adopted in the dry farming area of northern China. On the basis of analyzing the existing problems in stalk-breaking and stubble-breaking machines, we have developed a combined stalk-stubble breaking and mulching machine with two frames fixed together, the stalk and stubble-breaking blade rotors were mounted respectively on the frames. The machine can be used to break the maize (Zea mays L.) stalk and stubble and bury about one-third of the broken stalk and stubble in the soil, preventing them being blown away by wind. This paper describes the structural features of the machine, the design of main working parts, determination of the parameters of the central position of the two blade rotors, and presents the performance test results. The tests showed that the machine had a stalk-breaking rate of 89% and the vegetation coverage rate reached 67.9%, which meets the agro-technical requirements in the dry farming area of northern China. 3amulching 3aZea mays 3astubble 3acorn 3aequipment design 3aprototypes 3acorn stover 3aconservation tillage 3aagricultural machinery and equipment 3aChina 0acrop residues 0astalk-stubble breaking1 aWang, Lichun1 aLi, Chunsheng1 aTan, Hongjie1 aMa, Chenglin0 tSoil & tillage research.g2010 Mar., v. 107, no. 1 p.42-48dElsevier Sciencex0167-19877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2010.02.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20100607b20100703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02949naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001800156245011400174300001600288520144800304650002801752650001101780650001201791650002301803650001401826650001401840650002601854650001201880650002701892650002601919650001001945650002401955650002801979650003902007650001402046650002502060650002602085650002902111700001702140700001702157700001302174700001302187773008702200852000902287856007802296930003302374945001302407946001102420655001202431IND2042659720221120095656.0941017s1994    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204265972DNAL7 a80718942pmid7 a10.1007/BF002151142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStewart, B.A.10aImproved stability of Drosophila larval neuromuscular preparations in haemolymph-like physiological solutions  ap. 179-191.  aNeuromuscular preparations from third instar larvae of Drosophila are not well-maintained in commonly used physiological solutions: vacuoles form in the muscle fibers, and membrane potential declines. These problems may result from the Na:K ratio and total divalent cation content of these physiological solutions being quite different from those of haemolymph. Accordingly haemolymph-like solutions, based upon ion measurements of major cations, were developed and tested. Haemolymph-like solutions maintained the membrane potential at a relatively constant level, and prolonged the physiological life of the preparations. Synaptic transmission was well-maintained in haemolymph-like solutions, but the excitatory synaptic potentials had a slower time course and summated more effectively with repetitive stimulation, than in standard Drosophila solutions. Voltage-clamp experiments suggest that these effects are linked to more pronounced activation of muscle fiber membrane conductances in standard solutions, rather than to differences in passive muscle membrane properties or changes in postsynaptic receptor channel kinetics. Calcium dependence of transmitter release was steep in both standard and haemolymph-like solutions, but higher external calcium concentrations were required for a given level of release in haemolymph-like solutions. Thus, haemolymph-like solutions allow for prolonged, stable recording of synaptic transmission. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3alarvae 3aneurons 3amembrane potential 3ahemolymph 3asolutions 3asynaptic transmission 2aAnimals 2aDrosophilaxphysiology 2aHemolymphxphysiology 2aLarva 2aMembrane Potentials 2aMusclesxultrastructure 2aNeuromuscular Junctionxphysiology 2aSolutions 2aSynapsesxphysiology 2aSynaptic Transmission 2aVacuolesxultrastructure1 aAtwood, H.L.1 aRenger, J.J.1 aWang, J.1 aWu, C.F.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1994, v. 175, no. 2 p.179-191x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002151143Available from publisher's Web site  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdTLX  aNon-US 7aarticle02782naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001500138245008600153300001600239520179000255650001902045650001102064650001302075650002202088650002002110650002302130653001602153653001402169700001802183773008702201852000902288856007802297930003302375945001302408946001102421655001202432IND2042659620221120095629.0941017s1994    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204265962DNAL7 a10.1007/BF002151132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLehrer, M.10aApproaching and departing bees learn different cues to the distance of a landmark  ap. 171-177.  aBees learn both the absolute distance and the apparent size of landmarks in the vicinity of a foraging site. They learn about landmarks both when approaching and when leaving the site. Whereas learning on arrival can take place on every visit to the food source, learning on departure is limited to the first few visits, when the bee Turns Back and Looks (TBL) at the feeder in a stereotyped manoeuvre before flying off. We investigated whether one specific function of TBLs is to acquire information about the absolute distance of landmarks from the feeding site. Bees were trained to forage from a feeder which lay at a fixed distance from a cylinder. During training, bees were exposed to the cylinder either only while they approached and landed on the feeder, or only on their departure from it, or at both of these times. Tests on trained bees immediately after the TBL phase revealed that those bees which had viewed the cylinder only on arrival had learnt the apparent size of the cylinder, but not its distance from the feeder. In contrast, bees which saw the cylinder on departure had learnt its absolute distance. They also learnt the cylinder's apparent size, provided that the cylinder was close to the feeder. Bees which had viewed the cylinder on arrival as well as on departure learnt both absolute distance and apparent size. Distance dominated the bees' behaviour in the initial phase of learning, apparent size was more important later on. We suggest that early during learning bees need information about the 3-D structure of the environment so that they can identify those landmarks close to a foraging site which will specify accurately the site's position. This information is acquired during TBLs. Later, landmark guidance can be achieved by 2-D image matching. 3aApis mellifera 3aflight 3alearning 3aworker honey bees 3aanimal behavior 3adistance education 0aorientation 0alandmarks1 aCollett, T.S.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1994, v. 175, no. 2 p.171-177x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002151133Available from publisher's Web site  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdTLX  aNon-US 7aarticle03859naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147100002200156245011500178300001400293500002400307500001500331520214400346650001102490650001702501650003202518650002102550650001202571650002502583650001202608650002002620650001302640650001402653650001502667650001702682650001902699650001202718650002002730650001202750650001802762651001002780653001402790653002002804653001002824700001602834700002102850700001402871700002302885700001602908700001502924700001602939700001502955773009802970852000903068856008703077930003303164945002503197946001103222655001203233IND4434554220140725000000.0100326e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443455422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2010.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ2001 aBecerra, A.

Our main objective was to evaluate the vertical distribution of soil compaction induced by traffic of two tractors with different weights, one light (LT=15kN) and one heavy (HT=50kN), passing 0, 1, 3, 5 and 8 times over the same track on Aridisol soil. The work was performed in the Vélez Blanco District of Almería in southeast Spain. Outlined hypothesis were: (a) subsoil compaction distribution due to tractor traffic on recently tilled soils in almond orchard depends on total axle load and tractor passes, (b) topsoil compaction produced by tractor traffic depends on tractor passes and ground pressure. Variables measured were (CI) cone index, (BD) bulk density, (TSP) total soil porosity and (RD) rut depth. The relevant results were: in topsoil (0-200mm), 1, 3, 5 and 8 passes of a LT caused mean values of CI of 1420, 1825, 1950 and 2050kPa respectively, while for the HT with the same number of passes the values were of 1235, 1520, 1630 and 2510kPa respectively. BD mean values had a similar behavior: 1.35, 1.38, 1.51 and 1.55Mgm⁻³ for 1, 3, 5 and 8 passes of a LT and 1.30, 1.32, 1.41 and 1.52 for the HT with the same number of passes. In the subsoil (200-600mm) the HT caused higher CI and BD values than the LT. CI mean values of the LT were between 1705 and 2490kPa, while the HT produced 2100-2790kPa of CI. BD mean values were between 1.58 and 1.7Mgm⁻³ for the LT and 1.65-1.77Mgm⁻³ for the HT. Hence, the data support both hypotheses. No significant differences were found in RD between HT and LT when they passed 1, 3 or 5 times, but there was a difference when traffic raised up to 8 passes (143mm RD for HT). The main conclusions were: (a) this work has shown that soil compaction resulting from tractor traffic increases CI and BD and decreases total soil porosity. The data of CI and BD indicated that Almond orchard soil is unable to limit subsoil compaction under moderate traffic intensity. (b) Up to the fifth pass of either a FWA or 2WD tractor, ground pressure is responsible for topsoil compaction. 3aweight 3awheel tracks 3asoil penetration resistance 3asoil pore system 3asubsoil 3aspatial distribution 3atillage 3acompacted soils 3atractors 3afrequency 3asoil depth 3abulk density 3atrafficability 3atopsoil 3asoil compaction 3aalmonds 3aPrunus dulcis 3aSpain 0arut depth 0aground pressure 0aloads1 aBotta, G.F.1 aBravo, X.

Two pooling protocols were compared: a halving protocol involving a single retest of negative pools followed by halving of positive pools and a simple protocol involving single retest of negative pools but no halving of positive pools. For both protocols, all component samples in positive pools were then tested individually. In the simulations, the distributions of number of tests required to classify all individuals in an infected herd were generated for various combinations of prevalence (0.01, 0.05 and 0.1), herd size (300, 1000 and 3000), pool size (5, 10, 20 and 50) and test sensitivity (0.5-0.9). Test specificity was fixed at 1.0 because fecal culture for MAP yields no or rare false-positive results. Optimal performance was determined primarily on the basis of a comparison of the distributions of numbers of tests needed to detect MAP-infected cows using the Mann-Whitney U test statistic. Optimal pool size was independent of both herd size and test characteristics, regardless of protocol. When sensitivity was the same for each pool size, pool sizes of 20 and 10 performed best for both protocols for prevalences of 0.01 and 0.1, respectively, while for prevalences of 0.05, pool sizes of 10 and 20 were optimal for the simple and halving protocols, respectively. When sensitivity decreased with increasing pool size, the results changed for prevalences of 0.05 and 0.1 with pool sizes of 50 being optimal especially at a prevalence of 0.1. Overall, the halving protocol was more cost effective than the simple protocol especially at higher prevalences. For detection of MAP using fecal culture, we recommend use of the halving protocol and pool sizes of 10 or 20 when the prevalence is suspected to range from 0.01 to 0.1 and there is no expected loss of sensitivity with increasing pool size. If loss in sensitivity is expected and the prevalence is thought to be between 0.05 and 0.1, the halving protocol and a pool size of 50 is recommended. Our findings are broadly applicable to other infectious diseases under comparable testing conditions. 3aanimal diseases 3adisease surveillance 3ascreening 3asampling 3abioassays 3abiomarkers 3afeces 3adisease prevalence 3aaccuracy 3apopulation size 3acost effectiveness 3aMonte Carlo method 3astochastic processes 3asimulation models 3aparatuberculosis 3adairy cows 3aherd health 3aherd size 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdiagnosisxeconomicsxepidemiology. 2aCost-Benefit Analysis 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aMonte Carlo Method 2aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosisxisolation & purification 2aParatuberculosisxdiagnosisxeconomicsxepidemiology. 2aPopulation Density 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aPrevalence 2aSample Size 2aSensitivity and Specificity1 aO'Brien, Joshua M.1 aHietala, Sharon K.1 aGardner, Ian A.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2010 May 1, v. 94, no. 3-4 p.202-212dElsevierx0167-58777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2010.01.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/05/10  aNon-US 7aarticle03966naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188072000900197072000900206072000900215100002000224245012600244300001600370500002400386500001500410520152800425650000901953650001401962650002201976650001501998650002302013650001602036650002302052650003102075650001902106650001302125650001302138650003002151650002602181650002302207650001602230650001002246650003002256650001202286650003102298650005702329650001102386650006202397650002002459650005702479650001502536650006902551650003202620650001002652650004502662651001202707651001202719653003202731653002002763653002002783653002602803700001502829700002202844700002402866773010102890852000902991856009103000930003303091945002503124946001103149655001203160IND4434554420221120090054.0100326e20100501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443455442DNAL7 a201329952pmid7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2010.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ202 0aL821 0aL830 0aL840 0aL100 0aX1001 aBonde, Marianne10aEvaluation of sensitivity and specificity of routine meat inspection of Danish slaughter pigs using Latent Class Analysis  ap. 165-169.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTwo groups of observers, regular meat inspectors and two veterinary researchers, respectively, conducted independent veterinary meat inspection of organs of slaughter pigs from organic or conventional production systems slaughtered at one abattoir in April 2005. A total of 3054 pigs (899 organic and 2155 conventional) were examined. The observed pathological disorders were grouped in four categories; respiratory disorders (RESP), parasitic disorders (PAR), intestinal disorders (INT) and heart disorders (HEART). Using a latent class model, the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of meat inspectors and researchers were estimated without the assumption of an available gold standard. The Se for the regular meat inspection was found to be 0.92, 0.16, 0.24 and 0.49 for RESP, PAR, INT and HEART, respectively. The Se for the researchers was found to be 0.81, 0.96, 0.91 and 0.68 for RESP, PAR, INT and HEART, respectively. The Sp for the regular meat inspection was found to be between 0.98 and 1.00 for the four categories. The Sp for the researchers was found to be 0.83, 0.94, 0.76 and 0.99 for RESP, PAR, INT and HEART, respectively. The low Se of ordinary meat inspection for parasitic, intestinal and heart disorders will cause a significant underestimation of the prevalence of diseases reported to the pig producers. Based on our results the true prevalence of diseases (conventional vs. organic slaughter pigs) was (in %): 42 vs. 16, 5 vs. 51, 5 vs. 12 and 9 vs. 5 for RESP, PAR, INT and HEART, respectively. 3apork 3aslaughter 3adisease detection 3aestimation 3aprocess monitoring 3aparasitoses 3adisease prevalence 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aheart diseases 3aaccuracy 3avalidity 3adigestive system diseases 3aantemortem inspection 3aorganic production 3afood safety 3aswine 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aFood Inspectionxstandards 2aHeart Diseasesxepidemiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Diseasesxepidemiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aMeatxstandards 2aParasitic Diseases, Animalxepidemiologyxpathology. 2aPrevalence 2aRespiratory Tract Diseasesxepidemiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxepidemiologyxpathology. 3aDenmark 0aDenmark 0aplant and animal inspection 0ameat inspection 0afarming systems 0alatent class analysis1 aToft, Nils1 aThomsen, Peter T.1 aSørensen, Jan Tind0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2010 May 1, v. 94, no. 3-4 p.165-169dElsevierx0167-58777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2010.01.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/05/09  aNon-US 7aarticle01206naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002300115245016000138500005700298500001600355520037500371650002800746650002300774653002700797773005500824852000900879939003300888945000800921946001100929655001200940991609081940742620221120085940.0840504s1980    xx |||||o|||||||||||rus||7 aPAR840025772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSledzevskaia, E.R.10aStudy of the factors determining activity of the nematode Neoaplectana carpocapsae and the effectiveness of its application against insect pests of gardens  aTitle in original language could not be transcribed.  aIn Russian.  aNeoaplectana carpocapsae (agriotos strain) as control agent of insect pests of fruit trees, although 4 species of insects were susceptible it was practical to use N. carpocapsae against only 2 (Carpocapsa pomonella and Grapholitha funebrana), survival and activity of infective larvae on sprouts of bushes, on bark of fruit trees, on ground surface, and beneath the soil 3aSteinernema carpocapsae 3abiological control 0aSurvival and viability0 tGel'minty nasekomykh.dMoskva : Nauka, 1980.7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19840504c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle02837naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002500136245010900161300001600270500002400286520175400310650001302064650001602077650001302093650001002106650002602116650001302142650001002155650001602165650001602181651001402197700002202211700002002233700002402253700002302277773010302300852000902403856003902412655001202451IND4422854220221120073232.0090703e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442285422DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.10182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLancelotti, Julio L.10aFishless shallow lakes of Southern Patagonia as habitat for waterbirds at the onset of trout aquaculture  ap. 497-505.  aIncludes references  a1.The Strobel Meseta, a basaltic plateau of Patagonia (Santa Cruz Province, Argentina), holds thousands of shallow fishless lakes that are prime habitat for many species of waterbirds, including some considered 'near threatened'. In recent years, several lakes have been stocked with trout which has created uncertainty about the potential effects on the recipient ecosystem.2.Limnological and topographical analyses were performed in a group of 32 lakes of the Strobel Meseta in order to characterize and classify individual lakes of the meseta based on their limnological and topographic features, analyze the association between lake type and use by aquatic birds in general and by the endemic hooded grebe (Podiceps gallardoi) in particular, and evaluate the overlap between trout aquaculture and critical habitat for waterbirds.3.The lakes were classified by multivariate analyses into four characteristic types: turbid, high conductivity lakes (T), small vegetated lakes (SV) and larger lakes which were subdivided into either vegetated (LV) or unvegetated (LU). In general, macrophyte cover was the main classificatory variable, whereas conductivity, pH, surface, and depth contributed moderately. Large vegetated lakes were generally found to be important for waterbirds and provided critical habitat for the hooded grebe, whereas trout farmers largely favoured large unvegetated lakes. However, since some large vegetated lakes have already been stocked, there is some level of geographical overlap between waterbird habitat and trout farming.4.The existence of some level of spatial segregation between production and critical waterbird habitat affords opportunities for designing a spatially-based management system for trout aquaculture. 3aPodiceps 3aaquaculture 3ahabitats 3alakes 3amultivariate analysis 3aplateaus 3atrout 3auncertainty 3awater birds 3aArgentina1 aPozzi, Luciana M.1 aYorio, Pablo M.1 aDiéguez, María C.1 aPascual, Miguel A.0 tAquatic conservation.g2009 July, v. 19, no. 5 p.497-505dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1052-76137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.1018 7aarticle01808naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001700138245012200155300001400277520085400291650001401145650000901159650001201168650002101180650002201201650001401223700001601237773008501253852000901338856007801347930003301425945001301458946001101471655001201482IND2036095220221120065314.0931206s1991    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203609522DNAL7 a10.1007/BF002171042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIgelmund, P.14aThe giant fiber system in the forelegs (whips) of the whip spider Heterophrynus elaphus Pocock (Arachnida: Amblypygi)  ap. 63-73.  aThe front legs of the whip spider H. elaphus are strongly modified to serve sensory functions. They contain several afferent nerve fibers which are so large that their action potentials can be recorded externally through the cuticle. In recordings from the tarsus 7 different types of afferent spikes were identified; 6 additional types of afferent spikes were discriminated in recordings from the tibia and femur. Most of the recorded potentials could be attributed to identifiable neurons serving different functions. These neurons include giant interneurons and giant fibers from diverse mechanoreceptors such as slit sense organs, trichobothria, and a joint receptor. In the present report these neurons are characterized using electrophysiological and histological methods. Their functions are discussed in the context of the animal's behavior. 3aArachnida 3alegs 3aneurons 3amechanoreceptors 3aelectrophysiology 3ahistology1 aWendler, G.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1991, v. 168, no. 1 p.63-73x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002171043Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle03242naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168072001700186072001700203072001700220072001700237100002000254245009500274300001600369500001500385506007600400520123600476506003701712650002801749650002001777650001501797650001901812650001501831650001201846650002201858650001301880650001201893650001701905650001101922650001201933650003201945650003301977650003702010650004202047650001102089650003802100650002402138650003302162653002702195653001102222653002902233653002702262700001702289700001902306773009202325852000902417856008502426930003302511945002502544946001102569655001202580IND4374237820221207123646.0050912e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437423782DNAL7 a158249302pmid7 aPMC23942832pmcid7 a10.1007/s00359-005-0624-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In this study, we use a simple walking assay to demonstrate that walking activity increases with the proportion of high pollen-hoarding alleles in pure and backcrossed strains of bees (high-strain bees > offspring generated from a high backcross > offspring generated from a low backcross > low-strain bees). The trait is heritable but is not associated with markers linked to three quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapped for their effects on pollen hoarding with demonstrated pleiotropic effects on pollen and nectar foraging and learning behavior. However, locomotion in non-selected bees is correlated with responsiveness to sucrose, a trait that correlates with foraging and learning behavior. We propose that pollen-hoarding behavior involves a syndrome of behavioral traits with complex genetic and regulatory architectures that span sensory sensitivity, foraging behavior, and learning. We propose that locomotor activity is the component of this syndrome and reflects the early maturation of the bees that become pollen foragers.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aquantitative trait loci 3ainsect behavior 3alocomotion 3aApis mellifera 3apleiotropy 3asucrose 3aworker honey bees 3aforaging 3awalking 3aheritability 3apollen 2aAnimals 2aBeesxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBehavior, Animalxphysiology 2aExploratory Behaviorxphysiology 2aMotor Activityxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPollen 2aQuantitative Trait Locixgenetics 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTastexgeneticsxphysiology. 0apollen foraging traits 0atraits 0apollen hoarding behavior 0asucrose responsiveness1 aFondrk, M.K.1 aPage, R.E.

The somata of these two neurons lie in the periphery, about 25 cm away from the CNS. These two neurons are interneurons which receive mechanoreceptive inputs from approximately 750 and 1500 bristles, respectively. The receptive fields of GN1 and GN2 overlap; they extend for 40 mm (GN1) and 90 mm (GN2) along the length of the tarsus. About 90% of the synapses onto the giant fibers are axo-axonic. Mechanical stimulation of a single bristle is sufficient to elicit action potentials in one or both interneurons. The response of the interneurons adapts quickly. Average conduction time from the soma to the CNS is 45 ms for GN1 and 55 ms for GN2. Mean conduction velocities are 5.5 and 4.2 m/s, respectively. Activity in the giant fibers does not elicit a motor response; hence the giant fibers do not mediate an escape response. Possible functions of these giant fibers are discussed and compared to those of giant fiber systems in other arthropods. 3aneurons 3amechanoreceptors 3aArachnida 3alegs 3aelectrophysiology 0aanatomy and morphology1 aWendler, G.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1991, v. 168, no. 1 p.75-83x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002171053Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle03776naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100003000175245016900205300001800374500002400392500001500416520215700431650003002588650001502618650001002633650002402643650002502667650002202692650001202714650002502726650002302751651001002774653001602784653002202800653002502822653001402847653002702861700001502888700002302903700001902926700002402945773011102969852000903080856008803089930003303177945002503210946001103235655001203246IND4418981220221120053812.0090410e20090416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441898122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2009.01.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK590 0aE700 0aF3001 aAvocèvou-Ayisso, Carolle10aSustainable use of non-timber forest products: Impact of fruit harvesting on Pentadesma butyracea regeneration and financial analysis of its products trade in Benin  ap. 1930-1938.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPentadesma butyracea Sabine (Clusiaceae) is a multi-purpose tree that provides non-timber forest products (NTFPs). In particular, fruit almonds can be transformed into butter for cooking and cosmetics. During the present study, the following hypotheses were tested: (i) diameter structure of P. butyracea populations is independent of its fruit gathering intensity; (ii) P. butyracea seedling and sapling density and origin are independent of its fruit gathering intensity; (iii) P. butyracea fruit gathering and processing of its almonds are profitable activities and (iv) P. butyracea fruit collectors and almond transformers are receiving the lowest marketing margins in the commercial channel. The class distribution in the low-intensity harvesting sites showed a typical inverse J-shaped curve whereas the high-intensity harvesting ones showed an almost bell curve (G ² =23.93, p =0.0008). After data analysis, all hypotheses turned out to be wrong except the hypothesis (iii). In order to assess the effects of fruit harvesting on natural regeneration of P. butyracea, we compared seedling and sapling density of regeneration originating from seeds and roots suckers in plots that had been differentiated according to fruit harvesting intensity. These plots were laid out in riparian forests, which are the natural habitats for the species in Benin. Observed seedling and sapling density was high (13,872±7886 seedlings and saplings/ha) in low-intensity harvesting sites but very low (4200±3810 seedlings and saplings/ha) in high-intensity harvesting sites (F =17.16; p =0.0006). However, there was no significant difference between root sucker density in either type of harvesting site (F =0.79; p =0.3861). Collection of P. butyracea fruits and subsequent processing of its almonds into butter is an important source of income for women involved in these activities. Commercial margin analysis showed that these women involved in almonds and butter trade, far from being exploited by traders, recuperate between 49% and 80% of the price paid by the consumer, depending on the quality of the product and the length of commercial channel used. 3anontimber forest products 3aClusiaceae 3atrees 3aprofits and margins 3anatural regeneration 3acommercialization 3adensity 3apopulation structure 3amarketing channels 3aBenin 0abutter tree 0anet present value 0aharvesting intensity 0amarketing 0asustainable management1 aSinsin, B.1 aAdegbidi, Anselme.1 aDossou, Gatien1 aDamme, Patrick van.0 tForest ecology and management.g2009 Apr. 16, v. 257, no. 9 p.1930-1938dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.01.0433Available from publisher's Web site  a20090421b20090508c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/04/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02645naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160072000900169072000900178100002000187245012100207300001600328500002400344520113500368650002201503650002101525650001601546650002201562650001901584650001901603650001501622650001701637650001401654650001901668650002201687650002501709650002001734650002001754653001401774653001501788700001501803700001801818773012001836852000901956856009101965930003302056945002502089946001302114655001202127IND4434563720221120053729.0100326e20100415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443456372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2010.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ200 0aK001 0aX600 0aX1001 aGraham, Eric A.10aForest understory soil temperatures and heat flux calculated using a Fourier model and scaled using a digital camera  ap. 640-649.  aIncludes references  aThe characterization of the solar radiation environment under a forest canopy is important for both understanding temperature-dependent biological processes and validating energy balance models. A modified sinusoidal model of soil heat conductivity was used to estimate subsurface temperature and heat flux from the uneven but periodic solar heating of the soil surface due to sun flecks from a forest canopy. Using a mobile sensor platform with an infrared thermometer along an 11m transect, a sunfleck model of soil surface temperature was tested using soil surface temperature maxima, air temperatures, and photodiodes placed on the soil surface to measure sunflecks. A pan-tilt-zoom digital camera on a 10m tower above the site was then used to capture a time series of panoramic images of sunflecks reflected from the soil surface and to scale the sunfleck temperature model to a wide area. Finally, this image-based model of surface temperatures was combined with the modified sinusoidal model for heat conduction to estimate soil subsurface temperatures and heat flux over a wide area due to sunflecks from a forest canopy. 3atemperate forests 3asoil temperature 3ameasurement 3ameasuring devices 3adigital images 3aimage analysis 3aunderstory 3aforest soils 3aoverstory 3aenergy balance 3asimulation models 3athermal conductivity 3asolar radiation 3aair temperature 0aheat flux 0asun flecks1 aLam, Yeung1 aYuen, Eric M.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2010 Apr. 15, v. 150, no. 4 p.640-649dElsevier Science Ltd.x0168-19237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2010.02.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/30  aOther US 7aarticle03338naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154072000900172072000900181100002300190245006200213300001600275500002400291520133000315650000901645650001501654650002301669650001801692650002701710650002401737650003501761650002201796650002101818650002401839650001801863650002701881650001801908650002101926650001101947650001801958650001201976650001101988650002001999650003702019650001102056650004802067650004902115650004402164650004202208650002902250650003802279700002102317700002002338700002002358700002102378773010602399852000902505856009302514930003302607945002502640946001102665655001202676IND4418984220221120045357.0090410e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441898422DNAL7 a185793222pmid7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2008.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL6001 aGiammarino, Angelo14aThe effect of GnRH on in vitro bovine myometrial activity  ap. 325-333.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate, in vitro, the effects of increasing concentrations of GnRH on spontaneous mechanical activity patterns of uterine smooth muscle preparations of cows during the follicular and the luteal phases of the oestrus cycle. Uterine smooth muscle strips from 14 cows in follicular and 9 in luteal phase were collected immediately after slaughter and processed within 60min from collection. Two strips of the same uterus were mounted in an isolated organ bath with two chambers to evaluate the role of decapeptide GnRH on spontaneous myometrial contractility. After equilibration period at 20mN resting tension, the mechanical activity of the uterus was recorded for 10min and the mean contractile force (MCF) was calculated. Then GnRH antagonist (antide) was added to one chamber at fixed concentration (10⁻⁴ mol) and allowed to diffuse in solution and make contact with the strips. Subsequently, GnRH was added to the two baths at the same time at increasing concentration and MCF was recorded for 10min. The effect of GnRH on spontaneous myometrial activity was evident only in the strips from subjects in follicular phase. Our results are suggestive of the presence of GnRH receptors in bovine myometrial tissue. The involvement of GnRH on uterine contractions at mating can be postulated. 3acows 3amyometrium 3amuscle contraction 3asmooth muscle 3abiochemical mechanisms 3ahormonal regulation 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3ahormone receptors 3ahormone agonists 3ahormone antagonists 3aestrous cycle 3afollicular development 3aluteinization 3ain vitro studies 3adosage 3adose response 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCells, Cultured 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aFollicular Phasexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aGonadotropin-Releasing Hormonexpharmacology 2aLuteal Phasexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMyometriumxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aOrgan Culture Techniques 2aUterine Contractionxdrug effects1 aManera, Maurizio1 aRobbe, Domenico1 aPerugini, Monia1 aAmorena, Michele0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2009 June, v. 112, no. 3-4 p.325-333dElsevier Sciencex0378-43207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2008.05.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20090611b20090703c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/05/15  aNon-US 7aarticle03702naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154072000900172100001900181245010500200300001600305500002400321500001500345520164200360650002202002650001602024650001502040650001002055650001002065650001302075650001602088650002402104650001402128650001702142650001802159650001802177650001202195650002502207650002102232650001202253650003802265650003602303650001102339650004202350650002502392650004302417650000902460650005002469650002102519650003102540650002902571650001202600650002402612650001802636653001402654700001602668700002602684700001702710773010602727852000902833856009302842930003302935945002502968946001102993655001203004IND4418984820221120033356.0090410e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441898482DNAL7 a185413922pmid7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2008.04.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL2101 aHawken, P.A.R.10aDo cyclic female goats respond to males with an increase in LH secretion during the breeding season?  ap. 384-389.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe male effect is currently only used during seasonal or lactational anoestrus because the response is thought to be blocked in cyclic females by periods of elevated progesterone. In this study, we tested whether cyclic, female goats would respond to male exposure with an increase in pulsatile LH secretion. During May (breeding season; Southern Hemisphere) the cycles of 16 Australian Cashmere goats were synchronised using intravaginal progesterone pessaries. Pessary insertion was staggered to produce groups in their early luteal (EL; n =8) and late luteal phases (LL; n =8). The LL group was retrospectively subdivided into mid-luteal (ML; n =4) and late luteal (LL; n =4) groups due to differences in oestrous cycle length that emerged during the study. Male exposure stimulated an increase in LH pulse frequency in the EL and LL groups (P <0.01) but not in the ML group (P >0.1). This increase was accompanied by an increase in basal and mean concentrations of LH in the LL group (P <0.05) but not in EL (P <0.1) or ML (P >0.1) group. There was no effect of male exposure on LH pulse amplitude (P >0.1). Progesterone concentrations differed among all groups on the day of male exposure (P <0.05) and declined significantly over the 12-h sampling period in the LL group (P <0.05). Prolactin concentrations declined in the EL group but did not change significantly in the ML or LL group. In conclusion, male exposure induced an increase in pulsatile LH in goats in the early and late luteal phases of the oestrous cycle. The high concentrations of progesterone in females in the mid-luteal phase appeared to block the male effect. 3ahormone secretion 3aanovulation 3abiomarkers 3agoats 3amales 3aanestrus 3amale effect 3aluteinizing hormone 3aprolactin 3aprogesterone 3acorpus luteum 3aluteinization 3afemales 2aAnimal Communication 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aEstrous Cyclexbloodxmetabolism. 2aEstrus Synchronizationxmethods 2aFemale 2aGoatsxbloodxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aIntrauterine Devices 2aLuteinizing Hormonexbloodxsecretion. 2aMale 2aProgesteronexadministration & dosagexblood. 2aProlactinxblood 2aPulsatile Flowxphysiology 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aSeasons 2aSex Characteristics 2aUp-Regulation 0aovulation1 aEsmaili, T.1 aJorre de St Jorre, T.1 aMartin, G.B.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2009 June, v. 112, no. 3-4 p.384-389dElsevier Sciencex0378-43207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2008.04.0223Available from publisher's Web site  a20090611b20090703c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/05/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02218naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100001900177245013200196300001400328500002400342500001500366520068300381650001801064650001801082650002701100650002101127650002401148650002201172650002001194650003301214650001701247650001801264650002601282650002701308650001501335650002101350653002601371700001801397700001901415773011001434852000901544856009001553930003301643945002501676946001101701655001201712IND4434565220221120033331.0100326e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443456522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2010.01.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ100 0aQ500 0aX1001 aMueller, Klaus10aSimplified fractionation process for linseed meal by alkaline extraction - Functional properties of protein and fibre fractions  ap. 49-54.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA simplified linseed meal fractionation procedure for the extraction of protein and fibre has been developed.

Total phenolic content of n-butanol, ethyl acetate and water extracts, determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method, was 96.4, 26.4 and 15.4 mg g⁻¹ of dry extracts, respectively. The antioxidative activity of horsetail extracts was tested by measuring their ability to scavenge stable 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and reactive hydroxyl radicals by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The results demonstrated that the free radical scavenging activity (versus both DPPH and hydroxyl radicals) depended on the type and concentration of applied extracts; the highest DPPH (EC₅₀ = 0.65 mg mL⁻¹) and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities (EC₅₀ = 0.74 mg mL⁻¹) were obtained in the case of n-butanol extract. The radical scavenging activity of extracts significantly correlated with total phenolic content. The antimicrobial tests showed that ethyl acetate and n-butanol extracts inhibited the growth of tested bacteria. 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aEquisetum arvense 3aanti-infective properties 3aantioxidant activity 3abacteria 3abutanol 3acinnamic acid 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aethyl acetate 3aflavonoids 3afree radical scavengers 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aquantitative analysis 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 0aAntimicrobial activity 0afree radical scavenging activity 0ahigh performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 0ahorsetail1 aĆetković, Gordana S.1 aDjilas, Sonja M.1 aTumbas, Vesna T.1 aSavatović, Sladjana S.1 aMandić, Anamarija I.1 aMarkov, Siniša L.1 aCvetković, Dragoljub D.0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2009 Feb., v. 44, no. 2 p.269-278dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2007.01680.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090109b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02961naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245019800166520145300364592002801817650002801845650002201873650002601895650003001921650001601951650001201967650001501979650001001994650001402004650001702018650001502035650002302050650001902073650001602092650002002108653001402128653001402142653002402156653001502180653001802195700001802213700001402231700001802245773011902263856008802382852000902470655001202479IND60762250720221120103234.0220929e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076225072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1528562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xu10aReshaping the microenvironment and bacterial community of TNT- and RDX-contaminated soil by combined remediation with vetiver grass (Vetiveria ziznioides) and effective microorganism (EM) flora  aExplosive pollutants remaining in global soils are serious threats to human health and ecological safety. Soils contaminated by trinitrotoluene (TNT) and cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX) are simulated in this study and remediated using vetiver grass and effective microorganism (EM) flora to determine the efficacy of combined remediation in reshaping the microenvironment and bacterial community of soils contaminated by explosives. The degradation rates of TNT and RDX after 60 days of combined remediation were 95.66% and 84.37%, respectively. Soil microbial activity and enzyme activities related to the nitrogen cycle were upregulated. The content of soil elements in the remediation group changed significantly. Vetiver remediation increased the diversity and significantly changed the structure of the microbial community. Notably, bacteria, such as Sphingomonadaceae and Actinobacteriota, which can degrade explosives, occupied the soil niche, and the Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota, which are involved in sugar metabolism, showed particularly increased abundance. The metabolism of soil carbohydrates, fatty acids, and amino acids was upregulated in the vetiver, EM flora, and combined vetiver+EM flora remediation groups, and the most significantly upregulated pathway was galactose metabolism. The combined vetiver and EM flora treatment of soil contaminated by explosives greatly improved the ecology of the soil microenvironment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysopogon zizanioides 3aSphingomonadaceae 3abacterial communities 3abeneficial microorganisms 3aenvironment 3aenzymes 3aexplosives 3aflora 3agalactose 3ahuman health 3ametabolism 3amicrobial activity 3anitrogen cycle 3aremediation 3atrinitrotoluene 0aExplosive 0aIon group 0aMicrobial diversity 0aMetabolome 0aVetiver grass1 aLai, Jin-long1 aZhang, Yu1 aLuo, Xue-gang0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 815 p.152856-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1528563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04031naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245010500161300001600266520262000282592002802902650002202930650001502952650002302967650001002990650002603000650001803026650002003044650001703064650001103081650001703092650001103109650002403120650001303144650002303157650001003180650001003190650001603200650001603216650001703232650001803249700002103267700001903288700002503307773011803332856007803450852000903528655001203537IND60514924020221123002916.0160304e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051492402DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2015000952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPudel, Frank10a3‐MCPD‐ and glycidyl esters can be mitigated in vegetable oils by use of short path distillation  ap. 396-405.  aShort path distillation was applied to produce edible oils low in 3‐MCPD‐FE and G‐FE, but with comparable quality to conventionally deodorized oils. By use of the Response Surface Methology the effect of different process parameters (condenser temperature (X₁), evaporator temperature (X₂), stirrer speed (X₃) and pump frequency (X₄)) on quality parameters of the oil (content of 3‐MCPD‐FE/G‐FE (minimal), acid value (minimal), content of vitamin‐E‐active compounds (sum of tocopherols and tocotrienols, maximal) and oxidation stability (maximal)) was investigated. A model was calculated for the production of refined palm oil with lowest amounts of 3‐MCPD‐FE/G‐FE and a chemical and sensory quality comparable to oil produced by standard deodorization. For the different variables of short path distillation no 3‐MCPD‐FE was detected in any of the samples, while the level for G‐FE ranged between the limit of detection and 0.7 mg/kg. A target conflict between the content of vitamin‐E‐active compounds (maximal) and acid value (minimal) was found, but in a (global) optimum of all target quality parameters (condenser temperature = 60°C, evaporator temperature = 170°C, stirrer speed = 100 rpm and pump frequency = 20 Hz) the quality of the short path distilled palm oil was comparable to conventionally refined palm oil. Slightly poorer sensory quality regarding taste and smell can be improved by a mild deodorization after short path distillation. Only the colour of the resulting oil differs from that of a conventionally refined oil, one being orange red due to the carotinoids which were not thermally decomposed. Practical Application: Mitigation of 3‐MCPD‐FE and G‐FE is a big issue in oil processing. Especially for sensible products such as baby food the content of the esters should be as low as possible without changing the quality of the edible oil. Short path distillation is known as a gentle method used for the enrichment and purification of heat‐sensitive compounds. Thus the application of short path distillation on the purification of edible oils within the refining process could be an interesting option for the production of oils low in 3‐MCPD and glycidyl esters while maintaining high oil quality. Use of Response Surface Methology short path distillation followed by mild deodorization (180°C, 120 min) has been optimized to obtain edible oils low in 3‐MCPD‐FE and G‐FE but with comparable oil quality to conventionally deodorization. Only the red colour of palm oil was not reduced by this procedure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3aacid value 3aalpha-chlorohydrin 3acolor 3acooking fats and oils 3adeodorization 3adetection limit 3adistillation 3aesters 3ainfant foods 3amodels 3aoxidative stability 3arefining 3asensory properties 3asmell 3ataste 3atemperature 3atocopherols 3atocotrienols 3avegetable oil1 aBenecke, Patrick1 aVosmann, Klaus1 aMatthäus, Bertrand,0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2016 Mar., v. 118, no. 3 p.396-405dWiley-VCHx1438-76977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.2015000953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245015400181300001600335520132300351592002801674650002501702650001801727650002201745650001501767650000901782650002601791650002001817650001401837650002101851650001501872650001401887650001601901650002301917650002201940650001401962650001701976650001301993650001102006653001302017653001802030653001102048653002102059653001502080700001202095700001702107700001702124700001202141700001402153773013602167856008202303852000902385655001202394IND60516355920221119112205.0190726e20160214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051635592DNAL7 a265863142pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145150045352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Dandan10aPostprandial nutrient-sensing and metabolic responses after partial dietary fishmeal replacement by soyabean meal in turbot (Scophthalmus maximus L.)  ap. 379-388.  aIn this study, we chose a carnivorous fish, turbot (Scophthalmus maximus L.), to examine its nutrient-sensing and metabolic responses after ingestion of diets with fishmeal (FM), or 45 % of FM replaced by soyabean meal (34·6 % dry diet) balanced with or without essential amino acids (EAA) to match the amino acid profile of FM diet for 30 d. After a 1-month feeding trial, fish growth, feed efficiency and nutrient retention were markedly reduced by soyabean meal-incorporated (SMI) diets. Compared with the FM diet, SMI led to a reduction of postprandial influx of free amino acids, hypoactivated target of rapamycin signalling and a hyperactivated amino acid response pathway after refeeding, a status associated with reduced protein synthesis, impaired postprandial glycolysis and lipogenesis. These differential effects were not ameliorated by matching an EAA profile of soyabean meal to that of the FM diet through dietary amino acid supplementation. Therefore, this study demonstrated that the FM diet and SMI diets led to distinct nutrient-sensing responses, which in turn modulated metabolism and determined the utilisation efficiency of diets. Our results provide a new molecular explanation for the role of nutrient sensing in the inferior performance of aquafeeds in which FM is replaced by soyabean meal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScophthalmus maximus 3aanimal growth 3aaquaculture feeds 3acarnivores 3adiet 3aessential amino acids 3afeed conversion 3afish meal 3afree amino acids 3aglycolysis 3aingestion 3alipogenesis 3anutrient retention 3aprotein synthesis 3arefeeding 3asoybean meal 3asoybeans 3aturbot 0aFishmeal 0aSoyabean meal 0aTurbot 0aNutrient sensing 0aMetabolism1 aHe, Gen1 aMai, Kangsen1 aZhou, Huihui1 aXu, Wei1 aSong, Fei0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2016 Feb. 14, v. 115, no. 3 p.379-388dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145150045353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03259naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245011000167520172800277592002802005650002802033650002202061650001602083650001102099650001402110650001502124650001602139650001702155650001402172650001002186650001302196650001002209650002002219650001202239650001802251650002002269650001102289650001802300650001302318651001002331653002002341653001402361700002202375700002202397700001802419700002102437700002302458700002102481773012802502856007802630852000902708655001202717IND60752325420221119232628.0211001e20210726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075232542DNAL7 a10.4081/ijfs.2021.93832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlivastri, Alberto10aParasitic cysts in wild boars hunted in Central Italy: The sanitary controls in the wild game meats chain  aSeven hundred sixty-five (765) adult wild boars were examined during the 2016/2017 hunting season for the research of parasites.

The more involved organs were liver and lungs, in a less extension omentum and diaphragm. Parasitological analyses showed an overall prevalence of 3.9% for metacestodes in the hunted animals examined (Paoletti et al., 2018). Hydatids were molecularly characterized as E. granulosus sensu stricto. Trichinella spp. examination results showed no evidences of parasitic cysts. The products of hunting used for own consumption and direct sale to the final consumer or retailer, according to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004, lack of overall control by the Competent Authority. This is a critical point in the food chain of the game meat. The data obtained show the importance of the post mortem inspection and the central role of the Competent Authority to ensure not only the food safety of game meat but also to collect data for extensive epidemiological investigations on live-stocks wildlife settings having a direct impact on public health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinococcus granulosus 3aTaenia hydatigena 3aTrichinella 3aadults 3adiaphragm 3afood chain 3afood safety 3agame animals 3agame meat 3aheart 3ahydatids 3aliver 3amixed infection 3aomentum 3apublic health 3aslaughterhouses 3atongue 3aveterinarians 3awildlife 3aItaly 0aWild boar meats 0aparasites1 aPaoletti, Barbara1 aLauteri, Carlotta1 aPennisi, Luca1 aPaludi, Domenico1 aFestino, Anna Rita1 aVergara, Alberto0 tItalian journal of food safety.g2021 July 26, v. 10, no. 2 p.9383-dPAGEPress PublicationswJournal:23065x2239-71327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/ijfs.2021.93833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03810naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245015500171520221500326592002802541650002002569650002502589650002102614650002602635650002202661650002602683650001902709650001302728650001602741650001002757650002202767650002302789650002002812650001502832650003102847650001802878651001202896653001802908653002402926653001602950653001002966700002102976700001802997700001903015700002003034700002203054773011903076856008803195852000903283655001203292IND60762251220221120092842.0220816e20220325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076225122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1528612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoucif, Lotfi10aDetection of NDM-5 and MCR-1 antibiotic resistance encoding genes in Enterobacterales in long-distance migratory bird species Ciconia ciconia, Algeria  aβ-lactams and colistin resistance in Enterobacterales is a global public health issue. In this study we aimed to investigate the occurrence and genetic determinants of Extended-Spectrum β-lactamases, carbapenemases and mcr-encoding-genes in Enterobacterales isolates recovered from the migratory bird species Ciconia ciconia in an Algerian city. A total of 62 faecal samples from white storks were collected. Samples were then subjected to selective isolation of β-lactams and colistin-resistant-Enterobacterales. The representative colonies were identified using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionisation Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry. Susceptibility testing was performed using the disk-diffusion method. ESBL, carbapenemases, and colistin resistance determinants were searched for by PCR and sequencing. The clonality relationships of the obtained isolates were investigated by multilocus sequence typing assays. Mating experiments were carried out to evaluate the transferability of the carbapenemase and mcr-genes. Forty-two isolates were identified as follows: Escherichia coli (n = 33), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), Proteus mirabilis (n = 4) and Citrobacter freundii (n = 1). Molecular analysis showed that twelve isolates carried the blaESBL genes alone, fifteen E. coli isolates were positive for the blaOXA₋₄₈ gene, six isolates were NDM-5-carriers (two P. mirabilis, two K. pneumoniae and two E. coli) and eight E. coli strains were positive for the mcr-1 gene. MLST results showed a high clonal diversity, where NDM-5-producing strains were assigned to two sequence types (ST167 for E. coli and ST198 for K. pneumoniae), whereas the mcr-1 positive E. coli isolates belonged to ST58, ST224, ST453, ST1286, ST2973, ST5542, ST9815 and the international high-risk resistant lineage ST101. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of blaNDM₋₅ gene in white storks and also the first describing the mcr-1 gene in white storks in Algeria. This study underlines the important role of migratory white storks as carriers of high-level drug-resistant bacteria, allowing their possible implication as indicators and sentinels for antimicrobial resistance surveillance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCiconia ciconia 3aCitrobacter freundii 3aEscherichia coli 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aProteus mirabilis 3aantibiotic resistance 3abeta-lactamase 3acolistin 3aenvironment 3agenes 3amass spectrometry 3amigratory behavior 3amigratory birds 3amonitoring 3amultilocus sequence typing 3apublic health 3aAlgeria 0aCarbapenemase 0aColistin resistance 0aWhite stork 0aBatna1 aChelaghma, Widad1 aCherak, Zineb1 aBendjama, Esma1 aBeroual, Ferhat1 aRolain, Jean-Marc0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Mar. 25, v. 814 p.152861-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1528613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03491naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245009900168520202100267592002802288650001302316650001902329650002402348650002102372650001602393650001302409650001702422650001302439650001302452650001102465650001502476650002502491650001302516650001302529650001402542650001602556651001802572653001802590653002402608653002702632653002402659653001802683700001302701700001902714700001102733700001302744773011902757856008802876852000902964655001202973IND60762251320221120092938.0220816e20220325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076225132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1528622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhuo10aOxygen gradients shape the unique structure of picoeukaryotic communities in the Bay of Bengal  aPicoeukaryotic communities respond rapidly to global climate change and play an important role in marine biological food webs and ecosystems. The formation of oxygen minimum zones (OMZ) is facilitated by the stratification of seawater and higher primary production in the surface layer, and the marine picoeukaryotic community this low-oxygen environment is topic of interest. To better understand the picoeukaryotic community assembly mechanisms in an OMZ, we collected samples from the Bay of Bengal (BOB) in October and November 2020 and used 18S rDNA to study the picoeukaryotic communities and their community assembly mechanisms that they are controlled by in deep-sea and hypoxic zones. The results show that deterministic and stochastic processes combine to shape picoeukaryotic communities in the BOB. We divided the water column into three vertical layers: the upper oxycline (UO), the OMZ, and the lower oxycline (LO), based on dissolved oxygen concentrations (dissolved oxygen: UO > LO > OMZ) at vertical depths (from 5 m to 2000 m). Deterministic processes controlled the picoeukaryotic community in the UO, while the picoeukaryotic communities in the OMZ and LO were dominated by stochastic processes. The OMZ had a stronger diffusional limitation and the habitat niche breadth in the UO was wider than that in OMZ and LO. We classified the picoeukaryotic community into three functional composition types (phototrophic, mixotrophic, and heterotrophic); heterotrophs were most abundant in the surveyed area, and the proportion of decreased significantly with increasing depth and decreasing dissolved oxygen. The picoeukaryotes in the investigated area also correlated with temperature, salinity, and nutrients (phosphate, silicate, nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium). These findings contribute to a better understanding of picoeukaryotic communities in deep-sea and low-oxygen environments, their functional structuring, as well as the effects of environmental changes on their community structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3adissolved oxygen 3aenvironment 3ahabitats 3aheterotrophs 3anitrates 3anitrites 3aoxygen 3aphosphates 3aprimary productivity 3asalinity 3aseawater 3asilicates 3atemperature 3aBay of Bengal 0aPicoeukaryote 0aAssembly mechanisms 0aFunctional composition 0aOxygen minimum zone 0aBay of Bengal1 aGu, Ting1 aWang, Xingzhou1 aWu, Xi1 aSun, Jun0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Mar. 25, v. 814 p.152862-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1528623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245012000166300001600286520169000302592002801992650004402020650001402064650001702078650001802095650002902113650001302142650002202155650004102177650004402218650000902262650001502271650001402286650001502300650001302315700002602328700002802354773011802382856007802500852000902578655001202587IND60514925120221123041924.0160304e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051492512DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2015001192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSammaiah, Arukali10aTribology and oxidation studies of fatty acid sulfide derivatives synthesized via thiol‐ene “Click” additions  ap. 495-502.  aThe synthesis of sulfide derivatives via thiol‐ene addition reactions of methyl oleate and methyl 10‐ undecenoate as substrates is reported. The substrate fatty acids contained a terminal double bond in methyl 10‐undecenoate and an internal double bond in methyl oleate. Thiol‐ene addition of unsaturated fatty acid ester derivatives with hydroxy and amine functionality on the fatty acids was carried out under thermal conditions. The synthesized products were characterized by ¹H, ¹³C NMR, FT‐IR, and GC‐MS analysis and evaluated for their antioxidant, extreme pressure (EP), and antiwear (AW) properties in base oil namely, epoxy jatropha fatty acid n‐butyl esters (EJB). Synthesized products exhibited comparable antioxidant efficacy to butylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT). All four synthesized sulfide derivatives significantly enhanced the weld point of the base oil EJB and exhibited comparable performance to TCP (tricresyl phosphate) at 1 wt% level. Methyl 9(10)‐(2‐hydroxyethylthio) octadecanoate at 0.5% concentration exhibited considerable improvement in the wear scar of base oil from 0.834 to 0.422 mm. The synthesized sulfide derivatives have potential as multifunctional additives for biolubricant basestocks. Practical applications: Synthesis of multifunctional additives via thiol‐ene addition under thermal conditions. The prepared sulfide derivatives were found to exhibit good antioxidant, antiwear, and extreme pressure additives. The synthesized additives exhibited comparable performance to commercial additives. The products are potential biobased alternatives for commercial additives.

The sample included 705 children evaluated at 2 and 4 years of age, as part of the population-based birth cohort Generation XXI (Porto, Portugal). Data on sociodemographic and lifestyle factors of both children and mothers were collected by face-to-face interviews. The weight and height of children were measured by trained professionals. Based on FFQ, four energy-dense food groups were defined: soft drinks; sweets; cakes; salty snacks. A healthy eating index was developed using the WHO dietary recommendations for children (2006) aged 4 years. The associations were evaluated through Poisson regression models. After adjustment for maternal age and education, child's carer, child's siblings and child's BMI, higher consumption of energy-dense foods at 2 years of age was found to be associated with higher consumption of the same foods 2 years later. An inverse association was found between the intake (≥ median) of soft drinks (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0·74, 95 % CI 0·58, 0·95), salty snacks (IRR = 0·80, 95 % CI 0·65, 1·00) and sweets (IRR = 0·73, 95 % CI 0·58, 0·91) at 2 years of age and the consumption of fruit and vegetables at 4 years of age (≥ 5 times/d). Weekly and daily consumption of energy-dense foods at 2 years of age was associated with a lower healthy eating score at 4 years of age (IRR = 0·75, 95 % CI 0·58, 0·96; IRR = 0·56, 95 % CI 0·41, 0·77, respectively). The consumption of energy-dense foods at young ages is negatively associated with the diet quality of children a few years later.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3abody mass index 3acakes 3achildren 3adietary recommendations 3aeducation 3afood groups 3afruits 3ahealthy eating habits 3ahigh energy foods 3ainterviews 3alifestyle 3amothers 3anutritional adequacy 3aprofessionals 3aregression analysis 3asiblings 3asnacks 3asoft drinks 3asweets 3avegetables 3aPortugal 0aEnergy-dense foods 0aDiet quality 0aPreschool children1 aOliveira, Andréa,1 aRamos, Elisabete1 aMoreira, Pedro1 aBarros, Henrique1 aLopes, Carla0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2014 Apr. 14, v. 111, no. 7 p.1275-1282dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145130036203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01679naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001800150245015600168300001800324500001500342520061600357592002800973650002001001650002301021650001401044650001101058650001701069650001601086653001101102700002101113700002101134773009101155856008601246852000901332655001201341IND4465454820221117235126.0141111e20120801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446545482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.07.1322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabik, Hassan10aIdentification of pyrazine derivatives in a typical maple syrup using headspace solid-phase microextraction with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry  ap. 1006-1010.  a2019-12-06  aHeadspace solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry was applied to identify pyrazines in a typical maple syrup characterised by plant ligneous or sawdust flavour.

We have previously shown that a cocoa flavanol (CF) intervention can improve endothelial function and increase the regenerative capacity of the endothelium by mobilising circulating angiogenic cells in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The aim of the present study was to investigate whether CF can lower the levels of circulating endothelial microparticles (EMP), markers of endothelial integrity, along with improvements in endothelial function. The levels of EMP in the frozen plasma samples of CAD patients were measured along with endothelial function (flow-mediated vasodilation, FMD); n 16, FMD data published previously), and these data were compared with those of young (n 12) and age-matched (n 12) healthy control subjects. The CAD patients exhibited significantly increased levels of EMP along with impaired FMD when compared with the healthy control subjects. The levels of CD144⁺ and CD31⁺/41⁻ EMP were inversely correlated with FMD (r − 0·67, P= 0·01 and r − 0·59, P= 0·01, respectively). In these CAD patients, the levels of EMP were measured after they had consumed a drink containing 375 mg of CF (high-CF intervention, HiFI) or 9 mg of CF (macro- and micronutrient-matched low-CF control, LoFl) twice daily over a 30-d period in a randomised, double-blind, cross-over study. After 1 month of HiFI, the levels of CD31⁺/41⁻ and CD144⁺ EMP decreased (− 25 and − 23 %, respectively), but not after LoFl. Our data show that flavanols lower the levels of EMP along with higher endothelial function, lending evidence to the novel concept that flavanols may improve endothelial integrity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoronary artery disease 3across-over studies 3aendothelium 3aflavanols 3amicroparticles 3apatients 3aphenotype 3arisk factors 3avasodilation 0aCocoa flavanols 0aEndothelial integrity 0aEndothelial function 0aEndothelial microparticles1 aAmabile, Nicolas1 aAngeli, Franca S.1 aSansone, Roberto1 aStegemann, Berthold1 aKelm, Malte1 aSpringer, Matthew L.1 aYeghiazarians, Yerem1 aSchroeter, Hagen1 aHeiss, Christian0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2014 Apr. 14, v. 111, no. 7 p.1245-1252dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145130036933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03689naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245011200184300001600296520192400312592002802236650002202264650001202286650001202298650003102310650001702341650002002358650001002378650002002388650001402408650001302422650002602435650002102461650001902482650002102501650002002522650001502542650003102557650001902588650001702607650001502624650001702639650001302656653001302669653002602682653001202708653002002720700001602740700001902756700002402775700001402799700001602813700001902829773013602848856008202984852000903066655001203075IND60516357120221119110442.0190726e20160214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051635712DNAL7 a266521552pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145150046872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoozee, K.

Recent studies show that curcumin also possesses neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing properties that may help delay or prevent neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Currently, clinical diagnosis of AD is onerous, and it is primarily based on the exclusion of other causes of dementia. In addition, phase III clinical trials of potential treatments have mostly failed, leaving disease-modifying interventions elusive. AD can be characterised neuropathologically by the deposition of extracellular β amyloid (Aβ) plaques and intracellular accumulation of tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles. Disruptions in Aβ metabolism/clearance contribute to AD pathogenesis. In vitro studies have shown that Aβ metabolism is altered by curcumin, and animal studies report that curcumin may influence brain function and the development of dementia, because of its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as its ability to influence Aβ metabolism. However, clinical studies of curcumin have revealed limited effects to date, most likely because of curcumin’s relatively low solubility and bioavailability, and because of selection of cohorts with diagnosed AD, in whom there is already major neuropathology. However, the fresh approach of targeting early AD pathology (by treating healthy, pre-clinical and mild cognitive impairment-stage cohorts) combined with new curcumin formulations that increase bioavailability is renewing optimism concerning curcumin-based therapy. The aim of this paper is to review the current evidence supporting an association between curcumin and modulation of AD pathology, including in vitro and in vivo studies. We also review the use of curcumin in emerging retinal imaging technology, as a fluorochrome for AD diagnostics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aamyloid 3aanimals 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3abioavailability 3abrain 3aclinical trials 3acognition 3acurcumin 3adiagnostic techniques 3afluorescent dyes 3aimage analysis 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3ametabolism 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneuropathology 3apathogenesis 3asolubility 3atherapeutics 3aturmeric 0aCurcumin 0aAlzheimer’s disease 0aAmyloid 0aRetinal imaging1 aShah, T.

However, the size and shape of remnant patches can affect their conservation values through edge effects and isolation of ecologically important species such as foundation species. Foundation species interact with and profoundly affect other species, leading to cascading community effects if they are lost from an ecosystem. We used spinifex grass (Triodia scariosa) to investigate the patterns, processes and consequences of remnant shape and habitat degradation, including nutrient enrichment and soil compaction, for a foundation plant species in agricultural landscapes. First, we quantified differences in biotic and soil variables between narrow linear remnants and larger, more equilateral nature reserves. We then assessed whether these differences explained variation in spinifex abundance and condition. Finally, we tested whether edge effects influenced spinifex abundance. We surveyed 4230 quadrats across 282 sites in south-eastern Australia and measured the size and condition of 11,514 spinifex clumps. Linear remnants were characterised by different plant communities, elevated nutrient levels, more compact soil and higher abundance of non-spinifex grasses compared to nature reserves. Spinifex was twice as abundant in reserves than linear remnants and was negatively associated with soil compaction and soil nutrients. Spinifex condition was negatively associated with soil nitrogen and non-spinifex grasses. Linear remnants had proportionally fewer small spinifex clumps compared to reserves, suggesting lower recruitment in linear remnants. We found minimal evidence of edge effects on environmental variables, and no clear edge effect on spinifex abundance. Given the large contribution of linear remnants to native vegetation cover, measures to minimise nutrient enrichment and disturbance in these areas may help arrest potential ongoing declines in this foundation plant species in agricultural landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriodia 3abiodiversity 3aecosystems 3aedge effects 3agrasses 3ahabitat destruction 3anitrogen 3asoil 3asoil compaction 3avegetation 3aAustralia1 aDriscoll, Don A.1 aPatykowski, John1 aDoherty, Tim S.0 tEcosystems.g2021 Sept., v. 24, no. 6 p.1516-1530dSpringer USwJournal:jnl70038x1432-98407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-020-00598-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245015100185300001600336520156300352592002801915650001601943650002401959650001801983650004102001650002602042650004002068650001702108650001802125650001102143650002902154650003102183650001702214650001602231653002702247653001802274653001602292653003202308700002502340700002302365700002402388773013602412856008202548852000902630655001202639IND60516357220221119110504.0190726e20160214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051635722DNAL7 a267688502pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145150046992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMansoor, Nadia10aEffects of low-carbohydrate diets v. low-fat diets on body weight and cardiovascular risk factors: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials  ap. 466-479.  aThe effects of low-carbohydrate (LC) diets on body weight and cardiovascular risk are unclear, and previous studies have found varying results. Our aim was to conduct a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCT), assessing the effects of LC diets v. low-fat (LF) diets on weight loss and risk factors of CVD. Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Trials. Studies had to fulfil the following criteria: a RCT; the LC diet was defined in accordance with the Atkins diet, or carbohydrate intake of <20 % of total energy intake; twenty subjects or more per group; the subjects were previously healthy; and the dietary intervention had a duration of 6 months or longer. Results from individual studies were pooled as weighted mean difference (WMD) using a random effect model. In all, eleven RCT with 1369 participants met all the set eligibility criteria. Compared with participants on LF diets, participants on LC diets experienced a greater reduction in body weight (WMD –2·17 kg; 95 % CI –3·36, –0·99) and TAG (WMD –0·26 mmol/l; 95 % CI –0·37, –0·15), but a greater increase in HDL-cholesterol (WMD 0·14 mmol/l; 95 % CI 0·09, 0·19) and LDL-cholesterol (WMD 0·16 mmol/l; 95 % CI 0·003, 0·33). This meta-analysis demonstrates opposite change in two important cardiovascular risk factors on LC diets – greater weight loss and increased LDL-cholesterol. Our findings suggest that the beneficial changes of LC diets must be weighed against the possible detrimental effects of increased LDL-cholesterol.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3acarbohydrate intake 3aenergy intake 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3alow carbohydrate diet 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3alow fat diet 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3anutritional intervention 3arandomized clinical trials 3arisk factors 3aweight loss 0aLow-carbohydrate diets 0aLow-fat diets 0aWeight loss 0aCardiovascular risk factors1 aVinknes, Kathrine J.1 aVeierød, Marit B.1 aRetterstøl, Kjetil0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2016 Feb. 14, v. 115, no. 3 p.466-479dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145150046993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011700167300001800284520154000302592002801842596007501870596005901945596005902004650001902063650001402082650001402096650001202110650002302122650001802145650001502163650002302178650001002201650001802211700001802229700001702247700001702264700002002281700001802301700001802319773010202337856008202439852000902521655001202530IND60752327320221119231930.0211001e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075232732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-020-00596-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhi-Ping10aMethane Concentration in the Heartwood of Living Trees and Estimated Methane Emission on Stems in Upland Forests  ap. 1485-1499.  aThe stems of living trees in upland forests might contribute to the global methane (CH₄) source, but the contribution is poorly understood. We investigated CH₄ concentration in the heartwood of living trees in dominant upland forests using field campaign and subsequently evaluated the importance of stem CH₄ emission in the context of the global total. We found that only 0%, 9.8%, and 1.8% of stems of living trees had substantial CH₄ concentration in heartwood of ≥ 10,000 μL L–¹ in the boreal, temperate, and tropical and subtropical upland forests investigated, respectively. CH₄ concentration in heartwood depended mainly upon tree species and subsequently soil moisture. Relationships fitted indicate that CH₄ concentration followed a power function with respect to water content in heartwood, whereas nitrous oxide (N₂O) or carbon dioxide (CO₂) concentration linearly increased with water content in heartwood. Stem CH₄ emission was estimated at approximately 0.2–2 Tg yr–¹ globally, corresponding to less than 0.4% of the global total including all natural plus anthropogenic sources. Water content in heartwood is positively associated with soil water content. Soil water content rarely exceeds 40% v/v in upland forests, indicating stem CH₄ emission occurs mainly in the areas of low-lying upland forests with occasionally moist soils. More attentions should be paid on low-lying upland forests and forested wetlands in future when stem CH₄ emission needs to be estimated in all forests.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFA0600803cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a31370493cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41930643cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3acarbon dioxide 3aheartwood 3ahighlands 3amethane 3amethane production 3anitrous oxide 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3atrees 3awater content1 aLi, Huan-Long1 aWu, Hong-Hui1 aHan, Shi-Jie1 aHuang, Jian-Hui1 aZhang, Xi-Mei1 aHan, Xing-Guo0 tEcosystems.g2021 Sept., v. 24, no. 6 p.1485-1499dSpringer USwJournal:jnl70038x1432-98407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-020-00596-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245013300175520115800308592002801466650001601494650001801510650001101528650001201539650002601551650001801577650002001595650001701615650001701632653002201649653001601671653002601687653002701713653002101740653002001761700002501781700002101806700001801827700002001845700002301865700001901888700002101907773011901928856008802047852000902135655001202144IND60762253220221120093015.0220606e20220415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076225322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1528812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCecilia, Brunetti10aOn-line monitoring of plant water status: Validation of a novel sensor based on photon attenuation of radiation through the leaf  aNon-destructive real-time monitoring of leaf water status is important for precision irrigation practice to increase water productivity and reduce its use. To this end, we tested and validated a novel leaf sensor (Leaf Water Meter, LWM), based on the photon attenuation during the passage of the light through the leaf, to monitor plant water status. Four woody species were subjected to multiple cycles of dehydration and re-hydration, and the signals recorded by the LWM were compared with classical measurements of plant water relations (relative water content and water potential). A good agreement between the signals recorded by LWM sensor and the destructive measurements, throughout the repeated water stress and rewatering cycles, was found across all species. These results demonstrate that LWM sensor is a sensitive, non-destructive and easy-to-handle device to reliably monitor in continuous fashion leaf water status. In conclusion, this sensor may be considered a promising tool for smart irrigation scheduling in precision agriculture context to decrease water wastage in light of global change and increasing conflicts over water demand.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironment 3aglobal change 3aleaves 3aphotons 3aprecision agriculture 3awater content 3awater potential 3awater stress 3awoody plants 0aLeaf water status 0aLeaf sensor 0aPrecision agriculture 0aRelative water content 0aSmart irrigation 0aWater potential1 aFrancesca, Alderotti1 aDalila, Pasquini1 aCarlo, Stella1 aAntonella, Gori1 aFrancesco, Ferrini1 aMarco, Righele1 aMauro, Centritto0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Apr. 15, v. 817 p.152881-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1528813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03469naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245013700214300001800351520190100369592002802270596010102298650001502399650002002414650001302434650001902447650001002466650001002476650001902486650001202505650002202517650001502539650002002554650001102574650001302585650001702598650001602615651001002631700002202641700002502663700003302688700002402721700001902745700001802764773010202782856008202884852000902966655001202975IND60752327920221119231843.0211001e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075232792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-020-00587-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorales-Molino, César1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9464-862X10aLong-Term Responses of Mediterranean Mountain Forests to Climate Change, Fire and Human Activities in the Northern Apennines (Italy)  ap. 1361-1377.  aFagus sylvatica (beech) dominates the montane forests of the Apennines and builds old-growth high-conservation value stands. However, recent severe drought-induced diebacks raise concern on the future persistence of these forests and of Southern European mesophilous woodlands overall, growing at their dry edge. To explore the history of Apennine beech-dominated forests, we draw on the multiproxy paleoecological record from Lago Verdarolo, which includes a robust vegetation-independent temperature reconstruction. Numerical techniques are used to investigate the drivers of long-term Mediterranean mountain forest dynamics. Specifically, we focus on disentangling the ecological factors that caused the shift from high-diversity mixed forests to beech-dominated stands and on assessing the occurrence of legacy effects on present-day forests. Abrupt climate change largely drove vegetation dynamics during the Late Glacial and Early Holocene. Species-rich mixed Abies alba (silver fir) forests dominated about 10,500—5500 years ago, under rather dry and warmer-than-today conditions (+ 1—2 °C) and limited fire occurrence. Cooler and moister summers and increasing fire activity caused declines in several fire-sensitive temperate deciduous trees (for example, Ulmus, Tilia, Fraxinus) and favored the establishment of fir-beech forests around 5500 years ago. Further enhancement of fire activity and farming around 2000 years ago led to local Abies alba extinction and forest impoverishment. We conclude that the currently widespread monospecific Apennine beech forests are the result of multi-millennial land-use intensification superimposed on Late Holocene cooling and moistening. Given their higher drought-tolerance compared to beech stands, reviving ancient species-rich mixed fir forests represents a feasible and ‘tested’ possibility to adapt forests to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aSNF PP00P2-114886cSchweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung 3aAbies alba 3aFagus sylvatica 3aFraxinus 3aHolocene epoch 3aTilia 3aUlmus 3aclimate change 3acooling 3adrought tolerance 3aextinction 3aforest dynamics 3ahumans 3aland use 3apaleoecology 3atemperature 3aItaly1 aSteffen, Marianne1 aSamartin, Stéphanie1 avan Leeuwen, Jaqueline F.

We searched Medline, Google Scholar and the reference lists of previous reviews. All randomised controlled trials (RCT) on vitamin D supplementation that involved apparently healthy human subjects with a report of PTH were selected. Potential studies were screened independently and in duplicate. Results are summarised as mean differences with 95 % confidence intervals. Quality assessment, subgroup analysis, meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis were carried out. Thirty-three vitamin D supplementation RCT were included. Vitamin D supplementation significantly raised circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) with significant heterogeneity among studies with a pooled mean difference (PMD) of 15.5 ng/ml (test for heterogeneity: P<0·001 and I ²=97·3 %). Vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced PTH level with PMD of −8·0 pg/ml, with significant heterogeneity ((test for heterogeneity: P<0·001) and the I ² value was 97·3 %). In the subgroup analyses, the optimum treatment effect for PTH was observed with Ca doses of 600–1200 mg/d (−22·48 pg/ml), after the duration of a >12-month trial (−18·36 pg/ml), with low baseline 25(OH)D concentration of <20 ng/ml (−16·70 pg/ml) and in those who were overweight and obese (−18·11 pg/ml). Despite the present meta-analysis being hindered by some limitations, it provided some interesting evidence, suggesting that suppression of PTH level needs higher vitamin D intake (75 μg/d) than the current recommendations and longer durations (12 months), which should be taken into account for nutritional recommendations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3aconfidence interval 3adietary recommendations 3ahumans 3ameta-analysis 3aoverweight 3aparathyroid hormone 3arandomized clinical trials 3aregression analysis 3asystematic review 3avitamin D 0aCholecalciferol 0aVitamin D 0aParathyroid hormone 0aMeta-analyses 0aRandomised controlled trials1 aShab-Bidar, Sakineh1 aMirmiran, Parvin1 aHosseinpanah, Farhad1 aAzizi, Fereidoun0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2015 Nov. 14, v. 114, no. 9 p.1360-1374dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145150031893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03751naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245020100167300001800368520151500386592002801901650001801929650001701947650002501964650001001989650002501999650001502024650001702039650001702056650001402073650001602087650001102103650002602114650001102140650003102151650001802182650001302200650001302213650001202226650001302238650000902251650001102260650001802271650002902289650001402318650001202332650001302344650001302357653002802370653002202398653002302420653002202443653001202465653002602477653002202503700002002525700001702545700001802562700005502580700002202635700001702657700006502674700006102739773013502800856008502935852000903020655001203029IND60752313720221120110724.0211001e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075231372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c003832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnder, Seda10aRabbit Antidiethoxyphosphotyrosine Antibody, Made by Single B Cell Cloning, Detects Chlorpyrifos Oxon-Modified Proteins in Cultured Cells and Immunopurifies Modified Peptides for Mass Spectrometry  ap. 4728-4745.  aChronic low-dose exposure to organophosphorus pesticides is associated with the risk of neurodegenerative disease. The mechanism of neurotoxicity is independent of acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Adducts on tyrosine, lysine, threonine, and serine can occur after exposure to organophosphorus pesticides, the most stable being adducts on tyrosine. Rabbit monoclonal 1C6 to diethoxyphosphate-modified tyrosine (depY) was created by single B cell cloning. The amino acid sequence and binding constant (Kd 3.2 × 10–⁸ M) were determined. Cultured human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells incubated with a subcytotoxic dose of 10 μM chlorpyrifos oxon contained depY-modified proteins detected by monoclonal 1C6 on Western blots. depY-labeled peptides from tryptic digests of cell lysates were immunopurified by binding to immobilized 1C6. Peptides released with 50% acetonitrile and 1% formic acid were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer. Protein Prospector database searches identified 51 peptides modified on tyrosine by diethoxyphosphate in SH-SY5Y cell lysate and 73 diethoxyphosphate-modified peptides in N2a cell lysate. Adducts appeared most frequently on the cytoskeleton proteins tubulin, actin, and vimentin. It was concluded that rabbit monoclonal 1C6 can be useful for studies that aim to understand the mechanism of neurotoxicity resulting from low-dose exposure to organophosphorus pesticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aacetonitrile 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aactin 3aamino acid sequences 3aantibodies 3achlorpyrifos 3acytoskeleton 3adatabases 3aformic acid 3ahumans 3aliquid chromatography 3alysine 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneurotoxicity 3apeptides 3aproteome 3arabbits 3aresearch 3arisk 3aserine 3aspectrometers 3atandem mass spectrometry 3athreonine 3atubulin 3atyrosine 3avimentin 0adiethoxyphosphotyrosine 0amass spectrometry 0aProtein Prospector 0aN2a neuroblastoma 0aSH-SY5Y 0asingle B cell cloning 0arabbit monoclonal1 avan Grol, Marco1 aFidder, Alex1 aXiao, Gaoping1 aNoort, Daan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9267-814X1 aYerramalla, Udaya1 aTacal, Ozden1 aSchopfer, Lawrence M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1785-92471 aLockridge, Oksana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8345-36400 tJournal of proteome research.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 20, no. 10 p.4728-4745dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c003833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245008700170520131000257592002801567650002401595650001101619650001501630650002701645650001501672650001101687650001201698650002301710650001301733650000901746653001501755653002401770653002201794653001401816653001801830700001301848700001401861700001701875773009101892856009001983852000902073655001202082IND60762240120221120025702.0220523e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076224012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1335592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Zhong10aImproving anaerobic digestion of corn straw by using solid-state urea pretreatment  aThe resistant structure and high carbon/nitrogen ratio (C/N) of cellulosic substrate are the barriers during their anaerobic digestion (AD). Solid-state urea pretreatment was developed in this study to pretreat corn straw and adjust C/N ratio simultaneously for the downstream AD of corn straw. Results showed solid-state urea pretreatment was efficient in lignin removal and achieved the highest lignin reduction of 7.06% with C/N ratio = 15 during pretreatment. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the destruction of the dense structure by pretreatment, which benefited to the hydrolysis of corn straw. The cumulative methane yields of the pretreated corn straw ranged from 234.07 to 250.03 mL/g VS, which were obviously higher than that of the untreated corn straw. The maximum methane yield of 250.03 mL/g VS was achieved with C/N = 15 during pretreatment, which was 23.91% higher than that of the untreated group. In addition, AD digestates from the pretreated groups had 9.62% higher nutrients than that from the untreated group. The solid-state urea pretreatment can destroy the dense structure of corn straw and regulate the C/N ratio during AD, thus benefit the methane production and fertilizer use of the digestate, which is a potential choice during the AD of cellulosic substrate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3acarbon 3acorn straw 3afertilizer application 3ahydrolysis 3alignin 3amethane 3amethane production 3anitrogen 3aurea 0aCorn straw 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aUrea pretreatment 0aC/N ratio 0aMethane yield1 aZou, Hua1 aZheng, Yi1 aFu, Shan-Fei0 tChemosphere.g2022 Apr., v. 293 p.133559-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1335593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03733naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245010200182300001600284520197600300592002802276650002502304650001202329650001902341650003502360650001202395650001602407650003002423650001502453650001202468650002802480650001502508650001702523650002302540650002702563650004002590650001002630650002302640650001702663650001202680650003502692653001802727653000802745653001602753700001402769700001702783700001502800700001602815700001802831700001902849700001602868700002102884773013602905856008103041852000903122655001203131IND60654704520221122205044.0190726e20130314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065470452DNAL7 a228095522pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145120026562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAuinger, A.12aA common haplotype of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1b is associated with the metabolic syndrome  ap. 810-815.  aThe carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) enzyme system facilitates the transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria to provide substrates for β-oxidation. We performed an analysis including three coding SNP in the muscle isoform of the CPT1b gene (rs3213445, rs2269383 and rs470117) and one coding SNP in the CPT2 gene (rs1799821) to find associations with traits of the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Male participants (n 755) from the Metabolic Intervention Cohort Kiel were genotyped and phenotyped for features of the MetS. Participants underwent a glucose tolerance test and a postprandial assessment of metabolic variables after a standardised mixed meal. Carriers of the rare CPT1b 66V (rs3213445) allele had significantly higher γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) and glutamic pyruvate transaminase (GPT) activities (P< 0·0001, P= 0·03 and P= 0·048, respectively) and a higher fatty liver index (FLI, P= 0·026). Fasting and postprandial TAG (P= 0·007 and P= 0·009, respectively) and fasting glucose (P= 0·012) were significantly higher in 66V-allele carriers. The insulin sensitivity index determined after a glucose load was lower in those subjects (P= 0·005). Total cholesterol (P= 0·051) and LDL-cholesterol (P= 0·062) tended to be higher in 66V-allele carriers when compared with I66I homozygotes. Homozygosity of the rare K531E allele presented with lower GGT and GOT activities (P= 0·011 and P= 0·027, respectively). E531E homozygotes tended to have lower GPT and FLI (P= 0·078 and P= 0·052, respectively). CPT2 V368I (rs1799821) genotypic groups did not differ in the investigated anthropometric and metabolic parameters. The present results confirm the association of CPT1b coding polymorphisms with the MetS, with a deleterious effect of the CPT1b I66V and a protective impact of the CPT1b K531E SNP, whereas haplotype analysis indicates a relevance of the E531K polymorphism only.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine transaminase 3aalleles 3abeta oxidation 3acarnitine palmitoyltransferase 3afasting 3afatty liver 3agamma-glutamyltransferase 3agenotyping 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance tests 3ahaplotypes 3ahomozygosity 3ainsulin resistance 3along chain fatty acids 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3amales 3ametabolic syndrome 3amitochondria 3amuscles 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0aPolymorphisms 0aTAG 0aCholesterol1 aRubin, D.1 aSabandal, M.1 aHelwig, U.1 aRüther, A.1 aSchreiber, S.1 aFoelsch, U.

The aim of the present study was to determine the concentration of SCFA in faeces of lean and obese individuals and to analyse whether associations between faecal SCFA and metabolic syndrome parameters are present. Lean (n 20) and obese (n 20) women of similar age (28·5 (sd 7·6) v. 30·7 (sd 6·5) years, P= 0·33) participated in the study. Anthropometric measurements, body composition, blood pressure and biochemical parameters were assessed. SCFA were extracted from faeces and quantified by GC. Blood pressure and blood glucose, although within the normal limits, were higher in the obese group compared to lean subjects (P< 0·05). Lower HDL concentration and higher insulin and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index were observed in the obese than in the lean group (P< 0·05). The median values of SCFA (% w/w) from the lean and obese groups were butyric (0·021 v. 0·044, P= 0·024), propionic (0·021 v. 0·051, P= 0·007) and acetic (0·03 v. 0·061, P= 0·01). SCFA correlated positively with metabolic syndrome risk factors such as adiposity, waist circumference and HOMA index (P< 0·05), and inversely with HDL (P< 0·05). Our results suggest that the higher faecal concentration of SCFA is associated with metabolic risk factors and thus may influence metabolic homeostasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiposity 3ablood glucose 3ablood pressure 3aenergy 3afeces 3aglucose 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin 3ametabolic syndrome 3ametabolism 3amodels 3arisk factors 3ashort chain fatty acids 3awaist circumference 3awomen 0aSCFA 0aObesity 0aHomeostasis model assessment 0aHDL1 aGrześkowiak, Łukasz1 aFranceschini, Sylvia C.

Despite their importance, these protein–membrane interactions are difficult to characterize due to their often-transient nature as well as phospholipids’ poor solubility in aqueous solution. Here, we employ nanodiscs—small, water-soluble patches of a lipid bilayer encircled with amphipathic scaffold proteins—along with quantitative proteomics to identify lipid-binding proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using nanodiscs reconstituted with yeast total lipid extracts or only phosphatidylethanolamine (PE-nanodiscs), we capture several known membrane-interacting proteins, including the Rab GTPases Sec4 and Ypt1, which play key roles in vesicle trafficking. Utilizing PE-nanodiscs enriched with phosphatidic acid (PEPA-nanodiscs), we specifically capture a member of the Hsp40/J-protein family, Caj1, whose function has recently been linked to membrane protein quality control. We show that the Caj1 interaction with liposomes containing PA is modulated by pH and PE lipids and depends on two patches of positively charged residues near the C-terminus of the protein. The protein Caj1 is the first example of an Hsp40/J-domain protein with affinity for membranes and phosphatidic acid lipid specificity. These findings highlight the utility of combining proteomics with lipid nanodiscs to identify and characterize protein–lipid interactions that may not be evident using other methods.

The bioavailability of RG and HRG was investigated by in vitro experiments using human and rat small intestinal enzymes and by in vivo experiments using rats in the present study. Oligosaccharides, which are minor components of RG and HRG, were hydrolysed slightly by small intestinal enzymes of humans and rats, and the hydrolysing activity was slightly higher in rats than in humans. The amount of glucose released from HRG was greater than that from RG. However, the high-molecular-weight carbohydrates of the main components were hardly hydrolysed. Furthermore, neither RG nor HRG inhibited disaccharidase activity. When rats were raised on a diet containing 5 % of RG, HRG, resistant maltodextrin or fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS) for 4 weeks, all rats developed loose stools and did not recover during the experiment, except for the FOS group. Body weight gain was normal in all groups and was not significantly different compared with the control group. Caecal tissue and content weights were significantly increased by feeding RG or HRG, although other organ and tissue weights were not significantly different among the groups. In conclusion, RG and HRG consist of small amounts of glucose and digestible and non-digestible oligosaccharides, and large amounts of glucose polymers, which were hardly hydrolysed by α-amylase and small intestinal enzymes. RG and HRG, which were developed newly as dietary fibre materials, had no harmful effects on the growth and development of rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-amylase 3abioavailability 3abody weight changes 3acecum 3adietary fiber 3adigestibility 3afeces 3afructooligosaccharides 3aglucose 3agrowth and development 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3ainsoluble fiber 3amaltodextrins 3apolymers 3arats 0aDigestibility 0aPhysical effects 0aNew dietary fibre material 0aResistant glucan 0aHydrogenated resistant glucan1 aTanabe, Kenichi1 aMorita, Shigeki1 aHamaguchi, Norihisa1 aShimura, Fumio1 aNakamura, Sadako0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2015 Nov. 28, v. 114, no. 10 p.1550-1559dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145150033113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03579naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024002500134024001200159040001800171100002000189245015400209300001600363506017300379520157400552592002802126650001102154650001102165650002202176650001902198650001502217650001002232650000902242650000902251650002002260650001102280650002202291650001502313650001402328651001502342651000902357653003202366653001702398653001402415653001002429653002802439653002302467700002402490700002302514700002102537700001902558773010902577856011402686856007202800956008302872961001302955852000902968655001202977IND60514914020221214224739.0160304s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051491402DNAL7 a3163472aris7 a10113/51491402hdl7 a10.1071/WF140712doi8 ans15023  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSidman, Gabriel10aRisk assessment of post-wildfire hydrological response in semiarid basins: the effects of varying rainfall representations in the KINEROS2/AGWA model  ap. 268-278.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aRepresentation of precipitation is one of the most difficult aspects of modelling post-fire runoff and erosion and also one of the most sensitive input parameters to rainfall-runoff models. The impact of post-fire convective rainstorms, especially in semiarid watersheds, depends on the overlap between locations of high-intensity rainfall and areas of high-severity burns. One of the most useful applications of models in post-fire situations is risk assessment to quantify peak flow and identify areas at high risk of flooding and erosion. This study used the KINEROS2/AGWA model to compare several spatial and temporal rainfall representations of post-fire rainfall-runoff events to determine the effect of differing representations on modelled peak flow and determine at-risk locations within a watershed. Post-fire rainfall-runoff events at Zion National Park in Utah and Bandelier National Monument in New Mexico were modelled. Representations considered included both uniform and Soil Conservation Service Type II hyetographs, applying rain over the entire watershed and applying rain only on the burned area, and varying rainfall both temporally and spatially according to radar data. Results showed that rainfall representation greatly affected modelled peak flow, but did not significantly alter the model’s predictions for high-risk locations. This has important implications for post-fire assessments before a flood-inducing rainfall event, or for post-storm assessments in areas with low-gauge density or lack of radar data due to mountain beam blockage.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3afloods 3ahydrologic models 3anational parks 3aprediction 3aradar 3arain 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arunoff 3asoil conservation 3awatersheds 3awildfires 3aNew Mexico 3aUtah 0aBandelier National Monument 0adesign storm 0apeak flow 0aradar 0arainfall representation 0aZion National Park1 aGuertin, D.

Proteomics is no exception. In this perspective, we follow the ripples from a 1960 study of Zuckerkandl, Jones, and Pauling comparing tryptic peptides across animal species. This pioneering work directly led to the molecular clock hypothesis and the ensuing explosion in molecular phylogenetics. In the decades following, proteins continued to provide essential clues on evolutionary history. While technology has continued to improve, contemporary proteomics has strayed from this larger biological context, rarely comparing species or asking how protein structure, function, and interactions have evolved. Here we recombine proteomics with molecular phylogenetics, highlighting the value of framing proteomic results in a larger biological context and how almost forgotten research, though technologically surpassed, can still generate new ideas and illuminate our work from a different perspective. Though it is infeasible to read all research published on a large topic, looking up older papers can be surprisingly rewarding when rediscovering a “gem” at the end of a long citation chain, aided by digital collections and perpetually helpful librarians. Proper literature study reduces unnecessary repetition and allows research to be more insightful and impactful by truly standing on the shoulders of giants.

With a moderate persistence in plants, soil and, water, it can be carried to grape musts, particularly when applied to control grape rot diseases. This work aimed to determine the effect of chlorothalonil on Saccharomyces cerevisiae under fermentative conditions using a flow cytometry approach. Yeasts were cultivated in synthetic must with different concentrations of chlorothalonil (0 to 60 μM) and evaluated for culture-ability, membrane integrity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, mitochondrial membrane potential, metacaspase activity, ATP, nonprotein SH and, SH-proteins. The results confirmed the oxidation of nonprotein SH, including glutathione, and the binding of the fungicide with sulfhydryl proteins, which led to changes in the cell and mitochondrial membranes that result in the necrotic death of part of the yeast population, and a reduction in metabolic activity. Moreover, the reduction in glutathione-SH concentration was responsible for the increase in ROS which in turn triggers metacaspase-dependent apoptotic cell death. Cells that escape death adapt and began to grow and ferment after a dose-dependent lag-phase period, exhibiting an almost normal fermentative behavior thereafter. Moreover, was observed unexpected protection of chlorothalonil sub-dosages on yeast cell membrane integrity during alcoholic fermentation. This study contributed insights into how chlorothalonil leads the non-target organism S. cerevisiae to cell death and explores the effect of the fungicide during alcoholic fermentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aalcoholic fermentation 3aapoptosis 3abiochemical pathways 3achlorothalonil 3adeath 3adose response 3aflow cytometry 3aglutathione 3agrapes 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3anontarget organisms 3aoxidation 3areactive oxygen species 3asoil 3ayeasts 0aFungicide 0aMembrane integrity 0aApoptosis 0aReactive oxygen species1 aDelamare, Ana Paula Longaray1 aEcheverrigaray, Sergio0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2022 Mar., v. 182 p.105032-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2021.1050323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03666naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008200166520160500248592002801853650001501881650002201896650002501918650001001943650001601953650001301969650001501982650001801997650001002015650001602025650002702041650001502068650001402083650001902097650002202116650002302138650001002161650001502171650003702186650002402223650001402247650002102261650001502282650002402297650002502321653001902346653003402365653001802399653001602417653000802433653000802441653000902449653000802458653000702466653000802473653000802481653000802489653000802497653001102505653000702516653001002523653001002533700002302543700001702566700001902583700001702602700002702619700002302646773012102669856008502790852000902875655001202884IND60762241320221120215702.0220726e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076224132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2022.1050342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamdi, Hiba10aSubchronic exposure to Epoxiconazole induced-heart damage in male Wistar rats  aEpoxiconazole is a worldwide fungicide used to control fungal diseases. Although to its hazardous effects in non-target species, little information is available in the literature to show the cardiotoxic effects of EPX in male rats. Thus, our investigation aimed to assess the outcomes of EPX exposure on some biochemical parameters, the generation of oxidative stress, DNA fragmentation and histopathological alterations in the heart tissue. EPX was administered orally at doses of 8, 24, 40 and 56 mg/kg body weight, representing, respectively NOEL (No observed effect level), NOEL× 3, NOEL× 5 and NOEL× 7 for 28 consecutive days in male Wistar rats. Our results show that EPX induced a significant decrease of cardiac acetylcholinesterase, an increase of biochemical markers, such as creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) and a perturbation of the lipid profile. Furthermore, EPX caused diverse histological modifications in the myocardium, including congestion of cardiac blood vessels, cytoplasmic vacuolization, leucocytic infiltration and hemorrhage. Indeed, we have shown that EPX induces increase of lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation levels and DNA damage. On the other hand, we have found an increase of the antioxidant enzymes activity such as catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities. The glutathione peroxidase and glutathione S tranferase initially enhanced at the doses of 8, 24, and 40 mg/kg b.w. and then decreased at the dose of 56 mg/kg b.w. In conclusion, our work has shown that EPX causes cardiotoxic effects by altering redox status and damaging heart tissue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aDNA fragmentation 3aacetylcholinesterase 3ablood 3abody weight 3acatalase 3acreatinine 3aepoxiconazole 3afungi 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahemorrhage 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3alipid composition 3alipid peroxidation 3amales 3amyocardium 3ano observed adverse effect level 3anontarget organisms 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aphysiology 3asubchronic exposure 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aCardiotoxicity 0aOxidative stress, Gentoxicity 0aEpoxiconazole 0aWistar rats 0aEPX 0aROS 0aNOEL 0aLPO 0aPC 0aSOD 0aCAT 0aGPx 0aCPK 0aT-CHOL 0aTG 0aLDL-C 0aHDL-C1 aBen othmene, Yosra1 aKhlifi, Aida1 aHallara, Elhem1 aHouas, Zohra1 aNajjar, Mohamed Fadhel1 aAbid-Essefi, Salwa0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2022 Mar., v. 182 p.105034-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2022.1050343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02983naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008600165300001600251520168600267592002801953650002401981650001302005650001002018650002202028650001302050650001802063650001402081650001202095650002902107650002102136650001802157650001502175650003102190650001602221650002202237650001702259650002602276700002302302773013402325856008102459852000902540655001202549IND60654705320221122205031.0190726e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065470532DNAL7 a10.1017/S00071145120040592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernell, Olle10aClinical effects of probiotics: scientific evidence from a paediatric perspective  ap. S70-S75.  aProbiotics are live micro-organisms that when given in adequate amounts can cause health benefits. The safety and efficacy of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of various clinical conditions have been evaluated in randomised controlled clinical trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Generally, their safety has been documented. As a supplement to standard rehydration therapy, probiotics have been demonstrated to shorten the duration of diarrhoea resulting from acute viral gastroenteritis and in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in healthy children. Preliminary evidence suggests that probiotics might prevent necrotising enterocolitis in very-low-birth-weight infants, but further studies are needed before definite conclusions can be drawn. Probiotics have also been assessed in the treatment and prevention of allergic disease but the results, although promising, need further confirmation. Targeting a paediatric population, probiotics have been evaluated in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, Helicobacter pylori gastritis and infantile colic, but at this stage, there is no evidence to support their routine use for these indications. There is a great need for studies aiming at disentangling the mechanisms by which probiotics mediate their clinical effects and for comparative studies between various probiotic bacteria. We still need to know which probiotic(s) to use and for which indications. A clearer message on dosages, optimal timing and duration of administration is needed. For this purpose, more carefully designed and sufficiently powered, randomised controlled trials with predefined outcomes are needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicobacter pylori 3achildren 3acolic 3acomparative study 3adiarrhea 3aenterocolitis 3agastritis 3ainfants 3airritable bowel syndrome 3alow birth weight 3ameta-analysis 3aprobiotics 3arandomized clinical trials 3arehydration 3asystematic review 3atherapeutics 3aviral gastroenteritis1 aWest, Christina E.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2013 Jan., v. 109, no.

There is a great body of literature to prove that gp120 binds to CD4 first, then to the coreceptor. Binding experiments and functional assays have demonstrated that CD4 binding induces conformational changes in gp120 that enable or enhance its interaction with a coreceptor. Previous studies provided different glycomic maps for the HIV-1 gp120. Here, we build on previous work to report that the use of LC-MS/MS, in conjunction with hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) enrichment to glycosylation sites, associated with the assorted neutralizing or binding events of glycosylation targeted antibodies from different clades or strains. In this study, the microheterogeneity of the glycosylation from 4 different clades of gp120s is deeply investigated. Aberrant glycosylation patterns were detected on gp120 that originated from different clades, viral sequences, and host cells. The results of this study may help provide a better understanding of the mechanism of how the glycans participate in the antibody neutralizing process that targets glycosylation sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aantibodies 3aglycomics 3aglycoproteins 3aglycosylation 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3apolysaccharides 3aproteome 3aresearch 0agp120 0aHIV isolates 0aglycoproteomics 0aglycopeptides 0amicroheterogeneity 0aLC-MS/MS1 aSong, Ehwang1 aHuang, Yifan1 aYu, Aiying1 aMechref, Yehia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6661-60730 tJournal of proteome research.g2021 Aug. 27, v. 20, no. 10 p.4862-4874dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c005873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002400137245005800161300001600219520136100235592002801596650002601624650003701650650001401687650002601701650001201727650002101739650001201760650001501772650000901787650000901796650002001805650001101825650001401836650001301850651001501863653002301878653001201901653002501913653002401938700002301962700002001985700002302005773010902028856007102137852000902208655001202217IND60514914320221118235448.0160304s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051491432DNAL7 a10.1071/WF141712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobichaud, Peter R.10aValidation of a probabilistic post-fire erosion model  ap. 337-350.  aPost-fire increases of runoff and erosion often occur and land managers need tools to be able to project the increased risk. The Erosion Risk Management Tool (ERMiT) uses the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model as the underlying processor. ERMiT predicts the probability of a given amount of hillslope sediment delivery from a single rainfall or snowmelt event on unburned, burned and recovering forest, range and chaparral hillslopes and the effectiveness of selected mitigation treatments. Eight published field study sites were used to compare ERMiT predictions with observed sediment deliveries. Most sites experienced only a few rainfall events that produced runoff and sediment (1.3–9.2%) except for a California site with a Mediterranean climate (45.6%). When sediment delivery occurred, pooled Spearman rank correlations indicated significant correlations between the observed sediment delivery and those predicted by ERMiT. Correlations were ρ=0.65 for the controls, ρ=0.59 for the log erosion barriers and ρ=0.27 (not significant) for the mulch treatments. Half of the individual sites also had significant correlations, as did 6 of 7 compared post-fire years. These model validation results suggest reasonable estimates of probabilistic post-fire hillslope sediment delivery when compared with observations from eight field sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3aWater Erosion Prediction Project 3achaparral 3afield experimentation 3aforests 3amodel validation 3amulches 3aprediction 3arain 3arisk 3arisk management 3arunoff 3asediments 3asnowmelt 3aCalifornia 0aerosion prediction 0aFS WEPP 0apost-fire assessment 0aprobabilistic model1 aElliot, William J.1 aLewis, Sarah A.1 aMiller, Mary Ellen0 tInternational journal of wildland fire.g2016, v. 25, no. 3 p.337-350dCSIRO Publishingx1049-80017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF141713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245011400167520134100281592002801622650001201650650001601662650001601678650001701694650001401711650001501725650001701740650001201757650001301769650001601782650000901798650001201807650001301819650001501832650002001847653002101867653004001888653002401928653002901952653001201981700001501993700001802008700001802026700002802044700001902072700001502091773011802106856008802224852000902312655001202321IND60762241620221120225951.0220606e20220501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076224162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1525022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Chun10aCrop selection reduces potential heavy metal(loid)s health risk in wastewater contaminated agricultural soils  aVegetable crops have varied heavy metal(loid)s accumulation rates from soils to their edible tissues. However, crop selection has been seldom evaluated as a strategy for reducing the health risks of ingesting vegetables grown in soils contaminated by treated wastewater (TWW) irrigation. We cultivated twenty commonly grown vegetables using soils with an approximately 50-year history of TWW irrigation, and their ingestion risks were evaluated by the health risk index (HRI). Results showed that twenty vegetable species had varied abilities in accumulating heavy metal(loid)s from soils to their edible parts (e.g., >100 times of difference for Cd). We found higher potential health risks (HRI > 1) due to As, Cd, and Pb for adults ingesting few vegetable species and all the studied vegetables had negligible health risks (HRI < 1) for Cr, Cu, and Zn. These results suggest that remediation strategies should be targeted towards As, Cd, and Pb removal in agricultural soils in this region. Total HRI > 5 was obtained for ingesting spinach, Chinese lettuce, and Chinese chives, suggesting a high potential of severe health risks. Negligible risks (total HRI < 1) were found for tomato, kidney bean, potato, and cabbage. Our study highlights crop selection as a feasible strategy for ensuring food safety in TWW contaminated farmlands.  aPublisher supplied data 3acabbage 3aenvironment 3afood safety 3aheavy metals 3aingestion 3airrigation 3akidney beans 3alettuce 3apotatoes 3aremediation 3arisk 3aspinach 3atomatoes 3awastewater 3awater pollution 0aPhytoremediation 0aSustainable agricultural production 0aMining and smelting 0aDissolved organic matter 0a13C NMR1 aYang, Ying1 aKwan, Mei-po,1 aMa, Zhen-Bang1 aKarthikeyan, Raghupathy1 aWang, Jun-Jian1 aChen, Huan0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 May 01, v. 819 p.152502-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1525023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02339naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100003400137245010300171300001600274520106400290592002801354650001901382650001201401650001101413650001601424650001101440650001501451650000901466650001101475650001401486653000801500653001901508653002701527653001401554653001801568653001801586653001001604700001901614700002301633700002401656773010901680856007101789961001201860852000901872655001201881IND60514914520221118235257.0160304s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051491452DNAL7 a10.1071/WF160212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShakesby, R.

We convened a conference attended by experts and practitioners in post-wildfire impacts, meteorology and related research, including modelling, to focus on priority research issues. The aim was to improve our understanding of controls and responses and the predictive capabilities of models. This conference led to the eight selected papers in this special issue. They address aspects of the distinctiveness in the controls and responses among wildfire regions, spatiotemporal rainfall variability, infiltration, runoff connectivity, debris flow formation and modelling applications. Here we summarise key findings from these papers and evaluate their contribution to improving understanding and prediction of post-wildfire runoff and erosion under changes in climate, human intervention and population pressure on wildfire-prone areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aexperts 3ahumans 3ameteorology 3amodels 3aprediction 3arain 3arunoff 3awildfires 0aash 0aclimate change 0ahydraulic conductivity 0ahydrology 0aoverland flow 0aprecipitation 0ascale1 aMoody, John A.1 aMartin, Deborah A.1 aRobichaud, Peter R.0 tInternational journal of wildland fire.g2016, v. 25, no. 3 p.257-261dCSIRO Publishingx1049-80017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF160213Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02350naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245014200172300001100314520124200325592002801567650002001595650001201615650003001627650002801657650001301685650001201698651001301710651001401723700002401737700002401761700001901785773010601804856008101910852000901991655001202000IND60514914620221118235438.0160419e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051491462DNAL7 a10.1007/s00114-016-1355-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, Gabriel S.10aReview of the fossil matamata turtles: earliest well-dated record and hypotheses on the origin of their present geographical distribution  ap. 28.  aThe matamata (Chelus fimbriatus) is a highly aquatic chelid turtle known exclusively from northern South America. Due to its extremely modified morphology, it is well circumscribed among living taxa, but that is not the case of the two extinct species ascribed to the taxon, Chelus colombianus and Chelus lewisi. These were originally described for the Miocene of Colombia and Venezuela, respectively, and are known mostly from post-cranial material. Few traits have been considered diagnostic for these fossil taxa, and their shared geographic and temporal distributions raise doubts about their distinctiveness. Here, we describe new turtle remains from the early Miocene Castillo Formation, at Cerro la Cruz, northwestern Venezuela, assigning them to C. colombianus. We also review the taxonomy and diagnostic features of the fossil species of Chelus, comparing them with the variation recognized within C. fimbriatus. All alleged differences between the fossil Chelus species were found in our sample of the extant species, and may represent intraspecific variation of a single fossil species. Further, we reviewed the fossil record of Chelus spp. and proposed a paleobiogeographic hypothesis to explain its present geographic range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aextinct species 3afossils 3ageographical distribution 3aintraspecific variation 3ataxonomy 3aturtles 3aColombia 3aVenezuela1 aRincón, Ascanio D.1 aSolórzano, Andrés1 aLanger, Max C.0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2016 Apr., v. 103, no. 3-4 p.28-28dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0028-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-016-1355-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245013700160300001100297520145700308592002801765650001701793650002101810650002401831650001601855650000901871650001801880650002001898650003501918650002401953650001001977650001801987650001202005650001602017650002602033650001102059650001702070650001002087700001902097700001302116700001702129700001702146700001802163700002002181773010602201856008102307852000902388655001202397IND60514914820221118235348.0160419e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051491482DNAL7 a10.1007/s00114-016-1347-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Xin10aReproductive responses of male Brandt’s voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii) to 6-methoxybenzoxazolinone (6-MBOA) under short photoperiod  ap. 29.  aThe plant secondary metabolite 6-methoxybenzoxazolinone (6-MBOA) can stimulate and enhance animal reproduction. This compound has been successfully detected in Leymus chinensis, which is the main diet of Brandt’s voles. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different 6-MBOA doses on the reproductive physiology of male Brandt’s voles under a short photoperiod. The results showed that 6-MBOA administration increased relative testis weight, regardless of the dose, but it had little effect on the body mass. Low and middle doses of 6-MBOA increased the concentrations of luteinizing hormone and testosterone in the serum and the mRNA levels of StAR and CYP11a1 in the testes. However, 6-MBOA did not cause any significant increase in the mRNA levels of KiSS-1, GPR54, and GnRH compared to those in the control group. The mRNA level of KiSS-1 in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) was higher than that in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV). Collectively, our results demonstrated that the number of KiSS-1-expressing neurons located in the ARC was the highest, and that 6-MBOA, which might modulate the reproductive activity along the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, had a dose-dependent stimulatory effect on the reproductive activity of Brandt’s voles under a short photoperiod. Our study provided insights into the mechanism of 6-MBOA action and the factors influencing the onset of reproduction in Brandt’s voles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLasiopodomys 3aLeymus chinensis 3aanimal reproduction 3ablood serum 3adiet 3adose response 3agene expression 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3aluteinizing hormone 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3aneurons 3aphotoperiod 3asecondary metabolites 3atestes 3atestosterone 3avoles1 aJiang, Lian Yu1 aHan, Mei1 aYe, Man Hong1 aWang, Ai Qin1 aWei, Wan Hong1 aYang, Sheng Mei0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2016 Apr., v. 103, no. 3-4 p.29-29dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0028-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-016-1347-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009800169300001600267520129300283592002801576650001601604650001701620650001901637650002601656650002601682650002501708650001301733650001101746650001401757650002201771650001001793651002101803700001701824700002101841700001901862773008101881856008101962852000902043655001202052IND60514914920221118235317.0160304e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051491492DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-015-9926-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXavier, José C.,10aBiogeography of Cephalopods in the Southern Ocean Using Habitat Suitability Prediction Models  ap. 220-247.  aOur understanding of how environmental change in the Southern Ocean will affect marine diversity, habitats and distribution remain limited. The habitats and distributions of Southern Ocean cephalopods are generally poorly understood, and yet such knowledge is necessary for research and conservation management purposes, as well as for assessing the potential impacts of environmental change. We used net-catch data to develop habitat suitability models for 15 of the most common cephalopods in the Southern Ocean. Using modeled habitat suitability, we assessed favorable areas for each species and examined the relationships between species distribution and environmental parameters. The results compared favorably with the known ecology of these species and with spatial patterns from diet studies of squid predators. The individual habitat suitability models were overlaid to generate a “hotspot” index of species richness, which showed higher numbers of squid species associated with various fronts of the Antarctic circumpolar current. Finally, we reviewed the overall distribution of these species and their importance in the diet of Southern Ocean predators. There is a need for further studies to explore the potential impacts of future climate change on Southern Ocean squid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCephalopoda 3abiogeography 3aclimate change 3adiet study techniques 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental impact 3ahabitats 3amodels 3apredators 3aspecies diversity 3asquid 3aAntarctic region1 aRaymond, Ben1 aJones, Daniel C.1 aGriffiths, Huw0 tEcosystems.g2016 Mar., v. 19, no. 2 p.220-247dSpringer USx1432-98407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-015-9926-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01746naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245012600163300001800289520061000307592002800917650003600945650002500981650003101006650002301037650001101060650002101071650002101092650001501113700001401128700005201142773012201194856008301316852000901399655001201408IND60752316220221120125004.0211001e20210910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075231622DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c025132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jun10aEnantioselective Synthesis of Indanes with a Quaternary Stereocenter via Diastereoselective C(sp³)–H Functionalization  ap. 7359-7363.  aA practical synthesis of enantioenriched indane derivatives with quaternary stereocenters was developed via sequential enantioselective reduction and C–H functionalization. Good to excellent enantioselectivity could be achieved by either the CuH-catalyzed asymmetric reduction or the Corey–Bakshi–Shibata (CBS) reduction of indanone derivatives. The subsequent diastereospecific and regioselective rhodium-catalyzed silylation of the methyl C–H bond led to indane derivatives with quaternary centers. This strategy was further applied in syntheses of (nor)illudalane and botryane sesquiterpenoids.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3adiastereoselectivity 3aenantioselective synthesis 3aenantioselectivity 3aindans 3aregioselectivity 3asesquiterpenoids 3asilylation1 aShi, Zhan1 aLu, Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2259-27000 tOrganic letters.g2021 Sept. 10, v. 23, no. 19 p.7359-7363dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19216x1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.1c025133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01903naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245010300162300001800265520076800283592002801051650001601079650001501095650001401110650001601124650001101140650001901151650002101170650003301191700001801224700001601242700001401258700005501272773012201327856008301449852000901532655001201541IND60752316320221120124943.0211001e20210920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075231632DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c025142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Pei10aNickel/Photo-Cocatalyzed Regioselective Ring Opening of N-Tosyl Styrenyl Aziridines with Aldehydes  ap. 7364-7369.  aAldehydes and aziridines are both intrinsic electrophilic reagents, and thus the coupling reaction between these two compounds is highly challenging. In this protocol, the merger of nickel and hydrogen-atom-transfer photocatalysis successfully enables the ring opening of N-tosyl styrenyl aziridines with aldehydes, providing a novel and atom-economical access to a variety of β-amino ketones with complete regiocontrol. The preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the ring opening reaction proceeds with a cooperative catalytic mode: aldehydes are converted into acyl radicals by tetrabutylammonium decatungstate under irradiation, whereas the nickel catalyst is engaged in the ring opening of aziridines and the following carbon–carbon bond-forming step.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aaziridines 3acatalysts 3airradiation 3anickel 3aphotocatalysis 3aregioselectivity 3atetrabutylammonium compounds1 aJin, Youxiang1 aLiu, Jiawei1 aWang, Rui1 aWang, Chuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9219-17850 tOrganic letters.g2021 Sept. 20, v. 23, no. 19 p.7364-7369dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19216x1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.1c025143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02346naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005500149245017500204300001800379520103900397592002801436650000801464650001501472650001201487650001901499650001401518700001701532700001901549700001501568700001801583700005701601700005301658700005901711773012201770856008301892852000901975655001201984IND60752316620221120124836.0211001e20210921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075231662DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c025622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Bizhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4181-533X10aEnhancing the Potential of Miniature-Scale DNA-Compatible Radical Reactions via an Electron Donor–Acceptor Complex and a Reversible Adsorption to Solid Support Strategy  ap. 7381-7385.  aDNA-encoded library (DEL) technology is a powerful tool in the discovery of bioactive probe molecules and drug leads. Mostly, the success in DEL technology stems from the molecular diversity of the chemical libraries. However, the construction of DELs has been restricted by the idiosyncratic needs and the required low concentration (∼1 mM or less) of the library intermediate. Here, we report visible-light-promoted on-DNA radical coupling reactions via an electron donor–acceptor (EDA) complex and a reversible adsorption to solid support (RASS) strategy. This protocol provides a unique solution to the challenges of increasing the reactivity of highly diluted DNA substrates and reducing the residues of heavy metals from photocatalysts. A series of on-DNA indole sulfone and selenide derivatives were obtained with good to quantitative conversions. It is anticipated that these mild-condition on-DNA radical reactions will significantly improve the chemical diversity of DELs and find widespread utility to DEL construction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aadsorption 3aindoles 3aphotocatalysts 3aselenides1 aLü, Weiwei,1 aChen, Zhen-Yu,1 aZhang, Yue1 aDuan, Yin-zhe1 aLü, Xiaojie,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3600-288X1 aYan, Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9888-07441 aZhang, Xue-jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1429-94720 tOrganic letters.g2021 Sept. 21, v. 23, no. 19 p.7381-7385dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19216x1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.1c025623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03401naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245014600185300001800331520167300349592002802022650001502050650002402065650002502089650001002114650001902124650002302143650001602166650001802182650001602200650002302216650001602239650000902255650001202264650001202276650001902288650002002307650003202327650002502359653001502384653001902399653001202418653002302430653002002453700002302473700001902496700001902515700002102534700001902555700001902574773013902593856008202732852000902814655001202823IND60516349920221117172335.0190726e20151214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051634992DNAL7 a263957552pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145150035052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurakami, Yuki10aSupplemental epilactose prevents metabolic disorders through uncoupling protein-1 induction in the skeletal muscle of mice fed high-fat diets  ap. 1774-1783.  aObesity is one of the major health problems throughout the world. The present study investigated the preventive effect of epilactose – a rare non-digestible disaccharide – on obesity and metabolic disorders in mice fed high-fat (HF) diets. Feeding with HF diets increased body weight gain, fat pad weight and adipocyte size in mice (P<0·01), and these increases were effectively prevented by the use of supplemental epilactose without influencing food intake (P<0·01). Caecal pools of SCFA such as acetic and propionic acids in mice fed epilactose were higher compared with mice not receiving epilactose. Supplemental epilactose increased the expression of uncoupling protein (UCP)-1, which enhances energy expenditure, to 2-fold in the gastrocnemius muscle (P=0·04) and to 1·3-fold in the brown adipose tissue (P=0·02) in mice fed HF diets. Feeding HF diets induced pro-inflammatory macrophage infiltration into white adipose tissue, as indicated by the increased expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1, TNF-α and F4/80, and these increases were attenuated by supplemental epilactose. In differentiated myogenic-like C2C12 cells, propionic acid, but not acetic or n-butyric acids, directly enhanced UCP-1 expression by approximately 2-fold (P<0·01). Taken together, these findings indicate that the epilactose-mediated increase in UCP-1 in the skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue can enhance whole-body energy expenditure, leading to effective prevention of obesity and metabolic disorders in mice fed HF diets. It is suggested that propionic acid – a bacterial metabolite – acts as a mediator to induce UCP-1 expression in skeletal muscles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3abody weight changes 3abrown adipose tissue 3acecum 3achemokine CCL2 3aenergy expenditure 3afood intake 3ahigh fat diet 3amacrophages 3ametabolic diseases 3ametabolites 3amice 3amuscles 3aobesity 3apropionic acid 3askeletal muscle 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3awhite adipose tissue 0aEpilactose 0aPropionic acid 0aObesity 0aUncoupling protein 0aSkeletal muscle1 aOjima-Kato, Teruyo1 aSaburi, Wataru1 aMori, Haruhide1 aMatsui, Hirokazu1 aTanabe, Soichi1 aSuzuki, Takuya0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2015 Dec. 14, v. 114, no. 11 p.1774-1783dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145150035053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245013200168520186100300592002802161650001902189650002002208650002002228650001502248650001602263650001002279650001002289650001802299650001302317650001902330650000902349653001802358653002802376653002902404653002102433653002302454653002402477700001502501700001102516700001402527700001602541700001902557700001702576773011902593856008802712852000902800655001202809IND60762243820221120185913.0220929e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076224382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1527372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yuqian10aEffects of multiple global change factors on soil microbial richness, diversity and functional gene abundances: A meta-analysis  aSoil microbial richness, diversity, and functional gene abundance are crucial factors affecting belowground ecosystem functions; however, there is still a lack of systematic understanding of their responses to global change. Here, we conducted a worldwide meta-analysis using 1071 observation data concerning the effects of global change factors (GCFs), including warming (W), increased precipitation (PPT+), decreased precipitation (PPT-), elevated CO₂ concentration (eCO₂), and nitrogen deposition (N), to evaluate their individual, combined, and interactive effects on soil microbial properties across different groups and ecosystems. Across the dataset, eCO₂ increased microbial richness and diversity by 40.5% and 4.6%, respectively; warming and N addition decreased the abundance of denitrification functional genes (nirS, nirK, and nozS); N addition had a greater impact on soil C-cycling functional genes than on N-cycling ones. Long-term precipitation change was conducive to the increase in soil microbial richness, and fungal richness change was more sensitive than bacterial richness, but the sensitivity of bacteria richness to N addition was positively correlated with experimental duration. Soil microbial richness, diversity, and functional gene abundances could be significantly affected by individual or multiple GCF changes, and their interactions are mainly additive. W×eCO₂ on microbial diversity, and N×PPT+ and W×N on N-cycling functional gene abundance showed synergistic interactions. Based on the limitations of the collected data and the findings, we suggest designing experiments with multiple GCFs and long experimental durations and incorporating the effects and interactions of multiple drivers into ecosystem models to accurately predict future soil microbial properties and functions under future global changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3adata collection 3adenitrification 3aecosystems 3aenvironment 3afungi 3agenes 3ameta-analysis 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3asoil 0aGlobal change 0aSoil microbial richness 0aSoil microbial diversity 0aFunctional genes 0aIndividual effects 0aInteractive effects1 aMa, Junwei1 aYu, Yi1 aLi, Yijia1 aShen, Xinyi1 aHuo, Shouliang1 aXia, Xinghui0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 815 p.152737-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1527373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01522naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245005500165300001800220520051200238592002800750650001200778650001500790650001600805700001200821700001800833700001600851700001700867700001600884700001800900700005200918773012200970856008301092852000901175655001201184IND60752317620221120025044.0211001e20210922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075231762DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c026362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Shiqi10aSandmeyer-Type Reductive Disulfuration of Anilines  ap. 7428-7433.  aA transition metal/ligand-free disulfuration of anilines with disulfur transfer reagents (dithiosulfonate or tetrasulfide) is reported herein.

Rainfall interception, tree root cohesion, and tree surcharge were considered as main plant cover effects on the slope stability. In this regard, an improved version of the Transient Rainfall Infiltration and Grid-based Regional Slope stability model (TRIGRS) was performed using Microsoft Excel® and GIS framework system for coupled hydrological–mechanical modeling of rainfall-induced landslide by incorporating plant cover effects. The infiltration process of the improved model was integrated with the precipitation distribution method and rainfall interception approach while the slope stability analysis of TRIGRS model was replaced with the improved analysis with consideration of root cohesion and tree surcharge. In the following, the spatial temporal analysis of slope failures was performed using the monthly average rainfall during two different monsoon seasons of 2008 and 2009 for triggering shallow slope failure in Hulu Kelang area. The corresponding changes in pressure head and consequent water table depth were calculated during two monsoon seasons. Subsequently, factor of safety is computed using local rainfall patterns, along with root coefficient and tree surcharge in the study area. The results showed the plant-covered slopes are inducing an overestimation of the slope failure susceptibility using existing TRIGRS model, while the improved model resulted that less landslide susceptible areas were more representative of the actual stability conditions of the slopes at the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acohesion 3acomputer software 3ageographic information systems 3alandslides 3amodels 3amonsoon season 3arain 3asafety factor 3atrees 3awater table 3aMalaysia1 aMansor, Shattri1 aKassim, Azman1 aLee, Lee Min1 aSaadatkhah, Reza1 aSobhanmanesh, Ali0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 Mar., v. 75, no. 5 p.445-445dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-5326-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03528naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245011300172506011700285506007600402520165700478592002802135506003702163650001502200650001902215650001402234650001902248650000902267650001502276650002902291650001602320650002002336650003102356650001202387650001302399650002102412650001602433650002902449653001902478653000902497653001602506653002502522653002002547700001802567700002002585700002402605700002302629700002002652700002102672700002502693700001602718773011902734856008802853852000902941655001202950IND60762244220221207061122.0220606e20220415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076224422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1527492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Sosa, Irene10aHow to thrive in unstable environments: Gene expression profile of a riparian earthworm under abiotic stress  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNowadays, extreme weather events caused by climate change are becoming more frequent. This leads to the occurrence of extreme habitats to which species must adapt. This challenge becomes crucial for species living in unstable environments, such as the riparian earthworm Eiseniella tetraedra. Its cosmopolitan distribution exposes it to various environmental changes, such as freezing in subarctic regions or droughts in Mediterranean areas. Transcriptional changes under cold and desiccation conditions could therefore shed light on the adaptive mechanisms of this species. An experiment was performed for each condition. In the cold experiment, the temperature was lowered to −14 °C ± 2 °C (compared to 8 °C for control samples), and in the desiccation treatment, humidity was lowered from 60% to 15%. Comparisons of gene expression levels between earthworms under freezing conditions and control earthworms revealed a total of 84 differentially expressed genes and comparisons between the desiccation experiment and the control yielded 163 differentially expressed genes. However, no common responses were found between the two treatments. The results suggest that E. tetraedra can acclimate to low temperatures due to the upregulation of genes involved in glucose accumulation. However, downregulation of the respiratory chain suggests that this earthworm does not tolerate freezing conditions. Under desiccation conditions, genes involved in cell protection from apoptosis and DNA repair were upregulated. In contrast, lipid metabolism was downregulated, presumably to conserve resources by reducing the rate at which they are consumed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA repair 3aabiotic stress 3aapoptosis 3aclimate change 3acold 3aearthworms 3aelectron transport chain 3aenvironment 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aglucose 3ahumidity 3alipid metabolism 3atemperature 3atranscription (genetics) 0aClimate change 0aCold 0aDesiccation 0aEiseniella tetraedra 0aTranscriptomics1 aVerdes, Aída1 aTilikj, Natasha1 aMarchán, Daniel F.1 aPlanelló, Rosario1 aHerrero, Oscar,1 aAlmodóvar, Ana,1 aCosín, Darío Díaz1 aNovo, Marta0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Apr. 15, v. 817 p.152749-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1527493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012400164300001200288520107500300592002801375596004901403650001501452650001501467650002201482650001301504650001601517650000901533650001701542650000901559650001101568650000701579650001401586650002301600650001501623650001301638700002201651700001701673700001301690700001801703700001901721773013401740856008201874852000901956655001201965IND60514917220221118235049.0210712e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051491722DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4855-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Seol Ah10aSimultaneous removal of chromium(VI) and Reactive Black 5 using zeolite supported nano-scale zero-valent iron composite  ap. 447.  aPollution due to heavy metals and dyes has become a major global environmental issue. Simultaneous removal of heavy metals and dyes from wastewater remains a major challenge. In this study, a zeolite supported nano-scale zero-valent iron (Z-nZVI) composite was innovatively used for the simultaneous removal of Cr(VI) and Reactive Black 5 from aqueous solution. Experiments were carried out at different pH values (2–8) and adsorbent dosages (0.2–1 g L⁻¹). The maximum removal was found to be 99% for both Cr(VI) and Reactive Black 5 (RB5) at pH 3 with initial RB5 concentration 85 mg L⁻¹, Cr(VI) concentration 23 mg L⁻¹ and adsorbent dosage 1 g L⁻¹. A Freundlich model showed a satisfactory fit to the equilibrium adsorption data of a Z-nZVI composite with a correlation coefficient R ² = 0.9790 for RB5 and R ² = 0.9726 for Cr(VI). The kinetics of adsorption followed a pseudo-first-order model. The results of the study indicated that a Z-nZVI composite could potentially be used for the simultaneous removal of metals and dyes from wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data  a2013001470006cKorea Ministry of Environment 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3achromium 3acorrelation 3adyes 3aheavy metals 3airon 3amodels 3apH 3apollution 3asorption isotherms 3awastewater 3azeolites1 aKamala-Kannan, S.1 aOh, Sae-Gang1 aCho, Min1 aBae, Sunyoung1 aOh, Byung-Taek0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 Mar., v. 75, no. 5 p.447-447dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4855-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245011600183300001800299520155300317592002801870650005301898650001101951650001601962650002801978650001802006650000802024650001202032650002002044650002502064650001002089651002102099653001402120653002502134653002402159653001102183700001602194700001702210700001602227773013902243856008202382852000902464655001202473IND60516351020221119111928.0190726e20151214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051635102DNAL7 a264204172pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145150036332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKo, Min Jung10aRelation of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D status with skeletal muscle mass by sex and age group among Korean adults  ap. 1838-1844.  aThe objective of this study was to examine whether high serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration was associated with high skeletal muscle mass, taking into account the effects of sex and age among the participants of the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) aged 40 years or older. This was a cross-sectional study using data from the 2009 to 2010 KNHANES; a total of 8406 subjects (3671 men and 4735 women) were included. The appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMMI, kg/m²) was estimated to measure the skeletal muscle mass. Hypovitaminosis was classified when the level of serum 25(OH)D was <20 ng/ml. The general linear model adjusted for confounding factors was used to determine differences in means of ASMMI by 25(OH)D status. The mean values of ASMMI were higher for men when compared with women. Women had a greater proportion of hypovitaminosis (71·1 %) compared with men (53·2 %). After adjusting for multiple factors, men were seen to have significant differences in ASMMI based on 25(OH)D status regardless of age, showing a lower mean value of ASSMI in those with hypovitaminosis. However, there was no difference in ASMMI by 25(OH)D status among women in both younger and older age groups. In conclusion, we found that there might be a positive relationship between 25(OH)D and skeletal muscle mass in men, indicating that interventions to improve 25(OH)D levels that are aimed at increasing muscle mass could be beneficial for men with more rapid decreased rate of skeletal muscle mass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aadults 3ablood serum 3across-sectional studies 3alinear models 3amen 3amuscles 3askeletal muscle 3avitamin deficiencies 3awomen 3aKorean Peninsula 0aVitamin D 0aSkeletal muscle mass 0a25-Hydroxyvitamin D 0aAdults1 aYun, Sungha1 aOh, Kyungwon1 aKim, Kirang0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2015 Dec. 14, v. 114, no. 11 p.1838-1844dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145150036333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03201naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245011000185300001800295520179700313592002802110650000902138650001102147650001402158650001002172650001202182650002802194650001402222650001102236650001402247650003002261650002202291650001902313650000802332650001002340651002202350653001502372653004702387700002102434700002302455700002502478773013802503856008102641852000902722655001202731IND60654707920221122170646.0190726e20131114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065470792DNAL7 a236280822pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145130007802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIvey, Kerry L.10aTea and non-tea flavonol intakes in relation to atherosclerotic vascular disease mortality in older women  ap. 1648-1655.  aEpidemiological studies have indicated that dietary flavonoids generally, and flavonols specifically, may contribute to cardiovascular health. Tea consumption, which is often the main dietary source of flavonoids and flavonols, is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular outcomes. The primary objective of the present study was to explore the association of the habitual intake of flavonols from tea and non-tea sources with the risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease mortality in a population of elderly women. A total of 1063 women, aged over 75 years, were randomly selected from ambulant Caucasian women living in Perth, Western Australia. Flavonoid consumption was assessed using the US Department of Agriculture Flavonoid, Flavone and Proanthocyanidin databases. Atherosclerotic vascular disease mortality was assessed over 5 years of follow-up through the Western Australian Data Linkage System. During the follow-up, sixty-four women died from atherosclerotic vascular disease. Women in the highest compared with the lowest tertile of flavonol intake had a lower risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease death (OR 0·27, 95 % CI 0·13, 0·59; P≤ 0·01 for trend in multivariate-adjusted models). Similar relationships were observed for flavonol intake derived from both tea (OR 0·38, 95 % CI 0·18, 0·79; P< 0·01) and non-tea (OR 0·41, 95 % CI 0·20, 0·85; P= 0·05) sources. Tea was the main contributor to flavonol intake (65 %), and the intakes of flavonols from tea and non-tea sources were not significantly correlated. In conclusion, increased consumption of flavonols was independently associated with a lower risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease mortality. Both tea and non-tea sources of flavonols were independently associated with this benefit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUSDA 3aWhites 3adatabases 3adeath 3aelderly 3aepidemiological studies 3aflavonols 3amodels 3amortality 3anutrition risk assessment 3aproanthocyanidins 3arisk reduction 3atea 3awomen 3aWestern Australia 0aFlavonoids 0aAtherosclerotic vascular disease mortality1 aLewis, Joshua R.1 aPrince, Richard L.1 aHodgson, Jonathan M.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2013 Nov. 14, v. 110, no. 9 p.1648-1655dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145130007803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03263naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002800166245015200194300001800346520175100364592002802115650001302143650001202156650001202168650001702180650001402197650001002211650002302221650003002244650001202274650002402286650002402310650003002334651001002364653003002374653001202404700005202416700003302468700002002501700001802521700002602539773013802565856008102703852000902784655001202793IND60654708220221122205022.0190726e20131114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065470822DNAL7 a235344172pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145130008222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrio-Lopez, María T.10aProspective study of changes in sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and the incidence of the metabolic syndrome and its components: the SUN cohort  ap. 1722-1731.  aThe incidence of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) is increasing and lifestyle behaviours may play a role. The aim of the present study was to prospectively assess the association between changes in the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) and the incidence of the MetS and its components in a Spanish cohort of university graduates. We included 8157 participants initially free of the MetS and followed up during at least 6 years. SSB consumption was collected by a FFQ previously validated in Spain. The change in SSB consumption was calculated as the difference between SSB consumption at a 6-year follow-up and baseline consumption. The MetS was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation and the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's new definition of the MetS that had harmonised previous definitions. The associations between changes in SSB intake and the MetS were examined using multiple logistic regression. We observed 361 incident cases of the MetS. Participants who increased their consumption of SSB (upper v. lower quintile) had a significantly higher risk of developing the MetS (adjusted OR 2·2, 95 % CI 1·4, 3·5; P for trend = 0·003). Similarly, they presented a significantly higher risk of developing high blood pressure (adjusted OR 1·6, 95 % CI 1·3, 2·1), central obesity (adjusted OR 2·3, 95 % CI 1·9, 2·7), hypertriacylglycerolaemia (adjusted OR 1·7, 95 % CI 1·1, 2·6) or impaired fasting glucose (adjusted OR 1·6, 95 % CI 1·1, 2·2). In conclusion, an increase in SSB consumption was associated with a higher risk of developing the MetS and other metabolic disorders after 6 years of follow-up in a Mediterranean cohort of university graduates.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiabetes 3afasting 3aglucose 3ahypertension 3alifestyle 3alungs 3ametabolic syndrome 3anutrition risk assessment 3aobesity 3aprospective studies 3aregression analysis 3asugar sweetened beverages 3aSpain 0aSugar-sweetened beverages 0aCohorts1 aMartínez G., Miguel A.q(Martínez González),1 aFernandez-Montero, Alejandro1 aBeunza, Juan J.1 aZazpe, Itziar1 aBes Rastrollo, Maira,0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2013 Nov. 14, v. 110, no. 9 p.1722-1731dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145130008223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02140naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015800166300001400324520113300338592002801471650001401499650001301513650002801526650001601554650002501570650001401595650001801609650001601627773009301643856008101736852000901817655001201826IND60514918220221118235249.0160304e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051491822DNAL7 a10.1007/s13668-016-0154-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoth, Katie A.10aAssociations Between Food Restriction and Pressure-to-Eat Parenting Practices and Dietary Intake in Children: a Selective Review of the Recent Literature  ap. 61-67.  aThe identification of modifiable determinants child dietary intake has become a public health priority. Food-related parenting practices, including pressure-to-eat and food restriction, have been identified as potentially significant determinants of dietary intake in children. This is a review of the literature to date that has explored the relationship between food restriction and pressure-to-eat and child dietary intake. In general, findings from laboratory-based studies and longitudinal studies suggest that children exposed to high levels of food restriction and pressure-to-eat are more likely to consume sugar-sweetened beverages, palatable snack foods, and calorie-dense food items than children exposed to lower levels. Results from the body of cross-sectional studies examining this relationship are decidedly less conclusive, yielding inconsistent and sometimes contradictory results. Overall, the concept of food-related parenting practices as a potentially modifiable factor with the potential to positively impact child dietary intake patterns continues to be worth pursuing through additional future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverages 3achildren 3across-sectional studies 3afood intake 3alongitudinal studies 3aparenting 3apublic health 3asnack foods0 tCurrent nutrition reports.g2016 Mar., v. 5, no. 1 p.61-67dSpringer USx2161-33117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13668-016-0154-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01775naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245004300169300001400212520090300226592002801129650001601157650001601173650001101189650002101200650001601221650001301237650000901250700001901259773009301278856008101371852000901452655001201461IND60514918420221118235423.0160304e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051491842DNAL7 a10.1007/s13668-016-0155-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarvid, Maryam S.10aAdolescent Diet and Breast Cancer Risk  ap. 29-33.  aAlthough breast cancer risk increases with age, the importance of early events on breast cancer development is increasingly recognized. Compared to the plethora of studies on adult dietary exposures and breast cancer risk, the field of adolescent diet and breast cancer risk is still in its infancy. We review the data on breast cancer risk and diet during adolescence (defined as between ages 11 and 19) with a focus on the dietary exposures that have been investigated most in adult diet. The current literature suggests possible associations with dietary intake of soy and red meat and breast cancer risk. However, the lack of strong associations for other exposures may be due to methodological issues regarding precise measurement and a paucity of published studies. Overall, the area of early life exposures and cancer risk deserves more research and increased resources to advance the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescence 3aadolescents 3aadults 3abreast neoplasms 3afood intake 3ared meat 3arisk1 aChen, Wendy Y.0 tCurrent nutrition reports.g2016 Mar., v. 5, no. 1 p.29-33dSpringer USx2161-33117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13668-016-0155-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245018500171520157500356592002801931650000801959650001601967650001601983650001701999650001202016651001002028651001802038653002502056653003302081653002402114700001502138700001602153700001502169700001502184700001802199773011902217856008802336852000902424655001202433IND60762245620221116152344.0220929e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076224562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1527702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Sunling10aMulti-scale analysis of the impacts of meteorology and emissions on PM2.5 and O3 trends at various regions in China from 2013 to 2020 1: Synoptic circulation patterns and pollution  aA multiscale analysis of meteorological trends was carried out to investigate the impacts of the large-scale circulation types as well as the local-scale key weather elements on the complex air pollutants, i.e. PM₂.₅ and O₃ in China. As the first paper in the series, the relationship between synoptic circulation patterns and pollution was investigated. Six types of circulation patterns are defined and clustered to correlate with the observed pollutant levels, resulting in the identification of the impact similarity and difference of circulations on PM₂.₅ and O₃ for three regions in China, i.e., the BTH (Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei), YRD (Yangtze River Delta) and PRD (Peral River Delta), from 2013 to 2020. It is found that the six clustered circulation patterns were able to classify the circulation patterns that influence the pollutants and yield significant correlations with O₃ and PM₂.₅ in three regions. The major circulation patterns governing the heavy PM₂.₅ and O₃ were identified separately for each region and found to show inter-annual variabilities. Composite analysis indicated that there were some circulation patterns that caused the dual-highs of PM₂.₅ and O₃ with about 13%, 8% and 3% occurrences during the period of 2013 to 2020 in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, respectively. The key weather elements for each type of circulation pattern were also identified. A detailed study of the impacts of key weather elements and emissions on the PM₂.₅ and O₃ trends will accompany this paper (Gong et al., 2022).  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aenvironment 3ameteorology 3ariver deltas 3aweather 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aSynoptic circulation 0aPrincipal component analysis 0aPM2.5 and O3 trends1 aLiu, Yilin1 aHe, Jianjun1 aZhang, Lei1 aLu, Shuhua1 aZhang, Xiaoye0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 815 p.152770-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1527703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002600166245019800192300001800390520145000408592002801858650001101886650002801897650001401925650001601939650001701955650001001972650004301982650002002025650001402045650001402059650001902073650001102092650001502103650001002118653001302128653000802141653001502149653001902164653002502183700002502208700002202233700002302255773013902278856008202417852000902499655001202508IND60516352020221119112500.0190726e20151228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051635202DNAL7 a264236542pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145150037482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetersen, Kristina S.10aDietary intake in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes: validation of the Dietary Questionnaire for Epidemiological Studies version 2 FFQ against a 3-d weighed food record and 24-h urinalysis  ap. 2056-2063.  aThe Dietary Questionnaire for Epidemiological Studies version 2 (DQES v2) FFQ has not been validated in adults with diabetes. The aim was to determine the agreement between the DQES v2 FFQ and a 3-d weighed food record (WFR) and 24-h urinalysis in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The DQES v2 FFQ and a 3-d WFR were completed on one occasion for measurement of food and nutrient intake. A 24-h urine sample was provided for measurement of Na and K excretion. Participants were sixty-seven adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes recruited from the community. Nutrient intake reported in the FFQ was within 20 % of the corresponding intake level reported in the WFR for the majority of nutrients. However, the 95 % limits of agreement showed large variation at an individual level between the two methods. There was a weak to moderate correlation between nutrient intake measured using the two methods and a moderate to high correlation for food intake. Quintile analysis showed that for the majority of foods and nutrients >60 % of participants were ranked within 1 quintile of the WFR ranking. The weighted κ values showed slight to moderate agreement between the two methods. Na intake was under-estimated in the FFQ by 25 % and K intake was over-estimated by 5 % compared with the 24-h urinalysis. In adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, it is appropriate to use the DQES v2 FFQ to measure food and nutrient intake at a group level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aepidemiological studies 3aexcretion 3afood intake 3afood records 3afoods 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anutrient intake 3anutrients 3apotassium 3aquestionnaires 3asodium 3aurinalysis 3aurine 0aDiabetes 0aFFQ 0aValidation 0aDietary intake 0aWeighed food records1 aSmith, Jacqueline M.1 aClifton, Peter M.1 aKeogh, Jennifer B.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2015 Dec. 28, v. 114, no. 12 p.2056-2063dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145150037483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245008700183300001800270520134100288592002801629650002001657650002101677650002501698650001001723650002001733650002001753650001101773650001301784650001501797650001001812650002501822650001501847650001601862650001901878650003001897650002501927650001401952650002001966650001701986650001602003653001402019653003202033653001702065653001302082700001402095700002702109700002302136773013802159856008102297852000902378655001202387IND60654709120221122170715.0190726e20131114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065470912DNAL7 a236281132pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145130009742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndrew, Toby10aUnravelling the basis of variability in cobalamin levels in the general population  ap. 1672-1679.  aCobalamin (Cbl) is an essential B vitamin involved in the normal functioning of the nervous system, the formation of key components of blood, DNA synthesis and methylation, and energy production. Physiological levels of Cbl vary greatly within populations, although the basis for this variability remains largely unknown. We conducted a twin study to characterise the basis of variation in plasma Cbl levels and to test whether common genetic polymorphisms in genes known to cause defects in inborn errors of Cbl metabolism and transport are also associated with mean plasma Cbl levels in the general population. The present results showed that plasma levels of Cbl were heritable, with genetic and phenotypic variance increasing with age, and levels significantly correlated with age, BMI, exercise, alcohol consumption, smoking status, social class and folate levels, which collectively accounted for up to 15 % of Cbl variation. Of eight genes responsible for the defects of the Cbl metabolic pathway (cblA–G and mut), MMAA, MMACHC, MTRR and MUT harboured polymorphisms that showed evidence of association with Cbl levels. Characterisation of the heritable component of variation in Cbl levels can facilitate the early diagnosis and prognosis of Cbl insufficiency/deficiency in individuals at a higher risk of associated diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA replication 3aalcohol drinking 3abiochemical pathways 3ablood 3abody mass index 3aearly diagnosis 3aenergy 3aexercise 3afolic acid 3agenes 3agenetic polymorphism 3ametabolism 3amethylation 3anervous system 3anutrition risk assessment 3aphenotypic variation 3aprognosis 3asmoking (habit) 3asocial class 3avitamin B12 0aCobalamin 0aInborn errors of metabolism 0aTwin studies 0aGenetics1 aGill, Raj1 aGillham-Nasenya, Irina1 aAhmadi, Kourosh R.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2013 Nov. 14, v. 110, no. 9 p.1672-1679dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145130009743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03403naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002300188245009700211300001800308506007600326520170700402592002802109506003702137650001602174650002002190650001802210650001802228650001602246650001902262650001502281650001702296650002502313650000802338650001702346650001802363650001702381653003102398653000802429653001702437653002502454653001402479700002002493700002102513700002202534700002202556700002102578700002002599773013902619856008202758852000902840655001202849IND60516352520221207100815.0190726e20151228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051635252DNAL7 aPMC55502892pmcid7 a264506302pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145150038152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO’Neil, Adrienne10aPro-inflammatory dietary intake as a risk factor for CVD in men: a 5-year longitudinal study  ap. 2074-2082.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aConvincing evidence has identified inflammation as an initiator of atherosclerosis, underpinning CVD. We investigated (i) whether dietary inflammation, as measured by the ‘dietary inflammatory index (DII)’, was predictive of 5-year CVD in men and (ii) its predictive ability compared with that of SFA intake alone. The sample consisted of 1363 men enrolled in the Geelong Osteoporosis Study who completed an FFQ at baseline (2001–2006) (excluding participants who were identified as having previous CVD). DII scores were computed from participants’ reported intakes of carbohydrate, micronutrients and glycaemic load. DII scores were dichotomised into a pro-inflammatory diet (positive values) or an anti-inflammatory diet (negative values). The primary outcome was a formal diagnosis of CVD resulting in hospitalisation over the 5-year study period. In total, seventy-six events were observed during the 5-year follow-up period. Men with a pro-inflammatory diet at baseline were twice as likely to experience a CVD event over the study period (OR 2·07; 95 % CI 1·20, 3·55). This association held following adjustment for traditional CVD risk factors and total energy intake (adjusted OR 2·00; 95 % CI 1·03, 3·96). This effect appeared to be stronger with the inclusion of an age-by-DII score interaction. In contrast, SFA intake alone did not predict 5-year CVD events after adjustment for covariates (adjusted OR 1·40; 95 % CI 0·73, 2·70). We conclude that an association exists between a pro-inflammatory diet and CVD in Australian men. CVD clinical guidelines and public health recommendations may have to expand to include dietary patterns in the context of vascular inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAustralians 3aatherosclerosis 3aeating habits 3aenergy intake 3afood intake 3aglycemic index 3aguidelines 3ainflammation 3alongitudinal studies 3amen 3aosteoporosis 3apublic health 3arisk factors 0aDietary inflammatory index 0aCVD 0aRisk factors 0aLongitudinal studies 0aNutrition1 aShivappa, Nitin1 aJacka, Felice N.1 aKotowicz, Mark A.1 aKibbey, Katherine1 aHebert, James R.1 aPasco, Julie A.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2015 Dec. 28, v. 114, no. 12 p.2074-2082dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145150038153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03388naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245009900161300001600260500001500276520196600291592002802257650001802285650001502303650002502318650001102343650001302354650001302367650001502380650001202395650001802407650001502425650001002440650001302450650002102463650001902484650001602503650001502519650001202534650002102546650001602567650001602583650001102599650001102610653001202621700002002633700002702653773009602680856007302776852000902849655001202858IND60514919920221118235102.0160304e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051491992DNAL7 a10.1111/jph.124502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtulak, Katarzyna10aUltrastructural Impact of Tobacco Rattle Virus on Tobacco and Pepper Ovary and Anther Tissues  ap. 226-241.  a2019-12-06  aThe one‐third of plant viruses are seed transmitted, and this has significant economic consequences. Tobacco rattle virus (TRV), belonging to the genus Tobravirus and family Virgaviridae, has one of the widest host range of any known plant viruses. TRV infects vegetative organ and effects seed and pollen development that results in a decrease in crop yield. The mechanisms by which Tobravirus is transmissible to seeds are still poorly understood. The presence of the virus in pollen grains and inside ovaries is linked with seed transmission and can have effects on virus particles' transport during the pollination and fertilization process. This paper focuses on the significant impact of TRV on pepper and tobacco anthers and ultrastructure changes in ovaries. The presence of two types of TRV particles in ovary wall parenchyma and vascular tissues as well as in placenta cells was demonstrated via ultrastructural analysis. For the first time, the regular inclusion of virus particles was reported in both ovule integuments and nucellus parenchyma cells. Immunolocalization of TRV capsid proteins indicated the deposition of TRV CP epitope in ovary vascular bundles and in placenta cells. Moreover, the presence of virus particles was demonstrated inside pepper seeds in endothelium and integument parenchyma layers as well as on the embryo cell wall. Virus particles were found not only on the surface of pollen grains but also inside pepper pollen protoplasts in mature anthers. Also, this is the first time where TRV particles are reported in both differentiated endothecium cells and the remaining tapetum cells. Moreover, the detection of TRV capsid protein epitope in tobacco and pepper vascular anther tissues as well as in tapetum and endothecium cells was correlated with TRV distribution in infected anthers. Demonstrated analyses indicated that pollen grains and ovaries with ovules as well as could be a natural source of TRV transmission.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant viruses 3acrop yield 3aTobacco rattle virus 3apollen 3aepitopes 3aplacenta 3acell walls 3aviruses 3acoat proteins 3ahost range 3aseeds 3anucellus 3avascular tissues 3aultrastructure 3apollination 3aintegument 3atobacco 3avascular bundles 3aprotoplasts 3aendothelium 3avirion 3apepper 0aanthers1 aKozieł, Edmund1 aGarbaczewska, Grażyna0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2016 Apr., v. 164, no. 4 p.226-241dPareyx0931-17857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jph.124503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245019000187300001800377520163600395592002802031650001302059650001302072650002002085650002002105650002802125650001402153650001302167650001902180650002402199650001902223650001002242653001502252653001702267653002302284653001302307700001702320700002102337700001602358700001602374700002302390773013902413856008202552852000902634655001202643IND60516352720221119112517.0190726e20151228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051635272DNAL7 a264355342pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145150038392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWardenaar, F.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the validity of assessing protein intake using three web-based 24-h recalls and questionnaires, by comparing these with three urinary N excretions on the same day. A total of forty-seven Dutch elite top athletes, both disabled and non-disabled, aged between 18 and 35 years, with a BMI of 17·5–31 kg/m², exercising >12 h/week were recruited. Estimated mean dietary protein intake was 109·6 (sd 33·0) g/d by recalls and questionnaires v. 141·3 (sd 38·2) g/d based on N excretions in urine; the difference was 25·5 (sd 21·3) % between the methods (P<0·05). We found a reasonably good association between methods for protein intake of 0·65 (95 % CI 0·45, 0·79). On an individual level, under-reporting was larger with higher protein intakes than with lower intakes. No significant differences were found in reporting absolute differences between subcategories (sex, under-reporting, BMI, collection of recalls within a certain amount of time and using protein supplements or not). In conclusion, combined, multiple, 24-h recalls and questionnaires underestimated protein intake in these young elite athletes more than that reported for non-athlete populations. The method proved to be suitable for ranking athletes according to their protein intake as needed in epidemiological studies. On an individual level, the magnitude of underestimation was about equal for all athletes except for those with very high protein intakes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aathletes 3abody mass index 3adietary protein 3aepidemiological studies 3aexcretion 3anitrogen 3aprotein intake 3aprotein supplements 3aquestionnaires 3aurine 0aValidation 0a24-h recalls 0aNitrogen excretion 0aAthletes1 aSteennis, J.1 aCeelen, I.

The results showed that the membrane fouling was well controlled in Hy-AnMBR from the aspects of sludge property and membrane filtration performance. The solid concentration, including TS and MLSS in the Hy-AnMBR was reduced after introducing the fixed bed carrier, which was 13% and 20% lower than the control AnMBR (Con-AnMBR), and this resulted in improved filtration performance. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) photograph showed that membrane pores could still be observed on the Hy-AnMBR surface, indicating that the cake layer fouling of the Hy-AnMBR was less than the Con-AnMBR. The increase of the EPS and SMP promoted the acceleration of the membrane fouling rate. Analysis through confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and membrane cleaning revealed that adding sponge carriers mitigated 3.3%–9% pore-blocking, and the total membrane resistance in the Hy-AnMBR was reduced by 52% compared to the Con-AnMBR. Chemical cleaning was essential for pollutant removal, and membrane permeability recovery was more than 97%.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood waste 3amembrane bioreactors 3amembrane permeability 3amicrofiltration 3aphotographs 3apollution control 3apolyurethanes 3asludge 0aThermophilic anaerobic digestion 0aHybrid anaerobic membrane bioreactor (Hy-AnMBR) 0aMembrane fouling 0aSponge carriers1 aQiao, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5287-99161 aJiang, Pengwu1 aWu, Zhiyue1 aLin, Min1 aSun, Yibo1 aDong, Renjie0 tChemosphere.g2022 Apr., v. 292 p.133488-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1334883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01976naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245011900208300001600327520098400343592002801327650000801355650001801363650001201381650001101393650001701404700002001421773009601441856008101537990002301618852000901641655001201650IND60091400920221116184931.0141103e20130219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009140092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bpj.2012.12.0142doi7 aPMC35765412pmcid7 a234429652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwan, James W.10aNonequilibrium Distributions and Hydrodynamic Coupling Distort the Measurement of Nanoscale Forces near Interfaces  ap. 863-872.  aWe calculate the displacement of a single spherical particle from the minimum of a harmonic well positioned near a plane wall and immersed in a uniform flow. A failure to account for the fluctuations in particle position orthogonal to the plane (leading to fluctuations in hydrodynamic drag) results in large discrepancies, with the naive displacement calculated by assuming no fluctuations in the balance of forces. The chief criterion for neglecting such fluctuations is that the stiffness of the harmonic potential exceeds the thermal stresses on the particle by at least two orders of magnitude. For micrometer-diameter particles typically employed in force spectroscopy of DNA, macromolecules, and molecular motors, this can lead to errors of up to 100% in the measured properties. The Supporting Material to the article provides an implementation of this model intended to fit experimental measurements for the stiffness of the harmonic potential constraining the particle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3ahydrodynamics 3akinesin 3amodels 3aspectroscopy1 aFurst, Eric M.,0 tBiophysical journal.g2013 Feb. 19, v. 104, no. 4 p.863-872dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2012.12.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001600137245009900153300002000252520117000272650001601442650001201458650002701470650001901497650001601516650002201532650001301554650001301567650001101580650002101591650002001612700001901632700001701651700001901668700001801687700001501705773016301720856004001883852000901923655001201932IND4535100120221118231256.0160304e20141203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453510012DNAL7 a10.1021/jf503865e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Canhui10aDifferent Structural Properties of High-Amylose Maize Starch Fractions Varying in Granule Size  ap. 11711-11721.  aLarge-, medium-, and small-sized granules were separated from normal and high-amylose maize starches using a glycerol centrifugation method. The different-sized fractions of normal maize starch showed similar molecular weight distribution, crystal structure, long- and short-range ordered structure, and lamellar structure of starch, but the different-sized fractions of high-amylose maize starch showed markedly different structural properties. The amylose content, iodine blue value, amylopectin long branch-chain, and IR ratio of 1045/1022 cmâ1 significantly increased with decrease of granule size, but the amylopectin short branch-chain and branching degree, relative crystallinity, IR ratio of 1022/995 cmâ1, and peak intensity of lamellar structure markedly decreased with decrease of granule size for high-amylose maize starch. The large-sized granules of high-amylose maize starch were A-type crystallinity, native and medium-sized granules of high-amylose maize starch were CA-type crystallinity, and small-sized granules of high-amylose maize starch were C-type crystallinity, indicating that C-type starch might contain A-type starch granules. 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3acarbohydrate structure 3acentrifugation 3acorn starch 3acrystal structure 3aglycerol 3agranules 3aiodine 3amolecular weight 3astarch granules1 aLin, Lingshang1 aMan, Jianmin1 aZhao, Lingxiao1 aWang, Zhifeng1 aWei, Canxu0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2014 Dec. 3, v. 62, no. 48 p.11711-11721dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf503865e  aDNAL 7aarticle01734naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245013400210300001600344520076100360592002801121650001601149650002401165650001601189700001801205773009601223856008101319990002301400852000901423655001201432IND60091401020221116184858.0141103e20130219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009140102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bpj.2012.12.0192doi7 aPMC35765462pmcid7 a234429662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinh, David D.L.10aWide-Angle X-Ray Solution Scattering for Protein-Ligand Binding: Multivariate Curve Resolution with Bayesian Confidence Intervals  ap. 873-883.  aA new way to use wide-angle x-ray solution scattering to study protein-ligand binding is presented. First, scattering patterns are measured at different protein and ligand concentrations. Multivariate curve resolution based on singular value decomposition and global analysis is applied to estimate the binding affinities and reference patterns (i.e., the scattering patterns of individual components). As validated by simulation, Bayesian confidence intervals provide accurate uncertainty estimates for the binding free energies and reference patterns. Experimental results from several protein-ligand systems demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, which promises to expand the role of wide-angle x-ray scattering as a quantitative biophysical tool.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aconfidence interval 3auncertainty1 aMakowski, Lee0 tBiophysical journal.g2013 Feb. 19, v. 104, no. 4 p.873-883dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2012.12.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01484naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245011100173300001400284500001400298520041800312592002800730650002400758650001400782651001500796653001300811653002400824653001900848653001700867700001800884700002500902700002200927773009400949856008201043852000901125655001201134IND60698951420221119165429.0210116e20161116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069895142DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.632.105762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuglielmino, Adalgisa10aDescription of the first species of Fiorianteon Olmi (Hymenoptera, Dryinidae) from the Afrotropical region  ap. 93-98.  aNAL-light  aFiorianteon sulcatum sp. n. is described from Fianarantsoa Province (Madagascar).

The capsid is organized as a hexameric lattice. CA subunits in each hexamer are connected through interfaces that involve the CA N-terminal domain (NTD); pairs of CA subunits belonging to different hexamers are connected through a different interface that involves the C-terminal domain (CTD). At physiological ionic strength in noncrowded conditions, CA subunits homodimerize through this CTD-CTD interface, but do not hexamerize through the other interfaces (those involving the NTD). Here we have investigated whether macromolecular crowding conditions are able to promote hexamerization of the isolated NTD and/or full-length CA (with an inactive CTD-CTD interface to prevent polymerization). The oligomerization state of the proteins was determined using analytical ultracentrifugation in the absence or presence of high concentrations of an inert macromolecular crowding agent. Under the same conditions that promoted efficient assembly of intact CA dimers, neither NTD nor CA with an inactive CTD-CTD interface showed any tendency to form hexamers or any other oligomer. This inability to hexamerize was observed even in macromolecularly crowded conditions. The results indicate that a functional CTD-CTD interface is strictly required for hexamerization of HIV-1 CA through the other interfaces. Together with previous results, these observations suggest that establishment of NTD-CTD interactions involved in CA hexamerization during mature HIV-1 capsid assembly requires a homodimerization-dependent conformational switching of CTD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3acapsid 3acoat proteins 3adimerization 3aionic strength 3aultracentrifugation 3avirion1 aAlfonso, Carlos1 aRodríguez-Huete, Alicia1 aFuertes, Miguel Ángel1 aJiménez, Mercedes1 aRivas, Germán,1 aMateu, Mauricio G.,0 tBiophysical journal.g2013 Feb. 19, v. 104, no. 4 p.884-893dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2012.12.0353Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245013700189300001800326520162600344592002801970650000901998650001302007650001402020650001002034650000902044650003102053650001202084650001502096650002002111650002002131650001402151653002702165653000802192653001302200653002002213653002502233700001702258700001902275700001802294700002102312773013802333856008202471852000902553655001202562IND60516343620221119110323.0190726e20151028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051634362DNAL7 a263377092pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145150025852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMidorikawa, Taishi10aPrediction and validation of total and regional skeletal muscle volume using B-mode ultrasonography in Japanese prepubertal children  ap. 1209-1217.  aVery few effective field methods are available for accurate, non-invasive estimation of skeletal muscle volume (SMV) and mass in children. We aimed to develop regression-based prediction equations for SMV, using ultrasonography, in Japanese prepubertal children, and to assess the validity of these equations. In total, 145 healthy Japanese prepubertal children aged 6–12 years were randomly divided into two groups: the model development group (sixty boys, thirty-seven girls) and the validation group (twenty-nine boys, nineteen girls). Reference data in the form of contiguous MRI with 1-cm slice thickness were obtained from the first cervical vertebra to the ankle joints. The SMV was calculated by the summation of digitised cross-sectional areas. Muscle thickness was measured using B-mode ultrasonography at nine sites in different regions. In the model development group, strong, statistically significant correlations were observed between the site-matched SMV (total, arms, trunk, thigh and lower legs) measured by MRI and the muscle thickness×height measures obtained by ultrasonography, for both boys and girls. When these SMV prediction equations were applied to the validation groups, the measured total and regional SMV were also very similar to the values predicted for boys and girls, respectively. With the exception of the trunk region in girls, the Bland–Altman analysis for the validation group did not indicate any bias for either boys or girls. These results suggest that ultrasonography-derived prediction equations for boys and girls are useful for the estimation of total and regional SMV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboys 3achildren 3aequations 3agirls 3alegs 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amuscles 3aprediction 3askeletal muscle 3aultrasonography 3avertebrae 0aSkeletal muscle volume 0aMRI 0aChildren 0aUltrasonography 0aPrediction equations1 aOhta, Megumi1 aHikihara, Yuki1 aTorii, Suguru1 aSakamoto, Shizuo0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2015 Oct. 28, v. 114, no. 8 p.1209-1217dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145150025853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245013500209520148300344592002801827650001501855650002601870650001601896650003601912650001401948650001101962650001601973650001401989650001502003653003102018653002302049653001902072700006102091773009502152856008202247852000902329655001202338IND60751818420221119223916.0211030e20211105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075181842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2021.1324752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuleta, Ernesto C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0232-752810aAlkylation of monomeric, dimeric, and polymeric lignin models through carbon-hydrogen activation using Ru-catalyzed Murai reaction  aIn this study, we have assessed directed carbon-hydrogen activation (CHA) for alkylation of monomeric, dimeric, and polymeric lignin models using Murai's catalyst [RuH₂(CO)(PPh₃)₃]. Based on related work from our laboratory showing that isolated organosolv lignin bears benzylic directing groups ideal for CHA reactions, this approach could offer new methodology for the valorization of biorefinery lignin. Monomeric and dimeric models bearing a keto group at the benzylic position undergo Ru-catalyzed alkylation in good to excellent yield. Similarly, models bearing a benzylic OH group also undergo alkylation via a tandem oxidation/alkylation process enabled by the Ru catalyst. Polymeric models show low levels of functionalization as a result of the poor solubility of the starting polymer. With unsymmetrical models, functionalization occurs first at the least sterically hindered ortho-site, but a subsequent alkylation, leading to disubstituted products can occur at the more sterically hindered site, leading to hexasubstituted arenes. The reaction shows sensitivity to free phenolic OH groups, which appears to reduce the yield in some reactions, and is also a contributing factor to the low yields observed with polymeric lignin models. Combining CHA methodology with lignin isolation technology able to introduce appropriate directing groups for catalytic functionalization will form the basis for improved conversion of lignin to high value chemical products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkylation 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3abiorefining 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3acatalysts 3alignin 3amethodology 3aoxidation 3asolubility 0aCarbon hydrogen activation 0aRuthenium catalyst 0aMurai reaction1 aBozell, Joseph J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6952-963X0 tTetrahedron.g2021 Nov. 05, v. 100 p.132475-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11744x0040-40207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2021.1324753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03729naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002800155245015000183520184200333592002802175650001602203650002502219650001302244650002502257650001702282650002002299650001602319650001602335650001302351650001502364650001502379650001402394650001202408650001502420650001502435650001202450650001002462650001302472650001402485650001502499650001602514650002102530650002002551650001102571650001302582650001302595650000902608650001502617650000902632650001502641653001702656653002002673653002702693653002102720653002902741653002102770700002802791700002202819700002402841773009102865856009002956852000903046655001203055IND60762235620221119115445.0220523e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076223562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1335112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurthy, Meesala Krishna10aAssessment of toxicity in the freshwater tadpole Polypedates maculatus exposed to silver and zinc oxide nanoparticles: A multi-biomarker approach  aNanoparticles (NPs), especially silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) and zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs), are widely used in various industrial applications and are released into the surrounding environment through industrial and household wastewater. They have enormous toxic effects on aquatic animals and amphibians. In the current study, a multi-biomarker approach was used to assess toxicity on Polypedates maculatus (P. maculatus) tadpoles collected from a freshwater pond and exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of Ag-NPs (1, 5 and 10 mg L⁻¹) and ZnO-NPs (1, 10 and 50 mg L⁻¹). A significant bioaccumulation of silver (Ag) and Zinc (Zn) was observed in the blood, liver, kidney and bones in comparison to control tadpoles. Blood parameters (Red blood cells (RBC), Hematocrit (Htc), White blood cells (WBC), monocytes, lymphocytes and neutrophils), immunological markers (ACH50, lysozyme, total Ig, total protein, albumin, and globulin), biochemical markers (glucose, cortisol, cholesterol, triglycerides, alanine transaminase (ALT), asparatate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), urea and creatinine) and the oxidative stress marker (LPO) of serum were increased significantly (p < 0.05) in Ag/ZnO-NPs exposed groups when compared to the control groups. The levels of mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and haemoglobin (Hb) in the ZnO NP-exposed groups were significantly different from those in the control group. Antioxidant (SOD and CAT) levels were significantly declined in the treatment groups. Based on the results, Ag/ZnO-NPs are toxic to aquatic organisms and amphibians at sub-lethal concentrations. The species P. maculatus can be used as a bioindicator for the nanomaterial (NM) contamination of freshwater systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPolypedates 3aalanine transaminase 3aalbumins 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aantioxidants 3abioaccumulation 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3acortisol 3acreatinine 3afreshwater 3aglobulins 3aglucose 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3akidneys 3aliver 3alysozyme 3amonocytes 3ananosilver 3aneutrophils 3aoxidative stress 3aprotein content 3asilver 3atadpoles 3atoxicity 3aurea 3awastewater 3azinc 3azinc oxide 0aAntioxidants 0aBioaccumulation 0aBiochemical parameters 0aCharacterisation 0aImmunological parameters 0aOxidative stress1 aMohanty, Chandra Sekhar1 aSwain, Priyabrata1 aPattanayak, Rojalin0 tChemosphere.g2022 Apr., v. 293 p.133511-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1335113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001700137245008700154300002000241520112500261650004001386650002301426650003101449650002601480650001501506650003701521650001701558650001001575700001801585700001701603700002101620700001601641700001601657700001901673700001901692773016401711856004001875852000901915655001201924IND4535100820221118231316.0160304e20141210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453510082DNAL7 a10.1021/jf50480892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Da-Wei10aSynthesis and Herbicidal Evaluation of Triketone-Containing Quinazoline-2,4-diones  ap. 11786-11796.  aExploring novel 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.27, HPPD) inhibitors is one of the most promising research directions in herbicide discovery. To discover new triketone herbicides with broad-spectrum weed control as well as excellent crop selectivity, a series of (total 52) novel triketone-containing quinazoline-2,4-dione derivatives were synthesized and further bioevaluated. The greenhouse testing indicated that many of the newly synthesized compounds showed better or excellent herbicidal activity against broadleaf and monocotyledonous weeds at the dosages of 37.5â150 g of active ingredient (ai)/ha. The structure and activity relationship in this study indicated that the triketone-containing quinazoline-2,4-dione motif has possessed great impact on herbicide activity and may be used for further optimization. Among the new compounds, III-b and VI-aâVI-d displayed a broader spectrum of weed control than mesotrione. In addition, the compound III-b also demonstrated comparatively superior crop selectivity to mesotrione, thus possessing great potential for weed control in the field. 3a4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase 3aactive ingredients 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aherbicidal properties 3amesotrione 3astructure-activity relationships 3aweed control 3aweeds1 aLin, Hong-Yan1 aCao, Run-Jie1 aYang, Sheng-Gang1 aChen, Qiong1 aHao, Ge-Fei1 aYang, Wen-Chao1 aYang, Guang-Fu0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2014 Dec. 10, v. 62, no. 49 p.11786-11796dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf5048089  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006100155245010200216506011700318506007600435520146200511592002801973506003702001650001902038650001702057650001402074653001702088653002102105653001602126653001402142653001402156700006902170700005702239700005902296700006502355700007102420700006002491773009102551856009002642852000902732655001202741IND60762235920221207113502.0220523e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076223592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1335142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaldwell, Jessica1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2333-267914aThe micro-, submicron-, and nanoplastic hunt: A review of detection methods for plastic particles  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPlastic particle pollution has been shown to be almost completely ubiquitous within our surrounding environment. This ubiquity in combination with a variety of unique properties (e.g. density, hydrophobicity, surface functionalization, particle shape and size, transition temperatures, and mechanical properties) and the ever-increasing levels of plastic production and use has begun to garner heightened levels of interest within the scientific community. However, as a result of these properties, plastic particles are often reported to be challenging to study in complex (i.e. real) environments. Therefore, this review aims to summarize research generated on multiple facets of the micro- and nanoplastics field; ranging from size and shape definitions to detection and characterization techniques to generating reference particles; in order to provide a more complete understanding of the current strategies for the analysis of plastic particles. This information is then used to provide generalized recommendations for researchers to consider as they attempt to study plastics in analytically complex environments; including method validation using reference particles obtained via the presented creation methods, encouraging efforts towards method standardization through the reporting of all technical details utilized in a study, and providing analytical pathway recommendations depending upon the exact knowledge desired and samples being studied.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahydrophobicity 3ananoplastics 3apollution 0aMicroplastic 0aSubmicronplastic 0aNanoplastic 0aDetection 0aAnalytics1 aTaladriz-Blanco, Patricia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2469-97041 aLehner, Roman1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0478-54451 aLubskyy, Andriy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6725-44301 aOrtuso, Roberto Diego1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0197-72811 aRothen-Rutishauser, Barbara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7805-93661 aPetri-Fink, Alke1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3952-78490 tChemosphere.g2022 Apr., v. 293 p.133514-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1335143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03407naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245010100188300001800289520181400307592002802121650001102149650003002160650005302190650000902243650001102252650001102263650001602274650001402290650001802304650001402322650001202336650001102348650001002359650001202369650002202381650001202403650002402415650000902439650002402448650001602472651001802488653001802506653001702524653001102541653005302552700003102605773013802636856008202774852000902856655001202865IND60516344120221119110225.0190726e20151028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051634412DNAL7 a262998922pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145150027062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurakami, Kentaro10aPrevalence and characteristics of misreporting of energy intake in US adults: NHANES 2003–2012  ap. 1294-1303.  aUsing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003–2012, we investigated the prevalence and characteristics of under-reporting and over-reporting of energy intake (EI) among 19 693 US adults ≥20 years of age. For the assessment of EI, two 24-h dietary recalls were conducted using the US Department of Agriculture Automated Multiple-Pass Method. Under-reporters, acceptable reporters and over-reporters of EI were identified by two methods based on the 95 % confidence limits: (1) for agreement between the ratio of EI to BMR and a physical activity level for sedentary lifestyle (1·55) and (2) of the expected ratio of EI to estimated energy requirement (EER) of 1·0. BMR was calculated using Schofield’s equations. EER was calculated using equations from the US Dietary Reference Intakes, assuming ‘low active’ level of physical activity. The risk of being an under-reporter or over-reporter compared with an acceptable reporter was analysed using multiple logistic regression. Percentages of under-reporters, acceptable reporters and over-reporters were 25·1, 73·5 and 1·4 %, respectively, based on EI:BMR, and 25·7, 71·8 and 2·5 %, respectively, based on EI:EER. Under-reporting was associated with female sex, older age, non-Hispanic blacks (compared with non-Hispanic whites), lower education, lower family poverty income ratio and overweight and obesity. Over-reporting was associated with male sex, younger age, lower family poverty income ratio, current smoking (compared with never smoking) and underweight. Similar findings were obtained when analysing only the first 24-h recall data from NHANES 1999–2012 (n 28 794). In conclusion, we found that misreporting of EI, particularly under-reporting, remains prevalent and differential in US adults.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlacks 3aDietary Reference Intakes 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aUSDA 3aWhites 3aadults 3adiet recall 3aeducation 3aenergy intake 3aequations 3afemales 3aincome 3amales 3aobesity 3aphysical activity 3apoverty 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asedentary lifestyle 3aunderweight 3aUnited States 0aEnergy intake 0aMisreporting 0aAdults 0aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey1 aLivingstone, M.

In this reaction, DMF contributed one N atom and one C atom to two disconnected positions of pyridine ring, with no need for an additional nitrogen source. Two C═C bonds in two molecules of substituted styrenes offered four carbon atoms in the presence of iodine and persulfate. With the optimized conditions in hand, both symmetric and unsymmetric diaryl-substituted pyridines were obtained in useful yields. On the basis of relevant literature and a series of control experimental results, a possible mechanism was proposed in this work, which may demonstrate how DMF provides both N1 and C4 sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aiodine 3anitrogen 3aorganic chemistry 3apyridines1 aLiu, Hai-Ping1 aCao, Zhong-Zhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1224-79031 aLiu, Yufeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0015-52781 aLi, Hui1 aNie, Zhi-Wen1 aYang, Tong-Lin1 aLuo, Wei-Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8472-63751 aLiu, Qiang1 aGuo, Can-Cheng0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2021 Sept. 21, v. 86, no. 19 p.13446-13453dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.1c015503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03535naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245014900181300001800330520178600348592002802134650002402162650001202186650003202198650002502230650003902255650002202294650001702316650004302333650001102376650002002387650003002407650002202437650001602459650000902475650001502484653002002499653001902519653002802538653002102566653002202587700002302609700002002632700001802652700002102670700001802691700001702709700002602726773013802752856008202890852000902972655001202981IND60516344520221117172257.0190726e20151028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051634452DNAL7 a264282782pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145150027802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEid, Noura10aImpact of palm date consumption on microbiota growth and large intestinal health: a randomised, controlled, cross-over, human intervention study  ap. 1226-1236.  aThe reported inverse association between the intake of plant-based foods and a reduction in the prevalence of colorectal cancer may be partly mediated by interactions between insoluble fibre and (poly)phenols and the intestinal microbiota. In the present study, we assessed the impact of palm date consumption, rich in both polyphenols and fibre, on the growth of colonic microbiota and markers of colon cancer risk in a randomised, controlled, cross-over human intervention study. A total of twenty-two healthy human volunteers were randomly assigned to either a control group (maltodextrin–dextrose, 37·1 g) or an intervention group (seven dates, approximately 50 g). Each arm was of 21 d duration and was separated by a 14-d washout period in a cross-over manner. Changes in the growth of microbiota were assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation analysis, whereas SCFA levels were assessed using HPLC. Further, ammonia concentrations, faecal water genotoxicity and anti-proliferation ability were also assessed using different assays, which included cell work and the Comet assay. Accordingly, dietary intakes, anthropometric measurements and bowel movement assessment were also carried out. Although the consumption of dates did not induce significant changes in the growth of select bacterial groups or SCFA, there were significant increases in bowel movements and stool frequency (P<0·01; n 21) and significant reductions in stool ammonia concentration (P<0·05; n 21) after consumption of dates, relative to baseline. Furthermore, date fruit intake significantly reduced genotoxicity in human faecal water relative to control (P<0·01; n 21). Our data indicate that consumption of date fruit may reduce colon cancer risk without inducing changes in the microbiota.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3aammonia 3aanthropometric measurements 3acolorectal neoplasms 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3afruit consumption 3agenotoxicity 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3ainsoluble fiber 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aplant-based foods 3apolyphenols 3arisk 3avolunteers 0aDate palm fruit 0aGut microbiota 0aGastrointestinal health 0aDNA genotoxicity 0aCancer biomarkers1 aOsmanova, Hristina1 aNatchez, Cecile1 aWalton, Gemma1 aCostabile, Adele1 aGibson, Glenn1 aRowland, Ian1 aSpencer, Jeremy P.

MIS occurs when the release of hepatic insulin-sensitising substance (HISS) stimulates skeletal muscle glucose uptake. Our previous study had demonstrated that the HISS pathway is impaired in age-associated insulin resistance, and in the rats which were part of that study, voluntary exercise improved the response to insulin by restoring HISS action. The present study tests the hypothesis that voluntary exercise would reverse insulin resistance in diet-induced models of insulin resistance, and that the benefits are attributed through the improvement in HISS action. In this study, two experimental diets, a high-fat diet (for 4 weeks) and 35 % sucrose solution (for 9 and 16 weeks), were used to induce insulin resistance in rats. These rats were assigned to the exercise/no-exercise intervention. The effect of 7 d voluntary running-wheel exercise was determined by measuring insulin- and HISS action in the exercised rats and comparing them with the non-exercised controls. Voluntary exercise reversed insulin resistance, caused by dietary manipulation, through restoration of the HISS action. The direct insulin action was not changed by either diet or exercise. The metabolic improvements and reduced adiposity correlated with the extent of reversal of HISS action induced by exercise. Exercise improves insulin sensitivity in diet-induced insulin resistance primarily by restoration of HISS-mediated glucose uptake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiposity 3aexercise 3aexperimental diets 3aglucose 3ahigh fat diet 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3amodels 3apostprandial state 3arats 3askeletal muscle 3asucrose 0aDiets 0aHepatic insulin-sensitising substance1 aLegare, Dallas J.1 aLautt, W.

Despite extensive work, mechanistic questions can cloud efforts to correlate results from model compounds and polymeric membranes. Here, we report an NMR study of behavior in aqueous KOH of benzyltetramethylimidazolium and benzyltrimethylammonium salts with and without para-alkyl-substitution to probe whether base attack at the alkyl substituent plays a role in the reaction pathways. In all cases, the major products from the imidazolium salts are consistent with hydrolytic ring fragmentation as the principal mode of decomposition. Also, relative decomposition kinetics for both types of salts provided no conclusive evidence for a change in reaction mechanism upon introduction of the alkyl substituent. While our data do not rule out base attack at the alkyl group in the cases where rate differences were noted, these differences appear to be better attributed to reaction medium effects of submicrometer oil phase droplets arising from salt aggregation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanion exchange 3acations 3aelectrochemistry 3aimidazoles 3aoils 3aorganic chemistry 3apolymers 3areaction mechanisms1 aLomeda, Jay R.0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2021 Sept. 20, v. 86, no. 19 p.13481-13490dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.1c015633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03846naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245011300173520225200286592002802538650001602566650001502582650001302597650001402610650001402624650001202638650001602650650001702666650002702683650001602710650001502726650001902741650002202760650003302782650002202815650002002837650001402857653001602871653001702887653001802904653002002922700001502942700001602957700001502973700001802988700001703006700001903023700001803042700001203060700001803072773009103090856009003181852000903271655001203280IND60762236620221119115217.0220523e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076223662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1335222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wanjun10aAntagonistic effects and mechanisms of carbendazim and chlorpyrifos on the neurobehavior of larval zebrafish  aResidues from multiple pesticides are frequently detected on vegetables, which may produce combined toxicity not predicted by individual toxicity data. As these combined effects present additional dangers to food safety, we have compared individual to combined effects for a variety of pesticides. Carbendazim and chlorpyrifos are the two most commonly detected pesticides in vegetables, and previous studies reported that combined exposure results in synergistic developmental toxicity to zebrafish embryos. In this study, individual and combined effects on zebrafish motor activity were examined following individual and combined exposure to assess nervous system toxicity. Further, transcriptomics methods were used to identify potential molecular mechanisms for individual and combined toxicity. Carbendazim alone induced a disorganized swim pattern characterized by increased angular velocity, turn angle, meander, and acceleration during light-dark transition, while chlorpyrifos alone reduced average swim speed and light-dark acceleration. Combined treatment significantly reduced average swim velocity and total distance traveled. Combination indices indicated strong antagonism between compounds for average speed and light-dark acceleration. Transcriptomics (RNA-seq) showed that carbendazim significantly altered the expression of genes involved in antigen processing and presentation, apoptosis, autophagy, and metabolism, including ctslb, cyp7a1, hsp70l, and ugt1a1. Alternatively, chlorpyrifos significantly altered genes involved in various nervous system-related pathways, including glutamatergic, GABAergic, dopaminergic, and calcium signaling. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis suggested that chlorpyrifos significantly downregulated genes related to light transduction, resulting in decreased sensitivity to light-dark transitions, while antagonism mainly reflected divergent effects on phototransduction and retinol metabolism. Carbendazim had no significant effects on vision-related genes such as gnat1 and gngt1, while chlorpyrifos downregulated expression, an effect reversed by the combination. Comprehensive toxicity analyses must include joint effects of co-applied pesticides for enhanced food safety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aantagonism 3aantigens 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3acalcium 3acarbendazim 3achlorpyrifos 3adevelopmental toxicity 3afood safety 3ametabolism 3anervous system 3aphototransduction 3aprotein-protein interactions 3asequence analysis 3atranscriptomics 3avitamin A 0aCarbendazim 0aChlorpyrifos 0aNeurobehavior 0aTranscriptomics1 aFan, Ruiqi1 aLuo, Sunlin1 aYing liu, 1 aJin, Yongpeng1 aLi, Yongchen1 aXiong, Mengqin1 aYuan, Xiaoyan1 aJia, Li1 aChen, Yiqiang0 tChemosphere.g2022 Apr., v. 293 p.133522-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1335223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01904naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010600165300001400271520074000285592002801025650001401053650000901067650001201076650001601088650002801104650002301132651002101155653001401176653002501190653002601215653001001241653001601251653001301267700001801280700002301298773009401321856008201415852000901497655001201506IND60698952920221119165353.0210116e20161123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069895292DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.635.106042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Tae Won10aTwo new species of pontogeneiid amphipods (Crustacea, Senticaudata, Calliopioidea) from Korean waters  ap. 53-79.  aTwo new pontogeneiid amphipods, Eusiroides pilopalpus sp. n. and Paramoera dentipleurae sp. n., from Korean waters are described and illustrated.

We searched the databases of the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang, Vip, PubMed, and Elsevier Science Direct from database establishment to July 14, 2021 and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies reporting associations between trihalomethanes level and abnormally low birth weight and preterm birth. The pooled odds ratio (OR), pooled risk ratio, and pooled risk difference with their 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for risk estimates. A total of 24 studies involving 1,118,037 pregnant women were finally enrolled in the present systematic review and meta-analysis. Our research found that abnormally low birth weight was associated with higher levels of total trihalomethanes (OR = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.28, 4.68; P = 0.007). Unexpectedly, the meta-analysis indicated that higher total trihalomethanes level was associated with lower odds of preterm birth (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.81, 0.99; P = 0.03). Our findings indicate that trihalomethanes exposure might be a risk factor for abnormally low birth weight and that it would be prudent to minimize exposure to trihalomethanes during pregnancy because of the risk of abnormally low birth weight. Given some limitations of the systematic review and meta-analysis, our results should be interpreted with caution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfidence interval 3adatabases 3alow birth weight 3ameta-analysis 3ametabolites 3aodds ratio 3apregnancy 3apremature birth 3arelative risk 3arisk factors 3asystematic review 0aTrihalomethanes 0aLow birth weight 0aPreterm birth 0aMeta-analysis1 aXiong, Shi-min1 aShen, Xu-bo1 aNi, Yun-qiao1 aChen, Wei1 aHe, Cai-die1 aZhou, Yuan-zhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3799-22720 tChemosphere.g2022 Apr., v. 293 p.133524-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1335243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03581naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245012700180300001300307520201300320592002802333650003002361650001902391650001002410650001302420650001002433650001302443650002502456650001502481650001202496650001402508650001102522650001002533650002502543650002902568650001902597650001402616650003502630650002302665650002902688650003302717650003302750651001102783700002302794700002202817700001802839700003402857773009102891856004802982852000903030655001203039IND4480990620221117235245.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448099062DNAL7 a215264222pmid7 a10.1007/s11248-011-9515-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevos, Yann10aFeral genetically modified herbicide tolerant oilseed rape from seed import spills: are concerns scientifically justified?  ap. 1-21.  aOne of the concerns surrounding the import (for food and feed uses or processing) of genetically modified herbicide tolerant (GMHT) oilseed rape is that, through seed spillage, the herbicide tolerance (HT) trait will escape into agricultural or semi-natural habitats, causing environmental or economic problems. Based on these concerns, three EU countries have invoked national safeguard clauses to ban the marketing of specific GMHT oilseed rape events on their territory. However, the scientific basis for the environmental and economic concerns posed by feral GMHT oilseed rape resulting from seed import spills is debatable. While oilseed rape has characteristics such as secondary dormancy and small seed size that enable it to persist and be redistributed in the landscape, the presence of ferals is not in itself an environmental or economic problem. Crucially, feral oilseed rape has not become invasive outside cultivated and ruderal habitats, and HT traits are not likely to result in increased invasiveness. Feral GMHT oilseed rape has the potential to introduce HT traits to volunteer weeds in agricultural fields, but would only be amplified if the herbicides to which HT volunteers are tolerant were used routinely in the field. However, this worst-case scenario is most unlikely, as seed import spills are mostly confined to port areas. Economic concerns revolve around the potential for feral GMHT oilseed rape to contribute to GM admixtures in non-GM crops. Since feral plants derived from cultivation (as distinct from import) occur at too low a frequency to affect the coexistence threshold of 0.9% in the EU, it can be concluded that feral GMHT plants resulting from seed import spills will have little relevance as a potential source of pollen or seed for GM admixture. This paper concludes that feral oilseed rape in Europe should not be routinely managed, and certainly not in semi-natural habitats, as the benefits of such action would not outweigh the negative effects of management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus var. napus 3aEuropean Union 3acrops 3adormancy 3afoods 3ahabitats 3aherbicide resistance 3aherbicides 3aimports 3amarketing 3apollen 3aweeds 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aBrassica napusxgenetics 2aEuropean Union 2aGene Flow 2aHerbicide Resistancexgenetics 2aIntroduced Species 2aPlant Dormancyxgenetics 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aSeedsxgeneticsxphysiology. 3aEurope1 aHails, Rosemary S.1 aMesséan, Antoine1 aPerry, Joe N.1 aSquire, G.

Development of an Aroxyl Radical Absorption Capacity (ARAC) Assay Method  ap. 11901-11909.  aRecently, a new assay method that can quantify the aroxyl radical (ArOâ¢) absorption capacity (ARAC) of antioxidants (AOHs) was proposed. In the present work, the second-order rate constants (k(s)Extract) and ARAC values for the reaction of ArOâ¢ with seven kinds of rice bran extracts 1â7, which contain different concentrations of Î±-, Î²-, Î³-, and Î´-tocopherols and -tocotrienols (Î±-, Î²-, Î³-, and Î´-Tocs and -Toc-3s) and Î³-oryzanol, were measured in ethanol at 25 Â°C using stopped-flow spectrophotometry. The k(s)Extract value (1.26 Ã 10(â2) Mâ1 sâ1) of Nipponbare (extract 1) with the highest activity was 1.5 times larger than that (8.29 Ã 10(â3)) of Milyang-23 (extract 7) with the lowest activity. The concentrations (in mg/100 g) of Î±-, Î²-, Î³-, and Î´-Tocs and -Toc-3s and Î³-oryzanol found in the seven extracts 1â7 were determined using HPLC-MS/MS and UVâvis absorption spectroscopy, respectively. From the results, it has been clarified that the ArOâ¢-scavenging rates (k(s)Extract) (that is, the relative ARAC value) obtained for the seven extracts 1â7 may be approximately explained as the sum of the product {Î£ k(s)AOH-i [AOH-i]/10(5)} of the rate constant (k(s)AOH-i) and the concentration ([AOH-i]/10(5)) of AOH-i (Tocs, Toc-3s, and Î³-oryzanol) included in rice bran extracts. The contribution of Î³-oryzanol to the ksExtract value was estimated to be between 3.0â4.7% for each extract. Taken together, these results suggest that the ARAC assay method is applicable to general food extracts. 3aabsorption 3aantioxidants 3aethanol 3aoryzanol 3arice bran 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aOuchi, Aya1 aAbe, Takumi1 aMurata, Kazumasa1 aNakagawa, K.q(Kiyotaka),1 aMiyazawa, Teruo0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2014 Dec. 10, v. 62, no. 49 p.11901-11909dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf503996z  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245006400185300001800249520176200267592002802029650001702057650002702074650001302101650002102114650001502135650002002150650002002170650002602190650001202216650001002228650001902238650001202257650002102269650001402290650001702304650001302321650002202334650002002356653002402376653001902400653002302419700003202442700002602474773013602500856008102636852000902717655001202726IND60654701820221122224944.0190726e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065470182DNAL7 a231075252pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145120023582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJonker, Renate10aRole of specific dietary amino acids in clinical conditions  ap. S139-S148.  aIn a variety of chronic and acute disease states, alterations in protein synthesis, breakdown and protein turnover rates occur that are related to the loss of body protein and skeletal muscle wasting. A key observation is the stimulation of protein breakdown in muscle and the stimulation of protein synthesis in the splanchnic area; mainly liver. An altered splanchnic extraction of amino acids as well as an anabolic resistance to dietary protein, related to stress, disuse and aging play a key role in the pathogenesis of muscle wasting in these conditions. To overcome these factors, specific dietary protein and amino acid diets have been introduced. The main focus of these diets is the quantity and quality of dietary proteins and whether a balanced mixture or solely dietary essential amino acids are required with or without higher intake levels of specific amino acids. Specifically in cancer patients, stimulated muscle protein synthesis has been obtained by increasing the amount of protein in a meal and by providing additional leucine. Also in other chronic diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis, meals with specific dietary proteins and specific combinations of dietary essential amino acids are able to stimulate anabolism. In acute diseases, a special role for the amino acid arginine and its precursor citrulline as anabolic drivers has been observed. Thus, there is growing evidence that modifying the dietary amino acid composition of a meal will positively influence the net balance between muscle protein synthesis and breakdown, leading to muscle protein anabolism in a variety of chronic and acute disease states. Specific amino acids with anabolic potential are leucine, arginine and citrulline.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute course 3aamino acid composition 3aarginine 3achronic diseases 3acitrulline 3acystic fibrosis 3adietary protein 3aessential amino acids 3aleucine 3aliver 3amuscle protein 3amuscles 3amuscular atrophy 3aneoplasms 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3aprotein synthesis 3askeletal muscle 0adietary amino acids 0amuscle wasting 0aprotein metabolism1 aEngelen, Mariëlle P.

Preparative high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) guided by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)âelectrospray ionization (ESI)âhigh-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was employed for the isolation and purification of the active components, and three new compounds with half inhibition concentration (IC50) of 0.11, 0.17, and 0.14 mM against diphenolase were obtained from the extract, respectively. Their chemical structures were identified by HRMS, one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D NMR) spectroscopy as paecilomycones A, B, and C. Structure and activity studies showed that the tyrosinase inhibition activities are positively related to the number of hydroxyl groups on the paecilomycones. 3aPaecilomyces 3acatechol oxidase 3achemical structure 3acountercurrent chromatography 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3amethanol 3amycelium 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ascreening1 aLiu, Xiaoxio1 aGao, Sha1 aZhang, Wancun1 aPeng, Fan1 aHu, Fenglin1 aHuang, Bo1 aChen, Longyun1 aBao, Guanhu1 aLi, Chunru1 aLi, Zengzhi0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2014 Dec. 10, v. 62, no. 49 p.11917-11923dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf504128c  aDNAL 7aarticle03166naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245011800172300001800290520181700308592002802125650002002153650002102173650001302194650001802207650001502225650001102240650001802251650000902269650001902278653002402297653001702321653001702338653002102355700006102376700002202437700005902459773014702518856008202665852000902747655001202756IND60787785520221121002615.0220810e20220426xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078778552DNAL7 a10.1017/S13689800220009692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaiciurgis, Verena T10aNutrition programmes for individuals living with disadvantage in supported residential settings: a scoping review  ap. 2625-2636.  aHealth inequities such as chronic disease are significantly higher among individuals living with disadvantage compared with the general population and many are reported to be attributable to preventable dietary risk factors. This study provides an overview of the current nutrition interventions for individuals living with extreme disadvantage, in supported residential settings, to develop insights into the development and implementation of policies and practices to promote long-term nutritional health and well-being. A scoping review searched Scopus, ProQuest, CINAHL Plus, MEDLINE, and Web of Science databases using the terms ‘resident’, ‘nutrition’, ‘disadvantage’, ‘intervention’ and their synonyms, with particular emphasis on interventions in residential settings. Residential services providing nutrition provision and support. People experiencing extreme disadvantage. From 5262 articles, seven were included in final synthesis. Most interventions focused on building food literacy knowledge and skills. Study designs and outcome measures varied; however, all reported descriptive improvements in behaviour and motivation. In addition to food literacy, it was suggested that interventions need to address behaviour and motivations, programme sustainability, long-term social, physical and economic barriers and provide support for participants during transition into independent living. Socio-economic issues remain key barriers to long-term health and well-being. In addition to food literacy education, future research and interventions should consider utilising an academic-community partnership, addressing nutrition-related mental health challenges, motivation and behaviour change and a phased approach to improve support for individuals transitioning into independent living.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior change 3achronic diseases 3aliteracy 3amental health 3amotivation 3apeople 3apublic health 3arisk 3asocioeconomics 0aNutrition education 0aDisadvantage 0aIntervention 0aHomeless shelter1 aCharlton, Karen E1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8044-444X1 aClancy, Annabel K1 aBeck, Eleanor J1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3448-65340 tPublic health nutrition.g20222022 Sept. 26,  Apr. 26, v. 25, no. 9 p.2625-2636dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800220009693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02414naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001600137245020900153300002000362520113200382650001401514650002801528650001701556650002401573650001001597650001601607650000901623650002101632650001901653650003401672650002001706650002101726650001401747700001201761700001601773700001401789773016401803856004001967852000902007655001202016IND4535102620221118235152.0160304e20141210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453510262DNAL7 a10.1021/jf504527r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Wan-Guo10aDual Role of 2â²,4â²-Dihydroxy-6â²-methoxy-3â²,5â²-dimethylchalcone in Inhibiting High-Mobility Group Box 1 Secretion and Blocking Its Pro-inflammatory Activity in Hepatic Inflammation  ap. 11949-11956.  aA previous study reported that 2â²,4â²-dihydroxy-6â²-methoxy-3â²,5â²-dimethylchalcone (DMC) had a potential hepatoprotective effect through preventing acute liver injury in mice. This study further evaluated the preventive effects of DMC on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated hepatic inflammation and the underlying mechanism in liver macrophage. DMC significantly suppressed LPS-stimulated secretion and nucleocytoplasmic translocation of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). DMC could dose-dependently reduce the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase C alpha (PKCÎ±), and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1). Furthermore, HMGB1 phosphorylation, the interaction between PKC and HMGB1, and the expression of HMGB1-dependent inflammation-related molecules were dose-dependently inhibited by DMC. Finally, DMC could target binding to the B box of HMGB1 by molecular modeling studies. All of these results indicated that DMC exhibited a potential protective effect against hepatitis probably via inhibiting HMGB1 secretion and blocking HMGB1 pro-inflammatory activity. 3ahepatitis 3ahepatoprotective effect 3ainflammation 3alipopolysaccharides 3aliver 3amacrophages 3amice 3amolecular models 3anucleoproteins 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein kinase C 3asecretion1 aHe, Hao1 aLu, Yan-Hua1 aQian, Jie0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2014 Dec. 10, v. 62, no. 49 p.11949-11956dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf504527r  aDNAL 7aarticle03769naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002300137245014900160300002000309500001500329520203400344650001602378650001602394650003102410650001602441650002102457650002202478650002002500650001002520650002202530650001102552650001402563650001102577650001402588650002102602650001202623650001102635650001702646650000902663650001302672650002502685650002002710650002202730650001402752650002302766653001702789700002302806700002102829700002002850700001802870700002302888700002402911700001902935773016402954856004003118852000903158655001203167IND4535102720221118235102.0160304e20141210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453510272DNAL7 a10.1021/jf504544x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPacifico, Severina10aLC-MS/MS Profiling of a Mastic Leaf Phenol Enriched Extract and Its Effects on H2O2 and AÎ²(25â35) Oxidative Injury in SK-B-NE(C)-2 Cells  ap. 11957-11966.  a2019-12-06  aThe development of polyphenol neuroprotective nutraceuticals useful for functional foods could be a valuable strategy for counteracting oxidative stress relative diseases as Alzheimerâs Disease (AD). Oxidative stress is one of the AD earliest event and seems to play a central role in AÎ² generation, neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis. In order to counteract AD neurodegeneration, the inhibition of the vicious cycle of AÎ² generation and oxidation is an attractive therapeutic strategy, and antiamyloidogenic and antioxidant plant drugs could represent an alternative and valid approach. In this context, an alcoholic extract (Pl-M) from deterpenated Pistacia lentiscus L. leaves was investigated for its phenol composition through LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. Besides the identified metabolites, ten compounds were reported for the first time as constituents of Pistacia lentiscus leaves. Through DPPH, ABTS, and ORAC methods, the antioxidant potential of the extract was initially investigated. In order to evaluate the preparation of a safe and no toxic extract, MTT, SRB, and LDH assays toward SH-5YSY, and SK-N-BE(2)-C human neuronal cell lines, as well as on C6 mouse glial cell line, were performed. Evaluating the protective effects from oxidant injury in SK-N-BE(2)-C cells cotreated with the plant complex and H2O2, or AÎ²(25â35) fragment, it was observed that Pl-M extract exerted a significant cytoprotective response in both the oxidized cell systems. In particular, Pl-M extract was able to reduce by nearly 50% the AÎ²(25â35) induced toxicity at 25.0 Î¼g/mL dose level, whereas it counteracted almost completely the cytotoxic action at 100.0 Î¼g/mL. Data obtained allow us to hypothesize the use of Pistacia lentiscus leaves, a broadly available and renewable source, as an alternative strategy for the enrichment of food matrices with polyphenol bioactives. The present study put the basis for bioavailability and preclinical studies, able to define Pl-M extract safety and efficacy. 3apolyphenols 3afood matrix 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3ametabolites 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3abioavailability 3adrugs 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aphenol 3aoxidation 3aleaves 3aapoptosis 3afunctional foods 3aneurons 3ahumans 3acytotoxicity 3amice 3aoxidants 3aantioxidant activity 3afood enrichment 3aAlzheimer disease 3aneuroglia 3aPistacia lentiscus 0aantioxidants1 aPiccolella, Simona1 aMarciano, Sabina1 aGalasso, Silvia1 aNocera, Paola1 aPiscopo, Viincenzo1 aFiorentino, Antonio1 aMonaco, Pietro0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2014 Dec. 10, v. 62, no. 49 p.11957-11966dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf504544x  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002500166245002900191300001600220520147200236592002801708650003801736650003001774650002301804650002001827650001801847650002301865650001101888650001101899650001101910650001101921650002501932650002501957650001901982650001802001650002102019650001502040651001002055653001702065653002102082653003002103700001502133700002102148773013402169856008102303852000902384655001202393IND60654702420221122224836.0190726e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065470242DNAL7 a231075482pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145120024132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwaminathan, Sumathi10aProtein intakes in India  ap. S50-S58.  aIndian diets derive almost 60 % of their protein from cereals with relatively low digestibility and quality. There have been several surveys of diets and protein intakes in India by the National Nutrition Monitoring Board (NNMB) over the last 25 years, in urban and rural, as well as in slum dwellers and tribal populations. Data of disadvantaged populations from slums, tribals and sedentary rural Indian populations show that the protein intake (mainly from cereals) is about 1 gm/kg/day. However, the protein intake looks less promising in terms of the protein digestibility corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS), using lysine as the first limiting amino acid, where all populations, particularly rural and tribal, appear to have an inadequate quality to their protein intake. The protein: energy (PE) ratio is a measure of dietary quality, and has been used in the 2007 WHO/FAO/UNU report to define reference requirement values with which the adequacy of diets can be evaluated in terms of a protein quality corrected PE ratio. It is likely that about one third of this sedentary rural population is at risk of not meeting their requirements. These levels of risk of deficiency are in a population with relatively low BMI populations, whose diets are also inadequate in fruits and vegetables. Therefore, while the burden of enhancing the quality of protein intake in rural India exists, the quality of the diet, in general, represents a challenge that must be met.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aWorld Health Organization 3aat-risk population 3abody mass index 3adigestibility 3adigestible protein 3aenergy 3afruits 3agrains 3alysine 3anutrition monitoring 3anutritional adequacy 3aprotein intake 3aprotein value 3arural population 3avegetables 3aIndia 0adiet surveys 0adietary proteins 0aindispensable amino acids1 aVaz, Mario1 aKurpad, Anura V.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2012 Aug., v. 108, no.

S212-S221.  aFood regulation aims to protect public health through a safe and nutritious food supply produced by a compliant food industry. Food standards of developed countries generally do not regulate protein content or protein quality because the risk of dietary protein inadequacy in their national populations is very low. Protein is nevertheless regulated for reasons of product quality or protein labelling or to minimise assessed health risks associated with consumption of certain animal- and vegetable-protein foods; analogue products that extend or simulate commonly available animal-protein foods; and special purpose foods such as infant formula and foods, supplementary and medical foods, and foods for weight loss. The extent and approach to protein regulation varies greatly among jurisdictions but where it occurs, it is applied through minimum and sometimes maximum limits on protein content or quality measures or both using an inter-related approach. Protein quality measures range from amino acid profiles and digestibility corrected scores to protein rating, a rat bioassay and reference proteins not further described. Regulatory methods for protein quality determination are referenced to the published scientific literature or developed nationally. Internationally, the Codex Alimentarius regulates the protein content and quality of some foods. The Codex approach varies according to the food but is similar to the approaches used in national and regional food regulation. This paper provides a comparison of the regulation of protein in foods using examples from the food regulations of Australia New Zealand, Canada, the European Union, the United States of America and the Codex Alimentarius.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCodex Alimentarius 3aEuropean Union 3aamino acid composition 3aanimal proteins 3abioassays 3adeveloped countries 3adigestibility 3afood availability 3afood industry 3afood law 3ahealth effects assessments 3ainfant formulas 3amedical foods 3aprotein content 3aprotein value 3apublic health 3arats 3avegetable protein 3aweight loss 3aAustralia 3aCanada 3aNew Zealand 3aUnited States 0aProtein quality 0aFood standards 0aFood regulation0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2012 Aug., v. 108, no.

This study aimed to compare the psychometric properties of the general and specific factors of the 2000 and 2012 versions of the USHFSSM to measure the construct of food insecurity in two Portuguese samples of households with children. Cross-sectional. Portugal. An adaptation of the 2000 version was applied to 839 adults (from households with children aged 7–17 years) from the National Food, Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey 2015–2016, while the 2012 version was used among 2855 families from the Generation XXI birth cohort. The 2000 version showed to have a stronger ωh than the 2012 version (0·89 v. 0·78 for the general factor), as well as eigenvalues higher than 1 for the general factor (eigenvalues equal to 9·54, 0·97 and 0·80, for the general factor, specific factor 1 and specific factor 2, respectively), while the 2012 version had also the contribution of specific factors to explain food insecurity (eigenvalues equal to 9·40, 2·40 and 1·20, for general factor and specific factors 1 and 2, respectively). Good internal consistency (ωt = 0·99, for both versions) was obtained. In conclusion, the 2000 and 2012 versions of the USHFSSM showed good psychometric properties; however, the 2000 version has stronger general factor, while the 2012 version also has the contribution of specific factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood security 3anutrition 3aphysical activity 3apublic health 3asurveys 3aPortugal 0aFood insecurity 0aItem order 0aHouseholds with children 0aGeneration XXI 0aNational surveys1 aSevero, Milton1 aLopes, Carla1 aSantos, Ana Cristina0 tPublic health nutrition.g20222022 Sept. 23,  May 23, v. 25, no. 9 p.2371-2379dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800220012393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03427naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245011800187300001500305520176800320592002802088650003802116650003502154650003002189650001102219650002802230650002002258650001702278650001602295650001302311650002402324650002502348650001602373650001102389650001202400650001402412650001102426650001802437650001802455650001102473650001302484650002102497650001402518650002302532650001902555650001802574650002002592650001602612650001002628773013302638856008102771852000902852655001202861IND60654702820221122224806.0190726e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065470282DNAL7 a231075422pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145120024502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMillward, D.

S3-S21.  aThe WHO/FAO/UNU (2007) report examines dietary protein and amino acid requirements for all age groups, protein requirements during pregnancy, lactation and catch-up growth in children, the implications of these requirements for developing countries and protein quality evaluation. Requirements were defined as the minimum dietary intake which satisfies the metabolic demand and achieves nitrogen equilibrium and maintenance of the body protein mass, plus the needs for growth in children and pregnancy and lactation in healthy women. Insufficient evidence was identified to enable recommendations for specific health outcomes. A meta analysis of nitrogen balance studies identifies protein requirements for adults 10 % higher than previous values with no influence of gender or age, consistent with a subsequently published comprehensive study. A new factorial model for infants and children, validated on the basis of the adequacy of breast milk protein intakes and involving a lower maintenance requirement value, no provision for saltatory growth and new estimates of protein deposition identifies lower protein requirements than in previous reports. Higher values for adult amino acid requirements, derived from a re-evaluation of nitrogen balance studies and new stable isotope studies, identify some cereal-based diets as being inadequate for lysine. The main outstanding issues relate to the biological implausibility of the very low efficiencies of protein utilisation used in the factorial models for protein requirements for all population groups especially pregnancy when requirements may be overestimated. Also considerable uncertainty remains about the design and interpretation of most of the studies used to identify amino acid requirement values.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aRecommended Dietary Allowances 3aWorld Health Organization 3aadults 3aamino acid requirements 3abalance studies 3abody protein 3abreast milk 3achildren 3acompensatory growth 3adeveloping countries 3afood intake 3agender 3ainfants 3alactation 3alysine 3ameta-analysis 3amilk proteins 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anitrogen balance 3apregnancy 3aprotein deposition 3aprotein intake 3aprotein value 3astable isotopes 3auncertainty 3awomen0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2012 Aug., v. 108, no.

We investigated the associations between incidence of OF and dietary calcium, magnesium and soy isoflavone intake in a longitudinal study of 48 584 postmenopausal women. Multivariable Cox regression was applied to derive hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate associations between dietary intake, based on the averages of two assessments that took place with a median interval of 2⋅4 years, and fracture risk. The average age of study participants is 61⋅4 years (range 43⋅3–76⋅7 years) at study entry. During a median follow-up of 10⋅1 years, 4⋅3 % participants experienced OF. Compared with daily calcium intake ≤400 mg/d, higher calcium intake (>400 mg/d) was significantly associated with about a 40–50 % reduction of OF risk among women with a calcium/magnesium (Ca/Mg) intake ratio ≥1⋅7. Among women with prior fracture history, high soy isoflavone intake was associated with reduced OF risk; the HR was 0⋅72 (95 % CI 0⋅55, 0⋅93) for the highest (>42⋅0 mg/d) v. lowest (<18⋅7 mg/d) quartile intake. This inverse association was more evident among recently menopausal women (<10 years). No significant association between magnesium intake and OF risk was observed. Our findings provide novel information suggesting that the association of OF risk with dietary calcium intake was modified by Ca/Mg ratio, and soy isoflavone intake was modified by history of fractures and time since menopause. Our findings, if confirmed, can help to guide further dietary intervention strategies for OF prevention.  aPublisher supplied data  aUM1 CA182910cNational Institutes of Healthdhttps://doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002 3abone fractures 3acalcium 3adietary calcium 3afood intake 3aisoflavones 3alongitudinal studies 3amagnesium 3anutritional intervention 3apostmenopause 3aprospective studies 3aregression analysis 3arisk 0aOsteoporotic fractures 0aPostmenopausal women 0aSoy isoflavones1 aCai, Hui1 aGao, Yutang1 aDai, Qi1 aYang, Gong1 aZheng, Wei1 aShu, Xiao-Ou1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0711-83140 tJournal of nutritional science.g2022 Aug. 01, v. 11 p.e62-dCambridge University PresswJournal:6175x2048-67907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jns.2022.523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100003000137245015400167300002000321520110400341650004101445650001801486650001601504650002501520650001701545650001901562650001201581650001501593650001301608650001601621650001501637650001301652650001401665650001501679650002701694650002801721650001701749700003401766700002601800700002701826700003101853773016401884856004002048852000902088655001202097IND4535103620221118235652.0160304e20141210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453510362DNAL7 a10.1021/jf503628c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFigueroa-Perez, Marley G.10aMetabolite Profile, Antioxidant Capacity, and Inhibition of Digestive Enzymes in Infusions of Peppermint (Mentha piperita) Grown under Drought Stress  ap. 12027-12033.  aPeppermint (Mentha piperita) infusions represent an important source of antioxidants, which can be enhanced by inducing abiotic stress in plants. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of drought stress on peppermint cultivation as well as the metabolite profile, antioxidant capacity, and inhibition of digestive enzymes of resulting infusions. At 45 days after planting, irrigation was suppressed until 85 (control), 65, 35, 24, and 12% soil moisture (SM) was reached. The results showed that 35, 24, and 12% SM decreased fresh (20%) and dry (5%) weight. The 35 and 24% SM treatments significantly increased total phenolic and flavonoid contents as well as antioxidant capacity. Coumaric acid, quercetin, luteolin, and naringenin were detected only in some drought treatments; however, in these infusions, fewer amino acids and unsaturated fatty acids were identified. The 24 and 12% SM treatments slightly improved inhibition of pancreatic lipase and Î±-amylase activity. Therefore, induction of moderate water stress in peppermint is recommended to enhance its biological properties. 3aMentha piperita nothosubsp. piperita 3aalpha-amylase 3aamino acids 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acoumaric acids 3adrought 3airrigation 3aluteolin 3ametabolites 3anaringenin 3aplanting 3aquercetin 3asoil water 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3awater stress1 aRocha-Guzman, Nuria Elizabeth1 aPerez-Ramirez, Iza F.1 aMercado-Silva, Edmundo1 aReynoso-Camacho, Rosalía,0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2014 Dec. 10, v. 62, no. 49 p.12027-12033dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf503628c  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100005800141245009200199520121800291592002801509596000701537650001601544650001401560650001201574650002301586650001401609650001201623650001801635650002501653650002501678650001101703653001201714653001201726653001401738653002501752700001701777700001801794700002001812700002501832700002101857773012301878856007602001852000902077655001202086IND60788301720221118065546.0220812e20220725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078830172DNAL7 a10.1017/jns.2022.572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScully, Helena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1641-176610aLow socioeconomic status predicts vitamin D status in a cross-section of Irish children  aVitamin D is essential for bone and muscle health with adequate status in childhood crucial for normal skeletal development. We aimed to investigate vitamin D status in a convenience sample (n = 1226) of Irish children (aged 1–17 years) who had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) tested by request of their GP at a Dublin Hospital between 2014 and 2020. We examined predictors including age, sex, season and socioeconomic status (SES). Vitamin D deficiency (<30 nmol/l) was prevalent affecting 23 % and was more common in disadvantaged areas (34 %) and in those aged >12 v. ≤12 years (24 % v. 16 %, P = 0⋅033). The greatest predictor was SES (disadvantaged v. affluent, OR 2⋅18, CI 1⋅34, 3⋅53, P = 0⋅002), followed by female sex (OR 1⋅57, CI 1⋅15, 2⋅14, P = 0⋅005) and winter season (October to February, OR 1⋅40, CI 1⋅07, 1⋅84, P = 0⋅015). A quarter of our sample of children were deficient, rising to one-third in those in disadvantaged areas. Females and those aged over 12 years had a higher prevalence of deficiency. Public health strategies to improve vitamin D status in Irish children, including systematic food fortification may need to be considered to address this issue.  aPublisher supplied data  aNA 3ablood serum 3achildhood 3afemales 3afood fortification 3ahospitals 3amuscles 3apublic health 3askeletal development 3asocioeconomic status 3awinter 0a25(OH)D 0aIreland 0aVitamin D 0aVitamin D deficiency1 aLaird, Eamon1 aHealy, Martin1 aCrowley, Vivion1 aWalsh, James Bernard1 aMcCarroll, Kevin0 tJournal of nutritional science.g2022 July 25, v. 11 p.e61-dCambridge University PresswJournal:6175x2048-67907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jns.2022.573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100005900141245013000200520148100330592002801811650001301839650002801852650003201880650001201912650001801924650002001942650001101962650001701973650001801990650002402008650001702032650001602049650000902065651001302074653001902087653002002106653001902126653001302145653002002158700001702178700002002195700005802215773012302273856007602396852000902472655001202481IND60788302020221118070114.0220812e20220803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078830202DNAL7 a10.1017/jns.2022.612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTafese, Zelalem1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8633-176110aChild undernutrition and associated factors among children 6–23 months old in largely food insecure areas of rural Ethiopia  aChild malnutrition is the leading public health problem in Sub-Saharan Africa, resulting in poor health and economic losses. Ethiopia has one of the highest child undernutrition rates in the world that occurs to multifaceted factors, including food insecurity. Thus, we performed a cross-sectional study to assess the prevalence and risk factors for child undernutrition in largely food insecure areas of Ethiopia. Data were collected from 354 mother–child pairs from the Siraro district. Both bivariate and multivariate logistic regression was used for statistical analysis. Variables with a P-value of <0⋅05 in multivariate analysis were used to detect statistical significance at a 95 % confidence level. About 67 % of households are food insecure. The prevalence of stunting wasting and underweight were 42⋅7, 9⋅9 and 27⋅7 %, respectively. Female gender, higher age of the child (12–23 months v. 6–11 months), living in a household with five or more siblings, not getting therapeutic zinc supplement at least once, inadequate diet diversity, lack of growth monitoring service, and maternal own income increases the likelihood of child undernutrition. It can be concluded that child undernutrition is a severe public health problem in the study area. Improving primary healthcare services related to zinc supplementation, growth monitoring and promotion, and improving infant and child feeding practices can be considered as a strategy to address the problem.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3across-sectional studies 3adietary mineral supplements 3afemales 3afood security 3ahealth services 3aincome 3amalnutrition 3apublic health 3aregression analysis 3atherapeutics 3aunderweight 3azinc 3aEthiopia 0aDiet diversity 0aFood insecurity 0aMothers income 0aStunting 0aZinc supplement1 aReta, Fekadu1 aMulugeta, Biruk1 aAnato, Anchamo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4836-43350 tJournal of nutritional science.g2022 Aug. 03, v. 11 p.e63-dCambridge University PresswJournal:6175x2048-67907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jns.2022.613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01889naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245008900161300002000250520073200270592002801002650002401030650001401054650001301068650001501081650002201096650000701118650002201125700002201147700002101169700006201190700006201252773013701314856007901451852000901530655001201539IND60752312820221120110717.0211001e20210922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075231282DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.1c019552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Li-Juan10aRoom Temperature Hydrolysis of Benzamidines and Benzamidiniums in Weakly Basic Water  ap. 13762-13767.  aBenzamidinium compounds have found widespread use in both medicinal and supramolecular chemistry. In this work, we show that benzamidiniums hydrolyze at room temperature in aqueous base to give the corresponding primary amide. This reaction has a half-life of 300 days for unsubstituted benzamidinium at pH 9, but is relatively rapid at higher pH’s (e.g., t₁/₂ = 6 days at pH 11 and 15 h at pH 13). Quantum chemistry combined with first-principles kinetic modeling can reproduce these trends and explain them in terms of the dominant pathway being initiated by attack of HO– on benzamidine. Incorporation of the amidinium motif into a hydrogen bonded framework offers a substantial protective effect against hydrolysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3ahalf life 3ahydrogen 3ahydrolysis 3aorganic chemistry 3apH 3aprotective effect1 aCullen, Duncan A.1 aMorshedi, Mahbod1 aCoote, Michelle L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0828-70531 aWhite, Nicholas G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2975-08870 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2021 Sept. 22, v. 86, no. 19 p.13762-13767dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.1c019553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002500141245011800166520128800284592002801572650003001600650001101630650002001641650001801661650001401679650001801693650002401711650001601735651001601751653001801767653002201785653001201807653002001819700002401839700002201863700002001885700002101905700002001926700001901946700001801965773012301983856007602106852000902182655001202191IND60788302120221118065944.0220812e20220810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078830212DNAL7 a10.1017/jns.2022.662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatthes, Katarina L.12aA quantitative synthesis study on body mass index and associated factors among adult men and women in Switzerland  aExcess weight is caused by multiple factors and has increased sharply in Switzerland since the 1990s. Its consequences represent a major challenge for Switzerland, both in terms of health and the economy. Until now, there has been no cross-dataset overview study on excess weight in adults in Switzerland. Therefore, our aim was to conduct the first synthesis on excess weight in Switzerland. We included all existing nationwide Swiss studies (eight total), which included information on body mass index (BMI). Mixed multinomial logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the associations between different socio-demographic, lifestyle cofactors and the World Health Organization (WHO) categories for BMI. Along with lifestyle factors, socio-demographic factors were among the strongest determinants of BMI. In addition, self-rated health status was significantly lower for underweight, pre-obese and obese men and women than for normal weight persons. The present study is the first to synthesise all nationwide evidence on the importance of several socio-demographic and lifestyle factors as risk factors for excess weight. In particular, the highlighted importance of lifestyle factors for excess weight opens up the opportunity for further public health interventions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aadults 3abody mass index 3ahealth status 3alifestyle 3apublic health 3aregression analysis 3aunderweight 3aSwitzerland 0aExcess weight 0aLifestyle factors 0aObesity 0aSynthesis study1 aHartmann, Christina1 aSiegrist, Michael1 aBurnier, Michel1 aBochud, Murielle1 aZwahlen, Marcel1 aBender, Nicole1 aStaub, Kaspar0 tJournal of nutritional science.g2022 Aug. 10, v. 11 p.e65-dCambridge University PresswJournal:6175x2048-67907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jns.2022.663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002500166245005200191300001800243520177100261592002802032650002002060650002702080650001202107650001702119650001702136650001302153650001802166650000902184650002202193650001002215650001102225650001502236650001402251650001502265650002002280650002202300653001702322653001602339653001502355653001202370700003102382773013602413856008102549852000902630655001202639IND60654703520221122205015.0190726e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065470352DNAL7 a231075412pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145120025282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRutherfurd, Shane M.10aAvailable versus digestible dietary amino acids  ap. S298-S305.  aAvailable amino acids are those absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract in a form suitable for body protein synthesis. True ileal digestible amino acids are determined based on the difference between dietary amino acid intake and unabsorbed dietary amino acids at the terminal ileum. The accuracy of ileal digestible amino acid estimates for predicting available amino acid content depends on several factors, including the accuracy of the amino acid analysis procedure. In heat processed foods, lysine can react with compounds to form nutritionally unavailable derivatives that are unstable during the hydrochloric acid hydrolysis step of amino acid analysis and can revert back to lysine causing an overestimate of available lysine. Recently, the true ileal digestible reactive (available) lysine assay based on guanidination has provided a means of accurately determining available lysine in processed foods. Methionine can be oxidised during processing to form methionine sulphoxide and methionine sulphone and cysteine oxidised to cysteic acid. Methionine sulphoxide, but not methionine sulphone or cysteic acid, is partially nutritionally available in some species of animal. Currently, methionine and cysteine are determined as methionine sulphone and cysteic acid respectively after quantitative oxidation prior to acid hydrolysis. Consequently, methionine and cysteine are overestimated if methionine sulphone or cysteic acid are present in the original material. Overall, given the problems associated with the analysis of some amino acids in processed foodstuffs, the available amino acid content may not always be accurately predicted by true ileal amino acid digestibility estimates. For such amino acids specific analytical strategies may be required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid hydrolysis 3aamino acid composition 3aanimals 3abody protein 3acysteic acid 3acysteine 3adigestibility 3aheat 3ahydrochloric acid 3aileum 3alysine 3amethionine 3aoxidation 3aprediction 3aprocessed foods 3aprotein synthesis 0aavailability 0aamino acids 0aprocessing 0aprotein1 aMoughan, P.

The reproductive traits considered were fertility (FERT: 0/1) of ewes joined, total litter size (LSIZE: lambs born), the number of lambs surviving at weaning (LSIZEW: lambs weaned) and the percentage of lambs surviving (LSURV=LSIZEW/LSIZE) for ewes that lambed, along with the composite traits number of lambs born (NLB) and number weaned (NLW) for ewes joined. Corresponding trait values were derived from pregnancy scan data (FERT_S, LSIZE_S and NLB_S) for comparison, and were classified as inconsistent if the trait values did not match from scanning and lambing records. Data were obtained from four flocks, representing different time frames, locations, management and breeds or bloodlines. Each flock recorded scan data separately from lambing outcomes. Genetic parameters were estimated separately within each flock. Average levels of inconsistency between scan- and lambing-data values varied between 4.6% and 14.8% across flocks, tending to be highest (9.1–18.5%) for litter size of ewes scanned with multiple fetuses, and lowest (0.29–7.3%) for assignment of fertility. Inconsistencies did not have a significant impact on estimates of trait heritabilities, suggesting recording errors were independent of genetic merit. In three flocks, the genetic correlations (ra) between comparable traits derived from the different data sources were not different from unity (ra ≥ 0.99) even when phenotypic correlations (rp) were lower (rp ≥ 0.84). In the flock with the highest inconsistency rate between data sources, the range in ra varied between 0.60 (fertility) and 1.0 (litter size). Therefore, pregnancy scan data can be directly substituted for reproductive traits traditionally based on lambing data, but attention should be paid to ensuring accuracy of the data sources used. Scan data also provide no information on lamb-survival outcomes after birth, so does not constitute complete data on reproductive outcomes. Genetic evaluation systems might also benefit from fine tuning for scale-induced effects (due to litter size) on parameters to improve the accuracy of across flock prediction of breeding values for reproductive traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding value 3abreeds 3aewes 3afetus 3aflocks 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic merit 3aheritability 3alambing 3alambs 3alitter size 3aphenotypic correlation 3aprediction 3apregnancy 3areproductive traits 3aweaning 0acorrelation 0afertility 0aheritability 0alamb survival 0alitter size1 aSwan, Andrew A.1 aPurvis, Ian W.1 aBrown, Daniel0 tAnimal production science.g2016, v. 56, no. 4 p.679-689dCSIRO Publishingx1836-09397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN146303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006400155245008000219520150900299592002801808650002201836650001701858650002501875650003001900650003601930650002501966650001801991650001802009650002602027650001502053650001602068653001602084653001202100653001802112653002002130653002002150653001502170700005302185700006602238700001902304700003402323773009102357856009002448852000902538655001202547IND60762239520221119114707.0220523e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076223952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1335532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShrivastava, Vaibhav1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2478-057710aWastewater in the food industry: Treatment technologies and reuse potential  aWater is the most extensively used raw material in the food and beverage industry. This industrial sector has a negative impact on the environment and economy as a result of rising water demand and wastewater production. With the increasing scarcity of drinking water, the reuse of wastewater streams has become an important economic and ecological concern. Therefore, the optimisation of water consumption and wastewater reuse in the food industry is essential. On the other hand, several countries limit the reuse of wastewater because of legal curtailment, public health and safety concerns. This represents a major challenge for both industries and administrations due to the technical complexity and financial costs involved. The present review aims at addressing the key issues related to water consumption, wastewater generation, treatment and successful implementation cases of water reuse in the food and beverage industry. Moreover, the various case studies of already employed technologies for the food industry wastewater treatment and reuse have been analysed for their performance. Also, this review reveals future research on the application of other innovative technologies such as ultraviolet irradiation and micro electrolysis. However, the successful implementation of reuse strategies is associated with the holistic evaluation of local factors such as governmental incentives, social acceptance and legislation harmonisation related to the cost, risks, and environmental performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverage industry 3aelectrolysis 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3aindustrial wastewater treatment 3alaws and regulations 3apublic health 3araw materials 3aultraviolet radiation 3awastewater 3awater reuse 0aCoagulation 0aEconomy 0aFood industry 0aHeat extraction 0aReverse osmosis 0aWastewater1 aAli, Izba1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8089-95271 aMarjub, Makid Maskawat1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9523-10871 aRene, Eldon R.1 aSoto, Ailén María Florencia0 tChemosphere.g2022 Apr., v. 293 p.133553-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1335533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245007900205300001800284520117200302592002801474596002301502650002101525650002301546650002001569650001701589650000901606650001101615650001501626650001401641650001501655650001701670650001901687651000901706653001701715653003601732653001901768653002801787653002601815700003101841700002601872700002501898773013801923856008202061852000902143655001202152IND60788636620221118173451.0220815e20220328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078863662DNAL7 a10.1017/S00311820220003852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToledo, Rafael1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2651-979410aNeglected food-borne trematodiases: echinostomiasis and gastrodiscoidiasis  ap. 1319-1326.  aIn the present paper, we review two of the most neglected intestinal food-borne trematodiases: echinostomiasis, caused by members of the family Echinostomatidae, and gastrodiscoidiasis produced by the amphistome Gastrodiscoides hominis. Both parasitic infections are important intestinal food-borne diseases. Humans become infected after ingestion of raw or insufficiently cooked molluscs, fish, crustaceans, amphibians or aquatic vegetables. Thus, eating habits are essential to determine the distribution of these parasitic diseases and, traditionally, they have been considered as minor diseases confined to low-income areas, mainly in Asia. However, this scenario is changing and the population at risk are currently expanding in relation to factors such as new eating habits in developed countries, growing international markets, improved transportation systems and demographic changes. These aspects determine the necessity of a better understanding of these parasitic diseases. Herein, we review the main features of human echinostomiasis and gastrodiscoidiasis in relation to their biology, epidemiology, immunology, clinical aspects, diagnosis and treatment.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. RD12/0018/0013 3aEchinostomatidae 3aat-risk population 3aechinostomiasis 3aepidemiology 3afish 3ahumans 3aimmunology 3aingestion 3aintestines 3aparasitology 3atransportation 3aAsia 0aechinostomes 0afood-borne trematode infections 0aGastrodiscidae 0aGastrodiscoides hominis 0aintestinal trematodes1 aÁlvarez-Izquierdo, María1 aEsteban, J.

Despite the presence of toxins in their blood, all horses from the same pasture are not prone to display clinical signs of AM. The objective of this study was to compare the blood metabolomic profiles of horses with AM clinical signs with those of healthy co-grazing (Co-G) horses. To do so, plasma samples from 5 AM horses and 11 Co-G horses were investigated using untargeted metabolomics. Metabolomic data were evaluated using unsupervised, supervised, and pathway analyses. Unsupervised principal component analysis performed with all detected features separated AM and healthy Co-G horses. Supervised analyses had identified 1276 features showing differential expression between both groups. Among them, 46 metabolites, belonging predominantly to the fatty acid, fatty ester, and amino acid chemical classes, were identified by standard comparison. Fatty acids, unsaturated fatty acids, organic dicarboxylic acids, and fatty esters were detected with higher intensities in AM horses in link with the toxins’ pathological mechanism. The main relevant pathways were lipid metabolism; valine, leucine, and isoleucine metabolism; and glycine metabolism. This study revealed characteristic metabolite changes in the plasma of clinically affected horses, which might ultimately help scientists and field veterinarians to detect and manage AM. The raw data of metabolomics are available in the MetaboLights database with the access number MTBLS2579.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3agene expression regulation 3aisoleucine 3aleucine 3alipid metabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3apastures 3aprincipal component analysis 3aproteome 3aresearch 3arhabdomyolysis 3avaline 0ahorse 0aatypical myopathy 0ahypoglycin A 0aMCPA1 aToquet, Marie-Pierre1 aRenaud, Benoit1 aFrançois, Anne-Christine1 aFortier-Guillaume, Justine1 aMarcillaud-Pitel, Christel1 aBoemer, François1 aDe Tullio, Pascal1 aRichard, Eric A.1 aVotion, Dominique-Marie0 tJournal of proteome research.g2021 Aug. 26, v. 20, no. 10 p.4681-4692dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c002253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006500147245010900212300001800321520131000339592002801649596010101677650002401778650002001802650001201822650001801834650001301852650001001865650001701875650001401892650002001906650001701926650001701943650001801960650001401978650002001992653002302012653002502035653002602060700006902086773013702155856008202292852000902374655001202383IND60788636720221118173503.0220815e20220516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078863672DNAL7 a10.1017/S00311820220003972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPakharukova, Maria Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1054-206810aSimilarities and differences among the Opisthorchiidae liver flukes: insights from Opisthorchis felineus  ap. 1306-1318.  aThe foodborne liver trematode Opisthorchis felineus (Rivolta, 1884) is a member of the triad of phylogenetically related epidemiologically important Opisthorchiidae trematodes, which also includes O. viverrini (Poirier, 1886) and Clonorchis sinensis (Loos, 1907). Despite similarity in the life cycle, Opisthorchiidae liver flukes also have marked differences. Two species (O. viverrini and C. sinensis) are recognized as Group 1A biological carcinogens, whereas O. felineus belongs to Group 3A. In this review, we focus on these questions: Are there actual differences in carcinogenicity among these 3 liver fluke species? Is there an explanation for these differences? We provide a recent update of our knowledge on the liver fluke O. felineus and highlight its differences from O. viverrini and C. sinensis. In particular, we concentrate on differences in the climate of endemic areas, characteristics of the life cycle, the range of intermediate hosts, genomic and transcriptomic features of the pathogens, and clinical symptoms and morbidity of the infections in humans. The discussion of these questions can stimulate new developments in comparative studies on the pathogenicity of liver flukes and should help to identify species-specific features of opisthorchiasis and clonorchiasis pathogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data  a18-15-00098cRussian Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006769 3aClonorchis sinensis 3acarcinogenicity 3aclimate 3aclonorchiasis 3agenomics 3aliver 3aliver flukes 3amorbidity 3aopisthorchiasis 3aparasitology 3apathogenesis 3apathogenicity 3aphylogeny 3atranscriptomics 0aCholangiocarcinoma 0afoodborne trematodes 0aOpisthorchis felineus1 aMordvinov, Viatcheslav A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6173-07740 tParasitology.g20222022 Sept. 16,  May 16, v. 149, no. 10 p.1306-1318dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820220003973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245008300174300001600257520113900273592002801412650001501440650001501455650001901470650001401489653001701503653001901520653003301539653001301572653002101585653001801606700002601624700002701650773009901677856008501776852000901861655001201870IND60751814020221119224739.0211123e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075181402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2021.09.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVysyaraju, Raviraju10aComputational investigation of a novel hydrocyclone for fines bypass reduction  ap. 501-515.  aHydrocylones offer a process intensified environment for rapid, high-throughput and relatively sharp particle classification or phase separation. One of the main performance limitations of hydrocyclone is bypassing of fines to the underflow. To address this limitation, a novel design modification of fitting thin concentric rings to the cylindro-conical section has been proposed. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling based methodology has been adopted to validate the hypothesis. Predictions using Realizable k-ε, Reynolds Stress Model (RSM), and Large Eddy Simulation Wall Adopting Local Eddy viscosity (LES-WALE) turbulence models has revealed that LES-WALE matched better with the experimental observations. The experimental data included overall performance parameters and detailed observations of axial and tangential velocity profiles across the hydrocyclone. The validated CFD model and the methodology was then used to predict the behavior of the proposed designs. They established that the modifications held promise in reducing the bypass with additional benefits of sharper separation curve and finer D₅₀.  aPublisher supplied data 3aseparation 3atechnology 3aturbulent flow 3aviscosity 0aHydrocyclone 0aLES-WALE model 0aLagrangian particle tracking 0aAir-core 0aBypass reduction 0aAnnular Rings1 aPukkella, Arjun Kumar1 aSubramanian, Sivakumar0 tPowder technology.g2022 Jan., v. 395 p.501-515dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2021.09.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245014800159300001800307520119100325592002801516650004401544650003701588650002801625650002501653650001801678650001101696650002001707650001601727650001301743650001101756650001901767650000901786650001401795650003301809650001201842650001601854700001901870700001801889700002101907700001501928700001601943773013401959856008202093852000902175655001202184IND60538385520221121122629.0160815e20160316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053838552DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.5b035032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yan12aA Facile Electrodeposition Process for the Fabrication of Superhydrophobic and Superoleophilic Copper Mesh for Efficient Oil–Water Separation  ap. 2704-2712.  aA superhydrophobic and superoleophilic copper mesh with excellent oil–water separation efficiency was successfully fabricated via electrodeposition and then surface modification with lauric acid. The surface morphologies, chemical composition, and wettability were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and water contact angle (WCA) measurements. It was found that the as-prepared surface is both superhydrophobic and superoleophilic, with static WCA values as high as 155.5° ± 3° and an oil contact angle (OCA) of 0°. Furthermore, the as-prepared surface exhibited excellent oil–water separation efficiency including petroleum, toluene, hexane, gasoline and diesel, even after being recycled 10 times. In addition, the as-prepared copper mesh shows self-cleaning character with water and chemical stability. This study provides a facile, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly route to fabricate large-scale and excellent oil–water separation surface with high separation efficiency for a great number of potential applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aatomic force microscopy 3achemical composition 3acontact angle 3acopper 3adodecanoic acid 3aengineering 3agasoline 3ahexane 3ahydrophobicity 3aoils 3apetroleum 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atoluene 3awettability1 aZhang, Kaiteng1 aYao, Wenguang1 aZhang, Chengchun1 aHan, Zhiwu1 aRen, Luquan0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2016 Mar. 16, v. 55, no. 10 p.2704-2712dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.iecr.5b035033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245013900160300001800299500002000317520140600337592002801743650001201771650001501783650001301798650000801811650001201819650000901831650001901840650001301859650001001872700002001882700002201902700002101924773013001945856007302075852000902148655001202157IND60571411120221117235745.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057141112DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.80442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKinoshita, Tetsu14aThe effects of licorice flavonoid oil with respect to increasing muscle mass: a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial  ap. 2339-2345.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The present study evaluated the effects of licorice flavonoid oil (LFO) with respect to increasing the muscle mass of elderly populations using a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study. Fifty participants aged 54–90 years (seven men, 43 women), who underwent rehabilitation treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee, were examined and assigned to either the LFO group (n = 26) or the placebo group (n = 24). The LFO group consumed 300 mg LFO day⁻¹, whereas the placebo group consumed one placebo capsule every day for 16 weeks. We measured muscle mass, body fat percentage and the Japanese Knee Osteoarthritis Measure score at baseline and every 4 weeks thereafter. RESULTS: In the LFO group, muscle mass in the body trunk increased significantly after 16 weeks of LFO intake (+0.38 kg, P = 0.02). The trunk muscle mass weight of the LFO group increased significantly compared to that of the placebo group (P < 0.01). Furthermore, the body fat percentage and body trunk fat percentage of the LFO group were significantly suppressed compared to that of the placebo group (P = 0.03 and P < 0.01, respectively).

Ninety healthy 1-day-old Arbor Acres broilers were randomly divided into 3 groups with 6 replicates in each group and 5 chickens in each replicate. The three groups included control group, model group (0.15 g/L FFC), and SMPs group (0.15 g/L FFC + 5.00 g/L SMPs). After 5 days of experimental period, blood was collected, and kidney tissues were extracted. Renal injury was evaluated by serum biochemical indicators and pathological sections. Renal oxidative stress indexes were detected; transcriptomics and proteomics were used to comprehensively analyze the effects of SMPs on broiler kidney injury. The results showed that the model group inhibited average day gain (P < 0.01) and significantly adjusted blood urea nitrogen (BUN), uric acid (UA), and creatinine (Cr) (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). The histological observation of the kidneys in the model group showed abnormal morphology, and the oxidative stress parameters showed that FFC induced oxidative stress in the kidneys. Comprehensive transcriptome proteomic analysis data showed phosphoribose pyrophosphate synthase 2 (PRPS2), cytochrome 2AC1 (CYP2AC1), cytochrome 2D6 (CYP2D6), glutathione transferase (GST), and sulfotransferase 1B (SULT1B) expression levels changed. It is worth noting that our data showed that supplementation of 5.00 g/L SMPs in drinking water reversed the changes in BUN, Cr, and daily weight gain (P < 0.05) and relieved the abnormal kidney morphology caused by FFC. After SMPs processing, it improved the detoxification process of drug-metabolizing enzymes and improved the oxidative stress state induced by FFC. Therefore, SMPs reduced the nephrotoxicity caused by FFC by promoting drug-metabolizing enzymes and alleviating oxidative stress in the kidneys.  aPublisher supplied data  aChina (C2021204026)cNatural Science Foundation of Hebei Province 3aSalvia miltiorrhiza 3ablood serum 3acreatinine 3aflorfenicol 3aglutathione transferase 3ahistology 3akidneys 3anephrotoxicity 3aoxidative stress 3apollution 3apolysaccharides 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aresearch 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aurea nitrogen 3auric acid 3aweight gain1 aZhang, Lu1 aCui, Yuqing1 aJin, Guozhong1 aBao, Yongzhan1 aShi, Wanyu0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 June, v. 29, no. 30 p.45872-45884dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19114-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005800152245021000210300001600420520099800436592002801434650002201462650003401484650001401518650001601532650002401548650001501572650001901587650000901606650000701615650001601622650001201638650001601650650001001666650000901676653001001685653001201695653001201707653002901719653002801748653001301776653002201789653002401811700005901835700002301894700001601917700001901933700006201952700005502014700001902069700002002088773010002108856008702208852000902295655001202304IND60635635520221116162418.0190705e20181030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063563552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.04.1252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemmens, Elien1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5220-822314aThe impact of steeping, germination and hydrothermal processing of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grains on phytate hydrolysis and the distribution, speciation and bio-accessibility of iron and zinc elements  ap. 367-376.  aChelation of iron and zinc in wheat as phytates lowers their bio-accessibility. Steeping and germination (15 °C, 120 h) lowered phytate content from 0.96% to only 0.81% of initial dry matter. A multifactorial experiment in which (steeped/germinated) wheat was subjected to different time (2–24 h), temperature (20–80 °C) and pH (2.0–8.0) conditions showed that hydrothermal processing of germinated (15 °C, 120 h) wheat at 50 °C and pH 3.8 for 24 h reduced phytate content by 95%. X-ray absorption near-edge structure imaging showed that it indeed abolished chelation of iron to phytate. It also proved that iron was oxidized during steeping, germination and hydrothermal processing. It was further shown that zinc and iron bio-accessibility were respectively 3 and 5% in wheat and 27 and 37% in hydrothermally processed wheat. Thus, hydrothermal processing of (germinated) wheat paves the way for increasing elemental bio-accessibility in whole grain-based products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3achelation 3agermination 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrolysis 3aimage analysis 3airon 3apH 3aphytic acid 3asoaking 3atemperature 3awheat 3azinc 0aWheat 0aPhytase 0aPhytate 0aSteeping and germination 0aHydrothermal processing 0aMinerals 0aBio-accessibility 0aChemical speciation1 aDe Brier, Niels1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0605-23761 aSpiers, Kathryn M.1 aRyan, Chris1 aGarrevoet, Jan1 aFalkenberg, Gerald1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2229-10271 aGoos, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3854-65061 aSmolders, Erik1 aDelcour, Jan A.0 tFood chemistry.g2018 Oct. 30, v. 264 p.367-376dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.04.1253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02897naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245012000170300001600290500001900306520155800325592002801883650002801911650002801939650001901967650001701986650001602003650002402019650001402043650001902057650001302076650001902089650001902108650001802127700002302145700001902168700002002187700002202207700002502229773012602254856007402380852000902454655001202463IND60722958020221116181607.0210108e20210105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072295802DNAL7 a10.1039/d0bm01417f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhagat, Somnath Dharmaraj10aImplantable HDAC-inhibiting chemotherapeutics derived from hydrophobic amino acids for localized anticancer therapy  ap. 261-271.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEpigenetic targeting of different cancers by inhibiting particular histone deacetylase (HDAC) isozymes is a promising treatment approach against cancer. Development of locally-implantable molecular inhibitors of HDAC (henceforth called HDACi) promises high tumour site concentration and reduced systemic degradation of the HDACi. Herein, we report the design of such implantable HDACi based on amphiphilic derivatives of hydrophobic amino acids endowed with a hydroxamic acid (hxa)-based zinc-binding residue. The amino acids present in HDACi influenced the HDAC isozyme that could be inhibited most effectively; the l-phenylalanine derivative 4e inhibited the HDAC6 isozyme most potently (IC₅₀ ∼ 88 nM), while the l-isoleucine derivative 4h was most effective against the isozyme HDAC2 (IC₅₀ ∼ 94 nM). We also noticed that the l-Phe derivative 4e was up to 5× more potent towards inhibiting HDAC6 than its optical antipode 4f derived from d-Phe. This was rationalized in terms of the varying extent of penetration of the enantiomeric inhibitors inside the catalytic tunnel of the enzyme. Since the isozymes HDAC6 and HDAC2 are overexpressed in different cancer cells, 4e and 4h elicited selective anticancer activity in different cancer cell lines. Additive therapeutic action of the combination therapy of 4e and 4h was observed on lung cancer cells that overexpress both these isozymes. Further, 4e formed implantable self-assembled hydrogels that achieved sustained and selective killing of cancer cells in the vicinity of implantation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3abiocompatible materials 3acancer therapy 3adrug therapy 3aepigenetics 3ahistone deacetylase 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophobicity 3aisozymes 3alung neoplasms 3aneoplasm cells 3aphenylalanine1 aChanchal, Abhishek1 aGujrati, Mansi1 aBanerjee, Aditi1 aMishra, Ram Kumar1 aSrivastava, Aasheesh0 tBiomaterials science.g2021 Jan. 5, v. 9, no. 1 p.261-271dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0bm01417f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03482naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245010200172500002200274520210200296592002802398650002902426650002502455650000902480650001102489650001502500650000902515650001902524650001102543651001602554651001602570653001702586653001202603653000902615653001102624700002202635700002702657700002802684700001602712700001802728700002202746700002002768700002902788700001702817773005902834856008602893852000902979655001202988IND60573395820221118235210.0170724s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057339582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2017.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoxleitner, Max10aLate Pleistocene – Holocene surface processes and landscape evolution in the central Swiss Alps  aPre-press version  aThe European Alps are a geomorphologically active region and experience a number of gravity-driven hillslope processes. Soil and landscape formation in the Alps has consequently undergone several minor and major traceable changes of developmental trajectories during the Holocene. Soil development is hypothesised to be often non-linear with time and characterised by stages of progressive and regressive evolution caused by upbuilding (formation, profile deepening) and erosion (profile shallowing). Several cold and warm climate phases are identified during the Holocene but it is largely unknown which effects these might have had on slope processes. By using datable moraines (10Be) and mires (14C), we have constructed a temporal framework for these processes. Using the geochemical imprint of mires in the Alpine setting of the Göschener-valley of the Central Swiss Alps, we reconstructed general (mostly erosional) landscape processes for the last ca. 10ka. As this is the type locality for the Göschener cold phase, we assumed that this phase (Göschener cold phase I and II ~1.5 and ~2.5kaBP) should have left easily recognizable traits. After deglaciation (11–12kaBP), soil evolution was progressive. Beginning around 8kaBP, we detect a distinct increase in erosion here, together with a vegetation change (towards tundra vegetation) and the highest measured rates of carbon sequestration. Other phases of high geomorphic activity were recognised ca. 5–6kaBP, 4kaBP and, to a lesser extent, 1–3ka ago. The cold phase at 5–6kaBP corresponds to a less distinct change in vegetation and lessened erosion. Human impact is increasingly obvious since about 2.4kaBP which overlaps with the Göschener cold phase. Nonetheless, erosion processes were not extraordinarily high during this period and a climate effect cannot be distinguished. We detect evidence of increasing human disturbance (regressive soil evolution) for about the last 1ka. We also detect an increase in dust flux during the last ca. 4–5ka, presumably due to the landscape change(s) in the Sahara during this time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3acarbon sequestration 3adust 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3asoil 3asoil formation 3atundra 3aAlps region 3aSwitzerland 0aCentral Alps 0aErosion 0aMire 0aDating1 aMusso, Alessandra1 aWaroszewski, Jarosław1 aMalkiewicz, Małgorzata1 aMaisch, Max1 aDahms, Dennis1 aBrandová, Dagmar1 aChristl, Marcus1 ade Castro Portes, Raquel1 aEgli, Markus0 tGeomorphology.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2017.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024004000135040001800175100001800193245009400211300001500305520143000320592002801750650001901778650002501797650001601822650001601838650001101854650001001865650001401875650001101889650001201900650001701912650002201929650001201951650001901963650000901982650003501991650003402026650004002060650003002100700001202130700002202142700001802164700002002182700001602202773008402218856008602302990002302388852000902411655001202420IND60091720520221122065726.0141103e20110310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009172052DNAL7 a212157292pmid7 aPMC30845232pmcid7 a10.1016/j.brainres.2010.12.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerrico, C.D.10aAcquisition and baseline performance of working memory tasks by adolescent rhesus monkeys  ap. 91-104.  aAdolescence is a transitional stage of development characterized by protracted refinements in the neural circuits required for adult level proficiency of working memory. Because impaired working memory is a hallmark feature of several psychiatric disorders that have their onset during adolescence, model systems that can be used to assess the maturation of working memory function, and of disease-related risk factors that disrupt its development, are of particular importance. However, few studies have investigated the maturation of working memory in nonhuman primates. Thus in the present study, we adapted two working memory tests that are among the most widely used in human and adult nonhuman primates, for adolescent rhesus monkeys. Using a touch-screen apparatus, monkeys were trained on a spatial delayed-response task to assess spatial working memory and a delayed match-to-sample task to assess object working memory. The results indicate that adolescent rhesus monkeys readily and efficiently acquire the ability to perform touch-screen based, complex tests of working memory. These data establish that distinct components of adult prefrontal cortex-dependent cognitive functions can be effectively modeled and evaluated in adolescent monkeys. As such, this approach should be useful for assessing the influence of environmental risk factors on the protracted maturation of working memory in adolescent macaques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacaca mulatta 3aacademic achievement 3aadolescence 3aadolescents 3aadults 3abrain 3acognition 3amemory 3amonkeys 3arisk factors 2aAgingxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aMacaca mulatta 2aMale 2aMemory, Short-Termxphysiology 2aPrefrontal Cortexxphysiology 2aPsychomotor Performancexphysiology 2aReaction Timexphysiology1 aLiu, S.1 aAsafu-Adjei, J.K.1 aSampson, A.R.1 aBradberry, C.W.1 aLewis, D.A.0 tBrain research.g2011 Mar. 10, v. 1378 p.91-104dElsevier B.V.x0006-89937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2010.12.0813Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02061naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001100140245011800151300001600269520089900285592002801184650001001212650000901222650002301231650003101254650001601285650004301301700001501344700001601359700001401375700001301389700001301402700001301415700001301428700001501441773013501456856007501591852000901666655001201675IND60765438520221121061613.0220615e20140519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076543852DNAL7 a10.17221/7404-cjas2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Y.10aDifferential expression profiling of estrogen receptor in the ovaries of two egg duck (Anas platyrhynchos) breeds  ap. 238-243.  aIn the present study, quantitative real-time PCR was employed to investigate expression profiling and expression difference of ESR1 and ESR2 in ovaries of Shaoxing duck and Jingjiang duck during three laying stages. Results showed the expression levels of ESR1 and ESR2 in ovaries were increased from the age of the first egg to the age of 500 days in both duck breeds. The expression of ESR1 in Shaoxing duck was lower than that in Jingjiang duck for the age of the first egg and of 180 days, and for the age of 500 days it was higher in Shaoxing duck than in Jingjiang duck. The ESR2 showed converse expression profiling in the two duck breeds. The results suggest that ESR1 and ESR2 mediate the process of egg laying in ducks, and that ESR2 may play a more important role for the ovary during egg-laying stages and may be closely related to the laying performance of the ducks. &nbsp; &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aducks 3aeggs 3aestrogen receptors 3agene expression regulation 3aoviposition 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction1 aXiao, H.W.1 aLiang, Z.H.1 aPan, A.L.1 aShen, J.1 aPi, J.S.1 aPu, Y.J.1 aDu, J.P.1 aChen, Z.H.0 tCzech Journal of Animal Science.g, v. 59, no. 5 p.238-243dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:14567x1212-18197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/7404-cjas3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245006900169300001600238520161100254592002801865650001101893650001401904650001601918650002701934650001101961650001301972650001001985650001501995650002102010650001302031650001602044651001002060653001602070653002002086653001702106653002402123700001402147700001702161700001502178700001602193700001702209773008302226856008602309852000902395655001202404IND60573395920221118234953.0170724e20171015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057339592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2017.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Zhongtai10aRecent ground fissures in the Hetao basin, Inner Mongolia, China  ap. 102-114.  aGround fissures are a geological hazard with complex formation mechanisms. Increasing amounts of human activity have created more ground fissures, which can destroy buildings and threaten human security. Some ground fissures indicate potentially devastating earthquakes, so we must pay attention to these hazards. This paper documents recently discovered ground fissures in the Hetao basin. These ground fissures are located along the frontal margins of the terraces of the Sertengshan piedmont fault. These fissures are 600–1600m long, 5–50cm wide, and at most 1m deep. These ground fissures emerged after 2010 and ruptured newly constructed roads and field ridges. The deep geodynamic mechanisms within this extensional environment, which is dominated by NE-SW principal compressive shear, involve N-S tensile stress, which has produced continuous subsidence in the Hetao basin and continuous activity along the Sertengshan piedmont fault since the late Quaternary. Trenches across the ground fissures reveal that the fissures are the latest manifestation of the activity of preexisting faults and are the result of creep-slip movement along the faults. The groundwater level in the Hetao basin has been dropping since the 1960s because of overexploitation, resulting in subsidence. When the tensile stress exceeds the ultimate tensile strength of the strata, the strata rupture along preexisting faults, producing ground fissures. Thus, the Sertengshan piedmont fault planes are the structural foundation of the ground fissures, and groundwater extraction induces the development of ground fissures.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3abuildings 3aearthquakes 3agroundwater extraction 3ahumans 3apiedmont 3aroads 3asubsidence 3atensile strength 3aterraces 3awater table 3aChina 0aHetao basin 0aGround fissures 0aActive fault 0aGroundwater decline1 aMa, Baoqi1 aLong, Jianyu1 aZhang, Hao1 aLiang, Kuan1 aJiang, Dawei0 tGeomorphology.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 295 p.102-114dElsevier B.V.x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2017.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03281naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245016300160300001800323500002000341520172600361592002802087650003602115650001702151650002402168650001202192650002102204650001402225650001402239650001902253650002102272650001402293650002302307650001402330650002302344650001302367650001702380650001002397650002002407650001302427700001902440700002002459700002202479700002202501700004002523773013002563856007302693852000902766655001202775IND60571411520221117235546.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057141152DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.80372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassini, Ismahen10aEffects of seed priming, salinity and methyl jasmonate treatment on bioactive composition of Brassica oleracea var. capitata (white and red varieties) sprouts  ap. 2291-2299.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Brassica spp. sprouts are rich in nutrients and bioactive compounds, especially glucosinolates and phenolic acid derivatives, and the composition of these young germinating seeds can be altered by several external factors. In this study two cabbage varieties (Brassica oleracea var. capitata, red and white) were studied using seed priming (KCl 50 mmol L⁻¹; NaCl 150 mmol L⁻¹) and MeJA spraying (25 µmol L⁻¹) to elicit the phytochemical content of edible sprouts. RESULTS: The red variety was richer in glucosinolates and phenolic compounds than the white one but not in mineral nutrients. Seed priming enhanced the potassium (K) content and flavonols in both varieties, while the total content of glucosinolates was reduced after seed priming only in the red variety. The white variety responded better than the red one to KCl seed priming, increasing the flavonols (89%). Salinity did not induce any change in the phytochemical content of these two varieties. Elicitation with sprayed MeJA was effective in significantly increasing the content of indolic glucosinolates glucobrassicin (5.7‐fold) and neoglucobrassicin (9.7‐fold) in the red cultivar. In the white variety, in addition to glucobrassicin (19.4‐fold) and neoglucobrassicin (9.4‐fold), 4‐hydroxyglucobrassicin (2.3‐fold) was also enhanced. MeJA also elicited significant amounts of anthocyanins (41%) and chlorogenic acid derivatives (329%) in the white variety. CONCLUSION: KCl seed priming and MeJA elicitation promoted the phytochemical composition of the cabbage varieties, especially in the white variety. The application of NaCl resulted in less efficient elicitation. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica oleracea var. capitata 3aanthocyanins 3abioactive compounds 3acabbage 3achlorogenic acid 3acultivars 3aflavonols 3aglucobrassicin 3amethyl jasmonate 3anutrients 3aphenolic compounds 3apotassium 3apotassium chloride 3asalinity 3aseed priming 3aseeds 3asodium chloride 3aspraying1 aBaenas, Nieves1 aMoreno, Diego A1 aCarvajal, Micaela1 aBoughanmi, Neziha1 aMartinez Ballesta, Maria Del Carmen0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2017 June, v. 97, no. 8 p.2291-2299dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.80373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245021000211300001600421520139100437592002801828596005101856596006001907650002201967650001401989650002402003650001402027650001402041650001602055650001702071650002002088650001302108650001902121650001302140651001402153700002002167700006502187700006202252700006702314700006502381773012302446856008302569852000902652655001202661IND60762092320221118184854.0220107e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076209232DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-021-02694-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandrajith, Rohana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3072-524010aExposure Assessment of Fluoride Intake Through Commercially Available Black Tea (Camellia sinensis L.) from Areas with High Incidences of Chronic Kidney Disease with Undetermined Origin (CKDu) in Sri Lanka  ap. 526-534.  aFluoride is a beneficial trace element for human health as its deficiency and excess levels can cause detrimental health effects. In Sri Lanka, dry zone regions can have excessive levels of fluoride in drinking water and can cause dental and skeletal fluorosis. In addition to drinking water, traditional habits of tea consumption can cause an additional intake of fluoride in the population. A total number of 39 locally blended black tea samples were collected from a village where chronic kidney disease with undetermined origin (CKDu) is prevalent. In addition, unblended tea samples were obtained from tea-producing factories. The fluoride contents in infusions of 2% weight per volume (w/v) were measured using calibrated ion-selective fluoride electrodes. The mean fluoride content was 2.68±1.03 mg/L in loose tea, 1.87±0.57mg/L in packed tea samples, and 1.14±0.55 mg/L in unblended tea. Repeated brewing of the same tea leaves showed that over 50% of fluoride leached into the solution in the first infusion. An estimate of the daily total average fluoride intake via tea consumption per person is 2.68 mg per day. With groundwater in many dry zone regions in Sri Lanka showing high fluoride levels that exceed 0.5 mg/L, the additional daily intake can rapidly exceed recommended thresholds of 2 mg/day. This can add to adverse health impacts that might also relate to CKDu.  aPublisher supplied data  aRPHS/2016/CKDu/06cNational Science Foundation  a01DP17042cBundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung 3aCamellia sinensis 3ablack tea 3aexposure assessment 3afluorides 3afluorosis 3agroundwater 3ahuman health 3akidney diseases 3aresearch 3atrace elements 3avillages 3aSri Lanka1 aBhagya, Sachini1 aDiyabalanage, Saranga1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3268-73671 aWimalasiri, Swarna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3765-72121 aRanatunga, Mahasen A.B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4668-73681 aBarth, Johannes A.

Further, the antioxidant activity of oregano methanol/water extracts was characterised using DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl free radical); thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS); ferric reducing power (FRP); and total content of phenolic compounds (TPC) assays. EPR spectroscopy was used for the investigation of the influence of the absorbed dose on the character of the paramagnetic structures formed, as well as for their thermal stability and life-time characterisation. EPR spectrum of the reference (non-irradiated) sample represents a broad singlet line with unresolved hyperfine splitting, attributable to Mn(II) ions, upon which the additional sharp EPR signal (g = 2.0022, &Delta;B<sub>pp</sub> &asymp; 1 mT) is superimposed, assigned to stable semiquinone radicals produced by the oxidation of polyphenolic compounds present in plants. The additional paramagnetic structures of different origin (mostly of cellulose and carbohydrate), possessing diverse thermal stability and life-time, were identified in the gamma-irradiated samples. Immediately after irradiation, a statistically significant increase was observed of the TBARS values and the total content of phenolic compounds in methanol/water oregano extract. The alterations of the antioxidant properties of oregano extracts with the time after the radiation treatment were also monitored. A substantial time-dependent decrease of antioxidant activity was observed, probably as a result of storage, with both irradiated and non-irradiated oregano samples, as obvious from the ferric reducing power test and the content of total phenolic substances. The influence of irradiation and subsequent storage of oregano samples on the DPPH radical-scavenging ability was only negligible.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aOriganum vulgare 3aabsorbed dose 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acellulose 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3afree radicals 3agamma radiation 3airradiation 3amethanol 3aoregano 3aoxidation 3athermal stability1 aSuhaj, M.1 aPolovka, M.1 aBrezová, V.1 aŠimko, P.0 tCzech Journal of Food Sciences.g, v. 25, no. 3 p.131-143dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21225x1805-93177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/741-cjfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245014900183300001600332520137300348592002801721650001401749650000901763650003101772650001601803650001501819650000901834650001701843650002101860650001901881650002201900650002901922650001201951650002601963650001701989650001102006650000902017650002702026650003102053650002802084650003402112650004202146650004602188700001802234700002102252700002102273700001602294773010002310856008102410990002302491852000902514655001202523IND60089857120221120133513.0141102e20110715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008985712DNAL7 a215491042pmid7 a10.1016/j.bcp.2011.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Gaiping10aMouse γ-butyrobetaine dioxygenase is regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α through a PPRE located in the proximal promoter  ap. 175-183.  aConvincing evidence from studies with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α-deficient mice suggested that the carnitine biosynthetic enzyme γ-butyrobetaine dioxygenase (BBD) is regulated by PPARα. However, the identification of BBD as a direct PPARα target gene as well as its exact regulation remained to be demonstrated. In silico-analysis of the mouse BBD promoter revealed seven putative peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPRE) with high similarity to the consensus PPRE. Luciferase reporter gene assays using mutated and non-mutated serial 5′-truncation BBD promoter reporter constructs revealed that one PPRE located at −75 to −87 relative to the transcription start site in the proximal BBD promoter is probably functional. Using gel shift assays we observed in vitro-binding of PPARα/RXRα heterodimer to this PPRE confirming that it is functional. In conclusion, the present study clearly shows that mouse BBD is a direct PPARα target gene and that transcriptional up-regulation of mouse BBD by PPARα is likely mediated by binding of the PPARα/RXR heterodimer to one PPRE located in its proximal promoter region. The results confirm emerging evidence from recent studies that PPARα plays a key role in the regulation of carnitine homeostasis by controlling genes involved in both, carnitine synthesis and carnitine uptake.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarnitine 3agels 3agene expression regulation 3ahomeostasis 3aluciferase 3amice 3apharmacology 3apromoter regions 3areporter genes 3aresponse elements 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAnimals 2aCarnitinexmetabolism 2aHep G2 Cells 2aHumans 2aMice 2aPPAR alphaxphysiology 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic. 2aProtein Multimerization 2aResponse Elementsxphysiology 2aRetinoid X Receptor alphaxphysiology 2agamma-Butyrobetaine Dioxygenasexgenetics1 aKühne, Hagen1 aRauer, Christine1 aRingseis, Robert1 aEder, Klaus0 tBiochemical pharmacology.g2011 July 15, v. 82, no. 2 p.175-183dElsevier Inc.x0006-29527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2011.04.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02261naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245007800158300001600236520120900252592002801461650001301489650001101502650001001513650001801523650001601541650002601557650001001583650000901593650001201602650001201614651001201626700001701638700001801655773013101673856007401804852000901878655001201887IND60765438820221121205118.0220419e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076543882DNAL7 a10.17221/7416-pse2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoráček, J.,10aCarbon fraction concentrations in a haplic Luvisol as affected by tillage  ap. 262-266.  aChanges of soil organic matter (SOM) parameters were investigated in a haplic Luvisol with medium-heavy texture. Soil samples were taken from several layers at minimum (MT) and conventional (CT) tillage plots of a field experiment in Sitzenhof (Germany). All cultural practices except for tillage (crop rotation, fertilizing, protection measures, etc.) were identical over the whole time of the experiment. The concentrations of oxidizable carbon C<sub>ox</sub> and its constituents (humic acids (HA), fulvic acids (FA), and hot-water soluble carbon) are comparable in layers&nbsp;15&ndash;20 cm in both variants. In 0&ndash;15 cm and 30&ndash;55 cm layers, these concentrations were higher in the MT variant. A similar trend was observed in the colour quotient values of humic substances Q4/6, which indicates increasing condensation of humus substances (HS) at deeper layers in both variants, and it is also confirmed by a humic to fulvic acids ratio HA:FA. Concentrations of SOM fractions were higher (except 15&ndash;20 cm layers) in the MT than CT treatment throughout the profile, especially below the 30 cm depth. The SOM did not accumulate markedly in the surface layer of long-term MT treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLuvisols 3acarbon 3acolor 3acrop rotation 3aenvironment 3afield experimentation 3ahumus 3aoxen 3atexture 3atillage 3aGermany1 aStrosser, E.1 aČechová, V.0 tPlant, Soil and Environment.g, v. 60, no. 6 p.262-266dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:17122x1214-11787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/7416-pse3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03790naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245016300188300001600351520195600367592002802323650003402351650001302385650002702398650001602425650002502441650001402466650001402480650002702494650001802521650003002539650001302569650001602582650002802598650003202626650002102658650001702679650004102696650008902737650002602826650003702852650001302889650002402902650001402926650002502940650001602965651001402981700001902995700001703014773010303031856008103134852000903215655001203224IND4397094020221120022834.0151024e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439709402DNAL7 a163288592pmid7 a10.1007/s10482-005-9014-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTarpgaard, Irene H.10aDesulfobacter psychrotolerans sp. nov., a new psychrotolerant sulfate-reducing bacterium and descriptions of its physiological response to temperature changes  ap. 109-124.  aA psychrotrolerant acetate-oxidizing sulfate-reducing bacterium (strain akvbᵀ) was isolated from sediment from the northern part of The North Sea with annual temperature fluctuations between 8 and 14 °C. Of the various substrates tested, strain akvbᵀ grew exclusively by the oxidation of acetate coupled to the reduction of sulfate. The cells were motile, thick rods with round ends and grew in dense aggregates. Strain akvbᵀ grew at temperatures ranging from −3.6 to 26.3 °C. Optimal growth was observed at 20 °C. The highest cell specific sulfate reduction rate of 6.2 fmol cell⁻¹ d⁻¹ determined by the ^{35}\hbox{SO}_{4}^{2-} method was measured at 26 °C. The temperature range of short-term sulfate reduction rates exceeded the temperature range of growth by 5 °C. The Arrhenius relationship for the temperature dependence of growth and sulfate reduction was linear, with two distinct slopes below the optimum temperatures of both processes. The critical temperature was 6.4 °C. The highest growth yield (4.3–4.5 g dry weight mol⁻¹ acetate) was determined at temperatures between 5 and 15 °C. The cellular fatty acid composition was determined with cultures grown at 4 and 20 °C, respectively. The relative proportion of cellular unsaturated fatty acids (e.g. 16:1ω7c) was higher in cells grown at 4 °C than in cells grown at 20 °C. The physiological responses to temperature changes showed that strain akvbᵀ was well adapted to the temperature regime of the environment from which it was isolated. Phylogenetic analysis showed that strain akvbᵀ is closest related to Desulfobacter hydrogenophilus, with a 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 98.6%. DNA–DNA-hybridization showed a similarity of 32% between D. hydrogenophilus and strain akvbᵀ. Based on phenotypic and DNA-based characteristics we propose that strain akvbᵀ is a member of a new species, Desulfobacter psychrotolerans sp.␣nov.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDesulfobacter hydrogenophilus 3aacetates 3afatty acid composition 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3aoxidation 3aphylogeny 3aphysiological response 3aribosomal RNA 3asulfate-reducing bacteria 3asulfates 3atemperature 3aunsaturated fatty acids 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aBase Composition 2aCold Climate 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDeltaproteobacteriaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aGeologic Sedimentsxmicrobiology 2aKinetics 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPhylogeny 2aSulfatesxmetabolism 2aTemperature 3aNorth Sea1 aBoetius, Antje1 aFinster, Kai0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2006 Jan., v. 89, no. 1 p.109-124dSpringer Netherlandsx0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-005-9014-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03344naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100002200171245013800193300001600331520167300347592002802020650001202048650001002060650001402070650001202084650002702096650001802123650001802141650000902159650007302168650001202241650004002253650006002293650000902353650006502362650003202427650000902459650002502468700001902493700001702512700002402529700002202553700002802575700002002603773008502623856008602708990002302794852000902817655001202826IND60091720920221120210839.0141103e20110310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009172092DNAL7 a212157342pmid7 a10.1016/j.brainres.2010.12.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorrigan, Frances14aThe neuroprotective domains of the amyloid precursor protein, in traumatic brain injury, are located in the two growth factor domains  ap. 137-143.  aThe amyloid precursor protein (APP) is known to increase following traumatic brain injury (TBI). This increase in levels of APP may be deleterious to outcome due to the production of neurotoxic Aβ. Conversely, this upregulation may be beneficial as cleavage of APP via the alternative non-amyloidogenic pathway produces the soluble α form of APP (sAPPα), which is known to have many neuroprotective and neurotrophic functions. Indeed it has previously been shown that treatment with sAPPα following a diffuse injury in rats improves outcome. However, the exact location within the sAPPα molecule which contains this neuroprotective activity has yet to be determined. The sAPPα peptide can consist of up to 6 domains, with the main isoform in the brain missing the 4th and 5th. Of the remaining domains, the D1 and D6a domains seem the most likely as they have been shown to have beneficial actions in vitro. This present study examined the effects of in vivo posttraumatic administration via an intracerebroventricular injection of the D1, D2 and D6a domains of sAPPα on outcome following moderate-impact acceleration TBI in rats. While treatment with either the D1 or D6a domains was found to significantly improve motor and cognitive outcome, as assessed on the rotarod and Y maze, treatment with the D2 domain had no effect. Furthermore axonal injury was reduced in D1 and D6a domain treated animals, but not those that received the D2 domain. As the D1 and D6a domains contain a heparin binding region while the D2 domain does not, this suggests that sAPPα mediates its neuroprotective response through its ability to bind to heparin sulfate proteoglycans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamyloid 3abrain 3acognition 3aheparin 3aneuroprotective effect 3aneurotoxicity 3aproteoglycans 3arats 2aAmyloid beta-Protein Precursorxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aBrainxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aBrain Injuriesxmetabolismxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aMale 2aNeuroprotective Agentsxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley1 aPham, Chi L.L.1 aVink, Robert1 aBlumbergs, Peter C.1 aMasters, Colin L.1 avan den Heuvel, Corinna1 aCappai, Roberto0 tBrain research.g2011 Mar. 10, v. 1378 p.137-143dElsevier B.V.x0006-89937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2010.12.0773Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01983naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009900168300001600267500001900283520092600302592002801228650002501256650002501281650002301306650001101329650003001340650001501370700002501385700002601410773013001436856008201566852000901648655001201657IND60719748920221119094350.0201205e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071974892DNAL7 a10.1007/s10651-020-00465-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGülmez, Ahmet,12aA puzzle over ecological footprint, energy consumption and economic growth: the case of Turkey  ap. 753-768.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe paper investigates the non-linear causality from energy consumption and economic growth to ecological footprint for the case of Turkey by employing ARDL Models and ECM-Based Granger Causality over the period from 1961 to 2016.

Despite this, most of the literature focuses on short-term and simplified efforts to understand lethal effects, with only a few comprehensive studies addressing sublethal exposures. To fill this shortcoming, we explore the lethal and sublethal effects of Pogostemon cablin (Lamiaceae) EO and an EO-based emulsion (18%) using the coffee berry borer Hypothenemus hampei Ferrari (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) as a model. First, we determine the toxicity of EO and EO-based emulsion using dose-mortality curves and lethal times. Second, we subjected adult females of H. hampei to sublethal doses to assess whether they affected their behavior, reproductive output, and histological features. Our findings reveal that patchoulol (43.05%), α-Guaiene (16.06%), and α-Bulnesene (13.69%) were the main components of the EO. Furthermore, the EO and its emulsion had similar toxicity, with dose-mortality curves and lethal times overlapping 95% confidence intervals. We also observed that sublethal exposure of females of H. hampei reduces reproduction and feeding, increases walking activity, and causes histopathological changes in the midgut. This study advances the knowledge of the lethal and sublethal effects of an eco-friendly substance on insects.Responsible Editor: Giovanni Benelli  aPublisher supplied data  a151765/2020-0cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aCurculionidae 3aHypothenemus hampei 3aPogostemon cablin 3aadults 3aemulsions 3aessential oils 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3amidgut 3amodels 3apollution 3areproductive performance 3aresearch1 aFarder-Gomes, Cliver Fernandes1 aRibeiro, Arthur Vieira1 aCosta, Thiago Leandro1 aFrança, Josélia Carvalho Oliveira1 aBacci, Leandro1 aDemuner, Antônio Jacinto1 aSerrão, José Eduardo1 aPicanço, Marcelo Coutinho0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 June, v. 29, no. 30 p.45763-45773dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19183-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245014200165300002000307520132500327592002801652650002101680650001701701650001301718650001501731650002301746700005701769700002101826700005601847773013701903856008002040852000902120655001202129IND60606143420221117060211.0180724e20180507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060614342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b019532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOotani, Yusuke10aContrasting Roles of Water at Sliding Interfaces between Silicon-Based Materials: First-Principles Molecular Dynamics Sliding Simulations  ap. 10459-10467.  aIt is known that the wear of silicon-based materials is due to the tribochemical reaction with water at the sliding interface, but the detailed mechanisms remain under debate. In this study, we used a first-principles molecular dynamics method to investigate the tribochemical wear mechanism. When a small amount of water was present at the sliding interface, the formation of interfacial bridge bonds connecting the two surfaces was observed. These bonds transmitted shear force to the surfaces that induced strain therein. The strained surface Si–O bonds subsequently reacted with water (Si–O–Si + H₂O → Si–OH + Si–OH), that is, the hydrolysis reaction occurred. Because the hydrolysis reaction resulted in dissociation of the surface Si–O bonds, water promoted tribochemical wear. However, when a large amount of water was present, it separated the two surfaces. The water thereby suppressed the formation of interfacial bridge bonds and in turn the hydrolysis of Si–O bonds and thus tribochemical wear. Our results indicate that water could either promote or suppress tribochemical wear, depending on how much was present. We suggest that the previously reported humidity dependence of the tribochemical wear of silicon-based materials can be explained in terms of these contrasting roles of water.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3adissociation 3ahumidity 3ahydrolysis 3amolecular dynamics1 aXu, Jingxiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1484-96921 aHatano, Takahiro1 aKubo, Momoji1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3310-18580 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 May 07, v. 122, no. 19 p.10459-10467dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b019533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245011600178520193200294592002802226650002102254650002102275650001702296650001002313650001702323650001202340650001202352650001502364650001002379651001302389651001102402653002102413653002602434653002002460653002502480700002602505700002002531700002702551700002702578700003002605773009402635856008402729852000902813655001202822IND60681493920221120145416.0200217e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068149392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2020.1046022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSato, Priscila de Morais10aMothers' food choices and consumption of ultra-processed foods in the Brazilian Amazon: A grounded theory study  aIn recent decades, an increase in consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPF), a type of product frequently associated with diet-related obesity, chronic diseases, decrease of eating traditions and loss of culinary diversity, has been observed in middle-income countries. However, there is lack of information on factors related to choosing UPF. In this study, we aimed to understand the factors promoting UPF choices and consumption among mothers living in an urban context in the Brazilian Amazon, and to present a conceptual model grounded on their experiences that illustrates the dynamics between the observed factors. For this qualitative study, we used a constructive grounded theory approach, with a theoretical sampling of 40 women, to choose mothers with high and low consumption of ultra-processed foods. Data production and the first steps of analysis were performed concomitantly, followed by four steps of coding focused on creating conceptual categories and explaining the interactions between them. Our findings highlighted the importance of context in promoting UPF choice and consumption, particularly the “food environment”, physical and virtual, and the “sociocultural environment”. These contextual aspects interacted with the two main personal aspects influencing participants' UPF consumption, one concerning practices, “cooking behaviors”, and the other concerning preferences, “food tastes”. Factors such as economic and time constraints were also important and competed to shape eating practices through interactions with participants’ health valorization. Findings are discussed in relation to food choice theories, social roles and the food environment. Implications for public health initiatives include the importance of considering environmental changes, sociocultural and economic influences, the reliance on UPF, and the role of women in the home, when promoting healthy diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3achronic diseases 3aeconomic factors 3afood choices 3afoods 3ahealthy diet 3amothers 3aobesity 3atraditions 3awomen 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 0aEating practices 0aUltra-processed foods 0aGrounded theory 0aQualitative research1 aCouto, Marcia Thereza1 aWells, Jonathan1 aCardoso, Marly Augusto1 aDevakumar, Delanjathan1 aScagliusi, Fernanda Baeza0 tAppetite.g2020 May 01, v. 148 p.104602-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2020.1046023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002500137245014100162300001600303520126200319592002801581650001101609650001701620650001201637650001901649650002201668650001501690650000901705650002701714650001901741650002001760651002201780653001501802653001701817653002601834653002201860700002001882700002501902700002001927773011701947856007102064852000902135655001202144IND60644369020221117060848.0190516s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064436902DNAL7 a10.1071/BT180452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFunnekotter, Anna V.10aPhylogeographic analyses of Acacia karina (Fabaceae) support long term persistence of populations both on and off banded iron formations  ap. 194-204.  aUnderstanding the response of species to past climatic changes and whether particular areas acted as refugia is critical both to our understanding of the distribution of genetic variation, and for the conservation and/or restoration of species. We used phylogeographical analyses of Acacia karina, a Banded Iron Formation (BIF) associated species, to better understand historical processes in the semiarid midwest region of Western Australia. We specifically examined whether BIF acted as refugia for the species during the colder, dryer periods of the Quaternary. The genetic structure over the entire range of A. karina was assessed using seven nuclear microsatellites (19 populations; n=371) and 3196bp of chloroplast sequence (19 populations; n=190). We found high levels of nuclear and chloroplast genetic diversity and high levels of chloroplast haplotype differentiation. Genetic diversity was higher than expected for such a geographically restricted species, and similarly high levels of nuclear and chloroplast diversity were observed in BIF and non-BIF populations. The chloroplast and nuclear data suggest that BIFs have not acted as climate refugia for A. karina. Instead, long-term persistence of both BIF and non-BIF populations is supported.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia 3achloroplasts 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3airon 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphylogeography 3arefuge habitats 3aWestern Australia 0aAcacia spp 0achloroplasts 0aconservation genetics 0agenetic diversity1 aMillar, Melissa1 aKrauss, Siegfried L.1 aNevill, Paul G.0 tAustralian journal of botany.g2019, v. 67, no. 3 p.194-204dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl44712x0067-19247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/BT180453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03042naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245006800169300001400237520144500251592002801696650000801724650003001732650001401762650001501776650001601791650001001807650001501817650001501832650001001847650001901857650002101876650001201897650001901909650001901928650001401947650002901961650002601990653001002016653000702026653000902033653000802042653000802050653000802058653000802066653000702074653000702081653001602088653000902104653001102113653000802124653001402132653002502146700002302171700001902194773011002213856008402323852000902407655001202416IND60573396320221118235350.0190318e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057339632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2017.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKroth, Peter G.13aAn update on aureochromes: Phylogeny – mechanism – function  ap. 20-26.  aLight is important for algae, as it warrants metabolic independence via photosynthesis. In addition to the absorption of light by the photosystems, algae possess a variety of specific photoreceptors that allow the quantification of the light fluxes as well as the assessment of light qualities. About a decade ago, aureochromes have been described in the xanthophyte alga Vaucheria frigida. These proteins represent a new type of blue light photoreceptor as they possess both a light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domain for light reception as well as a basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) domain for DNA binding, indicating that they represent light-driven transcription factors. Aureochromes so far have been detected only in a single group of algae, photosynthetic stramenopiles, but not in any other prokaryotic or eukaryotic organisms. Recent biophysical work on aureochromes in the absence and the presence of DNA revealed the mechanism of allosteric communication between the sensor and effector domains despite their unusual inversed arrangement. Different molecular models have been proposed to describe the effect of light on DNA binding. Functional characterization of mutants of the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, in which the aureochrome genes have been silenced or deleted, indicate that different aureochromes may have different functions, being involved in central processes like light acclimation and regulation of the cell cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPhaeodactylum tricornutum 3aVaucheria 3aabsorption 3aacclimation 3aalgae 3ablue light 3acell cycle 3agenes 3aleucine zipper 3amolecular models 3amutants 3aphotoreceptors 3aphotosynthesis 3aphylogeny 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 0aAUREO 0aBL 0abZIP 0aFMN 0aFCP 0aLOV 0aNPQ 0aPS 0aRL 0aAureochrome 0abZIP 0aDiatom 0aLOV 0aStructure 0aTranscription factor1 aWilhelm, Christian1 aKottke, Tilman0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2017 Oct., v. 217 p.20-26dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2017.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02406naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245013100166300001600297520094700313592002801260650002501288650001701313650001801330650001601348650001901364650002001383650001401403650002001417650001001437650002001447650001301467650001101480653002001491653001001511653002401521653002501545653001601570700002501586700005801611700001601669700001901685700002401704773010001728856008701828852000901915655001201924IND60635636020221116162536.0190705e20181030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063563602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.04.1302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Xikun10aAddition of mushroom powder to pasta enhances the antioxidant content and modulates the predictive glycaemic response of pasta  ap. 199-209.  aThis study reports the effects of addition of mushroom powder on the nutritional properties, predictive in vitro glycaemic response and antioxidant potential of durum wheat pasta. Addition of the mushroom powder enriched the pasta as a source of protein, and soluble and insoluble dietary fibre compared with durum wheat semolina. Incorporation of mushroom powder significantly decreased the extent of starch degradation and the area under the curve (AUC) of reducing sugars released during digestion, while the total phenolic content and antioxidant capacities of samples increased. A mutual inhibition system between the degree of starch gelatinisation and antioxidant capacity of the pasta samples was observed. These results suggest that mushroom powder could be incorporated into fresh semolina pasta, conferring healthier characteristics, namely lowering the potential glycaemic response and improving antioxidant capacity of the pasta.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3adietary fiber 3adurum wheat 3agelatinization 3aglycemic effect 3amushrooms 3anutritive value 3apasta 3areducing sugars 3asemolina 3astarch 0aMushroom powder 0aPasta 0aNutritional profile 0aStarch digestibility 0aAntioxidant1 aBrennan, Margaret A.1 aServenti, Luca1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5172-85151 aLiu, Jianfu1 aGuan, Wenqiang1 aBrennan, Charles S.0 tFood chemistry.g2018 Oct. 30, v. 264 p.199-209dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.04.1303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009200165300002000257520172300277592002802000596005402028596006702082650001502149650001802164650001602182650001802198650001502216650001902231650001902250650002402269650001002293650002202303650002102325650001402346650001302360651001702373700002502390700001202415700002702427700001802454700002102472700001902493773015502512856008302667852000902750655001202759IND60780649620221120124353.0220621e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078064962DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-19157-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Daochen10aMicrobial diversity and community structure in deep-sea sediments of South Indian Ocean  ap. 45793-45807.  aMicrobial communities composed of bacteria, archaea and fungi play a pivotal role in driving the biogeochemical cycles in the marine ecosystem. Despite the vastness of the South Indian Ocean, only a few studies reported the simultaneous analysis of bacterial, archaeal and fungal diversity therein, particularly archaeal and fungal communities in deep-sea environments received less attention previously. In this study, microbial diversity, community composition and dynamics in microbial community structure in eight deep-sea sediment samples collected from different sites at varying depths of the South Indian Ocean were explored using Next-Generation Sequencing. In total, 21 bacterial phyla representing 541 OTUs were identified from the eight samples, where phylum Proteobacteria was found as the most abundant bacterial phylum in five out of eight samples. Firmicutes and Chloroflexi were the dominant phyla in the rest of the three samples. In the case of archaea, uncultured species belonging to the phyla Thaumarchaeota and Euryarchaeota were the abundant taxa in all the samples. Similarly, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the most abundant fungal phyla present therein. In all the eight samples studied here, about 10–58% and 19–26% OTUs in archaeal and fungal communities were mapped to unclassified taxa respectively, suggesting the lack of representation in databases. Co-occurrence network analysis further revealed that bacterial communities tend to be more dynamic than archaeal and fungal communities. This study provides interesting insights into the microbial diversity, community composition and dynamics in microbial community structure in the deep-sea sediments of the South Indian Ocean.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFE0107100cNational Key R&D Program of China  a2021K309CcPostdoctoral Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province 3aAscomycota 3aBasidiomycota 3aChloroflexi 3aEuryarchaeota 3aFirmicutes 3aProteobacteria 3aThaumarchaeota 3acommunity structure 3afungi 3amarine ecosystems 3amarine sediments 3apollution 3aresearch 3aIndian Ocean1 aSethupathy, Sivasamy1 aGao, Lu1 aNawaz, Muhammad Zohaib1 aZhang, Weimin1 aJiang, Jianxiong1 aSun, Jianzhong0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 June, v. 29, no. 30 p.45793-45807dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19157-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245010700165520147500272592002801747650001201775650001901787650002001806650000901826650001301835650001001848651001801858773011901876856007701995961001202072852000902084655001202093IND60794242720221116180547.0220922e20220911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079424272DNAL7 a10.3390/land110915362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanberry, Brice B.10aClimate Envelopes Do Not Reflect Tree Dynamics after Euro-American Settlement in Eastern North America  aTree distributions and densities have been dynamic since Euro-American settlement in North America. Historically dominant fire-tolerant tree species have decreased, and fire-sensitive, successional species have increased, and tree species have expended westward since the 1800s into the central Great Plains grasslands. Divergent compositional trajectories and the westward expansion of tree species may be explained by climate change. To establish patterns expected by climate change, I predicted climate envelopes in eastern North America during 7 intervals, from the 1500s to 1961–1990, of 16 wide-ranging fire-tolerant and fire-sensitive species. The climate envelopes demonstrated that suitable climate area has remained relatively stable for all species: compared with the 1500s, areal extents during the 1900s increased 104% for fire-sensitive species and 106% for fire-tolerant species. Additionally, a pattern of northeastern shifts (i.e., following the North American land mass) resulted from climate change. Climate envelopes demonstrated northeastern shifts with slight expansion for all species, which did not accord with realized dynamics of westward tree expansion or increases in fire-sensitive species. In accordance with other lines of evidence, land use disturbance change, incorporating fire exclusion, likely has caused the divergent trajectories of fire-tolerant and fire-sensitive species and westward expansion into the Great Plains grasslands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3afire resistance 3aland 3aland use 3atrees 3aNorth America0 tLand.g2022 Sept. 11, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land110915363Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245016000209300001600369500001900385520141700404592002801821650001001849650002501859650002501884650001101909650001801920650001401938650001501952650002501967651001101992651001102003651001002014651001902024700005702043773013002100856008202230852000902312655001202321IND60719749220221119094032.0201205e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071974922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10651-020-00467-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPata, Ugur Korkut1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2853-410610aFinancial development, globalization and ecological footprint in G7: further evidence from threshold cointegration and fractional frequency causality tests  ap. 803-825.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis paper empirically explores the dynamic relationships between financial development, globalization, energy consumption, economic growth, and ecological footprint in G7 countries over the period 1980–2015. Using a recently introduced threshold cointegration test with an endogenous structural break, the paper aims primarily to determine the effects of financial development and globalization on environmental degradation. The results confirm the presence of cointegration in Canada, Italy, and Japan. The long-run estimates indicate that globalization significantly reduces ecological footprint in Canada and Italy, while financial development reduces pollution in Japan. The findings also demonstrate that energy consumption stimulates environmental degradation in these three countries. Furthermore, the causality test that considers smooth structural breaks via a fractional frequency flexible Fourier function indicates that globalization causes ecological footprint in all the G7 countries except France, while financial development causes ecological footprint in France, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Finally, the overall results suggest that globalization is a more effective tool than financial development in regulating ecological footprint for G7 countries. Therefore, we recommend that policymakers should make use of the opportunities that globalization offers to solve environmental problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aecological footprint 3aeconomic development 3aenergy 3aglobalization 3apollution 3astatistics 3atime series analysis 3aCanada 3aFrance 3aItaly 3aUnited Kingdom1 aYilanci, Veli1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5738-690X0 tEnvironmental and ecological statistics.g2020 Dec., v. 27, no. 4 p.803-825dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870051x1352-85057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10651-020-00467-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012500168300002000293520116300313592002801476596010801504596010801612596010801720650001601828650002301844650001301867650001401880650001301894650001801907650001601925650001801941650001101959700005701970700001702027700001402044700001902058700001502077700001302092700001702105773015502122856008302277852000902360655001202369IND60780649720221120124500.0220621e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078064972DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-19107-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Miaomiao10aContribution of recycled moisture to precipitation and its influencing factors in the subalpine zone of Qilian Mountains  ap. 45947-45959.  aRecycled moisture, the part of precipitating vapor that comes from surface evapotranspiration, plays an important role in the hydrological process and the feedback of the land surface-atmosphere system. In this study, we use the δ²H and δ¹⁸O data of precipitation, plant water, and surface water systematically collected in the subalpine area of the Qilian Mountains from May to October, 2019, and assess the contribution of recycled moisture to precipitation based on the three-component isotopic mixing model. The results indicated that the main source of precipitating vapor comes from the advected vapor, and its contribution reaches up to 87.8 ± 1.6%. The contribution of local recycled moisture is 12.2 ± 1.6%, in which the proportion of transpiration and evaporation are 8.9 ± 0.6% and 3.3 ± 1.0%, respectively. In terms of the correlation between recycled moisture and its influencing factors, the temperature has a positive effect on evapotranspiration and promotes moisture recycling, while precipitation and humidity have a certain inhibition effect on evapotranspiration and reduce the contribution of recycled moisture.  aPublisher supplied data  a41661005cfoundation for innovative research groups of the national natural science foundation of china  a41867030cfoundation for innovative research groups of the national natural science foundation of china  a41971036cfoundation for innovative research groups of the national natural science foundation of china 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3ahumidity 3apollution 3aresearch 3asurface water 3atemperature 3atranspiration 3avapors1 aJia, Wenxiong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0853-13031 aZhu, Guofeng1 aShi, Yang1 aZhang, Zhiyuan1 aXiong, Hui1 aYang, Le1 aZhang, Fuhua0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 June, v. 29, no. 30 p.45947-45959dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19107-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245007900211300001600290520114600306592002801452650003501480650001601515650001001531650002001541650001401561650002601575650001301601650000901614700006501623700005801688700006301746700005801809773012301867856008301990852000902073655001202082IND60762092820221118184849.0220107e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076209282DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-021-02698-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaşimoğlu, Zeynep1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1532-018410aQuantitative Analysis of Serum Zinc Levels in Primary Brain Tumor Patients  ap. 568-573.  aAlthough the close relationships between most of the trace elements and tumor formation mechanisms are very well-defined, studies on some elements such as zinc are still ongoing. When examining studies on brain tumors, it was observed that studies investigating the role played by serum zinc levels on tumor etiology and prognosis have gained momentum. In this study, we investigate the relationship between different brain tumor types and serum zinc levels by quantitatively analyzing serum zinc levels in patients with primary brain tumors. In this study, we measured serum zinc levels of 33 brain tumor patients as well as 35 healthy individuals serving as a control group. Metal concentrations were measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Serum zinc levels were lower in patients with primary brain tumors compared to control group (p < 0.05). Additionally, patients’ serum zinc levels were significantly different according to their brain tumor types and also according to their age (p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that brain tumor patients’ serum zinc levels may play a role in tumor etiology, typology, and prognosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3ablood serum 3abrain 3abrain neoplasms 3aprognosis 3aquantitative analysis 3aresearch 3azinc1 aErbayraktar, Zübeyde1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0316-14621 aÖzer, Erdener1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5743-52221 aErbayraktar, Serhat1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2938-578X1 aErkmen, Tuğba1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3178-91500 tBiological trace element research.g2022 Feb., v. 200, no. 2 p.568-573dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-021-02698-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02272naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245004800171300001600219520099900235592002801234650001601262650001501278650002201293650001801315650001001333650001201343650001801355650001701373650002001390650001701410650002701427650001801454650001701472653002601489653001901515653001401534653001201548653001101560700001801571700002101589773011001610856008501720852000901805655001201814IND60747604420221120181853.0210816e20200303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074760442DNAL7 a10.1080/03079457.2019.16969462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHauck, Ruediger10aSpotlight on avian pathology: aspergillosis  ap. 115-118.  aAspergillosis is a disease of domestic and free-living birds caused by infection with a fraction of fungi within the genus Aspergillus. Species can be identified by colony morphology and microscopic characterization of conidia and conidiophores or by PCR, and isolates can be typed by microsatellite typing. Serodiagnostic options for testing are limited to antibody and antigen detection methods. The sensitivity of these tests can be enhanced through the use of protein electrophoresis. In many countries, no systemic antifungal drugs are registered for use in food-producing birds and resistance to antifungal drugs has been reported in Aspergillus strains derived from birds. The most important prevention strategy against aspergillosis is keeping the infection pressure low by adequate ventilation as well as cleaning and disinfection. Open questions about avian aspergillosis that research needs to address are related to epidemiology and serodiagnosis, as well as therapy and prevention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aantibodies 3aantigen detection 3aaspergillosis 3abirds 3aconidia 3aconidiophores 3adisinfection 3aelectrophoresis 3aepidemiology 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aserodiagnosis 3atherapeutics 0aAspergillus fumigatus 0afungal disease 0adiagnosis 0acontrol 0areview1 aCray, Carolyn1 aFrança, Monique0 tAvian pathology.g2020 Mar. 3, v. 49, no. 2 p.115-118dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4833x1465-33387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2019.16969463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245008200165300002000247520131500267592002801582596006501610596010001675650001201775650001101787650001501798650001001813650002201823650001401845650001301859650002301872651001001895700001901905700005701924773015501981856008302136852000902219655001202228IND60780649820221120124352.0220621e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078064982DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-19102-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Dengli10aIndustrial agglomeration and carbon neutrality in China: lessons and evidence  ap. 46091-46107.  aThis study explored the impact of industrial agglomeration on carbon neutrality and its spatial spillover effects utilizing the expanded the output density theoretical model of Ciccone and Hall. The main findings are as follows: (1) In terms of long-term effects, industrial output has significantly reduced regional carbon emissions, while industrial labor and capital agglomeration have aggravated carbon emissions, and industrial technology agglomeration has no significant impact on carbon emissions. (2) From the perspective of lagging effects, industrial output agglomeration has significantly increased regional carbon emissions, while industrial technology agglomeration has effectively reduced carbon emissions. The lagging effects of industrial labor and capital agglomeration are not significant. (3) From the perspective of regional differences, there are significant regional differences in the impact of industrial output and capital agglomeration on regional carbon emissions, while this differential influence does not exist on industrial labor and technological agglomeration. Therefore, in carbon emissions governance, it is necessary to analyze the long-term impact of industrial agglomeration on carbon emissions but also to pay attention to the lag and regional differences of the impact.  aPublisher supplied data  a18CJY020cNational Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences  a41801088cInnovative Research Group Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China 3acapital 3acarbon 3agovernance 3alabor 3along term effects 3apollution 3aresearch 3atheoretical models 3aChina1 aPeng, Zhongwen1 aYang, Yuanhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6342-90450 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 June, v. 29, no. 30 p.46091-46107dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19102-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02028naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245015200163300001800315520087100333592002801204650001201232650002101244650003001265650002401295650001801319650001301337650002301350700005201373700005201425773013601477856008001613852000901693655001201702IND60606143720221117060421.0180724e20180405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060614372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b019652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Shulan10aFirst-Principles Insights into Ammonia Decomposition Catalyzed by Ru Clusters Anchored on Carbon Nanotubes: Size Dependence and Interfacial Effects  ap. 9091-9100.  aAmmonia decomposition catalyzed by Ru nanoparticles supported on carbon nanotubes offers an efficient way for COₓ-free hydrogen generation. To understand the catalytic mechanism, the two most important elementary steps of ammonia decomposition, namely the initial cleavage of the NH₂–H bond and the nitrogen recombination, have been studied using density functional theory on a carbon nanotube deposited with Ruₓ (x = 1, 2, 6, and 13) clusters. The results indicate the reaction steps are catalyzed at Ru sites with barriers significantly lower than those on Ru(0001), but the barriers have a strong dependence on the size of the cluster. It is also found that Ru sites at the interface with the carbon nanotube are more active, showing a strong interfacial effect due apparently to facile charge transfer from the carbon nanotube to interfacial metal atoms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3acarbon nanotubes 3adensity functional theory 3ahydrogen production 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen 3aphysical chemistry1 aLin, Sen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2288-54151 aGuo, Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9901-053X0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Apr. 05, v. 122, no. 16 p.9091-9100dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b019653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02152naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245004400158300001600202520132100218592002801539650002701567650001501594650001101609650001801620700001901638773013401657856007401791852000901865655001201874IND60765439220221120171228.0220419e20080107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076543922DNAL7 a10.17221/743-cjfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKizilaslan, H.10aRisk analysis in Turkey milk production  ap. 144-150.  aThe present study has been done in order to determine the risks inherent in the milk production in Turkey. For that objective, factors such as the milk yield, the gross revenues realised, and the price levels as reflected to the producer&rsquo;s benefits, have been taken into account. Upon the calculation of the measures for variables, fluctuations were found in the milk yield, prices, and gross revenues. Based on the hypothesis that the information possessed by the producer on the economic and technological developments is scarce and restrained, the variable coefficient has been calculated as 10.81% for yield, 23.26% for prices, and 30.01% for gross revenues, respectively. With the hypothesis that the producers are aware of and informed on the economic and technological developments, these ratios, that is to say, the fortuitous variable coefficients would be, respectively, 2.07%, 15.96%, and 16.07%. According to the conclusions reached, an environment in which the producers can take rational decisions concerning the milk production can be said not to exist. For this reason, the government intervention through efficient measures for the dairy production will be necessary. Furthermore, the producers should be given informational support through the published studies in the agricultural extension.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural extension 3amilk yield 3aprices 3arisk analysis1 aKizilaslan, N.0 tCzech Journal of Food Sciences.g, v. 25, no. 3 p.144-150dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21225x1805-93177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/743-cjfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024002200135024001900157040001800176100003000194245008800224300001600312506007600328520081900404592002801223506003701251650002401288650001801312650002101330650001401351650001701365650001001382650001201392650002801404650001901432651001001451653001201461653001801473653002001491653002401511653001401535653001701549700003001566700006001596700002601656700002101682700002101703700001901724700002501743700001701768700002001785700001901805700003201824773011801856856008801974852000902062655001202071IND60567967920221207123729.0190318e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056796792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.04.0242doi7 aPMC58815782pmcid7 a285923592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Ansari, Ebrahim M.A.S.10aMercury accumulation in Lethrinus nebulosus from the marine waters of the Qatar EEZ  ap. 143-153.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTotal mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) were recorded in the commercial demersal fish Lethrinus nebulosus, caught from six locations in Qatar EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone).

There is no major threat to human health from the presence of Hg in L. nebulosus, based upon reasonable consumption patterns, limited to no more than three meals of L. nebulosus per week.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLethrinus nebulosus 3ademersal fish 3afish consumption 3afood webs 3ahuman health 3aliver 3amercury 3amethylmercury compounds 3amuscle tissues 3aQatar 0aMercury 0aMethylmercury 0aBioaccumulation 0aLethrinus nebulosus 0aQatar EEZ 0aArabian Gulf1 aAbdel-Moati, Mohamed A.R.1 aYigiterhan, Oguz1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8519-99681 aAl-Maslamani, Ibrahim1 aSoliman, Yousria1 aRowe, Gilbert T.1 aWade, Terry L.1 aAl-Shaikh, Ismail M.1 aHelmi, Ahmed1 aKuklyte, Ligita1 aChatting, Mark1 aAl-Ansi Al-Yafei, Mehsin A.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 121, no. 1-2 p.143-153dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.04.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02391naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002700153245011600180300001800296520108600314592002801400650004401428650002201472650002401494650001701518650003701535650002601572650001901598650001101617650003301628650002101661650002001682650002101702651001701723700002201740700002901762773010401791856008901895852000901984655001201993IND60563393620221118054054.0170216e20170216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056339362DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b024542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDludlu, Mbuso Kingdom,10aMicostructural and Mechanical Properties of Geopolymers Synthesized from Three Coal Fly Ashes from South Africa  ap. 1712-1722.  aIn this study, coal fly ashes (CFAs) from three different boiler sites in South Africa, Eskom (E coal fly ash), George Mukhari Academic Hospital (GMH coal fly ash), and KarboChem (KBC coal fly ash), were used to produce geopolymers. The coal fly ashes were pretreated with a mixed alkali activator solution of sodium silicate (NaSiO₃) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The geopolymer pastes were cured in an oven at 60 °C for 10 days and further cured at room temperature for 18 days. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the geopolymers were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), X-ray diffractions (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), thermogravimetric (TG), and compressive strength analyses. The compressive test results obtained showed that the E and KBC geopolymers have higher strength than GMH-CFA geopolymers. Similar results were obtained in the FTIR and SEM-EDS analyses. This indicates that E-CFA and KBC-CFA are more reactive and hence they have a higher degree of geopolymerization when compared to GMH-CFA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aambient temperature 3acoal fly ash 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3amechanical properties 3amicrostructure 3apastes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium hydroxide 3asodium silicate 3athermogravimetry 3aSouth Africa1 aOboirien, Bilainu1 aSadiku, Emmanuel Rotimi,0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Feb. 16, v. 31, no. 2 p.1712-1722dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.6b024543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03035naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245015200177300001600329520158900345536010301934592002802037596000802065650003202073650001302105650001902118650001602137650000902153650001302162650002502175650001602200650001202216651001802228653002502246653001102271653002402282653001402306653001502320700002502335700002502360773011002385856008502495852000902580655001202589IND60747604720221120165305.0210816e20200303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074760472DNAL7 a10.1080/03079457.2019.17104622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 a(Sjaak) de Wit, J.

For many IB variants, homologous live vaccines are not available for priming. Very little is known about the efficacy of priming with heterologous live IB vaccines (or combination of live IB vaccines) to induce broad IB protection in long-living chickens. In this study, the protection levels induced by vaccination programmes with only heterologous live priming by a Massachusetts vaccine and a 4/91 vaccine, only a multivalent inactivated vaccine that contained D1466 antigen and a combination of both, against a D1466 challenge were compared. The infection with infectious bronchitis virus D1466, a genotype II, lineage 1 virus, was able to cause serious damage to the unvaccinated laying hens resulting in respiratory signs, a long-lasting drop in egg production and loss of egg quality. All three vaccination programmes induced significant levels of protection against challenge with a pathogenic D1466 strain. Overall, the vaccination programme using the broad heterologous live priming and the inactivated vaccine provided high protection against the combination of egg drop and loss of egg quality. The results showed that this combination of heterologous live vaccines was able to increase the efficacy of the inactivated infectious bronchitis virus vaccine despite the very low antigenic relationship of both live vaccines with the challenge strain.  aThis work was supported by Intervet International BV, Boxmeer, The Netherlands [grant number 902].  aPublisher supplied data  a902 3aInfectious bronchitis virus 3aantigens 3aegg production 3aegg quality 3aeggs 3agenotype 3ainactivated vaccines 3avaccination 3aviruses 3aMassachusetts 0aHeterologous priming 0alayers 0ainactivated vaccine 0aIBV D1466 0aprotection1 ater Veen, Christiaan1 aKoopman, H.

The success of these processes relies on accurate computation of molecular diffusion coefficient which determines how fast a solvent penetrates into oil. Concentration profile measurements of solvent in oil are used for the determination of the molecular diffusion coefficient. Although numerous experimental techniques have been proposed, the accurate estimation of this parameter is still a topic of debate in the literature. In this work, 1-D nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is employed to obtain diffusivity data for a toluene–heavy oil system. Diffusion of toluene in heavy oil was monitored for 20 days at a controlled temperature of 35 °C and ambient pressure. Over time, toluene diffusion into oil leads to changes in spatial distribution of T₁ and T₂ that affect the received signal. This serves as the basis of the solvent and heavy oil concentration estimation. Consequently, concentration profiles were established by converting the MRI signals to concentration values. This conversion was achieved by creating samples with known concentrations of heavy oil–toluene and measuring their response in the same environment and parameter settings. A concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient was obtained from concentration profiles. The results show that relaxation based 1D MRI is an accurate and robust tool to obtain diffusivity data in complex fluids such as heavy oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3abitumen 3adiffusivity 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoils 3asolvents 3atemperature 3atoluene1 aKryuchkov, Sergey1 aKantzas, Apostolos0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Feb. 16, v. 31, no. 2 p.1226-1234dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.6b024643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245013600167300001800303500002000321520150200341592002801843650001501871650002001886650001201906650001601918650002701934650002501961650002401986650001202010650002302022650001702045650001502062650001102077650001302088650002002101650000902121650001102130650003902141650002502180650002302205650003302228650002702261700002402288773013002312856007302442852000902515655001202524IND60571412420221117235626.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057141242DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.80762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMune Mune, Martin Alain10aProduction and characterization of cowpea protein hydrolysate with optimum nitrogen solubility by enzymatic hydrolysis using pepsin  ap. 2561-2568.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Cowpea is a source of low‐cost and good nutritional quality protein for utilization in food formulations in replacement of animal proteins. Therefore it is necessary that cowpea protein exhibits good functionality, particularly protein solubility which affects the other functional properties. The objective of this study was to produce cowpea protein hydrolysate exhibiting optimum solubility by the adequate combination of hydrolysis parameters, namely time, solid/liquid ratio (SLR) and enzyme/substrate ratio (ESR), and to determine its functional properties and molecular characteristics. RESULTS: A Box–Behnken experimental design was used for the experiments, and a second‐order polynomial to model the effects of hydrolysis time, SLR and ESR on the degree of hydrolysis and nitrogen solubility index. The optimum hydrolysis conditions of time 208.61 min, SLR 1/15 (w/w) and ESR 2.25% (w/w) yielded a nitrogen solubility of 75.71%. Protein breakdown and the peptide profile following enzymatic hydrolysis were evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and size exclusion chromatography. Cowpea protein hydrolysate showed higher oil absorption capacity, emulsifying activity and foaming ability compared with the concentrate. CONCLUSION: The solubility of cowpea protein hydrolysate was adequately optimized by response surface methodology, and the hydrolysate showed adequate functionality for use in food. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aanimal proteins 3acowpeas 3aemulsifying 3aemulsifying properties 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aexperimental design 3afoaming 3agel chromatography 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anutritive value 3aoils 3apepsin 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein hydrolysates 3aprotein solubility 3aresponse surface methodology 3asodium dodecyl sulfate1 aMinka, Samuel René0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2017 June, v. 97, no. 8 p.2561-2568dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.80763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01451naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002400154245005500178300001400233520058300247592002800830650002200858650002200880650001800902650001500920700001700935773008900952856008801041990002301129852000901152655001201161IND60091721820221120210851.0141103e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009172182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystems.2012.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoñi-Moreno, Angel10aContinuous computation in engineered gene circuits  ap. 52-56.  aIn this paper we consider the problem of representation and measurement in genetic circuits, and investigate how they can affect the reliability of engineered systems.

In this paper, Na-containing mineral transformation behaviors and their influences on the catalytic performance during Na₂CO₃-catalyzed CO₂ gasification of high-alumina coal were comprehensively investigated by thermogravimetry, inductively coupled plasma, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Moreover, to have a better understanding of the mineral transformation during catalytic gasification, model compounds, i.e., kaolinite (Al₂O₃·2SiO₂·2H₂O) and boehmite (AlOOH), the main Al-containing minerals in high-alumina coal, were chosen as model compounds to investigate the mineral transformation behaviors. The results show that Na₂CO₃ first deactivates to generate inert sodium aluminum silicate (Na₁.₅₅Al₁.₅₅Si₀.₄₅O₄) at 700 °C, which contributes to the deactivation of catalysts, and then various kinds of sodium aluminum silicates are formed with increasing temperature and Na₂CO₃ addition. Among them, sodium aluminum silicate [(Na₂O)₀.₃₃NaAlSiO₄] has been testified as the most stable mineral during gasification. In addition, Na-containing mineral transformation and its resulting products are helpful to the recovery of Al from the ash of catalytic gasification, and 94% recovery rate can be obtained, which is considered to be a method to extract Al from gasification ash. Model kaolinite and boehmite can well explain the mineral transformation during Na₂CO₃-catalyzed CO₂ gasification of high-alumina coal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalkali metals 3aaluminum 3aaluminum oxide 3aboehmite 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acoal 3agasification 3akaolinite 3amodels 3asilicates 3asilicon 3asodium carbonate 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry1 aWang, Zhiqing1 aFang, Huibin1 aWang, Yongwei1 aHuang, Jiejie1 aFang, Yitian0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Feb. 16, v. 31, no. 2 p.1235-1242dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.6b024913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245015500178300001600333520101500349592002801364650002401392650002401416650001701440650002501457650001301482650001401495650001801509650001101527650001101538650002101549650001201570650002501582650002501607650001501632653001401647653002301661653002501684653001701709653001601726653001101742653004201753653003401795700002601829700002401855700001701879700002401896773010001920856008702020852000902107655001202116IND60525940620221119203543.0190402e20160101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052594062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.05.1072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaavedra, Gabriela M.10aEffects of preharvest applications of methyl jasmonate and chitosan on postharvest decay, quality and chemical attributes of Fragaria chiloensis fruit  ap. 448-453.  aFragaria chiloensis fruit has a short postharvest life mainly due to its rapid softening. In order to improve its postharvest life, preharvest applications of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and chitosan were evaluated during postharvest storage at room temperature. The quality and chemical parameters, and protection against decay were evaluated at 0, 24, 48 and 72h of storage from fruits of two subsequent picks (termed as first harvest and second harvest). In general, fruits treated with MeJA and chitosan maintained higher levels of fruit firmness, anthocyanin, and showed significant delays in decay incidence compared to control fruit. MeJA-treated fruits exhibited a greater lignin content and SSC/TA ratio, and delayed decay incidences. Instead, chitosan-treated fruits presented higher antioxidant capacity and total phenol content. In short, both the elicitors were able to increase the shelf life of fruits as evidenced by the increased levels of lignin and anthocyanin, especially of the second harvest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFragaria chiloensis 3aambient temperature 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3achitosan 3aelicitors 3afruit quality 3afruits 3alignin 3amethyl jasmonate 3aphenols 3apostharvest diseases 3apreharvest treatment 3ashelf life 0aElicitors 0aChilean strawberry 0aShelf life extension 0aFungal decay 0aAnthocyanin 0aLignin 0aMethyl jasmonate (PubChem CID: 62388) 0aChitosan (PubChem CID: 71853)1 aFigueroa, Nicolás E.1 aPoblete, Leticia A.1 aCherian, Sam1 aFigueroa, Carlos R.0 tFood chemistry.g2016 Jan. 01, v. 190 p.448-453dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.05.1073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245013800159520166500297592002801962650001701990650001102007650001202018650002002030650002202050650000902072650002002081650001102101650002502112650001902137651001002156700001502166700002002181700001902201700001902220700001602239773011902255856007702374852000902451655001202460IND60794243420221116180512.0220922e20220912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079424342DNAL7 a10.3390/land110915432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qiangyi 10aDistribution Characteristics, Regional Differences and Spatial Convergence of the Water-Energy-Land-Food Nexus: A Case Study of China  aLand use change affects the supply and demand of water, energy and food and the integration of land elements into the common water-energy-food (WEF) nexus, which is an effective way to strictly adhere to the bottom line of natural resources. First, this study used the entropy method and coupling coordination model to measure the coupling coordination degree of the water-energy-land-food (WELF) nexus in 30 provinces in China during the period of 2006–2019. Then, the regional differences and distribution dynamics were examined with the Dagum Gini coefficient and Kernel density estimation, respectively. Finally, the spatial correlation was analyzed using the global Moran’s I, and a spatial β convergence model was constructed to empirically test its spatial β convergence characteristics. The results show that the coupling coordination degree of the WELF nexus in most of the provinces was at the stage of barely coordinated, with a decreasing trend; the intensity of transvariation was the main source of regional differences in the coupling coordination degree of the WELF nexus, followed by intra-regional differences, while inter-regional differences were small. The national, eastern and central regions had a slight gradient effect, showing regional dispersion characteristics, albeit less obvious; there was a spatial absolute-β convergence and spatial conditional-β convergence nationally and in the three regions. On this basis, policy recommendations were made to realize the synergistic development of land planning, water resources allocation, energy utilization, and food production and to balance regional differences in resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aenergy 3aentropy 3afood production 3aissues and policy 3aland 3aland use change 3amodels 3astatistical analysis 3asupply balance 3aChina1 aYang, Lan 1 aJiang, Fangxin 1 aLiu, Yangqing 1 aGuo, Chenyang 1 aHan, Shuya 0 tLand.g2022 Sept. 12, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land110915433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01324naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245007700168300001600245500001900261520039900280592002800679650001400707650001300721650001500734700001900749700002300768700001800791773013000809856007400939852000901013655001201022IND60722959420221116184553.0210108e20210105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072295942DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc06299e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerpell, Christopher J.10aImidazolium-based catenane host for bromide recognition in aqueous media  ap. 101-104.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe synthesis of a novel catenated system which is dense in cationic hydrogen bonding imidazolium units is described.

Different extrusion processing approaches such as “cold”, “hot” and pre-mixed formulations were used to develop the Compritol® 888 ATO lipid matrices by altering the extrusion temperatures, drug loading and formulation composition. The extrudates were characterized via a range of techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), hot stage microscopy (HSM) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) to identify the drug state within the lipid matrix. Df-Na was found to be either in crystalline or amorphous state depending on the processing conditions. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis demonstrated excellent drug distribution of Df-Na on the surface of the compressed tablets. The lipid matrices developed by HME provided sustained release of pre-mixed formulations for 12h mainly controlled by diffusion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3acold 3acolloids 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adrugs 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aextrusion 3amelting 3amicroscopy 3atemperature 0aExtrusion 0aLipids 0aSolid dispersions 0aTablet 0aSolid dosage form1 aManiruzzaman, M.1 aSlipper, I.J.1 aMostafa, S.1 aMiolane, C.1 aCuppok, Y.1 aMarchaud, D.1 aDouroumis, D.0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2013 Oct. 01, v. 110 p.403-410dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2013.03.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013600157300002000293520131700313592002801630650004401658650003701702650001501739650002101754650001601775650002501791650002101816650003101837650001301868650002501881650001701906650001401923650001901937650002401956650001901980650001901999700001402018700001902032700001702051700001702068773012402085856007402209852000902283655001202292IND60665062420221118075115.0190912e20140611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066506242DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra03652b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chunming10aImproving hemocompatibility of polypropylene via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization for covalently coupling BSA  ap. 24842-24851.  aBovine serum albumin (BSA) modified polypropylene (PP) was fabricated via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) of poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (PEGMA) and glycidyl methacrylate (GMA). Kinetics study revealed an approximately linear increase in graft density of the functional brushes with polymerization time. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed that comonomers and BSA were successfully immobilized onto PP film. The hydrophilicity of PP was improved by modification with PEGMA and GMA. The balance between the inhibition of BSA adsorption by PEGMA and the covalent immobilization of BSA by GMA through the ring-opening reaction of the epoxy group resulted in the moderate fluorescence intensity of FITC–BSA immobilized PP-g-P (PEGMA-co-GMA). The hemolysis test showed that BSA could decrease the hemolysis rate. Red blood cell membrane maximal stress can be reduced by the inertness of BSA as well as the repulsion caused by its electrostatic interactions. Whole blood cell attachment tests showed that BSA molecules weakened the interaction between blood cells and the PP surface. Therefore, the immobilization of BSA on PP film is an effective approach for improving the hemocompatibility of PP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3abiocompatibility 3ablood cells 3abovine serum albumin 3achemical bonding 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aepoxides 3aerythrocyte membrane 3afluorescence 3ahemolysis 3ahydrophilicity 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3apolypropylenes1 aJin, Jing1 aLiu, Jingchuan1 aXu, Xiaodong1 aYin, Jinghua0 tRSC advances.g2014 June 11, v. 4, no. 47 p.24842-24851dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra03652b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02868naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002000136245006600156300001600222520123700238592002801475650002001503650001901523650002501542650001201567650001801579650002001597650002301617650001201640650001901652650001301671650001801684650002001702650002201722650001001744700002401754700002301778700002401801700002101825700002601846700002401872700002201896700002501918700001401943700002601957700001901983700002102002700002102023700002602044700002502070773012802095856007002223852000902293655001202302IND60481505220221121231408.0160205e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048150522DNAL7 a10.1890/0901792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, Ray G10aBiophysical considerations in forestry for climate protection  ap. 174-182.  aForestry – including afforestation (the planting of trees on land where they have not recently existed), reforestation, avoided deforestation, and forest management – can lead to increased sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and has therefore been proposed as a strategy to mitigate climate change. However, forestry also influences land‐surface properties, including albedo (the fraction of incident sunlight reflected back to space), surface roughness, and evapotranspiration, all of which affect the amount and forms of energy transfer to the atmosphere. In some circumstances, these biophysical feedbacks can result in local climate warming, thereby counteracting the effects of carbon sequestration on global mean temperature and reducing or eliminating the net value of climate‐change mitigation projects. Here, we review published and emerging research that suggests ways in which forestry projects can counteract the consequences associated with biophysical interactions, and highlight knowledge gaps in managing forests for climate protection. We also outline several ways in which biophysical effects can be incorporated into frameworks that use the maintenance of forests as a climate protection strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate 3adeforestation 3aenergy transfer 3aevapotranspiration 3aforests 3aglobal warming 3aplanting 3areforestation 3asolar radiation 3asurface roughness 3atrees1 aCanadell, Josep G.,1 aRanderson, James T1 aJackson, Robert B.,1 aHungate, Bruce A1 aBaldocchi, Dennis D.,1 aBan-Weiss, George A1 aBonan, Gordon B.,1 aCaldeira, K.q(Ken),1 aCao, Long1 aDiffenbaugh, Noah S.,1 aGurney, Kevin,1 aKueppers, Lara M1 aLaw, Beverly E.,1 aLuyssaert, Sebastiaan1 aO'Halloran, Thomas L0 tFrontiers in ecology and the environment.g2011 Apr., v. 9, no. 3 p.174-182dEcological Society of Americax1540-92957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0901793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03458naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245011300165300001600278520171600294592002802010650001502038650002502053650002202078650001802100650001902118650002402137650002602161650001702187650001502204650000902219650001602228650001702244650001802261653001502279653002202294653001902316653002002335653002502355653002602380700001102406700001702417700001502434700001802449700001602467700001502483700001802498700001802516700001902534700002002553700001802573700001602591700001702607773013602624856008702760852000902847655001202856IND60782092320221120073517.0220816e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078209232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.06.2112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Huan10aPea pod-mimicking hydroxyapatite nanowhisker-reinforced poly(lactic acid) composites with bone-like strength  ap. 114-123.  aThe anisotropic hierarchical structures of naturally derived materials have offered useful design principles for the fabrication of high-strength and functional materials. Herein, we unraveled a structure-by-bionics approach to construction of pea pod-mimicking architecture for poly(lactic acid) (PLA) composites impregnated with hydroxyapatite nanowhiskers (HANWs). The HANWs (length of 80–120 nm, diameter of ~30 nm) were customized using microwave-assisted aqueous biomineralization at minute level, which were incorporated into PLA microfibers by electrospinning with filler loadings of 10–30 wt%. The membranes comprising HANW-modified PLA microfibers were stacked and structured into composite films, strategically involving high-pressure compression at a relatively low temperature to impart the confined structuring mechanisms. It thus allowed partial melting and thinning of PLA microfibers into nanofibers, onto which the discrete HANWs were tightly adhered and embedded, showing distinguished architectural configurations identical with pea pod. More importantly, the mechanical properties and bioactivity were remarkably promoted, as demonstrated by the increments of over 54 % and nearly 72 % for the yield strength and elastic modulus (71.6 and 2547 MPa) of the structured composite loaded 30 wt% HANWs compared to those of pure PLA (46.4 and 1484 MPa), as accompanied by significant improvements in the bioactivity to nucleate and create apatite entities in mineral solution. The unusual combination of excellent biological characteristics and bone-like mechanical elasticity and extensibility make the structured PLA composites promising for guided bone/tissue regeneration therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3abioactive properties 3abiomineralization 3aextensibility 3ahydroxyapatite 3amicrowave treatment 3amodulus of elasticity 3ananocrystals 3ananofibers 3apeas 3atemperature 3atherapeutics 3atissue repair 0aBiomimetic 0aPoly(lactic acid) 0aHydroxyapatite 0aElectrospinning 0aConfined structuring 0aMechanical properties1 aKe, Lv1 aTang, Mengke1 aShang, Han1 aZhang, Zi-Lin1 aXu, Wenxuan1 aFu, Ya-Nan1 aWang, Yanqing1 aTang, Daoyuan1 aHuang, Donghui1 aZhang, Shenghui1 aYang, Hao-Ran1 aHe, Xinjian1 aGao, Jiefeng0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 216 p.114-123dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.06.2113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03538naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245018300161300001200344520191900356592002802275650001602303650001902319650001802338650001902356650001402375650002302389650001302412650002002425650003102445650001802476650001002494650002702504650001702531650001802548650001502566650001402581650001702595650001902612650001902631650002102650650002302671700002102694700001702715700001702732700001402749700001902763700001702782773010502799856008302904852000902987655001202996IND60709267920221120185641.0210921e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070926792DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-020-02618-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Li10aBioinformatics and expression analysis of histone modification genes in grapevine predict their involvement in seed development, powdery mildew resistance, and hormonal signaling  ap. 412.  aBACKGROUND: Histone modification genes (HMs) play potential roles in plant growth and development via influencing gene expression and chromatin structure. However, limited information is available about HMs genes in grapes (Vitis vinifera L.). RESULTS: Here, we described detailed genome-wide identification of HMs gene families in grapevine. We identified 117 HMs genes in grapevine and classified these genes into 11 subfamilies based on conserved domains and phylogenetic relationships with Arabidopsis. We described the genes in terms of their chromosomal locations and exon-intron distribution. Further, we investigated the evolutionary history, gene ontology (GO) analysis, and syntenic relationships between grapes and Arabidopsis. According to results 21% HMs genes are the result of duplication (tandem and segmental) events and all the duplicated genes have negative mode of selection. GO analysis predicted the presence of HMs proteins in cytoplasm, nucleus, and intracellular organelles. According to seed development expression profiling, many HMs grapevine genes were differentially expressed in seeded and seedless cultivars, suggesting their roles in seed development. Moreover, we checked the response of HMs genes against powdery mildew infection at different time points. Results have suggested the involvement of some genes in disease resistance regulation mechanism. Furthermore, the expression profiles of HMs genes were analyzed in response to different plant hormones (Abscisic acid, Jasmonic acid, Salicylic acid, and Ethylene) at different time points. All of the genes showed differential expression against one or more hormones. CONCLUSION: VvHMs genes might have potential roles in grapevine including seed development, disease resistance, and hormonal signaling pathways. Our study provides first detailed genome-wide identification and expression profiling of HMs genes in grapevine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aVitis vinifera 3aabscisic acid 3abioinformatics 3achromatin 3adisease resistance 3aethylene 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3agenes 3agrowth and development 3ahistone code 3ajasmonic acid 3aorganelles 3aphylogeny 3aplant growth 3apowdery mildew 3asalicylic acid 3aseed development 3aseedless varieties1 aAḥmad, Bilāl,1 aLiang, Zhen,1 aShi, Xiaoxin1 aSun, Ruyi1 aZhang, Songlin1 aDu, Guoqiang0 tBMC plant biology.g2020 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.412-412dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-020-02618-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02356naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245016700159300001800326520114900344592002801493650001101521650002301532650002001555650001201575650001801587650001401605650002101619700001801640700001901658700001401677700001701691700005501708773014601763856007601909852000901985655001201994IND60684409520221118014811.0200219e20200131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068440952DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b139752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ze-Shu10aYnamide Smiles Rearrangement Triggered by Visible-Light-Mediated Regioselective Ketyl–Ynamide Coupling: Rapid Access to Functionalized Indoles and Isoquinolines  ap. 3636-3644.  aIn the past decades, significant advances have been made on radical Smiles rearrangement. However, the eventually formed radical intermediates in these reactions are limited to the amidyl radical, except for the few examples initiated by a N-centered radical. Here, a novel and practical radical Smiles rearrangement triggered by photoredox-catalyzed regioselective ketyl–ynamide coupling is reported, which represents the first radical Smiles rearrangement of ynamides. This method enables facile access to a variety of valuable 2-benzhydrylindoles with broad substrate scope in generally good yields under mild reaction conditions. In addition, this chemistry can also be extended to the divergent synthesis of versatile 3-benzhydrylisoquinolines through a similar ketyl–ynamide coupling and radical Smiles rearrangement, followed by dehydrogenative oxidation. Moreover, such an ynamide Smiles rearrangement initiated by intermolecular photoredox catalysis via addition of external radical sources is also achieved. By control experiments, the reaction was shown to proceed via key ketyl radical and α-imino carbon radical intermediates.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3adehydrogenation 3aindoles 3aisoquinolines 3aoxidation 3aregioselectivity1 aChen, Yang-Bo1 aZhang, Hao-Wen1 aSun, Zhou1 aZhu, Chunyin1 aYe, Long-Wu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3108-26110 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 Jan. 31, v. 142, no. 7 p.3636-3644dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b139753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245018500159500001400344520190300358592002802261650001502289650001502304650002202319650002102341650001302362650001102375650001302386650003102399650001702430650001902447650001302466650001102479650001102490650001402501650000702515650001002522650001002532650002002542700002402562700003302586700002102619700002102640700002002661700002502681773011902706856007402825852000902899655001202908IND60704436320221120035715.0200724e20200306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070443632DNAL7 a10.3390/w120307232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠolić, Marko 10aComparing the Adsorption Performance of Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes Oxidized by Varying Degrees for Removal of Low Levels of Copper, Nickel and Chromium(VI) from Aqueous Solutions  aNAL-light  aFunctionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have drawn wide attention in recent years as novel materials for the removal of heavy metals from the aquatic media. This paper investigates the effect that the functionalization (oxidation) process duration time (3 h or 6 h) has on the ability of MWCNTs to treat water contaminated with low levels of Cu(II), Ni(II) and Cr(VI) (initial concentrations 0.5–5 mg L⁻¹) and elucidates the adsorption mechanisms involved. Adsorbent characterization showed that the molar ratio of C and O in these materials was slightly lower for the oxMWCNT6h, due to the higher degree of oxidation, but the specific surface areas and mesopore volumes of these materials were very similar, suggesting that prolonging the functionalization duration had an insignificant effect on the physical characteristics of oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (oxMWCNTs). Increasing the Ph of the solutions from Ph 2 to Ph 8 had a large positive impact on the removal of Cu(II) and Ni(II) by oxMWCNT, but reduced the adsorption of Cr(VI). However, the ionic strength of the solutions had far less pronounced effects. Coupled with the results of fitting the kinetics data to the Elowich and Weber–Morris models, we conclude that adsorption of Cu(II) and Ni(II) is largely driven by electrostatic interactions and surface complexation at the interface of the adsorbate/adsorbent system, whereas the slower adsorption of Cr(VI) on the oxMWCNTs investigated is controlled by an additional chemisorption step where Cr(VI) is reduced to Cr(III). Both oxMWCNT3h and oxMWCNT6h have high adsorption affinities for the heavy metals investigated, with adsorption capacities (expressed by the Freundlich coefficient KF) ranging from 1.24 to 13.2 (mg g⁻¹)/(mg l⁻¹)ⁿ, highlighting the great potential such adsorbents have in the removal of heavy metals from aqueous solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon nanotubes 3achromium 3acopper 3aduration 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aheavy metals 3aionic strength 3akinetics 3amodels 3anickel 3aoxidation 3apH 3apaper 3awater 3awater pollution1 aMaletić, Snežana 1 aKragulj Isakovski, Marijana 1 aNikić, Jasmina 1 aWatson, Malcolm 1 aKónya, Zoltan 1 aTričković, Jelena 0 tWater.g2020 Mar. 06, v. 12, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120307233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012300169520134800292592002801640650002301668650001601691650001901707650001501726650002301741650002301764650002001787650001201807650001401819650001201833650002201845650001401867650000901881650002001890650001301910651000901923653001601932653002301948653001601971653002701987700001702014700001902031700002102050700003002071700001702101700003102118700001902149700002302168773011302191856008202304852000902386655001202395IND60648385120221122142150.0190711e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064838512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2019.1106402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBadibostan, Hasan10aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in infant formulae, follow-on formulae, and baby foods in Iran: An assessment of risk  aTwenty-seven samples of infant formulae and follow-on formulae and fifteen samples of baby food from Iranian markets were analyzed for concentrations of four polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH4) determined by use of gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrophotometry. An assessment of risks posed to infants and toddlers was conducted by calculating the margin of exposure and incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) by use of the Monte Carlo Simulation Method. Benzo (a) anthracene, was not detected in any of the samples, while approximately 64.3% samples contained detectable amounts of benzo (a) pyrene, while chrysene was observed in three samples and benzo (b) fluoranthene was detected in one sample. One of the samples contained 1.43 μg PAH4/kg, which was greater than the maximum tolerable limit (MTL; 1 μg/kg) stated in Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1125. Accordingly, the 95% ILCRs in the infants/toddlers due to ingestion of milk powder and baby foods were determined to be 1.3 × 10−6 and 7.3 × 10−7, respectively. Also, the 95th centiles of the MOEs, due to ingesting milk powder or baby foods by infants/toddlers were estimated to be 3.6 × 104 and 7.2 × 104, respectively.

Recently, the toxicity of AgNMs has attracted significant attention. However, the effect of the shape of AgNMs (particles, wires, plates) on their toxicity in soil ecosystems remains poorly understood. In this study, we added AgNMs of different shapes and sizes (silver nanoparticles, AgNPs; 10 μm silver nanowires, 10-AgNWs; 20 μm silver nanowires, 20-AgNWs; silver nanoplates, AgPLs) to natural soil and determined their effect on the growth and reproduction of the free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. AgNPs and AgPLs were found to inhibit the growth and reproduction of C. elegans, whereas AgNWs had a negligible effect. Among these AgNMs, the results of this study suggest AgNPs are the most toxic. This confirms that the shape of AgNPs plays a significant role in their toxicity level. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comparative analysis of the shape-dependent toxicity of AgNMs in the soil using nematode C. elegans. This study provides a scientific reference for assessing shape-dependent soil nanotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aanimal growth 3afree-living nematodes 3aingredients 3ananosilver 3ananowires 3areproduction 3asilver 3asoil 3asoil ecosystems 3atoxicity 0aSoil toxicity 0aCaenorhabditis elegans 0aSilver nanomaterials 0aAgNMs 0aNanotoxicity 0aShape-dependency1 aKwak, Jin Il1 aAn, Youn-Joo0 tChemosphere.g2019 Jan., v. 215 p.50-56dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.09.1773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03449naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011100166500002200277520205100299592002802350650001202378650001502390650001502405650001202420650001102432650002202443650001302465650001002478650001402488650001502502650002202517650001902539651001002558653002902568653002002597653001702617653001802634653002002652700001802672700002002690700001802710700001802728773012702746856008502873852000902958655001202967IND60650924220221120161732.0190711e20180417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065092422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.04.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xing10aUpper Viséan coral biostrome in a volcanic-sedimentary setting from the Eastern Tianshan, Northwest China  aPre-press version  aFor the first time, a Mississippian coral biostrome is described from the Eastern Tianshan, Xinjiang Province, Northwest China. Rugose corals and foraminifers show that the biostrome developed during the late Viséan in one of the rare carbonate levels in the mainly volcanic-siliciclastic succession of the Yamansu Formation. A single fasciculate coral, Siphonodendron irregulare, dominates (>80%) this biostrome. Of the 22 coral genera found in the Yamansu Formation, 5 colonial and 6 solitary dissepimented corals are recorded in the biostrome. The biostrome can be divided vertically into two parts. In the main thick part dominate large patches of in situ Siphonodendron irregulare colonies. In the thinner uppermost part, Siphonodendron irregulare and Lithostrotion formed locally isolated small patches in a capping bed. The initial growth of the coral patches was related to slight topographic irregularities in the underlying volcano-sedimentary rocks. Siphonodendron irregulare appears to have been the best adapted species to the environmental pressures in the unstable tectono-sedimentary environment of the Yamansu Formation. It flourished and outnumbered the other corals when volcanic activity ceased and carbonate production became active for a short time. The development of the Siphonodendron biostrome ceased due to increases in sea-level and volcanic activity. Compared to Siphonodendron biostromes in the western and eastern Paleotethys, the Siphonodendron biostrome in Yamansu is unique for having developed in an island arc setting. To date, the Yamansu biostrome is the only documented coral bioconstruction at similar latitudes in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). Formation of this coral biostrome was controlled by extrinsic factors, such as changes in global climate and ocean currents, and intrinsic factors, such as the pioneering nature of the fast-growing Siphonodendron irregulare. Both sets of factors are responsible for the expansion of the tropical reef belt into previously more temperate environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRetaria 3aVisean age 3acarbonates 3aclimate 3acorals 3aintrinsic factors 3alatitude 3arocks 3asea level 3atopography 3avolcanic activity 3awater currents 3aChina 0aSiphonodendron biostrome 0aBiostratigraphy 0aPaleoecology 0aMississippian 0aNorthwest China1 aAretz, Markus1 aZhang, Xionghua1 aDu, Yuansheng1 aLuan, Tengfei0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2018 Apr. 17,  p.108739-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.04.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01860naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245004600167300001400213520064100227592002800868650001400896650001200910650001500922650001300937650001700950650000900967650001300976650001200989650001701001650002101018651001701039651001801056653001401074653003301088653001601121653001401137700002701151700003301178773012701211856007901338852000901417655001201426IND60684409720221118014650.0200219e20190827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068440972DNAL7 a10.1093/mspecies/sez0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAya-Cuero, Carlos10aDasypus kappleri (Cingulata: Dasypodidae)  ap. 51-60.  aDasypus kappleri Krauss, 1862, commonly known as greater long-nosed armadillo, is the second largest extant armadillo and readily distinguishable by the prominent spurs on the hind legs.

We reviewed the hazards imposed by all 784 pesticides currently registered for use on biofuel crops in Brazil. We detected compounds that have been suspended by international conventions, as well as over 80 compounds included in lists of priority concern for exhibiting environmental persistence and/or having the potential to elicit neurotoxic, reprotoxic, carcinogenic, or endocrine‐disrupting effects in humans and wildlife. These chemicals will be used at increased rates, or for the first time, across large expanses of agroin‐dustrially converted pastures and native (ie pristine) habitat in the cerrado (tropical savanna) and Amazonian rainforest biomes. If human and environmental health are to be balanced with productivity to achieve a sustainable agriculture, bolder initiatives on pesticide restriction and control must be implemented in tropical countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiofuels 3acerrado 3aecosystems 3aenergy crops 3aenvironmental health 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3aneurotoxicity 3apastures 3apesticides 3arain forests 3asavannas 3asustainable agriculture 3awildlife 3aBrazil1 aGrillitsch, B.q(Britta),0 tFrontiers in ecology and the environment.g2011 May, v. 9, no. 4 p.215-221dEcological Society of Americax1540-92957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0901393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02125naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245012800209300002000337506007600357520075300433592002801186506003701214650002901251650002201280650001101302650001101313650001201324650001301336700001701349700002201366700003001388700002501418700002001443773017601463856007901639852000901718655001201727IND60172143520221207112735.0150602e20120626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017214352DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12032231092doi7 aPMC33870442pmcid7 a226899692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGilsbach, Bernd K.10aRoco kinase structures give insights into the mechanism of Parkinson disease-related leucine-rich-repeat kinase 2 mutations  ap. 10322-10327.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMutations in human leucine-rich-repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) have been found to be the most frequent cause of late-onset Parkinson disease. Here we show that Dictyostelium discoideum Roco4 is a suitable model to study the structural and biochemical characteristics of the LRRK2 kinase and can be used for optimization of current and identification of new LRRK2 inhibitors. We have solved the structure of Roco4 kinase wild-type, Parkinson disease-related mutants G1179S and L1180T (G2019S and I2020T in LRRK2) and the structure of Roco4 kinase in complex with the LRRK2 inhibitor H1152. Taken together, our data give important insight in the LRRK2 activation mechanism and, most importantly, explain the G2019S-related increase in LRRK2 kinase activity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDictyostelium discoideum 3aParkinson disease 3ahumans 3amodels 3amutants 3amutation1 aHo, Franz Y.1 aVetter, Ingrid R.1 avan Haastert, Peter J.

The surface morphology is compared using SEM images. The presence of nitrogen was confirmed by the energy dispersion X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) indicating the polymerization of Gly on the surface of the modified electrode. The impedance study indicates a better charge transfer kinetics for DA at CPE modified with MWCNT/polyglycine electrode. The presence of MWCNTs in carbon paste matrix triggers the extent of electropolymerization of Gly and imparts more selectivity towards DA by electrochemically not sensing AA below a concentration of 3.1×10−4M. Due to the exclusion of the signal for AA, the interference of AA in the determination of DA is totally ruled out by DPV method which is used for its detection at lower concentrations. Large peak separation, good sensitivity, reproducibility and stability allow this modified electrode to analyze DA individually and simultaneously along with AA and UA. Detection limit of DA was determined from differential pulse voltammetric (DPV) study and found to be 1.2×10−8M with a linear dynamic range of 5.0×10−7M to 4.0×10−5M. The practical analytical application of this electrode was demonstrated by measurement of DA content in dopamine hydrochloride injection and human blood serum.  aPublisher supplied data 3adopamine 3adetection limit 3aenergy 3ablood serum 3ahumans 3auric acid 3adrugs 3anitrogen 3apolymerization 3aX-radiation 3acarbon nanotubes 3acolloids 3aelectrodes 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aelectrochemistry 3acarbon 3ascanning electron microscopy 3apH 3aspectroscopy 3aascorbic acid 0aGlycine 0aimpedance 0aMulti-walled carbon nanotube 0aElectropolymerization 0aDopamine 0aCarbon paste electrode1 aMascarenhas, Ronald J.1 aSwamy, B.E.

While MB1 and MB2, both consisting of 36 bases, differed only in the length of the linker for surface attachment, the significantly longer MB3, consisting of 56 bases, comprised an entirely different sequence. For sensor chip preparation, the MBs were chemisorbed on gold via thiol anchors together with different thiol spacers. The influence of important parameters, such as the length of the MBs, the length of the linker between the MBs and the gold surface, the length and nature of the thiol spacers, and the ratio between the MBs and the thiol spacers was studied. After hybridization with the target, the fluorophore of the longer MB3 was oriented close to the surface, and the shorter MBs were standing more or less upright, leading to a larger increase in fluorescence intensity. Fluorescence microscopy revealed a homogeneous distribution of the MBs on the surface. The sensor chips could be used for simple and fast detection of target molecules with a limit of detection in the larger picomolar range. The response time was between 5 and 20 min. Furthermore, it was possible to distinguish between fully complementary and singly mismatched targets. While rinsing with buffer solution after hybridization with target did not result in any signal decrease, complete dehybridization could be carried out by intense rinsing with pure water. The MB modified sensor chips could be prepared in a repeatable manner and reused many times without significant decrease in performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afluorescence microscopy 3afluorescent dyes 3agold 3ahybridization 3aoligonucleotides 3athiols1 aWesner, Daniel1 aSchönherr, Holger,1 aNöll, Gilbert0 tLangmuir.g2014 Dec. 02, v. 30, no. 47 p.14360-14367dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla504105x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01608naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245013000156300002000286520037600306592002800682650001600710650001200726650001500738650002000753650001300773700001800786700002200804700002400826700001900850700001500869700002100884700001800905700001600923700002100939700001400960700001700974773012400991856007401115852000901189655001201198IND60665063420221118071538.0190912e20140626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066506342DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra03669g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Jizhou10aElectrospun hybrid fibers with substantial filler contents formed through kinetically arrested phase separation in liquid jet  ap. 27683-27686.  aThis study reports polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS)-based hybrid fibers of architectural hierarchy and compositional heterogeneity.

These cells accumulated in extranodal tissues and gave rise to clonal tumors recapitulating the principal clinical, biological, and molecular genetic features of MALT lymphoma. Deletion of p53 gene accelerated tumor onset and induced transformation of MALT lymphoma to activated B-cell diffuse large-cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL). Treatment of MALT1-induced lymphomas with a specific inhibitor of MALT1 proteolytic activity decreased cell viability, indicating that endogenous Malt1 signaling was required for tumor cell survival. Our study shows that human-like lymphomas can be modeled in mice by targeting MALT1 expression to hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, demonstrating the oncogenic role of MALT1 in lymphomagenesis. Furthermore, this work establishes a molecular link between MALT lymphoma and ABC-DLBCL, and provides mouse models to test MALT1 inhibitors. Finally, our results suggest that hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells may be involved in the pathogenesis of human mature B-cell lymphomas.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aB-lymphocytes 3aanimal models 3acell viability 3achromosome translocation 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3alinkage (genetics) 3alymphoma 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3aoncogenes 3apathogenesis 3aproteolysis 3astem cells 3atissues 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0amolecular-directed therapy 0atransgenic mice 0acancer stem cells 0atumor reprogramming1 aFontán, Lorena1 aGonzalez-Herrero, Ines1 aRomero-Camarero, Isabel1 aSegura, Victor1 aAznar, M.

However, limited literature is available on the spatial distribution and trends of suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) in the sub-basins of UIB. This study covers the comparative assessment of flows and SSC trends measured at 13 stations in the UIB along with the variability of precipitation and temperatures possibly due to climate change for the past three decades. In the course of this period, the country’s largest reservoir, Tarbela, on the Indus River was depleted rapidly due to heavy sediment influx from the UIB. Sediment management of existing storage and future planned hydraulic structures (to tap 30,000 MW in the region) depends on the correct assessment of SSC, their variation patterns, and trends. In this study, the SSC trends are determined along with trends of discharges, precipitation, and temperatures using the non-parametric Mann–Kendall test and Sen’s slope estimator. The results reveal that the annual flows and SSC are in a balanced state for the Indus River at Besham Qila, whereas the SSC are significantly reduced ranging from 18.56%–28.20% per decade in the rivers of Gilgit at Alam Bridge, Indus at Kachura, and Brandu at Daggar. The SSC significantly increase ranging from 20.08%–40.72% per decade in the winter together with a significant increase of average air temperature. During summers, the SSC are decreased significantly ranging from 18.63%–27.79% per decade along with flows in the Hindukush and Western–Karakorum regions, which is partly due to the Karakorum climate anomaly, and in rainfall-dominated basins due to rainfall reduction. In Himalayan regions, the SSC are generally increased slightly during summers. These findings will be helpful for understanding the sediment trends associated with flow, precipitation, and temperature variations, and may be used for the operational management of current reservoirs and the design of several hydroelectric power plants that are planned for construction in the UIB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aair temperature 3abasins 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adesign 3aflow 3ahydraulic structures 3ahydroelectric power 3aliterature 3apower plants 3arain 3aresearch 3arivers 3asediments 3aspatial distribution 3aspatial variation 3astorage 3asummer 3asuspended sediment 3avariability 3awater 3awinter 3aHimalayan region 3aIndus River1 aKhurram Shahzad, Muhammad 1 aSeidel, Frank 1 aCosta, Anna 1 aNestmann, Franz 0 tWater.g2020 Mar. 06, v. 12, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120307303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245014800181520139800329592002801727650002401755650002201779650001501801650001501816650002301831650001501854650001401869650002101883650004101904650001401945650001801959650000701977650002101984650001602005650003302021650002502054650001502079650002002094653002402114653001902138653002002157653002002177653002102197700005802218700002402276700002302300700002002323773011802343856008602461852000902547655001202556IND60675551820221118235230.0201025e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067555182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1098022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGholizadeh, Amir Mohammad10aRemoval of Phenazopyridine from wastewater by merging biological and electrochemical methods via Azolla filiculoides and electro-Fenton process  aIn the present study, the potential of Azolla filiculoides (A. filiculoides) was first investigated for degradation of Phenazopyridine (PhP), an analgesic drug. The effects of main variables such as initial pharmaceutical concentration, amount of plant, and pH were studied on the efficiency of the biological process. It was observed that A. filiculoides was able to remove pharmaceuticals from contaminated water up to 85.90% during 48 h. Then, the electro-Fenton (EF) method was applied for further removal of PhP yielding a removal rate of about 98.72% under optimum conditions during 2 h. The effects of variables including the current, amount of catalyst, and pH were also studied in this phase. Also, the probability of adsorption was investigated during this step. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were performed for the used magnetite nanoparticles, total organic carbon (TOC) were performed to investigate PhP removal efficiency during the reaction time and Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were performed to analyze degradation byproducts of PhP. Based on the results, it was found that a combination of these bioremediation and electrochemical removal steps were capable of PhP removal from contaminated water. Therefore, this approach may be effective for phytoremediation of pharmaceutical-contaminated aquatic ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzolla filiculoides 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3aanalgesics 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abyproducts 3acatalysts 3aelectrochemistry 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3amagnetite 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aphytoremediation 3aprobability 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atotal organic carbon 3awastewater 3awater pollution 0aAzolla filiculoides 0aElectro-fenton 0aPharmaceuticals 0aPhenazopyridine 0aPhytoremediation1 aZarei, Mahmoud1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2668-01181 aEbratkhahan, Masoud1 aHasanzadeh, Aliyeh1 aVafaei, Fatemeh0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 254 p.109802-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1098023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245005900163300002000222520146600242592002801708650001001736650001501746650001201761650001901773650002201792650001201814650001201826650001201838650001301850650000901863650001801872650001101890650001101901650001201912650000901924650000901933650001401942650001201956650001501968650001101983650001301994650001102007650001402018650001502032650000902047650002302056650001302079650000902092700003002101773012402131856007402255852000902329655001202338IND60665063520221118071519.0190912e20140702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066506352DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra03673e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSen Gupta, Susmita10aAdsorption of metal ions by clays and inorganic solids  ap. 28537-28586.  aThis review deals with adsorption of metal ions, particularly those considered as hazardous, on clays and some inorganic solids and covers the publication years 2000–2013 describing and quantifying the use of isotherms to obtain the adsorption capacities of the solids. The inorganic solids in the review include clays and clay minerals, their modified forms (obtained by treatment with acids and alkalis, organic functionalization, etc.), zeolites, silica gel, soil, river sediment, activated alumina, inorganic polymers, red mud, inorganic oxides, fly ash, etc. The use of two parameter and three parameter linear isotherms are only discussed with a view to obtain quantitative description of adsorptive accumulation and separation of metal ions from aqueous solution on the solids. The extensively used isotherms are those of Freundlich, Langmuir, Dubinin–Radushkevich and Redlich–Peterson. How these isotherms are being used to obtain the adsorption capacities along with their interpretations form the bulk of the review. The review is divided into sections, each describing the use of a particular isotherm. The metal cations receiving immense importance in adsorption studies are As(iii)/As(v), Cd(ii), Cr(iii)/Cr(vi), Cu(ii), Co(ii), Pb(ii), Ni(ii), Hg(ii), and Zn(ii), and the review covers both the cationic and the anionic metal ions. A few other cations such as Mn(ii), Fe(iii), Se(v), which have not received much attention, are also covered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aadsorption 3aalkalis 3aaluminum oxide 3aaqueous solutions 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3acations 3achromium 3aclay 3aclay minerals 3acobalt 3acopper 3afly ash 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3amercury 3ametal ions 3anickel 3apolymers 3arivers 3asediments 3asilica gel 3asoil 3asorption isotherms 3azeolites 3azinc1 aBhattacharyya, Krishna G.0 tRSC advances.g2014 July 02, v. 4, no. 54 p.28537-28586dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra03673e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03545naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003100139245014900170500001400319520173000333592002802063650001102091650001502102650001802117650002202135650001602157650001602173650001302189650001302202650001102215650001202226650001602238650001602254650002102270650001502291650004202306650001502348650001402363650001302377650001102390650002502401650002102426650001502447650002502462650002102487651001002508700002902518700002202547700002802569700001702597700002702614700003102641700003302672700002402705773011902729856007402848852000902922655001202931IND60704437220221120035357.0200724e20200306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070443722DNAL7 a10.3390/w120307312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRenau-Pruñonosa, Arianna 10aIdentification of Aquifer Recharge Sources as the Origin of Emerging Contaminants in Intensive Agricultural Areas. La Plana de Castellón, Spain  aNAL-light  aIn urban, industrial, and agricultural areas, a vast array of contaminants may be found because they are introduced into the aquifers by different recharge sources. The emerging contaminants (ECs) correspond to unregulated contaminants, which may be candidates for future regulation depending on the results of research into their potential effects on health and on monitoring data regarding their occurrence. ECs frequently found in wastewater, such as acetaminophen, carbamazepine, primidone, and sulfamethoxazole, may be good indicators of the introduction of the reclaimed water to the aquifers. The resistance of the ECs to removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) causes them to be appropriate sewage markers. Plana de Castellón (Spain) is a coastal area that has been characterized by intensive citrus agriculture since the 1970s. Traditionally, in the southern sector of Plana de Castellón, 100% of irrigation water comes from groundwater. In recent years, local farmers have been using a mixture of groundwater and reclaimed water from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to irrigate the citrus. The aims of the present study were: (i) to assess the occurrences, spatial distributions, and concentrations of selected ECs, including 32 antibiotics, 8 UV filters, and 2 nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, in groundwater in a common agricultural context; (ii) to identify the recharge (pollution) sources acting as the origin of the ECs, and (iii) to suggest ECs as indicators of reclaimed water arrival in detrital heterogeneous aquifers. The obtained data provided relevant information for the management of water resources and elucidated the fate and behavior of emerging contaminants in similar contexts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aUV filters 3aacetaminophen 3aagricultural land 3aagriculture 3aantibiotics 3aaquifers 3abehavior 3acoasts 3afarmers 3agroundwater 3ainformation 3airrigation water 3amonitoring 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3aoccurrence 3apollution 3aresearch 3asewage 3aspatial distribution 3asulfamethoxazole 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater management 3aSpain1 aGarcía-Menéndez, Olga 1 aIbáñez, María 1 aVázquez-Suñé, Enric 1 aBoix, Clara 1 aBallesteros, Bruno  B.1 aHernández García, Marta 1 aMorell Evangelista, Ignacio,1 aHernández, Félix,0 tWater.g2020 Mar. 06, v. 12, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120307313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03407naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006800148245011000216300001100326500001400337520172000351592002802071650001602099650001502115650001602130650001302146650001802159650001802177650001802195650001602213650001602229650001302245650002502258650001502283650002602298650002402324650001002348650002002358650002302378650001002401650004202411650001402453650002502467650001502492650001202507650002302519650001802542651001002560700002502570700002302595773013102618856008302749852000902832655001202841IND60709269120221120205040.0201215e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070926912DNAL7 a10.1186/s13213-020-01595-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEltayeb, Mohamed Mutasim1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7178-227110aPyrosequencing scrutiny of bacterial and fungal communities in two Sudanese sorghum-based fermented foods  ap. 53.  aNAL-light  aPURPOSE: Several fermented foods are produced from sorghum flour in Africa, especially in the dryland regions where it is the principal crop. It is important to explore the microbial communities in these foods to improve their quality and organoleptic properties. In this study, the bacterial and fungal communities of two popular sorghum-based fermented foods in Sudan (kisra and hulumur) were analyzed, for the first time, using a culture-independent method of next-generation sequencing. METHODS: Fermented doughs for kisra and hulumur production were prepared according to the traditional approach, and then the bacterial and fungal communities were investigated using high-throughput sequencing. RESULTS: Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla were the predominant bacteria in both fermented doughs. At the genus level, the bacterial community was dominated by lactic acid bacteria, primarily Lactobacillus and Pediococcus, which represented 95.7% and 72% of the bacterial population in kisra and hulumur, respectively. Next, acetic acid bacteria (Gluconobacter and Acetobacter) were subdominant in hulumur. The fungal community was more heterogeneous among the fermented doughs. Zygomycota (85.5%) comprised the major phylum in kisra fermented dough, whereas Ascomycota (99.5%) was predominant in hulumur. The major fungal genera, Rhizopus, Alternaria, Penicillium, Gibberella, Lasiodiplodia, and Aspergillus, were extremely varied between the fermented doughs. CONCLUSION: Exploration of kisra and hulumur microbial community structure will expand the knowledge about their microbiota to manipulate the microbial community and improve their quality and organoleptic properties using different microbial recipes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcetobacter 3aAlternaria 3aAspergillus 3aFusarium 3aGluconobacter 3aLactobacillus 3aLasiodiplodia 3aPediococcus 3aPenicillium 3aRhizopus 3aacetic acid bacteria 3aarid lands 3abacterial communities 3acommunity structure 3adough 3afermented foods 3afungal communities 3afungi 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aknowledge 3alactic acid bacteria 3apopulation 3arecipes 3asensory properties 3asorghum flour 3aSudan1 aEltigani, Sara Ahmed1 aTaniguchi, Takeshi0 tAnnals of microbiology.g2020 Dec., v. 70, no. 1 p.53-53dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl62868x1590-42617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13213-020-01595-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01281naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245011400160506002800274520030400302592002800606506003700634650001400671650001400685650001300699650001600712700001800728700001700746773012800763856007900891852000900970655001200979IND60784951520221207094122.0190722s2001    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078495152DNAL7 a10.5281/zenodo.33338682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSobko, V.G.10aAdaptive polymorphism of growthes and juvenile individuals of irises of a section Limniris Tausch (Iridaceae)  aResource is Open Access  aThe ontogenetic features of growthes and juvenile individuals of some species of a genus Iris L.

As far as we know, this work is the first to report the use of multiple white-rot fungi species for degrading a binary mixture of anionic dyes under solid state fermentation (SSF) conditions and a further physicochemical characterization of the residual biomass. First, eight white-rot fungi decolorized the dye mixture of brilliant blue FCF and allura red AC adsorbed onto corncob, reaching decolorizations between 11.47% and 87.64%. Then, I. lacteus, B. adusta and T. versicolor, based on the decolorization yield, were selected to evaluate the effect of carbon:nitrogen ratio, moisture content and inoculum quantity on the decolorization percentage. The factorial designs showed that C:N ratio had a negative effect while moisture and inoculum quantity a positive effect. In terms of the kinetics, the three white-rot fungi achieved their maximum decolorization level, around 80.11–86.04%, after 10-12 days. I. lacteus exhibited the highest decolorization percentage, even though only the enzyme manganese peroxidase was detected, with a maximum activity of 6.62 U gds⁻¹ at day 14. Besides, T. versicolor was the only species with laccase activity, with a maximum of 15.94 U gds⁻¹ at day 6 of fermentation. The physicochemical characterization of the biomass allowed to conclude that these aggregates represent a potential organic amendment, as for their significant oxidizable organic carbon (more than 9.5% on wet basis) and essential nutrients content, as well as for their low ash content (less than 1% on wet basis). Finally, for outlining an efficient bioremediation cycle, a cheap and effective methodology for drying the biomass at the end of the SSF process is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aash content 3aazo dyes 3abiomass 3abioremediation 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acorn cobs 3adecolorization 3adrying 3aenzyme activity 3ainoculum 3alaccase 3amanganese peroxidase 3anutrients 3aorganic carbon 3aorganic soils 3aphysicochemical properties 3apollution 3asoil amendments 3asolid state fermentation 3awater content 3awhite-rot fungi 0aWhite-rot fungi 0aSynthetic dye decolorization 0aAdsorption 0aSolid state fermentation 0aLigninolytic enzymes 0aSoil amendment1 aMejía-Otálvaro, Felipe1 aVelásquez-Quintero, Carolina1 aHormaza-Anaguano, Angelina0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 254 p.109805-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1098053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02036naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011400169300001600283520080800299592002801107650002501135650001701160650001401177650001001191650001601201650002101217650001901238650001401257650001101271650001701282650001001299650002001309653002601329653002501355653001701380773014601397856008601543852000901629655001201638IND60709755020221118071055.0200908e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070975502DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-0163.2017.00006.42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeant Singh,10aChemical intervention in Stored Wheat protects Rhizopertha dominica (F.) damage without affecting seed health  ap. 259-262.  aSignificantly lower seed damage was observed in emamectin benzoate as compared to all other treatments.

Herein, a novel Fe₃O₄ impregnated graphene oxide (Fe₃O₄@GO)-activated persulfate system (Fe₃O₄@GO+K₂S₂O₈) was synthesized by following a sustainable protocol and was tested on real wastewater containing dye pollutants. In the presence of the PS-activated system, the degradation efficiency of Rhodamine B (RhB) was significantly increased to a level of ≍95% compared with that of Fe₃O₄ (≍25%). The influences of different operational parameters, including solution pH, persulfate dosage, and RhB concentration, were systemically evaluated. This system maintained its catalytic activity and durability with a negligible amount of iron leached during successive recirculation experiments. The degradation intermediates were further identified through reactive oxygen species (ROS) studies, where surface-bound SO₄⁻ was found to be dominant radical for RhB degradation. Moreover, the degradation mechanism of RhB in the Fe₃O₄@GO+K₂S₂O₈ system was discussed. Finally, the results indicate that the persulfate-activated Fe₃O₄@GO catalyst provided an effective pathway for the degradation of dye pollutants in real wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adegradation 3adosage 3adurability 3adyes 3agraphene oxide 3airon 3apH 3apollutants 3aprotocols 3areactive oxygen species 3arhodamines 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater 3awater purification1 aHe, Wei 1 aZarra, T.,1 aNaddeo, V.,1 aZhao, Yaping 0 tWater.g2020 Mar. 07, v. 12, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120307333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245023200167300001600399500001900415520163900434592002802073650003002101650001502131650001202146651001802158653001302176653001602189653002202205653002902227653002802256653001302284653001602297653001402313653002802327700002002355700002402375773011502399856007702514852000902591655001202600IND60709269420221120205233.0200905s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070926942DNAL7 a10.1139/cjz-2019-02612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartynov, Alexander12aA 50-year conundrum is conclusively solved: nudibranchs Dendronotus albus (= D. diversicolor) and Dendronotus robilliardi are valid species with compelling evidence from type materials, bibliographic sources, and molecular data  ap. 623-632.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA persistent confusion in the identification of two similar species of nudibranch molluscs of the genus Dendronotus Alder and Hancock, 1845, which inhabit shallow Canadian, Russian, and US waters of the northern Pacific Ocean, has caused a considerable taxonomic conundrum for over 50 years. In this study, we present compelling evidence for the first time, including morphological and molecular data as well as a study of type materials, to definitively conclude that Dendronotus albus MacFarland, 1966 was misidentified in the publication of G.A. Robilliard (1970; Veliger, 12: 433–479). This caused the long-term incorrect application of the characters of the real D. albus sensu F.M. MacFarland (1966; Mem. Calif. Acad. Sci. 6: 1–546) (which is still circulated in the literature) to a completely different, though externally similar, species incorrectly named “D. albus” in G.A. Robilliard (1970; Veliger, 12: 433–479). This species was properly described only 3 years ago as Dendronotus robilliardi Korshunova, Sanamyan, Zimina, Fletcher and Martynov, 2016. Using multiple evidence in this study, we firmly conclude that D. robilliardi is a well-supported valid species, whereas “Dendronotus diversicolor” Robilliard, 1970 is a junior synonym of D. albus. We also present rare bibliographic materials that shed light on the source of the misidentification of these species and also confirm the designation of the lectotype for D. albus. Biogeographical data, which are important for conservation and ecological studies, are also presented for D. albus and D. robilliardi in the Canadian and American Pacific Ocean.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageographical distribution 3alectotypes 3azoology 3aPacific Ocean 0amolluscs 0anudibranchs 0aDendronotus albus 0aDendronotus diversicolor 0aDendronotus robilliardi 0ataxonomy 0asystematics 0aphylogeny 0abiological nomenclature1 aFletcher, Karin1 aKorshunova, Tatiana0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2020, v. 98, no. 9 p.623-632dNRC Research PresswJournal:19146x1480-32837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2019-02613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01834naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008300167300001600250520092500266592002801191650000801219650001301227650002001240650002001260650001501280650001201295650001901307700002001326773011701346856004801463852000901511655001201520IND50071755520221118025636.0140325e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007175552DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-006-9397-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Chung-Yi12aA Numerical and Experimental Study of Pollutant Dispersion in a Traffic Tunnel  ap. 289-299.  aThree-dimensional turbulent flow and dispersion of gaseous pollutants carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in a road tunnel was modeled using the standard k–ε turbulence model and solved numerically using the finite volume method. Vehicle emissions were estimated from the measured traffic flow rates and modeled as banded line sources along the tunnel floor. The effects of fan ventilation and piston effect of moving vehicles on the airflow and pollutant dilution were examined. The numerical results reveal that a peak velocity exists near the tunnel floor due to the piston effect of vehicles. The cross-sectional concentrations of air pollutants are non-uniformly distributed and concentrations rise with downstream distance. The piston effect of vehicles can alone provide 25%–34% dilution of air pollutants in the tunnel, compounded 43%–70% dilution effect according to the ventilation condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair flow 3acarbon monoxide 3anitrogen oxides 3apollutants 3atraffic 3aturbulent flow1 aChung, Pei-Ling0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2007 July, v. 130, no. 1-3 p.289-299dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-006-9397-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002500186245004600211300002000257506007600277520154100353592002801894506003701922650002301959650001201982650001001994650000902004650001202013650001802025650001302043650001102056653003302067653002902100653001802129700002402147700002302171700002502194700002202219700001902241773017602260856007902436852000902515655001202524IND60172144820221207083459.0150602e20120626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017214482DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12053331092doi7 aPMC33870572pmcid7 a226914982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDebets, Alfons J.

Prions have also been found in fungi, but studies on their role in nature are scarce. The proposed biological function of fungal prions is debated and varies from detrimental to benign or even beneficial. [Het-s] is a prion of the fungus Podospora anserina . The het-s locus exists as two antagonistic alleles that constitute an allorecognition system: the het-s allele encoding the protein variant capable of prion formation and the het-S allele encoding a protein variant that cannot form a prion. We document here that het-s alleles, capable of prion formation, are nearly twice as frequent as het-S alleles in a natural population of 112 individuals. Then, we report a 92% prevalence of [Het-s] prion infection among the het-s isolates and find evidence of the role of the [Het-s] /het-S allorecognition system on the incidence of infection by a deleterious senescence plasmid. We explain the het-s/het-S allele ratios by the existence of two selective forces operating at different levels. We propose that during the somatic stage, the role of [Het-s]/HET-S in allorecognition leads to frequency-dependent selection for which an equilibrated frequency would be optimal. However, in the sexual cycle, the [Het-s] prion causes meiotic drive favoring the het-s allele. Our findings indicate that [Het-s] is a selected and, therefore, widespread prion whose activity as selfish genetic element is counteracted by balancing selection for allorecognition polymorphism.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPodospora anserina 3aalleles 3afungi 3aloci 3amammals 3ameiotic drive 3aplasmids 3aprions 0aheterokaryon incompatibility 0aself/nonself recognition 0aspore killing1 aDalstra, Henk J.

This is the tenth species within the genus. The new species is distinguishable from other congeners by the combination of the following features: (1) female second maxillipedal segment with 3 acutely pointed processes terminally; (2) female leg 4 endopod as long as or slightly longer than exopod; (3) male maxilliped with a small, acutely pointed process at subterminal corner of the first segment and a row of relatively coarse spinules along the inner margin of the second segment. The present study most probably implies a high species diversity of Paramacrochiron in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-West Pacific region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyclopoida 3afemales 3amales 3anew species 3aspecies diversity 3aVietnam 0aMedusae 0aParamacrochiron 0aparasitic copepod 0aVersuriga anadyoneme1 aHa, Tran Manh1 aThu, Pham The0 tCrustaceana.g, v. 93, no. 1 p.111-123dBrillwJournal:21399x0011-216X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685403-000039653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02305naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245007900164300001400243506002800257520109200285592002801377506003701405650001101442650001901453650002701472650001401499651000901513653001901522653001501541653002401556653002401580700002801604700002801632700001801660700001901678773012601697856007501823852000901898655001201907IND60784951920221207094125.0190220e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078495192DNAL7 a10.5209/MBOT.595742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTalebi, Seyed Mehdi10aTrichomes morphology and density analysis in some "Nepeta" species of Iran  ap. 51-62.  aResource is Open Access  a<p><em>Nepeta </em>are widely distributed worldwide and in different parts of Iran where seventy-nine species were registered.

The ridge-furrow maize system with plastic mulch (RFPM) is a widely used measure to increase crop yield in the Loess Plateau area. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the RFPM on soil water and inorganic nitrogen (N) distribution, especially with regard to the risk and dynamic of nitrogen losses, by using Hydrus-2D. The study was conducted over two consecutive years and consisted of two treatments: (i) the RFPM with the split application of nitrogen in 2013 (160 + 60 kg N ha⁻¹, sowing and jointing stage) and (ii) the RFPM with a one-time fertilizer in 2014 (220 kg N ha⁻¹, sowing stage). The results showed that the dynamic of soil water and nitrogen was clearly illustrated by Hydrus-2D, especially with regard to the nitrogen losses and utilization. The RFPM improved soil water consumption in both the ridge and the furrow; the soil water content was obviously fluctuating during the maize growing season, and the degree of fluctuation decreased as the depth increased. The soil NH4+-N concentration was mainly accumulated in the surface soil layer +15–10 cm; the highest NH4+-N concentrations were 69.12 and 104.62 mg·kg⁻¹ in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The highest NO3−-N concentrations were 130.86 and 198.20 mg·kg⁻¹ in 2013 and 2014, respectively. There was an exchange of NO3−-N between the ridge and the furrow when urea was applied in the furrow. The one-time fertilizer caused a high risk of NH₃ volatilization; they were 20.40 and 27.41 kg N ha⁻¹ in 2013 and 2014, respectively, which accounted for 9.27% and 12.46% of the N fertilizer inputs in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The rate of nitrite leaching was higher in the furrow than the ridge. However, a proper ratio of the split application of nitrogen would contribute to the NO3−-N leaching reduction; the NO3−-N leaching amounts were 18.13 and 31.26 kg N ha⁻¹, which accounted for 8.24% and 14.21% of the N fertilizer inputs in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Our study indicates, therefore, that the RFPM with a split application of nitrogen would be more effective for the nitrogen losses; the RFPM is a suitable system for agriculture in the rain-fed area of the Loess Plateau, with the benefits of water-use efficiency and non-point source pollution reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecosystems 3aammonium nitrogen 3acorn 3acrop yield 3afurrows 3aland 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anonpoint source pollution 3aplastic film mulches 3arisk 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asplit application 3aurea 3avolatilization 3awater use efficiency 3aChina1 aQiao, Ruiquan 1 aJiang, Rui 0 tLand.g2022 Sept. 08, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land110915143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03629naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012200167300001400289520189300303592002802196650002502224650002602249650002202275650002102297650001902318650001702337650001402354650001202368650002002380650001802400650001802418650002002436650001302456650002202469650001802491650002102509650001002530653001902540653002202559653001202581653001002593653001202603700001402615700001302629700001702642700001302659700001602672700001402688700001802702700005702720700005502777773011202832856008602944852000903030655001203039IND60681491220221120105727.0200405e20200410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068149122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.01.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSi, Xinghui10aHypoxia-sensitive supramolecular nanogels for the cytosolic delivery of ribonuclease A as a breast cancer therapeutic  ap. 83-95.  aAs the most common malignancy in women, breast cancer causes >40,000 deaths annually. Ribonuclease A (RNase), a new anti-cancer agent, has attracted intense interest due to its high efficacy and specificity. However, RNase suffers from instability, a short half-life in the circulation and poor membrane penetration. To overcome these challenges, we designed a supramolecular nanogel for the cytosolic delivery of RNase. The nanogels were fabricated using host–guest interactions between azobenzene (Azo) and β-cyclodextrin (βCD) conjugated to poly (L-glutamic acid)-graft-poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether (PLG-g-mPEG). RNase could be loaded inside the nanogels in mild aqueous conditions. Following optimization, the RNase-loading content and efficiency of the nanogel were 23.5 wt% and 50.4%, respectively. In the presence of nitroreductase (NTR), the cross-linking point between Azo and βCD was destroyed due to the conformation transition of Azo, ensuring the hypoxia-sensitive release of cargo from the nanogels in tumors in which NTR is overexpressed. In vitro release profiles revealed that 75.0% of the RNase was released under hypoxic conditions in 72 h, whilst only 19.7% was released under normoxic conditions. Cytotoxicity assays showed that the RNase-loaded nanogels (nano-RNase) were more efficient in inhibiting the proliferation of 4T1 cells than free RNase. In vivo studies showed 68.7% tumor suppression rates (TSR %) in the nano-RNase treated group, whilst free RNase treatment led to a lack of tumor inhibition. To further enhance the hypoxia status of tumors, we combined nano-RNase with a nanoformulation of vascular disrupting agents PLG-g-mPEG/combretastatinA4 (nano-CA4) and obtained a TSR of 91.7%. The hypoxia-sensitive supramolecular nanogels provided a versatile platform for the delivery of RNase, highlighting its applicability for cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic conditions 3aantineoplastic agents 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3abreast neoplasms 3acancer therapy 3acrosslinking 3ahalf life 3ahypoxia 3ain vivo studies 3amethyl ethers 3ananoparticles 3anitroreductases 3anormoxia 3apolyglutamic acid 3aribonucleases 3atoxicity testing 3awomen 0aSupramolecular 0aHypoxia-sensitive 0aNanogel 0aRNase 0aProtein1 aMa, Sheng1 aXu, Yudi1 aZhang, Dawei1 aShen, Na1 aYu, Haiyang1 aZhang, Yu1 aSong, Wantong1 aTang, Zhaohui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4726-43051 aChen, Xuesi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3542-92560 tJournal of controlled release.g2020 Apr. 10, v. 320 p.83-95dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.01.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02536naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245010400177300001600281520098800297592002801285650001201313650001601325650001901341650002701360650001401387650001701401650000901418650001801427650002101445650003101466650002601497650002001523650001501543650001601558650001401574653003801588653001001626653002101636653001201657653001201669700002701681700001701708700003001725700001801755700001601773700002101789773010001810856008701910852000901997655001202006IND60525938220221119211015.0190402e20160101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052593822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.05.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNúñez-Sánchez, N.10aNear Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) for the determination of the milk fat fatty acid profile of goats  ap. 244-252.  aMilk fatty acid (FA) composition is important for the goat dairy industry because of its influence on cheese properties and human health.

NIRS analysis of milk samples allowed to estimate FA contents and their ratios and indexes in fat with high precision and accuracy. In general, transflectance analysis gave better or similar results than reflectance mode. Interestingly, NIRS analysis allowed direct prediction of the Atherogenicity and Thrombogenicity indexes, which are useful for the interpretation of the nutritional value of goat milk. Therefore, the calibrations obtained in the present work confirm the viability of NIRS as a fast, reliable and effective analytical method to provide nutritional information of milk samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3acheeses 3adairy goats 3adairy industry 3afatty acid composition 3agoat milk 3ahuman health 3amilk 3amilk analysis 3amilk fatty acids 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3anutrition information 3anutritive value 3aprediction 3areflectance 3aviability 0aNear Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) 0aGoats 0aMilk fatty acids 0aOmega 3 0aOmega 61 aMartínez-Marín, A.L.1 aPolvillo, O.1 aFernández-Cabanás, V.M.1 aCarrizosa, J.1 aUrrutia, B.1 aSerradilla, J.M.0 tFood chemistry.g2016 Jan. 01, v. 190 p.244-252dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.05.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001200142245009400154520140400248592002801652650002201680650002201702650001101724650001701735651001001752700001801762700001701780773011901797856007701916852000901993655001202002IND60794240120221116180545.0220922e20220908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079424012DNAL7 a10.3390/land110915152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xi 10aDoes Economic Growth Lead to an Increase in Cultivated Land Pressure? Evidence from China  aWith economic growth, people’s living standards improve, and more cultivated land is needed to meet food demand. Meanwhile, the economic growth and urban expansion in China since 1978 has led to the loss of considerable amounts of cultivated land. Thus, the contradiction between “economic growth” and “food security” becomes increasingly prominent. Studying the impact of economic growth on cultivated land population support pressure is the basis for easing this problem. This study uses the cultivated land pressure index to represent cultivated land population support pressure, and explores the relationship between economic growth and cultivated land pressure based on the panel data of 31 provinces in China from 2000 to 2017. The feasibility generalized least squares estimation and the fixed effect model based on Driscoll and Kraay standard errors are used. The results show that: (1) the impact of economic growth on cultivated land pressure is an N-shaped or U-shaped curve; and (2) there are regional differences in the impact of economic growth on cultivated land pressure. The cultivated land pressure in economically developed regions and main grain production regions responds slowly to the impact of economic growth. Therefore, some policy recommendations are put forward, such as paying attention to cultivated land protection and controlling disorderly urban expansion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aurbanization 3aChina1 aWang, Yajuan 1 aZhu, Hongbo 0 tLand.g2022 Sept. 08, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land110915153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03690naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245014700199300001800346500002000364520154200384592002801926596004801954596005702002650001602059650002402075650001202099650001302111650001502124650001102139650001502150650000902165650002102174650002202195650001302217650001502230650002702245650002202272650002002294650002502314650001102339651002802350651001902378651001102397651001302408700006602421700006002487700005702547700002702604700002302631700002202654700005602676700006802732700006402800773013002864856007302994852000903067655001203076IND60747601820221120201436.0210816e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074760182DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.133602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKloch, Agnieszka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0086-157810aHigh genetic diversity of immunity genes in an expanding population of a highly mobile carnivore, the grey wolf Canis lupus, in Central Europe  ap. 1680-1695.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: The aim of the study was to assess the effect of changes in population size and migration on variation in functional immunity genes in the previously bottlenecked population of the grey wolf, Canis lupus. LOCATION: Eastern/Central Europe: Poland, Czechia, Slovakia. METHODS: We genotyped 7 immunity genes: three MHC‐DLA genes (dog leukocyte antigen) and four Toll‐like receptor (TLR) genes among 130 wolves originating from three populations: two lowland (Baltic and Central European), and highland Carpathian. We contrasted the population structure in immunity genes with a neutral structure based on 13 microsatellites, and we analysed signatures of selection in the immunity loci. RESULTS: We found high overall genetic variance in immunity genes and no evidence for decreased diversity in the recently established populations. The population structure in immunity loci was weak, with pairwise FST lower than for neutral markers. Although the results of neutrality tests were not significant, we identified codons under selection, both positive and negative. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that despite recent population expansion which is expected to result in decreased genetic diversity, the diversity of immunity genes in the newly established wolf population is similar to those in the source population. This suggests that migrations do not cause allele loss in grey wolf. Signatures of selection on codon level, but not in tests using allele frequencies, suggest the contrasting effects of demography and selection.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019/35/O/NZ8/01550cNarodowe Centrum Nauki  a129/UD/SKILLS/2015cFundacja na rzecz Nauki Polskiej 3aCanis lupus 3aToll-like receptors 3aalleles 3aantigens 3acarnivores 3acodons 3ademography 3adogs 3agenetic variance 3agenetic variation 3aimmunity 3aleukocytes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation growth 3apopulation size 3apopulation structure 3awolves 3aCentral European region 3aCzech Republic 3aPoland 3aSlovakia1 aBiedrzycka, Aleksandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5096-27671 aSzewczyk, Maciej1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7424-11201 aNowak, Sabina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7771-80321 aNiedźwiedzka, Natalia1 aKłodawska, Monika1 aHájková, Andrea1 aHulva, Pavel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4968-48591 aJędrzejewska, Bogumiła1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9652-09531 aW.

Thus, it is desirable to develop and analyze promoters that support glutamatergic-specific expression. The three vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) are found in different populations of neurons, and VGLUT1 is the predominant VGLUT in the neocortex, hippocampus, and cerebellar cortex. We previously reported on a plasmid (amplicon) Herpes Simplex Virus vector that contains a VGLUT1 promoter. This vector supports long-term expression in VGLUT1-containing glutamatergic neurons in rat postrhinal (POR) cortex, but does not support expression in VGLUT2-containing glutamatergic neurons in the ventral medial hypothalamus. This VGLUT1 promoter contains both the VGLUT1 upstream promoter and the VGLUT1 first intron. In this study, we begin to isolate and analyze the glutamatergic-specific regulatory elements in this VGLUT1 promoter. We show that the VGLUT1 upstream promoter and first intron each support glutamatergic-specific expression. We isolated a small, basal VGLUT1 promoter that does not support glutamatergic-specific expression. Next, we fused either the VGLUT1 upstream promoter or the first intron to this basal promoter. The VGLUT1 upstream promoter or the first intron, fused to the basal promoter, each supported glutamatergic-specific expression in POR cortex.  aPublisher supplied data 3acortex 3agene transfer 3aglutamic acid 3aherpes simplex 3ahippocampus 3ahypothalamus 3aintrons 3aneocortex 3aneurons 3aplasmids 3arats 3atransporters 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aCell Line 2aCerebral Cortexxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aCricetinae 2aGene Expression Regulationxgenetics 2aGenetic Vectorsxgenetics 2aGlutamic Acidxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aIntronsxgenetics 2aMale 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aRats 2aRats, Long-Evans 2aSimplexvirusxgenetics 2aVesicular Glutamate Transport Protein 1xbiosynthesisxgenetics.1 aLi, Xu1 aCao, Haiyan1 aZhao, Hua1 aGeller, Alfred I.0 tBrain research.g2011 Mar. 4, v. 1377 p.1-12dElsevier B.V.x0006-89937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2010.12.0403Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245014000164300001600304520098900320592002801309650000901337650002801346650001801374650001101392650002601403650000901429650001501438650001301453650002801466650001601494650001201510653000801522653000701530653000801537653000901545653001201554653000801566653000701574653000701581653000801588653000801596653000801604653002601612653001401638653001801652653001701670653001201687653001801699700001301717700001401730700001701744700001801761700001601779700001501795773010001810856008701910852000901997655001202006IND60525938320221119211016.0190402e20160101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052593832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.05.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Fei10aFeasibility of combining spectra with texture data of multispectral imaging to predict heme and non-heme iron contents in pork sausages  ap. 142-149.  aTo precisely determine heme and non-heme iron contents in meat product, the feasibility of combining spectral with texture features extracted from multispectral imaging data (405–970nm) was assessed. In our study, spectra and textures of 120 pork sausages (PSs) treated by different temperatures (30–80°C) were analyzed using different calibration models including partial least squares regression (PLSR) and LIB support vector machine (Lib-SVM) for predicting heme and non-heme iron contents in PSs. Based on a combination of spectral and textural features, optimized PLSR models were obtained with determination coefficient (R2) of 0.912 for heme and of 0.901 for non-heme iron prediction, which demonstrated the superiority of combining spectra with texture data. Results of satisfactory determination and visualization of heme and non-heme iron contents indicated that multispectral imaging could serve as a feasible approach for online industrial applications in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheme 3aindustrial applications 3aleast squares 3amodels 3amultispectral imagery 3apork 3aprediction 3asausages 3asupport vector machines 3atemperature 3atexture 0aMSI 0aPS 0aPSs 0aPLSR 0aLib-SVM 0aROI 0aR2 0aSE 0aSEC 0aSEP 0aSPA 0aMultispectral imaging 0aHeme iron 0aNon-heme iron 0aPork sausage 0aTexture 0aVisualization1 aQin, Hao1 aShi, Kefu1 aZhou, Cunliu1 aChen, Conggui1 aHu, Xiaohua1 aZheng, Lei0 tFood chemistry.g2016 Jan. 01, v. 190 p.142-149dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.05.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245014900158300001800307500002000325520143100345592002801776650001901804650001301823650001701836650002501853650001701878650002601895650001701921650001201938650001001950650001101960650002301971650002601994650001302020700002202033700002002055700003002075773013002105856007302235852000902308655001202317IND60571409920221120163805.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057140992DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.80852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSenica, Mateja14aThe higher the better? Differences in phenolics and cyanogenic glycosides in Sambucus nigra leaves, flowers and berries from different altitudes  ap. 2623-2632.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Elderberry (Sambucus nigra L.) possesses high antioxidant activity and has been used to treat numerous medicinal disorders. In addition to their antioxidant properties, elderberry parts accumulate toxic cyanogenic glycosides (CGG). It has been proven that altitude influences the biosynthesis of many secondary metabolites. In the present study we investigated the change of phenolics and CGG in elder leaves, flowers, and berries induced by different altitudes and locations. RESULTS: The data indicate that the accumulation of CGG and phenolics is affected by the altitude of the growing site. An increase of anthocyanin content was recorded in elder berries collected at higher elevations in both locations. Fruit collected at the foothills of location 2 contained 3343 µg g⁻¹ anthocyanins as opposed to fruit from the hilltop, which contained 7729 µg g⁻¹. Elder berries contained the lowest levels of harmful CGG compared to other analysed plant parts. However, more cyanogenic glycosides were always present in plant parts collected at the hilltop. Accordingly, berries accumulated 0.11 µg g⁻¹ CGG at the foothills and 0.59 µg g⁻¹ CGG at the hilltop. CONCLUSION: Elder berries and flowers collected at the foothill were characterised by the lowest levels of both beneficial (phenolics) and harmful compounds (CGG) and are suitable for moderate consumption. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aSambucus nigra 3aaltitude 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3abiosynthesis 3acyanogenic glycosides 3aelderberries 3aflowers 3ahills 3aleaves 3aphenolic compounds 3asecondary metabolites 3atoxicity1 aŠtampar, Franci,1 aVeberic, Robert1 aMikulic‐Petkovsek, Maja0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2017 June, v. 97, no. 8 p.2623-2632dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.80853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245010500175300001600280520112200296592002801418650001201446650001201458650001101470650001401481650001201495650001301507650001101520650001101531650002001542650001701562650001301579650000901592650001401601650001401615650001101629650001301640650001301653650001101666650001301677650000901690653001201699653001001711653001301721653001401734653001301748653001201761653001101773653001201784653001101796653001301807653001101820653001401831653001101845653000901856653001301865653001401878653001301892653001201905653001301917653000901930700002101939700002301960700001801983700001802001700002602019773012102045856008102166852000902247655001202256IND60567965520221122063626.0190318e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056796552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2017.04.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrewnowska, Małgorzata10aLeaching of arsenic and sixteen metallic elements from Amanita fulva mushrooms after food processing  ap. 861-866.  aThe leaching of arsenic and fifteen metallic elements from freshly collected caps of Amanita fulva Fr. fruiting bodies as a result of food processing was investigated. The caps were respectively dried, deep frozen, blanched and pickled. No previous data were available on impact of pickling with vinegar on fate of heavy metals accumulated in flesh by mushrooms. Blanching highly (57–86%) decreased concentration of As, Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Rb and Tl, and less (24–40%) of Ba, Cr, U and Zn, while it did not decrease the concentration of Ag and Sr. In comparison with the blanched caps, pickling of the caps of A. fulva in a solution of vinegar decreased by 60–87% the concentrations of Cd, Mn, Pb, Rb, Tl and Zn, and by 11–26% those of As, Cu and Ni. In parallel, pickling caused an increase in the level of Ag. Pickled caps of A. fulva, in comparison with fresh caps, showed very high (>80–99%) reductions of As, Cd, Mn, Pb, Rb, Tl and Zn, and also high (56–72%) reductions of Co, Cu and Ni, while Ba and Cr decreased at a smaller rate (7.5–14%). However, pickled caps were richer, at 90%, in Ag.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmanita 3aarsenic 3abarium 3ablanching 3acadmium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3afruiting bodies 3aheavy metals 3aleaching 3alead 3amanganese 3amushrooms 3anickel 3apickling 3arubidium 3asilver 3avinegars 3azinc 0aCooking 0aFungi 0aMinerals 0aMushrooms 0aPickling 0aArsenic 0aBarium 0aCadmium 0aCobalt 0aChromium 0aCopper 0aManganese 0aNickel 0aLead 0aRubidium 0aStrontium 0aThallium 0aUranium 0aVanadium 0aZinc1 aFalandysz, Jerzy1 aChudzińska, Maria1 aHanć, Anetta1 aSaba, Martyna1 aBarałkiewicz, Danuta0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2017 Oct., v. 84 p.861-866dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2017.04.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011900169300001800288500001900306520135300325592002801678596002101706596002001727596001901747650002501766650002201791650001201813650001101825650001301836650001401849650001501863650001401878650002501892650000701917650001401924650001501938650002201953651001501975700006401990700002002054700001802074700002202092700001902114700001602133700002402149700002302173700001902196700002002215700002202235773013802257856008202395852000902477655001202486IND60719746820221119092545.0201205e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071974682DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-019-01367-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoersma, Alje S.10aAlienimonas californiensis gen. nov. sp. nov., a novel Planctomycete isolated from the kelp forest in Monterey Bay  ap. 1751-1766.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPlanctomycetes are environmentally and biotechnologically important bacteria and are often found in association with nutrient-rich (marine) surfaces. To allow a more comprehensive understanding of planctomycetal lifestyle and physiology we aimed at expanding the collection of axenic cultures with new isolates. Here, we describe the isolation and genomic and physiological characterisation of strain CA12ᵀ obtained from giant bladder kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) in Monterey Bay, California, USA. 16S rRNA gene sequence and whole genome-based phylogenetic analysis showed that strain CA12ᵀ clusters within the family Planctomycetaceae and that it has a high 16S rRNA sequence similarity (82.3%) to Planctomicrobium piriforme DSM 26348ᵀ. The genome of strain CA12ᵀ has a length of 5,475,215 bp and a G+C content of 70.1%. The highest growth rates were observed at 27 °C and pH 7.5. Using different microscopic methods, we could show that CA12ᵀ is able to divide by consecutive polar budding, without completing a characteristic planctomycetal lifestyle switch. Based on our data, we suggest that the isolated strain represents a novel species within a novel genus. We thus propose the name Alienimonas gen. nov. with Alienimonas californiensis sp. nov. as type species of the novel genus and CA12ᵀ as type strain of the novel species.  aPublisher supplied data  aKA 4967/1-1cDFG  aJO 893/4-1cDFG  aALWOP.308cNWO 3aMacrocystis pyrifera 3aPlanctomycetaceae 3abladder 3agenome 3agenomics 3alifestyle 3amacroalgae 3anew genus 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3aphylogeny 3aphysiology 3asequence homology 3aCalifornia1 aKallscheuer, Nicolai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4925-69231 aWiegand, Sandra1 aRast, Patrick1 aPeeters, Stijn H.1 aMesman, Rob J.1 aHeuer, Anja1 aBoedeker, Christian1 aJetten, Mike S.

In this context, connecting the ultrafast optical response of nanoobjects to the correct thermal pathways is of paramount importance. We developed full thermo-optical models relating transient spectroscopy measurements, performed on metal nanoobjects in dielectric environments, to the overall system thermal dynamics. The models are applicable to small spherical nanoparticles embedded in a homogeneous matrix, following an analytical approach, and are expanded to include the cases of arbitrarily complex geometries and sizes relying on the finite-element method. These approaches are then exploited to rationalize several observations made in the context of previous time-resolved thermo-optical studies at the nanoscale. The present tools open the path for accurate retrieval of thermal parameters, notably the Kapitza resistance and the local environment thermal conductivity, from experiments. They also allow identifying the optimal parameters for selectively probing thermal dynamics of either a nanoobject or its nanoscale environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageometry 3ametrology 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aphysical chemistry 3aspectroscopy 3athermal conductivity1 aCrut, Aurélien1 aMedeghini, Fabio1 aStoll, Tatjana1 aMaioli, Paolo1 aVallée, Fabrice1 aBanfi, Francesco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7465-84171 aDel Fatti, Natalia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8074-256X0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Mar. 27, v. 122, no. 15 p.8655-8666dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b018753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02490naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013500168300001800303520128000321592002801601650000801629650001501637650002001652650002101672650001601693650002001709650001801729650000901747650001401756650001101770700001601781700001701797700001301814700001301827700001701840700001801857773011001875856008601985852000902071655001202080IND60530467820221121101301.0160721e20160405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053046782DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.6b002302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Shixing10aHigh-Sensitivity and High-Efficiency Detection of DNA Hydroxymethylation in Genomic DNA by Multiplexing Electrochemical Biosensing  ap. 3476-3480.  aDNA hydroxymethylation (5-hmC) is a kind of new epigenetic modification, which plays key roles in DNA demethylation, genomic reprogramming, and the gene expression in mammals. For further exploring the functions of 5-hmC, it is necessary to develop sensitive and selective methods for detecting 5-hmC. Herein, we developed a novel multiplexing electrochemical (MEC) biosensor for 5-hmC detection based on the glycosylation modification of 5-hmC and enzymatic signal amplification. The 5-hmC was first glycosylated by T4 β-glucosyltransferase and then oxidated by sodium periodate. The resulting glucosyl-modified 5-hmC (5-ghmC) was incubated with ARP-biotin and was bound to avidin-HRP. The 5-hmC can be detected at the subnanogram level. Finally, we performed 5-hmC detection for mouse tissue samples and cancer cell lines. The limit of detection of the MEC biosensor is 20 times lower than that of commercial kits based on optical meaurement. Also, the biosensor presented high detection specificity because the chemical reaction for 5-hmC modification can not happen at any other unhydroxymethylated nucleic acid bases. Importantly, benefited by its multiplexing capacity, the developed MEC biosensor showed excellent high efficiency, which was time-saving and cost less.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aepigenetics 3agene expression 3aglycosylation 3amice 3aneoplasms 3asodium1 aDou, Yanzhi1 aZhao, Zhihan1 aLi, Fuwu1 aSu, Jing1 aFan, Chunhai1 aSong, Shiping0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2016 Apr. 05, v. 88, no. 7 p.3476-3480dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.6b002303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01618naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245010800166520064900274592002800923650001100951650001200962650001900974650000900993650001501002650001501017650001701032700002701049700002301076773011901099856007701218852000901295655001201304IND60794240620221116180427.0220922e20220908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079424062DNAL7 a10.3390/land110915132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKunitsky, Viktor V.10aResponse of Permafrost Thermal State to Global Climatic Change in Urbanised Landscapes, Yakutsk, Russia  aA study was undertaken to investigate the structure and condition of urban permafrost in the city of Yakutsk.

To obtain more useful information from collected data, the wavelet energy was extracted as feature signal by the wavelet transform method for qualitative and quantitative analysis. For qualitative analysis, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was applied to evaluate the feature signals, and the result indicated that these feature signals had good classification performance with the first two scores explaining 82.50% of total variance. Moreover, probabilistic neural network (PNN) was performed to classify eggs with different storage times, and 92.86% of samples in testing set were classified correctly. For quantitative analysis, back propagation neural networks (BPNN) and support vector machine (SVM) were applied to build prediction models of yolk index, indicating that SVM models (R2 = 0.9641 in training set and R2 = 0.8339 in testing set) were better than BPNN (R2 = 0.8629 in training set and R2 = 0.7863 in testing set).

This study examined SOC change, total C input to soil and, via integration of these estimates over years, carbon sequestration efficiency (CSE, the ratio of SOC change over C input) under no fertilization (control), chemical nitrogen fertilizer alone (N) or combined with phosphorus and potassium fertilizers (NP, NK, PK and NPK), or chemical fertilizers combined with low or high (1.5×) manure input (NPKM and 1.5NPKM). RESULTS: Results showed that, as compared with the initial condition, SOC content increased by 0.03, 0.06, 0.05, 0.09, 0.16, 0.26, 0.47 and 0.68 Mg C ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ under control, N, NK, PK, NP, NPK, NPKM and 1.5NPKM treatments respectively. Correspondingly, the C inputs of wheat and maize were 1.24, 1.34, 1.55, 1.33, 2.72, 2.96, 2.97 and 3.15 Mg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ respectively. The long‐term fertilization‐induced CSE showed that about 11% of the gross C input was transformed into SOC pool.

This study aimed at evaluating in vivo the impact of the pro-healing PDA-coated stent on ISR and on the quality of the strut re-endothelialization in a rat model. PDA-coated stents demonstrated a significant reduction in ISR in vivo compared to bare metal stents (ratio neointima/media = 0.48 (±0.26) versus 0.83 (±0.42), p < 0.001). Western blot analyses identified a trend towards an increased activation of p38 MAPK phosphorylation and its anti-proliferative effects on vascular SMC that could explain the results observed in morphological analyses. This bioinspired and biocompatible polydopamine layer could intrinsically limit ISR. In addition, according to its latent reactivity, PDA offers the possibility to immobilize some relevant drugs on the PDA-functionalized stent to provide potential synergistic effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aanimal models 3abiocompatible materials 3aendothelial cells 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aphosphorylation 3apolymers 3arisk 3athrombosis1 aChai, Feng1 aMaton, Mickael1 aSobocinski, Jonathan1 aWoisel, Patrice1 aMaurel, Blandine1 aLyskawa, Joël1 aBlanchemain, Nicolas0 tBiomaterials science.g2021 Jan. 5, v. 9, no. 1 p.212-220dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0bm01204a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245010100173300001600274520107500290592002801365650002001393650001201413650001601425650002501441650002101466650004101487650001301528650001501541650001101556650004301567650001001610650000701620650001601627653001001643653000901653653003501662653002701697700002201724773010001746856008701846852000901933655001201942IND60525938820221119211106.0190402e20160101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052593882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.05.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDziadas, Mariusz10aComparison of enzymatic and acid hydrolysis of bound flavor compounds in model system and grapes  ap. 412-418.  aFour synthesized terpenyl-ß-d-glycopyranosides (geranyl, neryl, citronellyl, myrtenyl) were subjected to enzymatic (AR 2000, pH 5.5) and acid (citric buffer, pH 2.5) hydrolysis. Decrease of glycosides was measured by HPLC and the volatiles released – by comprehensive gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC×GC–ToF-MS). Enzymatic hydrolysis performed for 21h yielded 100% degree of hydrolysis for all glycosides but citronellyl (97%). Degree of acid hydrolysis was highly dependent on type of aglycone and the conditions. The highest degree was achieved for geraniol, followed by citronellol and nerol. Myrtenylo-ß-d-glycopyranoside was the most resistant glycoside to hydrolysis. Acid hydrolysis degree was also related to temperature/time combination, the highest being for 100°C and 2h. In a result of enzymatic hydrolysis 85–91% of total peak areas was terpene aglycone, whereas for acid hydrolysis the area of released terpene aglycone did not exceed 1.3% of total peak area indicating almost complete decomposition/transformation of terpenyl aglycone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid hydrolysis 3abuffers 3acitronellol 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aflavor compounds 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ageraniol 3aglycosides 3agrapes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3anerol 3apH 3atemperature 0aGrape 0aWine 0aTerpenyl-ß-d-glycopyranosides 0aBound flavor compounds1 aJeleń, Henryk H.0 tFood chemistry.g2016 Jan. 01, v. 190 p.412-418dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.05.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03887naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245007700207300001600284506007600300520201700376592002802393506003702421650001702458650001302475650001702488650002402505650001802529650001502547650001202562650001002574650002602584650001002610650002602620650001302646650002102659650002302680650001302703650001502716650001902731650001402750650001902764650002202783650001202805650001802817650001402835650001102849650001102860651002102871651001002892653001302902653001502915653001302930700001802943700002402961773016102985856008203146852000903228655001203237IND60644367420221207110612.0190819e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064436742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pld.2019.04.0042doi7 aPMC67024422pmcid7 a314534172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTiwari, Achyut10aPlant endemism in the Nepal Himalayas and phytogeographical implications  ap. 174-182.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNepal is located in the central part of the greater Himalayan range with a unique series of mountain chains formed by recent mountain building geological events. As one of the youngest mountains in the world it contributes to diversity of plants and also provided barriers to and corridors through which plants migrated during the ice ages. The higher altitudinal variation with the high mountains, deep river valleys and lowland plains combine with the effects of the summer monsoon and dry winter result with an extraordinary diversity of ecosystems including flora and fauna in a relatively small land area. The existing checklists for Nepal record some 6000 species of flowering plants and about 530 ferns. However, the botanical experts estimate that numbers may go up to 7000 when the poorly known remote regions are fully explored. The information on plant endemism in Nepal Himalaya is not adequately known as Nepal is still struggling to complete long awaited Flora of Nepal project. Endemic species are confined to specific areas and are the first to be affected by land use and other global changes. We sought to explore the spatial distribution of endemic plant species in Nepal in relation to the consequences associated with climatic and geologic changes over time in the region with the help of published literature. It was found that the endemism showed marked spatial variation between open moist habitat and dry inner valleys, the former with higher endemism. The updated records showed 312 flowering plant species to be endemic to Nepal with higher endemism around the elevation of 3800–4200 m at sea level. The recent human population explosion, intensified deforestation, habitat fragmentation and modern day environmental changes are posing greater threats to endemic plant in Nepal. The conservation status and threats to these peculiar species are unknown. Nevertheless, environmental degradation and high poverty rates create a potent mix of threats to biodiversity in this landscape.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAngiospermae 3aaltitude 3abiodiversity 3aconservation status 3adeforestation 3aecosystems 3aexperts 3afauna 3aferns and fern allies 3aflora 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3ahuman population 3aindigenous species 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amonsoon season 3amountains 3aphytogeography 3apopulation growth 3apoverty 3ariver valleys 3asea level 3asummer 3awinter 3aHimalayan region 3aNepal 0aHimalaya 0aTopography 0aEndemism1 aUprety, Yadav1 aRana, Santosh Kumar0 tPlant diversity.g2019 June, v. 41, no. 3 p.174-182dElsevier B.V.aKunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of ScienceswJournal:23310x2468-26597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pld.2019.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02803naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245007100173520182000244592002802064653002202092653001502114653002302129653002002152653001902172653002402191700002502215700002302240700001802263773010902281856009002390852000902480655001202489IND60681492120221120105802.0200330e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068149212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.1037482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpeak, Andrew14aThe influence of tree traits on urban ground surface shade cooling  aThe physical nature of the built urban environment gives rise to urban heat islands (UHI), making many cities frequently thermally uncomfortable in the summer, with potentially serious effects on human health. When climate change effects of higher summer temperatures and prolonged heatwaves are factored in, it is clear that adaptive measures are needed to ensure the liveability of cities. The shade provided by planting trees is one such adaptation measure. This study, in Bolzano, Italy, used a thermal camera to record the surface temperatures of three common urban surfaces – asphalt, porphyry, and grass – in the shade of 332 single tree crowns, of 85 different species, during the peak temperature period of summer days. By comparing with the temperature of adjacent unshaded ground, estimates of the degree of surface cooling were made. Measurements at three locations within the shadow revealed higher cooling in the centre and at the western edge. The cooling was related to a multitude of tree traits, of which Leaf Area Index estimate (LAIcept) and crown width were the most important. Median average cooling of 16.4, 12.9 and 8.5 °C was seen in the western edge of the tree shade for asphalt, porphyry and grass, respectively. Maximum temperatures were reduced by roughly 19 °C for all surface types. Coniferous trees were capable of providing high cooling, however, crown dimensions may limit the receiving surface area. Descriptive and predictive multiple linear regression models were able to predict cooling with some success from several of the predictor variables (LAIcept and gap fraction). Strategic planting of single trees in cities can have significant impacts on the absorption of solar radiation by ground surface materials thus reducing the heat storage that contributes to UHIs.  aPublisher supplied data 0aUrban heat island 0aTree shade 0aEcosystem services 0aThermal comfort 0aThermal camera 0aSurface temperature1 aMontagnani, Leonardo1 aWellstein, Camilla1 aZerbe, Stefan0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2020 May, v. 197 p.103748-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.1037483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012500169520109400294592002801388650001601416650001301432650001701445650001501462650001001477650001401487650002101501650002601522650002001548650001001568650002601578653000901604653000701613653000801620653000701628653000801635653000901643653001201652653000801664653001301672653001001685653000801695653000801703653000801711653000801719653002401727653003001751653000601781653002001787653000601807653002601813700001801839700001301857700001401870700001801884700001501902700001601917700005801933773011401991856008602105852000902191655001202200IND60688798120221120161512.0200614e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068879812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1124072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Jia-Hong10aIdentification of the bHLH gene family in Dracaena cambodiana reveals candidate genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis  aThe basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (TFs) regulate multiple biological processes by altering the expression of target genes. However, the bHLH superfamily genes in the dragon tree (Dracaena cambodiana Pierre ex Gagnep) have not been characterized, and their role in flavonoid biosynthesis remain unclear. Here, 62 bHLH genes in D. cambodiana were identified, and these genes were classified into 19 subfamilies based on a phylogenetic comparison with proteins from Arabidopsis. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that 8 DcbHLHs were up-regulated when exposed to the inducer of dragon’s blood and ultraviolet radiation b (UVB). Interaction network analysis revealed that 3 bHLHs (DcbHLH2, DcbHLH5 and DcbHLH56) are likely involved in flavonoid biosynthesis. In addition, DcbHLH5 and flavonoids biosynthetic genes were co-expressed in response to the inducer and UVB exposure. Furthermore, DcbHLH5 could bind to the promoters of flavonoid biosynthesis genes and activate their expression. This study suggests that DcbHLH proteins maybe involved in flavonoid biosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aDracaena 3abiosynthesis 3aflavonoids 3agenes 3aphylogeny 3apromoter regions 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics 3atrees 3aultraviolet radiation 0abHLH 0aTF 0aUVB 0aJA 0aCDD 0aFPKM 0aqRT-PCR 0aY1H 0aDual-LUC 0aGRAVY 0aCHS 0aCHI 0aMBW 0aJAZ 0aDracaena cambodiana 0abHLH transcription factor 0aD 0aragon’s blood 0aF 0alavonoid biosynthesis1 aXia, Dong-Nan1 aXu, Jing1 aGuo, Dong1 aLi, Hui-Liang1 aWang, Ying1 aMei, Wen-Li1 aPeng, Shi-Qing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3984-19020 tIndustrial crops and products.g2020 Aug., v. 150 p.112407-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1124073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03973naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245009700202300001800299500002000317520220800337592002802545596003002573596003002603650003102633650001702664650001902681650002402700650001602724650001102740650001502751650001002766650003002776650001102806650001502817650001702832650001302849650002102862650001602883650002502899650001002924700006102934700005602995700005803051700007203109700006203181773013003243856007303373852000903446655001203455IND60747602620221120201431.0210816e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074760262DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.133632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKazanidis, Georgios1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5114-697210aSensitivity of a cold‐water coral reef to interannual variability in regional oceanography  ap. 1719-1731.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: We assessed the effects of regional oceanographic shifts on the macrofaunal biodiversity and biogeography of cold‐water coral reefs (CWCRs). CWCRs are often hotspots of biodiversity and ecosystem services and are in the frontline of exposure to multiple human pressures and climate change. Almost nothing is known about how large‐scale atmospheric variability affects the structure of CWCRs’ communities over ecological timescales, and this hinders their efficient conservation. This knowledge gap is especially evident for species‐rich macrofauna, a key component for ecosystem functioning. LOCATION: The Mingulay Reef Complex, a protected biogenic ecosystem in the northeast Atlantic (120–190 m). METHODS: A unique time series (2003–2011) at 79 stations was used to make the first assessment of interannual changes in CWCRs’ macrofaunal biodiversity, biogeography and functional traits. We quantified the impacts of interannual changes in North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI)—the major mode of atmospheric variability in the North Atlantic, bottom temperature and salinity alongside static variables of seafloor terrain and hydrography. RESULTS: Environmental gradients explained a significant amount of community composition (Radj2 = 26.7%, p < .01) with interannual changes in bottom temperature, salinity and NAOI explaining nearly twice as much variability than changes in terrain or hydrography. We observed significant differences in community composition, diversity and functional traits but not in species richness across interannual variability in bottom temperature. In warmer years, the biogeographic composition shifted more towards a temperate and subtropical affinity. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the necessity for thorough investigations of faunal communities in CWCRs as they may be sensitive to interannual changes in regional oceanography. Considering the scientific consensus on the substantial warming of North Atlantic by 2100, we recommend the establishment of programmes for the monitoring of CWCRs. This will support an advanced understanding of CWCRs’ environmental status over time and will serve their conservation for the future.  aPublisher supplied data  a678760cH2020 Environment  a818123cH2020 Environment 3aNorth Atlantic Oscillation 3abiogeography 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3aecosystems 3afauna 3ageographical distribution 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3aoceanography 3asalinity 3aspecies richness 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3awater1 aHenry, Lea‐Anne1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5134-11021 aVad, Johanne1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2215-04911 aJohnson, Clare1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8213-25541 aDe Clippele, Laurence Helene1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4097-274X1 aRoberts, J.

Most research has focussed on the oral, skin, and gut microbiomes, whereas relatively little is known about the reproductive microbiome. Here, we review empirical evidence to show that reproductive microbiomes can have significant effects on the reproductive function and performance of males and females. We then discuss the likely repercussions of these effects for evolutionary processes related to sexual selection and sexual conflict, as well as mating systems and reproductive isolation. We argue that knowledge of the reproductive microbiome is fundamental to our understanding of the evolutionary ecology of reproductive strategies and sexual dynamics of host organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3adigestive system 3amicrobiome 3areproductive isolation 3asexual selection 0abacteria 0acryptic female choice 0areproductive immunity 0asperm competition1 aVeerus, Liisa1 aTrosvik, Pål1 aBuckling, Angus1 aPizzari, Tommaso0 tTrends in ecology & evolution.g2020 Mar., v. 35, no. 3 p.220-234dElsevier LtdwJournal:1990x0169-53477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2019.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02859naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245012500205300001000330520176400340592002802104596004702132650002502179650001102204650001402215650001302229650001102242700003202253700001802285700002402303773011402327856008302441852000902524655001202533IND60758001520221123043615.0220116e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075800152DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-021-03994-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichel, Lucie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5516-463010aHow shearwaters prey. New insights in foraging behaviour and marine foraging associations using bird-borne video cameras  ap. 7.  aConventional bio-logging techniques used for ethological studies of seabirds have their limitations when studying detailed behaviours at sea. This study uses animal-borne video cameras to reveal fine-scale behaviours, associations with conspecifics and other species and interactions with fishery vessels during foraging of a Mediterranean seabird. The study was conducted on Scopoli's shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea) breeding in Linosa island (35°51′33″ N; 12°51′34″ E) during summer 2020. Foraging events were video recorded from a seabirds' view with lightweight cameras attached to the birds' back. Foraging always occurred in association with other shearwaters. Competitive events between shearwaters were observed, and their frequency was positively correlated to the number of birds in the foraging aggregation. Associations with tunas and sea turtles have been frequent observations at natural foraging sites. During foraging events, video recordings allowed observations of fine-scale behaviours, which would have remained unnoticed with conventional tracking devices. Foraging events could be categorised by prey type into “natural prey” and “fishery discards”. Analysis of the video footage suggests behavioural differences between the two prey type categories. Those differences suggest that the foraging effort between natural prey and fishery discards consumption can vary, which adds new arguments to the discussion about energy trade-offs and choice of foraging strategy. These observations highlight the importance of combining tracking technologies to obtain a complete picture of the at-sea behaviours of seabirds, which is essential for understanding the impact of foraging strategies and seabird-fishery interactions.  aPublisher supplied data  aQU 148/23cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft 3aCalonectris diomedea 3aenergy 3afisheries 3aseabirds 3asummer1 aCianchetti-Benedetti, Marco1 aCatoni, Carlo1 aDell’Omo, Giacomo0 tMarine biology.g2022 Jan., v. 169, no. 1 p.7-7dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-021-03994-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03494naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245023300173520146300406592002801869650002601897650004401923650002201967650002401989650001302013650002102026650001402047650001602061650002802077650003702105650001802142650002102160650001702181650000702198650001202205650002202217650002402239650003302263650002102296650003302317650001502350650002902365650001102394650002202405650001502427650001402442653002502456653001502481653001402496653001302510653001202523700002502535700001602560700002002576700002402596700002702620773011402647856008602761852000902847655001202856IND60688798320221120151517.0200614e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068879832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1124092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMondal, Subhadeep10aContemporaneous synthesis of multiple carbohydrate debranching enzymes from newly isolated Aspergillus fumigatus SKF-2 under solid state fermentation: A unique enzyme mixture for proficient saccharification of plant bioresources  aThe agricultural residues are the most plentiful renewable bioresources in our earth as they enriched with a good amount of polysaccharides like cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, and starch. A newly isolated soil fungus Aspergillus fumigatus SKF-2 produced a cocktail of carbohydrate debranching enzymes under solid-state fermentation (SSF) using a mixture of sugarcane bagasse, wheat bran and orange peel in equal amount as inducible substrates. During optimization of fermentation condition through one factor at a time approach and subsequently by response surface methodology cellulase [CMCase (1447.89 U/gds), FPase (1401.98 U/gds), β-glucosidase (1461.23 U/gds)], xylanase (1897.43 U/gds), pectinase (1456.95 U/gds) and amylase (1821.34 U/gds) were evolved in higher titer. Most of the enzymes were optimally active at pH 7.0, stable up to pH 7.0-9.0 and at 30°-40 °C. The molecular weight of the CMCase, amylase, xylanase, pectinase, and β-glucosidase was determined as 21, 32, 50, 60 and 70 KDa, respectively. The kinetic indices like Km and Vmax were also in favorable ranges. Chemical as well as FE-SEM-EDX, FTIR and XRD analysis of the SSF substrates revealed a considerable structural deformation occurred by the action of enzymes evolved in the course of fermentation. The produced enzymatic combination mixture may have considerable industrial potentialities for complete saccharification of plant polysaccharides containing bioresources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aagricultural wastes 3aamylases 3abeta-glucosidase 3acellulose 3adeformation 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahemicellulose 3amolecular weight 3aorange peels 3apH 3apectins 3apolygalacturonase 3arenewable resources 3aresponse surface methodology 3asaccharification 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asoil fungi 3asolid state fermentation 3astarch 3asugarcane bagasse 3awheat bran 3axylanases 0aAgricultural residue 0aCellulases 0aPectinase 0aXylanase 0aAmylase1 aSoren, Jyoti Prakash1 aMondal, Joy1 aRakshit, Subham1 aKumar Halder, Suman1 aMondal, Keshab Chandra0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2020 Aug., v. 150 p.112409-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1124093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02320naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011800169300001400287520127900301592002801580650001601608650001001624650001001634650001701644650002401661650001501685650001401700700001901714700001601733700002101749773008201770856008601852990002301938852000901961655001201970IND60091719720221120130305.0141103e20110304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009171972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.brainres.2010.12.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aItoh, Kanako10aPotentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells by papaverine: Role played by PLC-γ, IP₃ receptors  ap. 32-40.  aPapaverine, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (PDE) 10A, is gaining attention for its potential in the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the putative neuroprotective/neurotrophic actions of papaverine remain unclear. Thus, we investigated the effects of papaverine on nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Papaverine potentiated NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, the selective PDE10A inhibitor MP-10 had no effect on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. The potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by papaverine was blocked by the PLC-γ inhibitor U73122. Furthermore, papaverine's potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth was also blocked by the co-administration of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP₃) receptor antagonists (xestospongin C and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB)) and by reduced expression of IP₃ receptor gene (i.e., itpr1 and itpr3) by siRNA. Our findings suggest that papaverine could potentiate NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, and that activation of PLC-γ and IP₃ receptors might be involved in the mechanism underlying papaverine's potentiation of neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3abrain 3agenes 3amyo-inositol 3anerve growth factor 3apapaverine 3areceptors1 aIshima, Tamaki1 aKehler, Jan1 aHashimoto, Kenji0 tBrain research.g2011 Mar. 4, v. 1377 p.32-40dElsevier B.V.x0006-89937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2010.12.0753Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014700162300001400309520122800323592002801551650001101579650002001590650001501610650001301625650001601638650001801654650001801672650000901690650001901699650001601718650001801734650001801752650001701770650001501787650002001802650001601822650001601838650001401854650001701868653001301885653001701898653001901915653002201934700001801956700001601974700001501990700001502005700001902020700001502039773011902054856008102173852000902254655001202263IND60567966320221120202242.0190318e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056796632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2017.04.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Peihua10aPreparation of curcumin-loaded emulsion using high pressure homogenization: Impact of oil phase and concentration on physicochemical stability  ap. 34-46.  aCurcumin is a natural food coloring agent with many pharmacological effects such as anti-oxidation and anti-cancer. In this study, curcumin was dissolved in different oil phases (medium chain triglyceride, canola oil and linseed oil) by different treatments (heat, ultrasonic and microwave). Curcumin nanoemulsions stabilized by different emulsifiers (Tween-80, lecithin, whey protein isolation and acacia) with different concentrations were prepared using high pressure homogenization to evaluate physicochemical properties including curcumin content, particle size, potential, physical stability and storage stability (variation of curcumin content and particle size under different temperatures in 60 days). The increase in oil phase concentration caused increase in curcumin content, particle size and viscosity of the emulsions but decrease in stability. Meanwhile, temperature significantly affected the stability of nanoemulsion stabilized by lecithin instead of Tween-80. Curcumin nanoemulsion could achieve the maximum curcumin content when choosing medium chain triglyceride as its oil phase. These results may broaden the application of curcumin in food industry for improving its solubility and bioavailability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia 3abioavailability 3acanola oil 3acurcumin 3aemulsifiers 3afood coloring 3afood industry 3aheat 3ahomogenization 3alinseed oil 3ananoemulsions 3aparticle size 3apolysorbates 3asolubility 3astorage quality 3atemperature 3aultrasonics 3aviscosity 3awhey protein 0aCurcumin 0aNanoemulsion 0aMicrostructure 0aStorage stability1 aZeng, Qinghan1 aTai, Kedong1 aHe, Xiaoye1 aYao, Yanyu1 aHong, Xiaofeng1 aYuan, Fang0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2017 Oct., v. 84 p.34-46dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2017.04.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03948naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006000152245015200212520238900364592002802753650001702781650001102798650001202809650001902821650001802840650001302858650001502871650001002886650001102896650001902907650001102926650001002937650001402947650001702961650001202978650001202990650001303002650002203015650001503037650000903052653002103061653001703082653001603099653002003115653002103135700002203156700002003178700001403198773009803212856008703310852000903397655001203406IND60681492620221120105733.0200318e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068149262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2020.1070362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCienciala, Piotr1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1247-328110aLateral geomorphic connectivity in a fluvial landscape system: Unraveling the role of confinement, biogeomorphic interactions, and glacial legacies  aThe rates at which sediment from the landscape is recruited to channel networks reflect lateral geomorphic connectivity and have significant implications for biophysical river systems. By strongly influencing sediment supply regime, such inputs control the dynamics and characteristics of the channel as well as the associated habitat and biota. The main objective of this research was to disentangle the relative importance of geomorphic and biological factors which define spatial patterns in lateral connectivity by promoting or restricting bank erosion, avulsions, and slope failures. Focusing on a forested, formerly glaciated mountain basin in the interior Pacific Northwest, we combined extensive field surveys with remote sensing data (LiDAR, aerial imagery) to obtain metrics representing this complex suite of landscape characteristics. The interpretation of evidence yielded by correlations between these variables, a regime model, and qualitative observations, suggest that, at a multi-decadal timescale between major landscape disturbances, lateral connectivity patterns in Sullivan Creek may be, to a large extent, governed by a combination of biotic factors and glacial legacies. In particular, forest canopy metrics were key predictors of hillslope stability as well as bank and valley floor resistance, suggesting a pivotal influence of root reinforcement. On the other hand, instream large wood abundance was closely related to channel splitting, which reflects its role in promoting channel avulsions. More extensive bank erosion in reaches dominated by drift deposits appeared to indicate glacial legacies. Furthermore, a strong association between bank erosion and colluvial inputs suggested a close coupling within the channel-hillslope system. Lateral confinement – defined as the proportion of the channel length abutting against bedrock, terraces, fans and roads – was negatively associated with channel braiding; the relationships linking confinement with bank erosion and the magnitude of colluvial inputs (negative and positive association, respectively) were relatively weak. Taken together, findings emerging from this research suggest that better understanding of lateral geomorphic connectivity patterns in mountain river basins similar to our study site requires that both channel processes and broader, biophysical landscape system be considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3abank erosion 3abasins 3abedrock 3abiotic factors 3aforest canopy 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3alidar 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3aroads 3asediments 3aspatial data 3astreams 3asurveys 3aterraces 3atopographic slope 3awatersheds 3awood 0aBiogeomorphology 0aConnectivity 0aConfinement 0aMountain rivers 0aGlacial legacies1 aNelson, Andrew D.1 aHaas, Andrew D.1 aXu, Zewei0 tGeomorphology.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 354 p.107036-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2020.1070363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245011000168300001600278520130300294592002801597650001301625650002501638650001601663650001301679650001501692650002601707650001401733650001601747650002401763650001301787650001501800650001601815653002101831653001401852653001601866653001301882653001501895653002201910700001401932700001201946700001401958773009801972856008602070852000902156655001202165IND60600411620221119102536.0180703e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060041162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.05.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, R.C.10aCombustion and emissions characteristics of dual-channel double-vortex combustion for gas turbine engines  ap. 314-325.  aA vortex combustor is a novel gas turbine combustor that uses staged combustion technology. Research examining the combustion organization method of the pilot combustion zone and the mainstream combustion zone is an important component of the design of the structure of a vortex combustor. In this paper, a new type of single-cavity vortex combustor fueled with aviation kerosene is presented. A double-vortex flow field structure and an evaporation tube for the fuel supply are used in the pilot zone. The flow-field structure of a double recirculation zone and a pneumatic atomization injector for the fuel supply are used in the mainstream combustion zone. The combustion experiment was performed under atmospheric pressure. The influence of the air-flow parameters, fuel parameters and staged method on the combustion performance and the characteristics of the pollutant emissions were studied in detail. Research indicates that the inlet temperature and the staged method primarily influence the ignition limit, lean blowout, combustion efficiency, temperature distribution of the outlet and pollutant emissions. The equivalence ratio primarily influences the temperature distribution of the wall and pollutant emissions. The inlet velocity influences the total pressure loss of the combustor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair flow 3aatmospheric pressure 3aatomization 3aaviation 3acombustion 3acombustion efficiency 3aemissions 3aevaporation 3agas turbine engines 3akerosene 3apollutants 3atemperature 0aVortex combustor 0aStructure 0aPerformance 0aEmission 0aExperiment 0aAviation kerosene1 aFan, W.J.1 aShi, Q.1 aTan, W.L.0 tApplied energy.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 130 p.314-325dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.05.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245014500174300001600319520143400335592002801769650001401797650001101811650001401822650001501836650001801851650001701869650001801886650001901904650001101923650001401934650001801948650002901966650001201995653001402007653001602021653001702037653002602054653001402080700006102094700002002155700001202175700001502187700002202202773009102224856009002315852000902405655001202414IND60633551520221117223249.0190425e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063355152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.03.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Guosheng10a236U and radiocesium in river bank soil and river sediment in Fukushima Prefecture, after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident  ap. 388-394.  aAlmost 8 years after the Japanese Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident, data for 236U and 236U/238U have mainly remained limited to only a few heavily contaminated samples. In the present study, activities of 236U, 134Cs, and 137Cs, along with 234U, 235U, 238U, in 15 river bank soil and 10 river sediment samples, were measured by ICP-MS/MS and γ spectrometry. The 134Cs activities and 134Cs/137Cs activity ratios (decay-corrected to March 11, 2011) in these 15 river bank soil samples were from 74.8 to 3.88 × 105 Bq kg−1 and from 0.944 to 1.02, respectively; and in these 10 river sediment samples were from 87.1 to 1.86 × 105 Bq kg−1 and from 0.904 to 0.990, respectively. The 236U activities and 236U/238U atom ratios in these soil samples were in the respective ranges of (0.139–17.6) × 10−5 Bq kg−1 and (0.259–3.83) × 10−8; and in these sediment samples were in the respective ranges of (0.884–27.0) × 10−5 Bq kg−1 and (1.12–5.04) × 10−8. For one river sediment core sample, 134Cs and 236U activities decreased with the depth indicating 134Cs and 236U accumulated in the river sediment with time. Unlike 134Cs, no clear evidence of FDNPP accident-derived 236U has been found in this study, although further monitoring is encouraged to establish the background database on 236U/238U for its potential application as a tracer in environmental studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3acesium 3adatabases 3amonitoring 3anuclear power 3apower plants 3aradionuclides 3ariparian soils 3arivers 3asediments 3asoil sampling 3atandem mass spectrometry 3auranium 0a236U/238U 0a134Cs/137Cs 0aRiver system 0aSource identification 0aICP-MS/MS1 aRahman, M.

Moreover, it is assumed that apoptosis in the follicular cells has a beneficial influence on the developmental competence of oocytes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether bovine oocytes with varied developmental competence show differences in the degree of apoptosis and gene expression pattern in their surrounding follicular cells (cumulus and granulosa cells). Oocytes and follicular cells from follicles of 3 to 5 mm in diameter were grouped as brilliant cresyl blue (BCB)+ and BCB- based on glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity in the ooplasm by BCB staining. In the follicular cells initial, early and late apoptotic events were assessed by analyzing caspase-3 activity, annexin-V and TUNEL, respectively. Global gene expression was investigated in immature oocytes and corresponding follicular cells. BCB+ oocytes resulted in a higher blastocyst rate (19.3%) compared to the BCB- group (7.4%, P < 0.05). Moreover, the analysis of apoptosis showed a higher caspase-3 activity in the follicular cells and an increased degree of late apoptotic events in granulosa cells in the BCB+ compared with the BCB- group. Additionally, the global gene expression profile revealed a total of 34 and 37 differentially expressed genes between BCB+ and BCB- cumulus cells and granulosa cells, respectively, whereas 207 genes showed an altered transcript abundance between BCB+ and BCB- oocytes. Among these, EIF3F, RARRES2, RNF34, ACTA1, GSTA1, EIF3A, VIM and CS gene transcripts were most highly enriched in the BCB+ oocytes, whereas OLFM1, LINGO1, ALDH1A3, PTHLH, BTN3A3, MRPS2 and PPM1K were most significantly reduced in these cells. Therefore, the follicular cells enclosing developmentally competent oocytes show a higher level of apoptosis and a different pattern of gene expression compared to follicular cells enclosing non-competent bovine oocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3acattle 3agene expression 3agranulosa cells 3agenes 3agene expression regulation 3aoocytes 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 2aAnimals 2aAnnexin A5xanalysis 2aApoptosis 2aCaspase 3xmetabolism 2aCattle 2aCell Separation 2aColoring Agents 2aCumulus Cellsxchemistryxenzymologyxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Profilingxveterinary 2aGlucosephosphate Dehydrogenasexmetabolism 2aGranulosa Cellsxchemistryxenzymologyxphysiology. 2aIn Situ Nick-End Labeling 2aOocytesxchemistryxenzymologyxphysiology. 2aOxazines 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aStaining and Labeling 0aglucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase1 aSalilew-Wondim, D.1 aTorner, H.1 aTesfaye, D.1 aGhanem, N.1 aTomek, W.1 aEl-Sayed, A.1 aSchellander, K.1 aHölker, M.0 tTheriogenology.g2012 Aug., v. 78, no. 3 p.656-669.e5dElsevier Inc.x0093-691X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2012.03.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245014500161300002000306520148100326592002801807596009801835596009801933650000802031650002102039650002602060650002902086650002502115650001202140650002302152650001702175650001702192650001602209650002302225650001502248653001402263653001302277653005102290653002502341700001402366700001402380700005302394700001502447773014102462856007902603852000902682655001202691IND60779497420221116151939.0220609e20220531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077949742DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c004342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Shaoying10aCharge-Switchable CuₓO Nanozyme with Peroxidase and Near-Infrared Light Enhanced Photothermal Activity for Wound Antibacterial Application  ap. 25042-25049.  aBacterial infection is still a thorny problem threatening human health, and nanozymes offer a promising alternative strategy to combat the health threat posed by bacterial infection. However, the antibacterial efficacies of nanozymes are unsatisfactory because of low catalytic activity of nanozymes and their inability to trap bacteria. Herein, a multifunctional nanozyme, polydopamine (PDA)-modified copper oxide (CuₓO-PDA) is designed to overcome this challenge. CuₓO-PDA showed peroxidase-mimicking activity and the catalytic activity was enhanced upon near-infrared (NIR) irradiation. CuₓO-PDA was negatively charged under neutral or alkaline condition and showed no obvious peroxidase-mimicking activity. On the contrary, the surface charge of CuₓO-PDA can be switched to positive under acidic conditions, which can target negatively charged bacteria. More interestingly, well-dispersed CuₓO-PDA can aggregate rapidly under NIR irradiation, which trapped the bacteria and nanozymes together. It was found that shortening the distance between nanozyme and bacteria could improve the antibacterial effect. The obtained CuₓO-PDA can cause DNA degradation, lipid peroxidation, and biofilm eradication. CuₓO-PDA showed good antibacterial effect against two kinds of representative bacteria, Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive). The experiment in vivo further proved favorable antibacterial activity of CuₓO-PDA nanozyme.  aPublisher supplied data  a22074043cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a22174047cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibacterial properties 3abacterial infections 3abiofilm 3acatalytic activity 3acupric oxide 3ahuman health 3airradiation 3alipid peroxidation 3aperoxidase 0ananozymes 0aCuxO-PDA 0aNIR irradiation, peroxidase-mimicking activity 0aantibacterial effect1 aFeng, Yun1 aSun, Qian1 aXu, Zhiai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4391-25071 aZhang, Wen0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 May 31, v. 14, no. 22 p.25042-25049dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c004343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03400naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013600167300001600303520156800319592002801887650002101915650001701936650001501953650001401968650002201982650003102004650003102035650001102066650002502077650002702102650002102129650002902150650001502179650001302194650001402207650001202221650005002233650001002283653001702293653001902310653002702329653001302356700001602369700001602385700001702401700001402418700001202432700001502444700001602459773026502475856008502740852000902825655001202834IND60527248120221120040238.0190415e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052724812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.repbio.2016.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chanjuan10aExpression of factors involved in the regulation of angiogenesis in the full-term human placenta: Effects of in vitro fertilization  ap. 104-112.  aThe effects of assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) on the safety of pregnancy and the resulting offspring remain controversial. Studies of placental functions, especially vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, in pregnancies established through ART are helpful for furthering our understanding of the safety of ART. This study compares the expression profiles of angiogenic factors in human term placentas obtained from natural (NAT) pregnancies vs. placentas obtained from pregnancies that resulted from ART. Term placentas were obtained from women who underwent an ART procedure (n=4), and these were compared with term placentas that were obtained from women who had experienced a spontaneous pregnancy (controls, n=4). An array analysis was performed using the Human Angiogenesis Antibody Array to detect 43 angiogenic factors and to identify which of these factors were differentially expressed between the two groups. The expression of six of these factors was greater in the ART group than in the NAT group. The levels of four of them, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR3), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), interferon gamma (IFNG) and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), were quantified using western blot analysis. These factors were examined using immunohistochemistry and microscopy in vascular endothelial cells or the cytoplasm and membranes of syncytiotrophoblast cells. Our finding that selected angiogenic factors exhibit altered expression profiles in ART placentas might be significant when evaluating ART safety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aangiogenesis 3aantibodies 3acytoplasm 3aendothelial cells 3afibroblast growth factor 2 3agene expression regulation 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ain vitro fertilization 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterstitial collagenase 3amicroscopy 3aplacenta 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3avascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 3awomen 0aAngiogenesis 0aAntibody array 0aIn vitro fertilization 0aPlacenta1 aZhang, Yuan1 aTang, Lisha1 aZhao, Haijun1 aGao, Chao1 aGao, Li1 aCui, Yugui1 aLiu, Jiayin0 tReproductive Biology.g2016 June, v. 16, no. 2 p.104-112dElsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.aSociety for Biology of Reproduction & the Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of Polish Academy of Sciences in OlsztynwJournal:23206x1642-431X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.repbio.2016.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03074naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245009500209300001600304506007600320520123200396592002801628506003701656650002801693650002101721650001101742650003401753650001301787650001401800650001701814650001801831650002201849650001301871650001401884650003701898650001301935650001201948653001501960653002401975653002201999653001502021653000802036653001102044653000802055653000902063653000902072653000902081653000802090653000802098700002002106700002302126700002202149700006402171773012202235856008202357852000902439655001202448IND60584515620221207133323.0180905e20171020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058451562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jgg.2017.06.0032doi7 aPMC56661242pmcid7 a290379902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aByrne, Dwayne J.10aRoles for the VCP co-factors Npl4 and Ufd1 in neuronal function in Drosophila melanogaster  ap. 493-501.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe VCP-Ufd1-Npl4 complex regulates proteasomal processing within cells by delivering ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome for degradation. Mutations in VCP are associated with two neurodegenerative diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and inclusion body myopathy with Paget's disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD), and extensive study has revealed crucial functions of VCP within neurons. By contrast, little is known about the functions of Npl4 or Ufd1 in vivo. Using neuronal-specific knockdown of Npl4 or Ufd1 in Drosophila melanogaster, we infer that Npl4 contributes to microtubule organization within developing motor neurons. Moreover, Npl4 RNAi flies present with neurodegenerative phenotypes including progressive locomotor deficits, reduced lifespan and increased accumulation of TAR DNA-binding protein-43 homolog (TBPH). Knockdown, but not overexpression, of TBPH also exacerbates Npl4 RNAi-associated adult-onset neurodegenerative phenotypes. In contrast, we find that neuronal knockdown of Ufd1 has little effect on neuromuscular junction (NMJ) organization, TBPH accumulation or adult behaviour. These findings suggest the differing neuronal functions of Npl4 and Ufd1 in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aRNA interference 3aadults 3aamyotrophic lateral sclerosis 3adementia 3alongevity 3amicrotubules 3amotor neurons 3amuscular diseases 3amutation 3aphenotype 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aproteins 3asynapse 0aProteasome 0aTDP-43 accumulation 0aNeurodegeneration 0aDrosophila 0aALS 0aIBMPDF 0aNMJ 0aNpl4 0aTBPH 0aUfd1 0aUPS 0aVCP1 aHarmon, Mark J.1 aSimpson, Jeremy C.1 aBlackstone, Craig1 aO'Sullivan, Niamh C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8244-81450 tJournal of genetics and genomics.g2017 Oct. 20, v. 44, no. 10 p.493-501dElsevier LtdwJournal:2201x1673-85277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgg.2017.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001900161245013000180300001600310500000900326520132800335592002801663650001601691650001401707650001301721650001401734650001301748650000901761650001401770650002401784650002101808650002101829650001101850650001701861650002301878651001001901651001201911651002301923700001701946700001701963700001701980773014701997856009602144852000902240655001202249IND60667821220221120072341.0191125e197905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066782122DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1979.03615995004300030022x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFosberg, M.

They have developed under a western hemlock (Tusuga heterophylla) habitat type with 740 mm of precipitation, > 8°C mean summer soil temperature and 7.5°C mean annual soil temperature (weather data, Univ. of Idaho. Res. Stn., Sandpoint). The B2ir or cambic horizons have developed from volcanic ash and the underlying IIA'&B' and IIB'2x horizons have fragipans developed in glacial outwash sediments. Horizons from volcanic ash have higher values of estimated allophane, organic C, extractable Fe, Al, and Mn, exchangeable H, 1/3- and 15-bar moisture, and CEC than do underlying horizons. Bulk densities range from 0.80 to 0.90 in volcanic ash horizons compared with 1.41 to 1.65 for glacial sediments. X-ray patterns show little indication of crystalline minerals in the ash-related horizons. Concretions have greater contents of Mn and Fe whereas Al remains relatively constant in relation to the total soil. Development of a B2ir, without an Al horizon under the O horizon, is characteristic of soils associated with these climatic and vegetational zones. Diagnostic properties make the cambic gradational to a spodic horizon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aallophane 3aaluminum 3afragipans 3ahabitats 3airon 3amanganese 3ameteorological data 3aorganic horizons 3asoil temperature 3asummer 3avolcanic ash 3avolcanic ash soils 3aIdaho 3aMontana 3aWashington (state)1 aFalen, A.

The FA CO2 flux was found to be higher in vegetated site than non-vegetated site due to higher root density and respiration. The presence of organic carbon, microbial activity and root biomass are important indicators for sequestration of atmospheric CO2 in naturally vegetated site of FA dumps because of the fresh FA dumps are supposed to be initially free of organic carbon. Furthermore, in the naturally vegetated site, the FA CO2 efflux rates were least in Saccharum spontaneum (lower by 84.29%) and Prosopis juliflora (lower by 92.09%) association as compared to Typha latifolia association. Thus, the field results proved that S. spontaneum and P. juliflora associations are potentially suitable for sequestering atmospheric CO2 in the fresh FA deposited sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProsopis juliflora 3aSaccharum spontaneum 3aTypha latifolia 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3afly ash 3amicrobial activity 3asoil 0aCarbon sequestration 0aFly ash dumps 0aNaturally vegetated site 0aCO2 flux1 aSahu, Nayan1 aBehera, Soumit K.1 aSingh, Nandita0 tEcological engineering.g2016 Oct., v. 95 p.198-205dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2016.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01833naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009200168300001800260520033700278536016900615592002800784596013200812650001400944650001100958650004400969650001401013650002201027650002001049653002301069653001501092653001901107653000801126653001701134700001801151700001701169700001801186773012501204856008501329852000901414655001201423IND60700640720221120070249.0200702e20200702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070064072DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2018.15642982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qinghu10aIsolation and structure elucidation of two new compounds from artemisia Ordosica Krasch  ap. 1862-1867.  aTwo new compounds, namely arteordoyn A (1) and arteordoyn B (2), together with four known compounds, were isolated from the petroleum ether extract of Artemisia ordosica Krasch.

PFOS was the predominant compound, making up on average 88.9% of the ∑PFC, followed by PFOSA (7.8%). PFUnA (1.9%) and PFDA (1.2%) were detected in most samples. PFHxS, PFNA and PFOA were only found in a minority of the samples. We found substantial differences in PFC concentrations among life history stages, the highest concentrations were found in neonates, suckling juveniles and lactating females. Such differences should be considered when PFC levels in wildlife are evaluated. The high concentrations found in young porpoises are of concern as PFCs have known toxic effects on the development of the central nervous system and reproductive organs. Despite efforts to reduce PFC emissions, a decreasing temporal trend of concentrations was not detected for any compound.

Vital activities, such as survival, proliferation, growth, and differentiation, are among the many cellular functions modulated by apoptotic cells. The ability to recognize and respond to apoptotic cells appears to be a universal feature of all cells, regardless of lineage or organ of origination. However, the diversity and complexity of the response to apoptotic cells mandates that great care be taken in dissecting the signaling events and pathways responsible for any particular outcome. In particular, one must distinguish among the multiple mechanisms by which apoptotic cells can influence intracellular signaling pathways within viable responder cells, including: receptor-mediated recognition of the apoptotic cell, release of soluble mediators by the apoptotic cell, and/or engagement of the phagocytic machinery. Here, we provide a protocol for identifying intracellular signaling events that are induced in viable responder cells following their exposure to apoptotic cells. A major advantage of the protocol lies in the attention it pays to dissection of the mechanism by which apoptotic cells modulate signaling events within responding cells. While the protocol is specific for a conditionally immortalized mouse kidney proximal tubular cell line (BU.MPT cells), it is easily adapted to cell lines that are non-epithelial in origin and/or derived from organs other than the kidney. The use of dead cells as a stimulus introduces several unique factors that can hinder the detection of intracellular signaling events. These problems, as well as strategies to minimize or circumvent them, are discussed within the protocol. Application of this protocol should aid our expanding knowledge of the broad influence that dead or dying cells exert on their live neighbors, both in health and in disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acell lines 3acell viability 3akidneys 3amice 3asignal transduction1 aFeng, Lanfei1 aAntoni, Angelika1 aRauch, Joyce1 aLevine, Jerrold S.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 Dec. 27, , no. 118 p.e54980-e54980dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/549803Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/54980/identification-intracellular-signaling-events-induced-viable-cells  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245012400179300001800303520104900321536012701370592002801497596008401525650001701609650001701626650001701643650002501660650001901685650004101704650001501745650002301760650001901783650001201802650000901814650001701823650001001840650001101850651001101861653002301872653002401895653001801919653001001937700002401947700002401971700002401995700002002019700002802039773012502067856008502192852000902277655001202286IND60700641020221120050754.0200702e20200702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070064102DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2019.15667232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStamenković, Jelena G.10aChemical composition of the essential oils and headspace volatiles of Ferulago sylvatica (Besser) Reichenb. from Serbia  ap. 1947-1950.  aChemical composition of the headspace volatiles and essential oils isolated from different parts of Ferulago sylvatica was determined by GC and GC/MS analyses.

In species with parental care, predation can affect survival of both adults and the offspring under their care. This effect can be further modulated by or combined with other factors that contribute to mating and reproductive success of adults, such as the quality of their breeding site. Using the nest guarding behavior of a treefrog with paternal egg attendance, Kurixalus eiffingeri, we quantify the effects of predation on the behavior of adult frogs and the survival of their offspring. We observed predator avoidance behavior of male frogs guarding empty breeding sites or breeding sites with eggs in response to the introduction of a predatory snake, Dinodon rufozonatum. We hypothesized that male nest guarding behavior would be negatively correlated with predation risk and positively correlated with their clutch sizes. Furthermore, we predicted that predator avoidance in male frog would negatively impact the survivorship of their offspring. We found that breeding site fidelity in male frogs was determined by perceived predation risk and breeding site value, with more males abandoning sites when exposed to high mortality risks (presence of a snake) and when the reproductive benefits (number of offspring) were low. In addition, we found that the willingness of males to return to their breeding sites was positively correlated with their clutch sizes. Abandoning breeding sites, however, can be costly to males, because abandoned eggs had a lower hatching rate. Our findings provide empirical evidence of how the costs and benefits of predation risk and breeding site value can determine the behavior of an amphibian with parental care. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: When faced with predation risks, the willingness of individuals to maintain their ownership over nest sites can have significant effects on their reproductive success. For species with parental care, nest defense can also be critical for offspring survival. Using an East Asian treefrog with male egg attendance, we hypothesized that males would maximize their reproductive output by increasing investment for nest sites with low predation risks and with more offspring. We found that males are more likely to invest in nest attendance when risks are low and benefits of offspring survival are high. Moreover, we found that the willingness of males to continue parental investment resulted in an increase in survivorship of their offspring. Our results show that perceived risks and benefits to the adults are important factors in determining offspring survival in an amphibian species with parental care.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHylidae 3aadults 3acorrelation 3aeggs 3afrogs 3ahatching 3amales 3anesting sites 3anests 3aownership 3aphilopatry 3apredation 3apredator avoidance 3aprogeny 3areproductive performance 3areproductive success 3arisk 3asnakes 3asurvival rate1 aLee, Wing-Ho1 aSun, Jhong-Si1 aYou, Chen-Hen1 aKam, Yeong-Choy1 aPoo, Sinlan0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2017 Aug., v. 71, no. 8 p.122-122dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0340-54437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-017-2349-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03066naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245014300168300001400311520152000325592002801845650001501873650001001888650002201898650001501920650001501935650002001950650002201970650001601992650002102008650000902029650002202038650001802060650001102078650001502089650001202104651001302116653001702129653002602146653003402172653001502206653002202221653001902243700002402262700002102286773016102307856008302468852000902551655001202560IND60527248720221120061835.0190415e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052724872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jssas.2014.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZewdu, Shegena10aLand-use/land-cover dynamics in Sego Irrigation Farm, southern Ethiopia: A comparison of temporal soil salinization using geospatial tools  ap. 91-97.  aLand-use patterns are changing fast in most of the tropical nations in relation to the human population growth and related impacts. Majority of the rural population in Ethiopia depends on agriculture, and hence the land-use changes during the past couple of decades in rural Ethiopia are mostly linked to agricultural developments. The present study deals with the status and trends of land-use and land-cover dynamics in Sego Irrigation Farm in southern Ethiopia. Geospatial tools were used to assess changes in land-use/land-cover patterns in the study area during 1984–2010. Patch dynamics was assessed to understand the degree of fragmentation and changes along the terrain topography. Detailed analyses have revealed that the extent of cultivated land, which was 38.1% in 1984 has increased to 60.7% by 2010, with an average change of 58ha per year. The extent of land, which was intensively and sparsely cultivated in 1984 and 1995, was converted to barren and fallow land due to irrigation-related salinization problems. The water body/swamp, which was 55ha in 1984 has significantly decreased to 2ha by 2010. Land-use changes have been attributed to factors such as population pressure and environmental changes as more land area was put under irrigated cultivation, leading to salinization and lowering productivity of the soils in the area. Findings of the present study have implications for other rural areas in Ethiopia and elsewhere in the tropical regions, where irrigated agriculture is practiced.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody water 3afarms 3airrigated farming 3airrigation 3aland cover 3aland use change 3apopulation growth 3arural areas 3arural population 3asoil 3asoil salinization 3asurface water 3aswamps 3atopography 3atropics 3aEthiopia 0aBarren lands 0aEnvironmental impacts 0aGeographic information system 0aIrrigation 0aLand-use patterns 0aRemote sensing1 aSuryabhagavan, K.V.1 aBalakrishnan, M.0 tJournal of the Saudi Society of Agricultural Sciences.g2016 Jan., v. 15, no. 1 p.91-97dElsevier B.V.aKing Saud UniversitywJournal:23282x1658-077X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jssas.2014.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002400176245014000200300001500340520135200355592002801707650002201735650001001757650002201767650002001789650001001809650000901819650002201828650001201850650002001862650002001882650002201902650001801924650002901942700002001971700002101991700002102012700002202033700002002055700002302075700002102098773015202119856007002271856010602341990002302447852000902470655001202479IND60608495320221118211512.0190510e20170210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060849532DNAL7 a10.3791/549812doi7 aPMC54091902pmcid7 a282875932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenley, Beverley M.10aReliable identification of living dopaminergic neurons in midbrain cultures using rna sequencing and th-promoter-driven egfp expression  ap. e54981.  aIn Parkinson's Disease (PD) there is widespread neuronal loss throughout the brain with pronounced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the SNc, leading to bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor. The identification of living dopaminergic neurons in primary Ventral Mesencephalic (VM) cultures using a fluorescent marker provides an alternative way to study the selective vulnerability of these neurons without relying on the immunostaining of fixed cells. Here, we isolate, dissociate, and culture mouse VM neurons for 3 weeks. We then identify dopaminergic neurons in the cultures using eGFP fluorescence (driven by a Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) promoter). Individual neurons are harvested into microcentrifuge tubes using glass micropipettes. Next, we lyse the harvested cells, and conduct cDNA synthesis and transposon-mediated "tagmentation" to produce single cell RNA-Seq libraries1,2,3,4,5. After passing a quality-control check, single-cell libraries are sequenced and subsequent analysis is carried out to measure gene expression. We report transcriptome results for individual dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons isolated from midbrain cultures. We report that 100% of the live TH-eGFP cells that were harvested and sequenced were dopaminergic neurons. These techniques will have widespread applications in neuroscience and molecular biology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParkinson disease 3abrain 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression 3aglass 3amice 3amolecular biology 3aneurons 3aneurophysiology 3aquality control 3asequence analysis 3atranscriptome 3atyrosine 3-monooxygenase1 aCohen, Bruce N.1 aKim, Charlene H.1 aGold, Heather D.1 aSrinivasan, Rahul1 aMcKinney, Sheri1 aDeshpande, Purnima1 aLester, Henry A.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2017 Feb. 10, , no. 120 p.e54981-e54981dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/549813Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/54981/reliable-identification-living-dopaminergic-neurons-midbrain-cultures  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245006000170300001400230520097900244592002801223650002501251650001401276650001101290650001501301650001201316650002501328650001101353650001901364650002801383650001301411650002001424650001301444650001101457651001201468653002401480653001501504653002201519653002101541700002201562700001601584700002101600773010901621856008301730852000901813655001201822IND60584516120221120200711.0190516e20180108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058451612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molp.2017.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerbančič, Jana10aCarbon Supply and the Regulation of Cell Wall Synthesis  ap. 75-94.  aAll plant cells are surrounded by a cell wall that determines the directionality of cell growth and protects the cell against its environment. Plant cell walls are comprised primarily of polysaccharides and represent the largest sink for photosynthetically fixed carbon, both for individual plants and in the terrestrial biosphere as a whole. Cell wall synthesis is a highly sophisticated process, involving multiple enzymes and metabolic intermediates, intracellular trafficking of proteins and cell wall precursors, assembly of cell wall polymers into the extracellular matrix, remodeling of polymers and their interactions, and recycling of cell wall sugars. In this review we discuss how newly fixed carbon, in the form of UDP-glucose and other nucleotide sugars, contributes to the synthesis of cell wall polysaccharides, and how cell wall synthesis is influenced by the carbon status of the plant, with a focus on the model species Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3abiosphere 3acarbon 3acell walls 3aenzymes 3aextracellular matrix 3amodels 3aphotosynthesis 3aphysiological transport 3apolymers 3apolysaccharides 3aproteins 3asugars 3aIndiana 0acarbon availability 0acell walls 0anucleotide sugars 0asucrose synthase1 aLunn, John Edward1 aStitt, Mark1 aPersson, Staffan0 tMolecular plant.g2018 Jan. 08, v. 11, no. 1 p.75-94dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000001387x1674-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2017.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245017000168520160900338592002801947650001801975650001801993650001602011650001902027650001802046650001402064650002402078650003002102650001702132650001502149650001902164650001502183650001302198650001302211650001402224651001902238651001502257653001802272653002702290653002602317653001302343653002702356700002002383700001802403700001902421700001202440773011902452856008802571852000902659655001202668IND60716016520221118071802.0211213e20210320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071601652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1432332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Dan10aCharacterization and ecological function of bacterial communities in seabed sediments of the southwestern Yellow Sea and northwestern East China Sea, Western Pacific  aThe marine ecosystems of the marginal seas of the Western Pacific region are frequently disturbed by terrigenous materials. It is of great significance to investigate the ecological functioning of these marine areas, which can be well understood by exploring the microbial communities of sediments. However, the geographical distribution, composition, and genetic functions of sedimentary bacterial communities of the Yellow Sea and East China Sea (YEC Seas) are poorly understood. In this work, sediment samples were collected from YEC Sea areas to investigate bacterial communities by high-throughput sequencing. A total of 1960 genera were determined, with Proteobacteria being the dominant phylum (45.03%), followed by Planctomycetes, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, and Chloroflexi. Correlation analysis indicates that the bacterial composition is influenced by environmental factors, including pressure, depth, seawater density, salinity, organic matter content, nutrient, and heavy metal. Approximately 178 metabolism pathways annotated in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database were detected in the bacterial communities, including ones for nutrient metabolism (C, 3.04%; S, 0.70%; N, 0.52%; and P, 0.22%) and exogenous pollutant metabolism (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), chlorobenzene, and benzoate; up to 4.97%). The results demonstrate that the abundant bacterial communities in the sediments of the YEC Seas are important for maintaining marine ecological functioning, especially for elemental biogeochemical cycling and exogenous pollutant transformation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidobacteria 3aBacteroidetes 3aChloroflexi 3aPlanctomycetes 3achlorobenzene 3adatabases 3aecological function 3ageographical distribution 3aheavy metals 3ametabolism 3aorganic matter 3apollutants 3asalinity 3aseawater 3asediments 3aEast China Sea 3aYellow Sea 0aMarginal seas 0aWestern Pacific marine 0aBacterial communities 0aSediment 0aEcological functioning1 aZhang, Zhongyun1 aSun, Mingming1 aFeng, Zhengyao1 aYe, Mao0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Mar. 20, v. 761 p.143233-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1432333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03472naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245012200170300001400292520195500306592002802261650001602289650001302305650002002318650001702338650002902355650001002384650002602394650002102420650001702441650001602458653003202474653001702506653000902523653001102532653001002543653001402553700002102567700003002588700002002618700001902638700001802657700002102675700001902696700001902715700001602734773011102750856008402861852000902945655001202954IND60666020520221120121445.0200210e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066602052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2019.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInomata, Chihiro10aInvolvement of an Oct4-related PouV gene, pou5f3/pou2, in neurogenesis in the early neural plate of zebrafish embryos  ap. 30-42.  aIn early vertebrate embryos, the dorsal ectoderm is induced by the axial mesendoderm to form the neural plate, which is given competence to form neural cells by soxB1 genes. Subsequently, neurogenesis proceeds in proneural clusters that are generated by a gene network involving proneural genes and Notch signaling. However, what occurs between early neural induction and the later initiation of neurogenesis has not been fully revealed. In the present study, we demonstrated that during gastrulation, the expression of the Oct4-related PouV gene pou5f3 (also called pou2), which is widely observed at earlier stages, was rapidly localized to an array of isolated spotted domains, each of which coincided with individual proneural clusters. Two-color in situ hybridization confirmed that each pou5f3-expressing domain included a proneural cluster. Further analysis demonstrated that anterior pou5f3 domains straddled the boundaries between rhombomere 1 (r1) and r2, whereas posterior domains were included in r4. The effects of forced expression of an inducible negative dominant-interfering pou5f3 gene suggested that pou5f3 activated early proneural genes, such as neurog1 and ebf2, and also soxB1, but repressed the late proneural genes atoh1a and ascl1b. Furthermore, pou5f3 was considered to repress her4.1, a Notch-dependent Hairy/E(spl) gene involved in lateral inhibition in proneural clusters. These results suggest that pou5f3 promotes early neurogenesis in proneural clusters, but negatively regulates later neurogenesis. Suppression of pou5f3 also altered the expression of other her genes, including her3, her5, and her9, further supporting a role for pou5f3 in neurogenesis. In vitro reporter assays in P19 cells showed that pou5f3 was repressed by neurog1, but activated by Notch signaling. These findings together demonstrate the importance of the pou5f3-mediated gene regulatory network in neural development in vertebrate embryos.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aectoderm 3aembryo (animal) 3agastrulation 3agene regulatory networks 3agenes 3ain situ hybridization 3aneurodevelopment 3aneurogenesis 3avertebrates 0aMidbrain-hindbrain boundary 0aNeurogenesis 0aOct4 0apou5f3 0asoxB1 0aZebrafish1 aYuikawa, Tatsuya1 aNakayama-Sadakiyo, Yukiko1 aKobayashi, Kana1 aIkeda, Masaaki1 aChiba, Mizuki1 aKonishi, Chihiro1 aIshioka, Akiko1 aTsuda, Sachiko1 aYamasu, Kyo0 tDevelopmental biology.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 457, no. 1 p.30-42dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2019.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245009800178300001600276520164400292592002801936650001501964650001901979650001901998650001902017650002302036650001102059650002902070650002002099650001302119650002502132650002002157650000902177650001902186650002302205650002202228650000902250650001102259650002502270650001102295651001102306653001902317653002302336653002502359653003702384653002002421700002202441700001802463700003002481773012302511856008702634852000902721655001202730IND50060511720221118223425.0190318e20130315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006051172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2012.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraux, Anne-Isabelle10aEnsemble modelling of climate change risks and opportunities for managed grasslands in France  ap. 114-131.  aThe Pasture Simulation model (PaSim) was used to simulate agronomic and environmental services at 12 grassland sites in France, comparing near past climate conditions (1970–1999) and projections for near (2020–2049) and far future (2070–2099). Modelled climate change impacts were assessed using statistical and threshold-based analysis on managed (intensive, extensive) grasslands (permanent, sown), comparing shallow and deep soils, and for an ensemble of emission scenarios, climate models, and downscaling/initialization methods.Results show a significant drift of all sites towards more arid climates by the end of the century. Significant reductions in annual water drainage and herbage protein content are projected, together with new opportunities for annual and seasonal herbage production, in spring and winter especially. Simulated future conditions also show an increased interannual and seasonal variability of production. Contrary to expectations, current natural conditions reflecting large water availability are not expected to reduce future risks of negative climate change impacts on grassland systems. Notably, milk production from aftermath grazing of permanent grasslands established on deep soils at Mirecourt (humid site) is estimated to fall down below one-third of the current median value in four out of 30 years (∼13%) for 2070–2099, whereas similar shortfalls were not observed with the baseline climate.Balancing risks and opportunities, permanent extensive grasslands can be viewed as a trade-off between the continuity of grassland service provision and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid zones 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3adrainage water 3aecosystem services 3aforage 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amilk production 3apastures 3apermanent grasslands 3aprotein content 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3aseasonal variation 3asimulation models 3asoil 3aspring 3astatistical analysis 3awinter 3aFrance 0aClimate change 0aGrassland services 0aGreenhouse gas (GHG) 0aPasture Simulation model (PaSim) 0aRisk assessment1 aBellocchi, Gianni1 aLardy, Romain1 aSoussana, Jean-François,0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2013 Mar. 15, v. 170 p.114-131dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2012.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02068naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001700161245006900178300001600247500000900263520095100272592002801223650001301251650002201264650001301286650000901299650001801308650001701326650000901343650001101352650002301363650000701386650001001393650000801403700001801411773014801429856009601577852000901673655001201682IND60667821820221118165553.0191125e197003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066782182DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1970.03615995003400020021x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, J.

Plant factors recognized as favoring Fe transport were (i) ability of roots to lower the pH of their growth medium, (ii) efflux of material by the root that reduces Fe³⁺ to Fe²⁺, (iii) increase of citrate in root sap, and (iv) decrease of P in root sap. The Fe-efficient Pa 54 corn was more efficient than the yellow stripe ys₁ in all of the above factors and transported more Fe to leaves than ys₁.

Time has moved on but time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors are still calibrated in a number of different ways. In this article we present a rigorous investigation of the method proposed by Heimovaara and demonstrate its accuracy. We demonstrate that the placement of a starting point in any place other than the one determined using Heimovaara's method results in erroneous permittivity measurement. This will be most significant at low values of permittivity. We propose that Heimovaara's method be adopted as a standard method for calibrating TDR sensors for measuring permittivity. The discussion centers on the placement of the first time marker used to measure the signal travel time from which permittivity is measured. Our modeling results suggest that this point is slightly forward of the apex of the bump on the waveform which corresponds to the impedance increase as the wave travels from the cable into the TDR sensor head. We also demonstrate that using the apex of this bump as a starting point reference can lead to erroneous measurements of travel time in layered dielectric media. Finally we examine the use of long cables to connect sensors to the TDR. We demonstrate that the travel time in the cable changes as a function of temperature and that fixed travel time markers based on cable length cause error in the measurement of travel time. For a 2.6-m cable the error was 1.6% at 50°C, and 4.7% for a 10.3-m cable, relative to calibration at 25°C.

The MPs solution was precipitated after heating in an acidic condition, while it was stable in the presence of SC. Particle size results indicated the formation of MP-SC complex nanoparticles. Their values (141) were much smaller than MP and significantly improved the solubility and stability of MP in acidic conditions. The formation of covalent interactions (CC at peak 1643–1654 and NO stretching at peak (1537–1539) and hydrogen bonds (CH binding at peak 1452–1454) between MPs and SC were clear. Overall, the formation of the MP-SC complex was attributed to the covalent interactions and hydrogen bonds between MPs and SC, leading to the inhibition of MPs aggregation and improved stability in acidic solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonascus 3afood chemistry 3ahydrogen 3apH 3aparticle size 3asodium caseinate 3asolubility 3athermal stability 0aMonascus pigments 0aSodium caseinate 0aComplex 0aThermal stability 0aMicrostructure1 aAl-Dalali, Sam1 aHao, Jia1 aIkram, Alouk1 aZhang, Jie1 aXu, Duoxia1 aCao, Yanping0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Aug. 01, v. 384 p.132480-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1324803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245008500187300001400272500002000286520121500306592002801521650002101549650001001570650001301580650001001593650001601603650001701619650000901636650001801645650001101663650001201674650005601686650000901742650005601751650000901807650002501816650001701841651001001858700001801868700001501886700001701901700001701918700001401935773013501949852000902084856008902093655001202182IND4387506220221118223542.0190314e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438750622DNAL7 a172666732pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0264.2006.00742.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShibata, S.14aThe Time Course of Lymphatic Routes Emanating from the Peritoneal Cavity in Rats  ap. 78-82.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe lymph drainage routes from the abdominal cavity in rats were observed at 3 min, 1, 2 and 4 h after India ink was administered intraperitoneally. Four systems of lymph drainage routes from the peritoneal cavity were observed. Three minutes after injection, the drainage route travelled via the intrathoracic lymph vessels located along the internal thoracic artery and returned to the anterior mediastinal lymph nodes. One hour after injection, the drainage route travelled via the lymph vessel located along the left phrenic nerve in addition to the drainage route observed at 3 min. Two and four hours after injection, in addition to the above‐mentioned routes, the drainage that had travelled via the thoracic duct continued along the right side of the aorta and was also observed in the lateral lymph vessel located on the vertebra. These findings suggest that lymph or cells absorbed into the peritoneal cavity at first travel towards the anterior mediastinal lymph nodes in the thorax via the ventral lymphatic channels, and then gradually course through the dorsal lymphatic channels. These routes may serve as a route for transporting cancer cells and other cells from the peritoneal cavity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdominal cavity 3aaorta 3adrainage 3alymph 3alymph nodes 3anerve tissue 3arats 3athoracic duct 3athorax 2aAnimals 2aLymphatic Vesselsxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aMale 2aPeritoneal Cavityxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aTime Factors 3aIndia1 aYamaguchi, S.1 aKaseda, M.1 aIchihara, N.1 aHayakawa, T.1 aAsari, M.0 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2007 Feb., v. 36, no. 1 p.78-82dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3895878x0340-20967nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0264.2006.00742.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02120naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245008000175300001800255520099800273592002801271650002501299650001401324650001201338650001201350650001701362650002101379650002201400650001301422650001401435650001101449650002001460651001001480700002401490700002501514773009901539856008701638852000901725655001201734IND60088515220221120091101.0141102e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008851522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2011.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertin, Angéline10aEstrogen pollution in a highly productive ecosystem off central-south Chile  ap. 1530-1537.  aWhile the presence of steroid estrogens in the environment has become a major environmental and health concern, their occurrence in coastal sediments remains poorly characterized. In this study, we measured the levels of three natural (estrone, 17β-estradiol, estriol) and one synthetic (17α-ethinylestradiol) estrogens in 54 coastal sediment samples collected from nine locations off central-southern Chile. Steroid estrogens were found in every sample. Remarkably high levels of 17α-ethinylestradiol were detected, reaching up to 48.14ng/g dry weight. As a result, the global estrogenic loads were estimated to be high at all sites. Interestingly, they were found to correlate with the size of human populations served by sewage plants. Our study indicates that 17α-ethinylestradiol may accumulate in coastal sediments. The possible impact of this highly potent synthetic estrogen on the biota of the marine ecosystem off central-south Chile and on human health remains an open question.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental health 3aestradiol 3aestriol 3aestrone 3ahuman health 3ahuman population 3amarine ecosystems 3asampling 3asediments 3asewage 3awater pollution 3aChile1 aInostroza, Pedro A.1 aQuiñones, Renato A.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2011 July, v. 62, no. 7 p.1530-1537dElsevier Ltdx0025-326X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2011.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03460naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001600179245014000195300001600335506007600351520209900427592002802526506003702554650001602591650001402607650001302621650001302634650001702647650001402664650001802678650002802696650001402724650002602738650001802764650001602782650003002798650001602828700002002844773010002864856004102964852000903005655001203014IND4465349920221207104334.0120419e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446534992DNAL7 a10.1093/aob/mcs0182doi7 aPMC33105002pmcid7 a223788392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Xinxin10aEvolution of mixed-linkage (1 â 3, 1 â 4)-Î²-D-glucan (MLG) and xyloglucan in Equisetum (horsetails) and other monilophytes  ap. 873-886.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Horsetails (Equisetopsida) diverged from other extant eusporangiate monilophytes in the Upper Palaeozoic. They are the only monilophytes known to contain the hemicellulose mixed-linkage (1 â 3, 1 â 4)-Î²-D-glucan (MLG), whereas all land plants possess xyloglucan. It has been reported that changes in cell-wall chemistry often accompanied major evolutionary steps. We explored changes in hemicelluloses occurring during Equisetum evolution. METHODS: Hemicellulose from numerous monilophytes was treated with lichenase and xyloglucan endoglucanase. Lichenase digests MLG to di-, tri- and tetrasaccharide repeat-units, resolvable by thin-layer chromatography. KEY RESULTS: Among monilophytes, MLG was confined to horsetails. Our analyses support a basal trichotomy of extant horsetails: MLG was more abundant in subgenus Equisetum than in subgenus Hippochaete, and uniquely the sister group E. bogotense yielded almost solely the tetrasaccharide repeat-unit (G4G4G3G). Other species also gave the disaccharide, whereas the trisaccharide was consistently very scarce. Tetrasaccharide : disaccharide ratios varied interspecifically, but with no consistent difference between subgenera. Xyloglucan was scarce in Psilotum and subgenus Equisetum, but abundant in subgenus Hippochaete and in the eusporangiate ferns Marattia and Angiopteris; leptosporangiate ferns varied widely. All monilophytes shared a core pattern of xyloglucan repeat-units, major XEG products co-chromatographing on thin-layer chromatography with non-fucosylated hepta-, octa- and nonasaccharides and fucose-containing nona- and decasaccharides. CONCLUSIONS: G4G4G3G is the ancestral repeat-unit of horsetail MLG. Horsetail evolution was accompanied by quantitative and qualitative modification of MLG; variation within subgenus Hippochaete suggests that the structure and biosynthesis of MLG is evolutionarily plastic. Xyloglucan quantity correlates negatively with abundance of other hemicelluloses; but qualitatively, all monilophyte xyloglucans conform to a core pattern of repeat-unit sizes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAngiopteris 3aEquisetum 3aMarattia 3aPsilotum 3abiosynthesis 3achemistry 3adisaccharides 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aevolution 3aferns and fern allies 3ahemicellulose 3alicheninase 3athin layer chromatography 3axyloglucans1 aFry, Stephen C.0 tAnnals of botany.g2012 Apr., v. 109, no. 5 p.873-886dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcs018  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245019400163300001400357500001900371520122700390592002801617650000801645650001501653650001601668650002401684650002001708650001501728650001001743650000901753650001401762650002301776650002001799650001301819650001601832653001601848653001401864653001501878653001901893653000801912700001801920700001301938700001601951773010601967856008202073852000902155655001202164IND60699613120221118011149.0200804e20200822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069961312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2020.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Shiyi10aLow fouling strategy of electrochemical biosensor based on chondroitin sulfate functionalized gold magnetic particle for voltammetric determination of mycoplasma ovipneumonia in whole serum  ap. 91-99.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBased on the successful design and preparation of Fe₃O₄@Au@polyethylene glycol (PEG)@chondroitin sulfate (CS) nanoparticles, a novel electrochemical biosensor was elaborately developed for MO determination by the drop coating method. This biosensor demonstrates ultra-low fouling properties in complex biological systems, especially in whole serum. Only 2.40% of the differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) signal changes are shown in the resistance test of electrode interface to 100% goat serum. The constructed biosensor also presented a good selectivity (DNA samples for M1, M2 and M3give a response around 14.2–21.4%of that obtained by the target analyte), reproducibility (the relative standard deviation (RSD) is only 4.82%) and storage stability (93.2% of the initial response is maintained after 20 day). Moreover, this biosensor exhibits high analytical performance with a wide line arranges (10⁻¹⁷ M ∼ 10⁻¹² M) in buffer, even in 100% goat serum. In both cases, a low limit of detection (LOD) of 3.3 aM(S/N = 3)is showed.

Nevertheless, most behavioral studies on mating patterns and sexual selection are conducted in laboratory standardized conditions, and it is unclear how potential laboratory-induced social biases affect mating outcome. The social environment may actually dictate which of female mate choice or male-male competition is the primary determinant of mating outcome. This matters because we expect sexually selected traits to evolve differently if mating outcome is determined by female mate choice or by male-male competition. We address this issue by performing an in-depth quantitative synthesis testing the effects of common extrinsic (population density, sex ratio), intrinsic (age), and laboratory-induced (cage volume, experimental duration) biases of the social environment of adults on mating outcome. For this, we used the butterfly Bicyclus anynana, as it provides a reasonable sampling of mating experiments in diverse laboratory conditions (i.e., 31 publications from 7 different laboratories since 2001). We found that all tested social environmental variables displayed strong variation across B. anynana mating studies, and that most variables had significant effects usually in interaction with another variable and with opposite effects between sexes. Hence, mating outcome is affected by laboratory biases on the social environment. Our quantitative synthesis offers a first case example of the effects of a pervasive and recurrent issue in animal behavioral research on sexual selection, i.e., the need to root mating experiments in ecologically relevant laboratory environments, in order to produce meaningful results about the selective force(s) driving the evolution of sexually selected traits in nature. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Mating outcome is biased by the laboratory social environment in which experiments are conducted. Male and female age, density, ratio, as well as cage volume and experimental duration all affect mating proportions, and this blurs our understanding of how sexual selection shapes sexually selected traits in the wild. This first systematic review was conducted on 31 studies in a single butterfly species, but our results are likely relevant in any taxonomic group.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBicyclus anynana 3aadults 3aanimals 3abutterflies 3acages 3aenvironmental factors 3afemales 3amales 3amating behavior 3aphenotype 3apopulation density 3asex ratio 3asexual selection 3asocial environment 3asystematic review1 aHolveck, Marie-Jeanne0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2017 Aug., v. 71, no. 8 p.117-117dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl6766x0340-54437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-017-2346-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001800176245013500194300001500329520122000344592002801564650001401592650002501606650001301631650001601644650001101660650002801671650003001699650001101729650001901740650001801759650001201777700001901789700002201808700002701830773015201857856007002009856010102079990002302180852000902203655001202212IND60608495620221118211303.0190510e20170423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060849562DNAL7 a10.3791/549842doi7 aPMC55650972pmcid7 a285180642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArbabi, Vahid13aAn experimental and finite element protocol to investigate the transport of neutral and charged solutes across articular cartilage  ap. e54984.  aOsteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitating disease that is associated with degeneration of articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Degeneration of articular cartilage impairs its load-bearing function substantially as it experiences tremendous chemical degradation, i.e. proteoglycan loss and collagen fibril disruption. One promising way to investigate chemical damage mechanisms during OA is to expose the cartilage specimens to an external solute and monitor the diffusion of the molecules. The degree of cartilage damage (i.e. concentration and configuration of essential macromolecules) is associated with collisional energy loss of external solutes while moving across articular cartilage creates different diffusion characteristics compared to healthy cartilage. In this study, we introduce a protocol, which consists of several steps and is based on previously developed experimental micro-Computed Tomography (micro-CT) and finite element modeling. The transport of charged and uncharged iodinated molecules is first recorded using micro-CT, which is followed by applying biphasic-solute and multiphasic finite element models to obtain diffusion coefficients and fixed charge densities across cartilage zones.  aPublisher supplied data 3acartilage 3achemical degradation 3acollagen 3adiffusivity 3aenergy 3afinite element analysis 3amicro-computed tomography 3amodels 3aosteoarthritis 3aproteoglycans 3asolutes1 aPouran, Behdad1 aZadpoor, Amir.

However, information about the extent to which mulching affects the recovery of native vegetation is inconclusive. The soil seed bank plays an important role in the resilience of frequently disturbed shrubland communities but little is known about how it is affected by mulching treatments. In this study, we assessed the effects of straw mulching (2.0Mgha−1) on the recovery of vegetation after a wildfire in Galicia (NW Spain). For this purpose, we carried out a greenhouse and field-based study to evaluate the effects of mulching applied immediately after fire on the soil seed bank and recovery of vegetation cover in a shrubland area during the first year after wildfire. In the greenhouse, there were no differences in the total number of seedlings that emerged from the soil seed bank of mulched and untreated samples (634 seedlings m−2 vs 731 seedlings m−2). Species richness increased from 22 in untreated burned soils to 24 species in the mulched, burned soils. In the field, straw mulching favoured plant establishment and recovery of vegetation cover. At the end of the first post-fire year, plant cover was significantly higher (63%) in the mulching treatment compared to the untreated one (44%). Mulching did not affect species composition, and there was little evidence of the presence of non-native species. The results indicate that, in the present case, straw mulching immediately after the fire favoured recovery of plant cover in the first year after the fire by conserving the soil moisture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburied seeds 3agreenhouses 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3amulching 3aplant establishment 3arunoff 3aseedlings 3ashrublands 3asoil water 3aspecies diversity 3astraw 3avegetation cover 3awildfires 3aSpain 0aWildfire 0aStraw mulch 0aSoil seed bank 0aVegetation recovery 0aNonnative species1 aVega, Jose A.,1 aFonturbel, Teresa1 aBarreiro, Ana1 aLombao, Alba1 aGómez-Rey, Mª Xesús1 aDiaz-Raviña, Montserrat1 aGonzález-Prieto, Serafín0 tEcological engineering.g2016 Oct., v. 95 p.138-142dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2016.06.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02096naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245010100173520086600274592002801140650001201168650001801180650002101198650001901219651001401238653001101252653001401263653001301277653001201290653002301302653002001325700001701345700002901362700002601391700002101417700001801438700002701456773010601483856008801589852000901677655001201686IND60762959520221116160336.0220307e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076295952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.1133222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErüz, Coşkun,10aSpatial pattern and characteristics of the benthic marine litter in the southern Black Sea shelf  aThe abundance and characteristics of benthic marine litter in the southern Black Sea shelf were demonstrated.

A multi-objective optimization model was developed to optimize the allocation of physical water and virtual water resources to different water users in Beijing, China, considering the trade-offs between economic benefit and environmental impacts of water consumption. Surface water, groundwater, transferred water and reclaimed water constituted the physical resource of water supply side, while virtual water flow associated with the trade of five major crops (barley, corn, rice, soy and wheat) and three livestock products (beef, pork and poultry) in agricultural sector (calculated by the trade quantities of products and their virtual water contents). Urban (daily activities and public facilities), industry, environment and agriculture (products growing) were considered in water demand side. As for the traditional allocation of physical water resources, the results showed that agriculture and urban were the two predominant water users (accounting 54% and 28%, respectively), while groundwater and surface water satisfied around 70% water demands of different users (accounting 36% and 34%, respectively). When considered the virtual water trade of eight agricultural products in water allocation procedure, the proportion of agricultural consumption decreased to 45% in total water demand, while the groundwater consumption decreased to 24% in total water supply. Virtual water trade overturned the traditional components of water supplied from different sources for agricultural consumption, and became the largest water source in Beijing. Additionally, it was also found that environmental demand took a similar percentage of water consumption in each water source. Reclaimed water was the main water source for industrial and environmental users. The results suggest that physical water resources would mainly satisfy the consumption of urban and environment, and the unbalance between water supply and demand could be filled by virtual water import in water scarce regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3abarley 3abeef 3acase studies 3acorn 3acrops 3aenvironmental impact 3afinancial economics 3agroundwater 3aimports 3amodels 3apork 3apoultry 3arice 3asupply balance 3asurface water 3avirtual water 3awastewater treatment 3awater allocation 3awater flow 3awater supply 3awheat 3aChina 0aVirtual water trade 0aWater allocation 0aMulti-objective optimization 0aWater management1 aLi, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4958-25451 aZhuo, La1 aZhang, Wenlong1 aXiong, Wei1 aWang, Chao1 aWang, Peifang0 tWater research.g2018 Feb. 01, v. 129 p.264-276dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2017.11.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03199naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013500173300001600308500001900324520138000343536052201723592002802245596001902273650001102292650001302303650001202316650001502328650001102343650001502354653001302369653001902382653001902401653001802420653001702438700002202455700001702477700002102494700002102515773013502536856008502671852000902756655001202765IND60700641920221120050658.0200702e20200503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070064192DNAL7 a10.1080/14942119.2020.17351982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerendt, Ferréol10aApplication of spiroergometry to determine work metabolism related strain in the course of cable work with a mini forestry crawler  ap. 114-125.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWinching is a common practice for extracting logs in forest operations; however, it requires significant physical effort by humans to pull-out the cable to the felling site. The aim of this study was to quantify the intensity of this activity by measuring human effort parameters during different winching operations under experimental conditions with a mini forestry crawler. Internal energy provision was determined by a portable spiroergometric device which was linked to beat-to-beat heart rate measurement. These data as well as the pulling force were assigned to the respective distance markers. After a small decrease over the first few meters, the pulling force increased as the pull-out distance increased. A maximum heart rate reserve of 67.3% and a metabolic equivalent (MET) of 11.6 were reached at the choking point in the flat winching direction. When winching was simulated uphill, peak values between 6.6 and 9.1 METs were reached at the end of the winching process. Winching with a remote-controlled mini forestry crawler over a distance of 50 m was rated as vigorous work, since METs of 6.0 for the entire work cycle were frequently exceeded. Thus, winching distances should be kept shorter in order to reduce metabolic strain. Moreover, winching teams should take active breaks and rotate work tasks during the working day to enable the necessary recovery.  aThis work was supported by the GFH—Gesellschaft zur Förderung der forst- und holzwirtschaftlichen Forschung an der Universität Freiburg im Breisgau e.V.; by the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) and the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB) within the framework of the “Förderrichtlinie Waldklimafond” (Grant 22WB304801); J.S. was supported by the European Social Fund and by the Ministry of Science, Research and Arts Baden-Württemberg.  aPublisher supplied data  a28W-B-3-048-01 3aenergy 3aforestry 3aforests 3aheart rate 3ahumans 3ametabolism 0aWinching 0alog extraction 0aspiroergometry 0apulling force 0awork fatigue1 aHoffmann, Stephan1 aJaeger, Dirk1 aPrettin, Stephan1 aSchweier, Janine0 tInternational journal of forest engineering.g2020 May 03, v. 31, no. 2 p.114-125dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2055x1913-22207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14942119.2020.17351983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015800166300001100324520156900335592002801904650001201932650001801944650001301962650001001975650001501985650001402000650001702014650001102031650001302042650001002055650001802065650001202083651001202095700002002107700002002127700002002147700002102167773010602188856008102294852000902375655001202384IND60574541920221117034318.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057454192DNAL7 a10.1007/s00114-017-1472-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVincent, Peggy10aNew insights on the systematics, palaeoecology and palaeobiology of a plesiosaurian with soft tissue preservation from the Toarcian of Holzmaden, Germany  ap. 51.  aThe Posidonienschiefer Formation (Toarcian) of Holzmaden, Baden-Württemberg in southwestern Germany has yielded several excellently preserved plesiosaurian specimens and received considerable research attention. The plesiosaurians found within these deposits are always significantly outnumbered by ichthyosaurs, and close examination of these rare specimens is crucial to a better understanding of the diversity and palaeoecology of Plesiosauria in this very peculiar ecosystem. The plesiosaurian specimen SMNS 51945 found in this area is a juvenile individual consisting of a partial, crushed skull and an exquisitely preserved post-cranial skeleton. Its anatomical characters seem to differ from the long-necked plesiosauroids Microcleidus brachypterygius and Seeleyosaurus guilelmiimperatoris that are the most abundant taxa within the plesiosaurian assemblage. The post-cranial skeleton preserves very likely soft tissues composed of buff-coloured and dark-coloured structures around the vertebral column and hindlimb of the animal. A network of buff-coloured fibres located posterior to the hindlimb most likely represents phosphatised collagen fibres as already found in some ichthyosaur specimens, confirming that wing area in plesiosaurians was much larger than that suggested by skeletal remains alone. The specimen also contains gastroliths (sand-sized grains mainly composed of quartz) in the stomach cavity suggesting the animal spent at least some of its time in shallow coastal waters, tens or hundreds of kilometres from the final place of burial.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3acoastal water 3acollagen 3acolor 3aecosystems 3ajuveniles 3apaleoecology 3aquartz 3askeleton 3askull 3aspine (bones) 3astomach 3aGermany1 aAllemand, Rémi1 aTaylor, Paul D.1 aSuan, Guillaume1 aMaxwell, Erin E.0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2017 June, v. 104, no. 5-6 p.51-51dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0028-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-017-1472-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03586naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001500165245011000180300001600290520209400306592002802400650002202428650001402450650001802464650001802482650001802500650002302518650001302541650003102554650002202585650003502607650002002642650001102662650001902673650003402692650004202726650004402768651001002812700001802822700002002840700001402860700002302874700001402897773009002911856008203001852000903083655001203092IND4471239720221122220647.0141110e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447123972DNAL7 a217044372pmid7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2011.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Hua10aEfficacy of hypocaloric parenteral nutrition for surgical patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis  ap. 730-737.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hypocaloric parenteral nutrition is an underfeeding strategy that lowers energy intake to around 20 kcal/kg/d. It is believed to achieve benefits by modulating metabolic responses and alleviating hyperglycemia. This study aims to systematically review the clinical efficacy of hypocaloric parenteral nutrition on surgical patients. METHODS: Medline, SCI, Embase, Cochrane Library, Chinese Biomedicine Database (CBM) and China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database (CNKI) were searched for studies published before July 1, 2010. Randomized control trials (RCTs) that compared hypocaloric PN with standard or higher energy PN in surgical patients were identified and included. Methodological quality assessment was based on Cochrane Reviewers’ Handbook and modified Jadad’s Score Scale. Statistical software RevMan 5.0 was used for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Five trials met all inclusion criteria and were included in the final meta-analysis. There were significant reductions in infectious complications (RR, 0.60; 95%CI 0.39–0.91, P = 0.02; I² = 38%) and length of hospitalization (LOS) associated with receiving hypocaloric PN (MD-2.49 days, 95%CI −3.88 to −1.11, P = 0.0004; I² = 48%). Stratified analysis of the smaller trials (<60) and larger trials demonstrated that the heterogeneity between trials was mainly associated with sample size. When smaller trials were excluded, hypocaloric PN was associated with reduction in infectious complications (RR, 0.21, 95%CI 0.06–0.72, P = 0.01, I2 = 0%) and shortening of LOS (MD, −2.32 days, 95%CI −3.72 to −0.93, P = 0.001, I² = 0%). CONCLUSION: Hypocaloric parenteral nutrition may reduce infectious complications and the length of hospitalization in post-operative patients. However, this conclusion is tentative due to patient type and sample size. Furthermore, in terms of hypocaloric PN, the actual energy amount still varies a great deal (from 15 kcal/kg/d to 20 kcal/kg/d). This suggests that further research, including larger randomized clinical trials is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3adatabases 3aenergy intake 3ahyperglycemia 3ameta-analysis 3aparenteral feeding 3apatients 3arandomized clinical trials 3asystematic review 2aCaloric Restrictionxstandards 2aHospitalization 2aHumans 2aLength of Stay 2aParenteral Nutritionxmethods 2aRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic 2aSurgical Procedures, Operativexmethods 3aChina1 aSun, Ming-Wei1 aHefright, Brook1 aChen, Wei1 aLu, Charles Damien1 aZeng, Jun0 tClinical nutrition.g2011 Dec., v. 30, no. 6 p.730-737dElsevier Ltdx0261-56147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2011.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003100153245015800184520166000342592002802002650002602030650001002056650001102066650001402077650001802091650001602109650001202125650001002137651001102147653002302158653001102181653001202192653001702204653001802221653001002239700001802249700001702267700003202284700001902316773011902335856008802454852000902542655001202551IND60716017420221118072507.0211213e20210320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071601742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1432492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCortés-Gómez, Adriana A.10aInorganic elements in live vs dead nesting olive ridley marine turtles in the Mexican Pacific: Introducing a new statistical methodology in ecotoxicology  aThis study reports the largest inorganic elements database in the blood of live marine turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea), with 241 live as well as 38 dead nesting turtles sampled and analyzed for 26 inorganic elements, including essential (Al, As, B, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Se, S, V, and Zn) and non-essential elements (Cd, Li, Pb, Sr, Ti, Tl, and Hg). We compared inorganic element concentrations in live and dead olive ridleys from the arribada beach “La Escobilla” located on the Pacific coast of southeastern Mexico. The most outstanding result of our study is the higher Cd concentration in dead (mean 4.27 μg g⁻¹ ww: min 0.01-max 81.5) compared with live animals (mean 0.14 μg g⁻¹ ww: min 0.02-max 0.52). This population has been previously reported to have the highest Cd concentration worldwide in kidney and liver samples from marine turtles (with 150.88 ± 110.99 and 82.88 ± 36.65 μg g⁻¹ ww, respectively). Other important findings of this study include the low Hg concentration along with the decrease in Pb over the years in this population. The study also uses a new statistical method – the iconography of correlations – in which all available information is used without removing individuals or variables with missing information for the whole analysis, which is a common problem in ecotoxicology. A major advantage of this method compared to other multivariate methods is that the missing information can be easily handled, because the correlations (2 variables) and partial correlations (3 variables) are estimated only with the available data using a one-at-a-time strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepidochelys olivacea 3ablood 3acoasts 3adatabases 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironment 3akidneys 3aliver 3aMexico 0aInorganic elements 0aMetals 0aCadmium 0aOlive ridley 0aMarine turtle 0aBlood1 aRomero, Diego1 aSantos, Juan1 aRivera-Hernández, José R.1 aGirondot, Marc0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Mar. 20, v. 761 p.143249-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1432493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03612naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001800180245013900198506007600337520168400413592002802097506003702125650004202162650002402204650002502228650003102253650001502284650002702299650001602326650001602342650001602358650001702374650001602391650002102407650001902428650002502447650001702472650001002489650001902499650001002518650002002528650000902548650001302557650002102570650002202591650002502613650001202638650002502650650003602675650002102711700001602732700001602748700001802764773012202782856007302904852000902977655001202986IND60650194620221207062123.0190709e20170911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065019462DNAL7 a10.3390/nu90910002doi7 aPMC56227602pmcid7 a288919832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Xuchong10aProtective Effects of Ethanolic Extracts from Artichoke, an Edible Herbal Medicine, against Acute Alcohol-Induced Liver Injury in Mice  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOxidative stress and inflammation are well-documented pathological factors in alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Artichoke (Cynara scolymus L.) is a healthy food and folk medicine with anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to evaluate the preventive effects of ethanolic extract from artichoke against acute alcohol-induced liver injury in mice. Male Institute of Cancer Research mice were treated with an ethanolic extract of artichoke (0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 g/kg body weight) by gavage once daily. Up to 40% alcohol (12 mL/kg body weight) was administered orally 1 h after artichoke treatment. All mice were fed for 10 consecutive days. Results showed that artichoke extract significantly prevented elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, triglyceride, total cholesterol, and malondialdehyde. Meanwhile, the decreased levels of superoxide dismutase and glutathione were elevated by artichoke administration. Histopathological examination showed that artichoke attenuated degeneration, inflammatory infiltration and necrosis of hepatocytes. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that expression levels of toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) in liver tissues were significantly suppressed by artichoke treatment. Results obtained demonstrated that artichoke extract exhibited significant preventive protective effect against acute alcohol-induced liver injury. This finding is mainly attributed to its ability to attenuate oxidative stress and suppress the TLR4/NF-κB inflammatory pathway. To the best of our knowledge, the underlying mechanisms of artichoke on acute ALD have been rarely reported.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCynara cardunculus subsp. cardunculus 3aToll-like receptors 3aalanine transaminase 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aartichokes 3aaspartate transaminase 3abody weight 3acholesterol 3aglutathione 3ahealthy diet 3ahepatocytes 3aherbal medicines 3ahistopathology 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainflammation 3aliver 3aliver diseases 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3amice 3anecrosis 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atissues 3atraditional medicine 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atriacylglycerols1 aWei, Ruofan1 aDeng, Aihua1 aLei, Tingping0 tNutrients.g2017 Sept. 11, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu90910003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03274naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245011800162300002000280520131500300592002801615596009801643596009801741596012801839596010301967650001402070650001502084650001502099650002302114650001102137650001302148650001802161650001102179650001502190653003202205653003202237653003002269653002102299653002702320700001302347700001302360700001702373700001502390700001602405700005202421700005402473773014102527856007902668852000902747655001202756IND60779498920221116151848.0220609e20220527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077949892DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c023172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Haisong10aMachine-Learning-Assisted Catalytic Performance Predictions of Single-Atom Alloys for Acetylene Semihydrogenation  ap. 25288-25296.  aSelective semihydrogenation of acetylene for the production of polymer-grade ethylene is a significant chemical industrial process. Facile activization of acetylene and weak adsorption of ethylene are critical requirements for high-performance catalysis. Single-atom alloys (SAAs) have strong binding effect on acetylene and weak effect on ethylene, which have been regarded as the superior catalysts for acetylene semihydrogenation. Herein, we established a pioneering machine learning (ML) assisted approach to investigate the reaction activity and selectivity of 70 SAA catalysts for acetylene semihydrogenation. As the most desirable ML model, the gradient boosting regression (GBR) algorithm has been extended to predict the energy barrier of *C₂Hₙ (n = 2–4) hydrogenation with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of only 0.02 eV. Notably, five candidate SAAs with excellent activity and selectivity for acetylene semihydrogenation are screened out via accessible descriptors. These data of ML prediction have been verified by DFT calculation with a high-accuracy (error less than 0.07 eV). This work demonstrates the potential of ML-assisted approach for predicting the energy barrier of transition state and simultaneously provides a convenient approach for the rational design of efficient catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data  a22172006cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a22173003cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2021YFC2103501cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002855  a2212012cNatural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipalitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004826 3aacetylene 3aadsorption 3aalgorithms 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy 3aethylene 3ahydrogenation 3amodels 3aprediction 0asingle-atom alloy catalysts 0aacetylene semihydrogenation 0adensity functional theory 0amachine learning 0aperformance prediction1 aDing, Hu1 aWang, Si1 aLiang, Yujie1 aDeng, Yuan1 aYang, Yusen1 aWei, Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5257-790X1 aZhang, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3559-20960 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 May 27, v. 14, no. 22 p.25288-25296dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c023173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03508naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005200150245013300202300001500335520194300350592002802293650001702321650001402338650002102352650001102373650001502384650001802399650003102417650003702448650000902485650001002494650002302504650001402527650001502541650001202556650002202568650001502590651001102605653004302616653001902659653002402678653001902702653002502721700002302746700001902769700002702788773008202815856008402897852000902981655001202990IND60580978020221122035142.0171005e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058097802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2016.06.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3122-017212aA new approach of monitoring and physically-based modelling to investigate urban wash-off process on a road catchment near Paris  ap. 96-108.  aNowadays, the increasing use of vehicles is causing contaminated stormwater runoff to drain from roads. The detailed understanding of urban wash-off processes is essential for addressing urban management issues. However, existing modelling approaches are rarely applied for these objectives due to the lack of realistic input data, unsuitability of physical descriptions, and inadequate documentation of model testing. In this context, we implement a method of coupling monitoring surveys with the physically-based FullSWOF (Full Shallow Water equations for Overland Flow) model (Delestre et al., 2014) and the process-based H-R (Hairsine-Rose) model (Hairsine and Rose, 1992a, 1992b) to evaluate urban wash-off process on a road catchment near Paris (Le Perreux sur Marne, Val de Marne, France, 2661 m2). This work is the first time that such an approach is applied for road wash-off modelling in the context of urban stormwater runoff. On-site experimental measurements have shown that only the finest particles of the road dry stocks could be transferred to the sewer inlet during rainfall events, and most Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are found in the particulate phase. Simulations over different rainfall events represent promising results in reproducing the various dynamics of water flows and sediment transports at the road catchment scale. Elementary Effects method is applied for sensitivity analysis. It is confirmed that settling velocity (Vs) and initial dry stocks (S) are the most influential parameters in both overall and higher order effects. Furthermore, flow-driven detachment seems to be insignificant in our case study, while raindrop-driven detachment is shown to be the major force for detaching sediment from the studied urban surface. Finally, a multiple sediment classification regarding the Particle Size Distribution (PSD) can be suggested for improving the model performance for future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aequations 3amodel validation 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aoverland flow 3aparticle size distribution 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arain 3aroads 3asediment transport 3asediments 3astormwater 3asurveys 3aurban development 3awatersheds 3aFrance 0aPhysically based and distributed model 0aUrban wash-off 0aHairsine-Rose model 0aFullSWOF model 0aSensitivity analysis1 aBonhomme, Céline,1 aLe, Minh-Hoang1 aChebbo, G.q(Ghassan),0 tWater research.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 102 p.96-108dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2016.06.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02206naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245009800173300001600271520108400287592002801371650001101399650001101410650001201421650001201433650001701445650001001462653001601472653001501488653002001503653001001523653001701533653001401550700002201564700002101586773012201607856008201729852000901811655001201820IND60543813220221118011533.0190412e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054381322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.asd.2014.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuřavová, Kateřina10aAge-related mandible abrasion in the groundhopper Tetrix tenuicornis (Tetrigidae, Orthoptera)  ap. 187-192.  aA study was conducted to determine whether the mandibles of the detrito-/bryophagous groundhopper Tetrix tenuicornis are subject to mechanical wear as a result of feeding, as is the case for grasshoppers that feed on silica-rich grasses. Abrasion was evaluated by measuring the length and width of the 3rd incisor and length of the 4th incisor in adults of different ages collected under natural conditions during one season. Although T. tenuicornis and other groundhoppers avoid feeding on grasses, we found that mandible abrasion increased with T. tenuicornis age. Age-related abrasion of the incisors of left and right mandibles was statistically significant in both sexes but the degree of abrasion was greater for females than males, apparently reflecting differences in the frequency and magnitude of feeding. Degree of abrasion also differed between right and left mandibles, probably because of differences in how each mandible is used during food processing. Abrasion of cuticular mandible structures may reduce the effectiveness of food processing late in the season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTetrix 3aadults 3afemales 3agrasses 3agrasshoppers 3amales 0aExoskeleton 0aMorphology 0aMechanical wear 0aAging 0aDetritophagy 0aBryophagy1 aHajduková, Lenka1 aKočárek, Petr,0 tArthropod structure & development.g2014 May, v. 43, no. 3 p.187-192dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl67358x1467-80397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.asd.2014.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02881naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245012900173300001600302520125200318592002801570650001801598650001901616650001401635650001301649650002201662650001701684650001601701650001101717650003101728650002101759650002101780650002101801650001501822650002101837650001101858650001701869650001201886650001001898653001401908653001701922653001001939653003301949700002601982700002402008700002602032700002602058700002402084773013502108856008702243852000902330655001202339IND60672994420221121040802.0200103e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067299442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYermak, Irina M.10aMucoadhesive properties of sulphated polysaccharides carrageenans from red seaweed families Gigartinaceae and Tichocarpaceae  ap. 634-642.  aThe mucoadhesive properties of different types of carrageenan (kappa-, kappa/beta-, iota/kappa- and lambda-CRGs) isolated from red seaweed families Gigartinaceae and Tichocarpaceae collected on the Pacific coast were studied. We examined the interaction between CRGs and pig stomach mucin in dilute aqueous solutions using a set of methods. Measurements of the dynamic light scattering of mucin in the presence of CRG showed that the polysaccharides cause aggregation of mucin particles, as confirmed by microscopy data. The addition of CRGs to solutions of mucin resulted in the formation of a mixture that changed the charge of mucin, especially in the case of kappa- and kappa/beta-CRGs. The interaction between CRG and porcine gastric mucin in the presence of various additives confirmed that hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions are complemented when CRG and mucin are mixed in an aqueous medium, which is also confirmed by in vitro methods based on measurements of work of adhesion and shear stress. Kappa- and kappa/beta-CRGs that contain 3,6-anhydro-α-d-galactopyranose chains (DA) have high molecular weight and exhibit a high density of available hydrogen bonding groups able to interact more strongly with mucin glycoproteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGigartinaceae 3aTichocarpaceae 3aadditives 3aadhesion 3aaqueous solutions 3abioadhesives 3acarrageenan 3acoasts 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrogen bonding 3ain vitro studies 3alight scattering 3amicroscopy 3amolecular weight 3amucins 3ashear stress 3astomach 3aswine 0aStructure 0aMucoadhesive 0aMucin 0aThe dynamic light scattering1 aDavydova, Viktoria N.1 aKravchenko, Anna O.1 aChistyulin, Dmitry A.1 aPimenova, Evgeniya A.1 aGlazunov, Valery P.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 142 p.634-642dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245016300170300001600333520132800349592002801677596005001705650002601755650003501781650001401816650002201830650001601852650001801868650001501886650001001901650002001911650001101931650001501942650001701957650001101974650001501985650001402000650001302014650003002027650001002057650001202067651001302079700002102092700001702113700002602130700002602156700002002182700001602202773012602218856008202344852000902426655001202435IND60699939320221122062439.0200624e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069993932DNAL7 a10.1007/s13313-020-00719-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, Saleem Ur10aCotton leaf curl Kokhran virus in association with Chili leaf curl betasatellite infecting mungbean (Vigna radiata.) and black gram (Vigna mungo.) in Pakistan  ap. 461-465.  aIn 2016, begomovirus-like symptoms were observed in mungbean (Vigna radiata) and black gram (Vigna mungo) in Pakistan. Symptomatic and asymptomatic leaf samples were collected and total genomic DNA was extracted. Full length begomovirus and betasatellite genomes were PCR amplified and cloned in plasmid pTZ/57RT cloning vector. The cloned molecules were subjected to Sanger sequencing. Based on Sequence Demarcation Tool, the begomovirus clone SR-3 identified in mungbean showed 94.50% highest identity with cotton leaf curl Kokhran virus-Kokhran (CLCuKoV-Ko), while the clone SR-5 isolated from black gram showed 99.7% highest identity with CLCuKoV-Ko. In phylogenetic tree analysis the identified isolates made a lower branch tree with CLCuKoV-Ko. The betasatellite clone SR-79 isolated from black gram showed 97% similarity with chili leaf curl betasatellite (ChLCB) and the betasatellite clone SR-93 isolated from mungbean showed 97.7% similarity with ChLCB. Southern blot analysis also confirmed the presence of CLCuKoV-Ko. This is the first report of CLCuKoV-Ko associated with ChLCB infecting both mungbean and black gram in Pakistan. This presents the new combination of disease complex and increase in host range of this virus species, which shows a real threat to other crops especially legume crops in Pakistan.  aPublisher supplied data  a58-6402-0-178FcAgricultural Research Service 3aBetasatellite (genus) 3aCotton leaf curl Kokhran virus 3aGossypium 3aSouthern blotting 3aVigna mungo 3aVigna radiata 3ablack gram 3acrops 3agenetic vectors 3agenome 3ahost range 3aleaf curling 3aleaves 3amung beans 3aphylogeny 3aplasmids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atrees 3aviruses 3aPakistan1 aZubair, Muhammad1 aAhmed, Nasim1 aRaz̤ā, G̲h̲ulām,1 aKhan, Muhammad Zuhaib1 aMansoor, Shahid1 aAmin, Imran0 tAustralasian plant pathology.g2020 July, v. 49, no. 4 p.461-465dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl32209x0815-31917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13313-020-00719-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02984naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014300169300001400312520136900326592002801695650002401723650002701747650002101774650002101795650002001816650002501836650001301861650002101874650003101895650001001926650001601936650001801952650001301970653001201983653002401995653001102019653002402030700001902054700001902073700001902092700001802111700001602129700001902145700001902164700001502183700005902198773010202257856008602359852000902445655001202454IND60531152120221118085312.0190318e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053115212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2016.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Min-Chul12aA brominated flame retardant 2,2⿲,4,4⿲ tetrabrominated diphenyl ether (BDE-47) leads to lipogenesis in the copepod Tigriopus japonicus  ap. 19-26.  aDe novo lipogenesis (DNL) is a fatty acid synthesis process that requires several genes, including sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP), ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). DNL up-regulation is able to induce fat accumulation through an increase in fatty acids. To investigate the relationship between DNL up-regulation and the accumulation of fatty acids and lipid droplets in response to 2,2⿲,4,4⿲ tetrabrominated diphenyl ether (BDE-47), we examined DNL in the copepod Tigriopus japonicus. Transcription levels of DNL-related genes were increased after exposure to 2.5μg/L BDE-47 for 24h. After exposure to 2.5μg/L BDE-47, palmitic acid was significantly increased (P<0.05) at days 1 and 4, along with upregulation of fatty acid synthesis-related genes (e.g., desaturases and elongases). However, docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid were down-regulated at days 1 and 4, showing an antagonistic effect. Lipid droplet area significantly increased in Nile red staining analysis after 24h of exposure to 2.5μg/L BDE-47 in T. japonicus, while DNL was down-regulated in response to 500μM salicylate (a lipogenesis inhibitor), indicating that BDE-47 exposure is closely associated with an increase in fatty acids in this copepod.

Finally, salicylaldehyde, 4-OH-benzaldehyde, and 4-OH-benzoic acid which were detected at Level 1 identification confidence were suggested as indicator chemicals of toluene and phenol exposure in the contaminated field.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3acarboxylation 3ahydroxybenzaldehyde 3amass spectrometry 3aoxidation 3aphenol 3asoil 3atoluene 0aSuspect/non-target screening 0aToluene 0aPhenol 0aDegradation 0aTransformation products1 aChoo, Gyojin1 aChoi, Younghun1 aJeon, Junho1 aOh, Jeong-Eun0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 May 15, v. 430 p.128429-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1284293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011300168520182300281592002802104650002102132650001002153650001902163650001602182650001402198650001702212650004302229650001802272650002002290650001402310650000902324650001302333650001802346651001802364700001602382700001502398700001402413700001802427700001102445700001602456700001402472773013402486856008502620852000902705655001202714IND60672830720221119084419.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067283072DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz048.P11-057-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Xiaokun10aRRR-α-tocopherol as a Predominant Stereo-isomer in Chinese Breast Milk During Lactation Stages (P11-057-19)  aHuman milk is the most important source for neonates to acquire adequate vitamin E for their immune system and brain growth. Among all tocopherols, infant brain discriminates in favor of the natural occurring RRR-α-tocopherol against the synthetic α-tocopherol stereoisomers and other tocopherols. However, the stereoisomer profiles of α-tocopherol in Chinese human milk have not been previously reported. This study aimed to analyze the stereoisomer profile of α-tocopherol in Chinese human milk over different lactation stages. Colostrum (day 0–7), transitional milk (day 8–15) and mature milk (day 40–45) were collected longitudinally from 89 healthy lactating mothers of full-term, singleton delivery. The levels of α-tocopherol stereoisomers (RRR, RSR, RSS, RRS, Σ2S) were determined by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. In three lactation stages, RRR-α-tocopherol is the predominated stereoisomers in Chinese human milk (P < 0.0001), accounting for an average proportion of 85% of total α-tocopherol. In contrast, the ratios of the synthetic stereoisomers were RRS, 5.10-6.02%; RSR, 2.32-3.31%, RSS, 2.66-2.85%; and Σ2S, 2.89%-3.49%. The mean total α-tocopherol was 9.20mg/L in colostrum but sharply declined to 4.10 mg/L in mature milk. After taking the different breastfeeding volumes over lactation stages into consideration, Chinese human milk constantly provided about 3.5 mg/day α-tocopherol and 2.98 mg/day RRR-α-tocopherol to infants. RRR-α-tocopherol is the predominated stereoisomer in Chinese human milk over different lactation stages. Chinese breastmilk supply higher % of RRR- stereoisomer as 85% of total α-tocopherol than US report as 75%. There is, therefore, a demand to add matched level of RRR- α-tocopherol in Chinese formula.

In this work, we have developed the binary catalyst system (ZnCo₂O₄/inorganic salt) for chemical fixation of CO₂ with epoxides into cyclic carbonates without solvent, and all reactions were performed on a large scale using a 100 ml batch reactor. Two mesoporous catalysts of ZnCo₂O₄ with different architecture, such as flakes (ZnCo–F) and spheres (ZnCo–S) were synthesized and utilized as a heterogeneous catalyst for cycloaddition reaction. The bifunctional property of catalysts is mainly attributed to strong acidic and basic properties confirmed by TPD (NH₃ & CO₂) analysis. The ZnCo–F catalyst exhibited excellent conversion of propylene oxide (99.9%) with good corresponding selectivity of propylene carbonate (≥99%) in the presence of inorganic salt (KI) at 120 °C, 2 MPa, 3 h. In addition, ZnCo–F catalyst demonstrated good catalytic applicability towards the various substrates scope of the epoxide. Furthermore, the catalytic properties were examined by evaluating the reaction parameter such as catalyst loading, pressure, temperature and time. The proposed catalyst exhibited good reusability for cycloaddition reaction without significant change in its catalytic activity and proposed a possible reaction mechanism for chemical fixation of CO₂ with epoxide into cyclic carbonate over ZnCo–F/KI.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatch systems 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonates 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acycloaddition reactions 3aenvironmental management 3aepoxides 3aporous media 3apropylene 3apropylene oxide 3areaction mechanisms 3asolvents 3asynergism 3atemperature 0aCO2 utilization 0aHeterogeneous catalysis 0aCyclic carbonates 0aInorganic salt 0aMetal oxide1 aJadhav, Harsharaj S.1 aKim, Hern0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 298 p.113433-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1134333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03750naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100002100158245015400179300001600333520237000349592002802719650001902747650001002766650001902776650004502795650001802840650001302858650001102871650003502882650002402917650001402941650001702955650001402972653000702986653001602993653001703009653001303026653000903039700005903048773010703107856009303214852000903307655001203316IND60540549420221120113151.0190318e20150301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054054942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2014.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRantala, Mari H.10aLH secretion around induced ovulation during early and late diestrus and its effect on the appearance of short estrous cycles in cyclic dairy heifers  ap. 497-503.  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the stage of the estrus cycle (early vs. late diestrus) on the LH secretion after induced ovulation and on the incidence of short estrous cycles in dairy heifers. Cyclic heifers were presynchronized with dexcloprostenol and divided into Groups D7 (n = 6) and D14 (n = 6). On Day 7 (D7) or Day 14 (D14) after ovulation (Day 0), all animals were treated with dexcloprostenol followed by 0.1 mg of gonadorelin (GnRH) 24 hours later. Blood samples were taken daily for progesterone (P4) analysis and for LH analysis every 10 minutes for 3 hours on Days 1, 3, and 5 and every 30 minutes for 6 hours starting just before GnRH administration. In a control group, Group C (n = 7), estrus was synchronized with an intravaginal progesterone-releasing device (CIDR) inserted for 9 days. Blood for P4 analysis was taken daily for 16 days and for LH analysis every 30 minutes for 31 hours starting 30 hours after CIDR removal (unmanipulated LH peak) and every 10 minutes for 3 hours on Days 1, 3, and 5 after ovulation. In all groups, ovarian structures and ovulation were detected via daily transrectal ultrasound examination around first and second ovulation. In D7, all cycles (6/6) were shorter than normal (range 7–9 days). In D14, 2 of the 6 animals had a short cycle (both 7 days) whereas 4 had a cycle of normal length. All cycles were of normal length in C. Animals in D7 and D14 were divided according to their cycle length into short (SC) and normal (NC) cycle groups. The mean size of the ovulatory follicle during the 3 days before ovulation was significantly different between D7 and D14 and on 3 days and 1 day before ovulation between SC and NC. Secretion of LH during the 6 hours after GnRH administration did not differ between D7 and D14, or SC and NC. The mean basal LH secretion in D7 and D14 on Days 1, 3, and 5 was significantly different. No difference on those days was noted between SC and NC. In conclusion, when ovulation is induced with GnRH 24 hours after giving dexcloprostenol, short estrous cycles can occur during both early and late diestrus. The preovulatory LH surge did not differ between D7 and D14, or SC and NC. Also, basal LH secretion on Days 1, 3, and 5 was similar in SC and NC, and lower basal LH concentration coincided with higher P4 concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal ovaries 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3acontrolled internal drug release devices 3adairy heifers 3adiestrus 3aestrus 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3aluteinizing hormone 3aovulation 3aprogesterone 3asecretion 0aLH 0aShort cycle 0aProgesterone 0aDiestrus 0aGnRH1 aTaponen, Juhani1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6200-38380 tTheriogenology.g2015 Mar. 01, v. 83, no. 4 p.497-503dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2014.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03793naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245018900168520248300357592002802840650001902868650001902887650002002906650001302926650002802939650001902967650001502986650003103001650001203032650001503044650002403059650001303083651001203096700002103108700001803129700002003147773013403167856008503301852000903386655001203395IND60672830820221119084408.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067283082DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz048.P11-058-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChehab, Rana10aC-section Delivery Is a Barrier to and Demographic-maternal-child Factors Have Mixed Effects on the Length of Exclusive Breastfeeding Under Nutrition Transition in Lebanon (P11-058-19)  aThe study aims to: estimate the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding in Lebanon; and examine socio-demographic, maternal, and child-related determinants associated with exclusive breastfeeding for 40 days and 6 months. In a cross-sectional study of a nationally representative sample of 1005 Lebanese mother-child dyads, mothers of children < 5 years completed face-to-face interviews about child feeding practices, socio-demographic, maternal, and child characteristics. Exclusive breastfeeding versus mixed feeding or exclusive bottle feeding at 40 days or versus mixed feeding or bottle and solid feeding at 6 months served as the dependent variables. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted and adjusted for significant covariates with P < 0.10 in the unadjusted analysis. For all other analyses, P < 0.05 indicated statistical significance. 41% and 12% of the children were exclusively breastfed for 40 days and 6 months, respectively. Compared to the mixed fed or exclusively bottle fed at 40 days, the older the child at the interview the higher the odds by 1.4% per month of exclusive breastfeeding, whereas children delivered via C-section had a 26% or 53% lower odds of exclusively breastfeeding respectively. Also, compared to the exclusively bottle fed at 40 days, children in families with 3 + siblings had a 73% higher odds of exclusively breastfeeding, while children in families owning 2 + cars had a 58% lower odds of exclusively breastfeeding. Compared to the mixed fed at 6 months, children of overweight or obese mothers at the interview had 45% or 53% lower odds of exclusively breastfeeding respectively, whereas heavier children at the interview had a 10% per kg higher odds of exclusively breastfeeding. Compared to the bottle and solid fed at 6 months, children delivered via C-section and those in families owning 2 + cars had a lower odds of exclusively breastfeeding by 62% and 58% respectively. Socio-demographic, maternal and child characteristics influenced infant feeding practices over time in Lebanon. C-section delivery was consistently associated with a lower odds of exclusive breastfeeding for 40 days and 6 months. Reducing elective C-section delivery would enhance exclusive breastfeeding in a population undergoing social and nutrition transition.

However, few studies have assessed the effects of microplastics on higher plants. In this study, we investigated the influence of polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs, 50 mg L⁻¹), with four different particle sizes (100, 300, 500, and 700 nm), on the physiological and biochemical indexes of cucumber leaves. The biomass of cucumber plants significantly decreased after exposure to 300 nm PSNPs. Similarly, the chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, soluble sugar, carotenoid, and proline content, as well as the fluorescence of cucumber leaves were significantly reduced by 100 nm PSNPs. Malondialdehyde, proline, peroxidase gene expression and enzyme activity, and hydrogen peroxide content significantly increased in cucumber leaves exposed to 700 nm PSNPs. In addition, increasing PSNPs particle size led to decreased relative expression levels and activities of the major antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase, while vitamin C and soluble protein content significantly increased. Overall, our results indicated that PSNPs affect the photosynthetic, antioxidant, and sugar metabolism systems of cucumber leaves, with the latter clearly affecting the total biomass of cucumber plants. The benzene ring resulting from the degradation of PSNPs in cucumber leaves may be the main factor affecting chlorophyll metabolism and sugar metabolism. Our findings provide a scientific basis for the risk assessment of PSNPs exposure in soil-plant systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumis sativus 3aagricultural land 3aantioxidant enzymes 3aascorbic acid 3abenzene 3abiomass 3acarotenoids 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3acucumbers 3adegradation 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescence 3agene expression 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaves 3amalondialdehyde 3ananoplastics 3aparticle size 3aperoxidase 3aphotosynthesis 3aphysiological response 3apollution 3apolystyrenes 3aproline 3aprotein content 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aPolystyrene 0aCucumber 0aPhysiological indexes 0aBiochemical indexes1 aLi, Ruijing1 aLi, Qingfei1 aZhou, Junguo1 aWang, Guangyin0 tChemosphere.g2020 Sept., v. 255 p.127041-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1270413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04168naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245013200174300001600306520194900322592002802271650001902299650001502318650001802333650001202351650001302363650001402376650002002390650001702410650003102427650002902458650001002487650003602497650001102533650002202544650001102566650002002577650001502597650001902612650002102631650001902652650001802671650001302689650001702702650002102719650001202740650001002752650002602762650001302788650002002801650002102821650001902842650002102861653002302882653001302905653002302918653001502941653002402956700002202980700001703002700006803019700002603087700001503113700001603128700002003144700005603164773009103220856009003311852000903401655001203410IND60633549020221117223449.0190425e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063354902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.03.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUlhassan, Zaid10aDual behavior of selenium: Insights into physio-biochemical, anatomical and molecular analyses of four Brassica napus cultivars  ap. 329-341.  aSelenium (Se) is a prerequisite metalloid for humans and animals. But, its essentialness or phytotoxicity is still obscure. Here, we investigated the dual effects of sodium selenite (0, 25, 50 or 100 μM) on the physio-biochemical, anatomical and molecular alterations in different Brassicca napus L. cultivars (viz. Zheda 619, Zheda 622, ZY 50, and ZS 758). Findings revealed that Se-supplementation markedly boosted the plant growth and biomasses by improving mineral uptake, water-soluble protein, sugar, photosynthetic efficiency regarding the pigments and gas exchange parameters. Higher Se-levels impaired the photosynthetic efficiency, deplete nutrients-uptake, osmotic stress by proline accumulation and higher Se-accumulation in roots led to growth and biomass reduction. Se-supplementation minimized the accumulation of ROS (hydrogen peroxide, superoxide radical), malondialdehyde and methylglyoxal (MG) levels by activating the enzymes engaged in AsA-GSH cycle and ROS-MG detoxification. But, elevated-Se impaired the oxidative metabolism by desynchronizing the antioxidants as revealed by decreasing levels of ascorbic acid, activities and expression levels of catalase, glutathione reductase, and dehydro-ascorbate reductase. Up-regulation of secondary metabolites genes (PAL, PPO) revealed the role of Se in regulating transcriptional networks involved in oxidative stress. The damages in leaf and root ultra-structures disclosed the Se-phytotoxicity. Together, outcomes uncovered the protective mechanism of Se (till 25 μM) by reinforcing the plant morphology, photosynthesis, osmo-protection, redox balance, enzyme activities for ROS-MG detoxification by reducing ROS and MG components. Excessive-Se prompt phytotoxicity by impairing above mentioned parameters, especially at 100 μM Se. Among all B. napus cultivars, Zheda 622 was discovered as highly-susceptible and ZS 758 showed greatest-tolerance against Se stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3aaerobiosis 3aascorbic acid 3abiomass 3acatalase 3acultivars 3aenzyme activity 3agas exchange 3agene expression regulation 3agene regulatory networks 3agenes 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaves 3amalondialdehyde 3ametalloids 3aosmotic stress 3aoxidative stress 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytotoxicity 3apigments 3aplant growth 3aplant morphology 3aproline 3aroots 3asecondary metabolites 3aselenium 3asodium selenite 3asuperoxide anion 3aultrastructure 3awater solubility 0aBrassicca napus L. 0aSelenium 0aPhysio-biochemical 0aAnatomical 0aMolecular profiling1 aGill, Rafaqat Ali1 aAli, Skhawat1 aMwamba, Theodore Mulembo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2235-32081 aBaṣārat Alī, Es.,1 aWang, Jian1 aHuang, Qian1 aAziz, Rukhsanda1 aZhou, Weijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1471-96440 tChemosphere.g2019 June, v. 225 p.329-341dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.03.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245011600154520146300270592002801733650002301761650001101784650002301795650002301818650002001841650001201861650002201873650002001895650002201915650001501937650001901952650003001971650001702001650001302018651001002031700001402041700001402055700001602069700001802085700001802103700001702121773012602138856007302264852000902337655001202346IND60651829620221121063150.0190712e20160819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065182962DNAL7 a10.3390/su80808162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Caiyao10aEcological Security and Ecosystem Services in Response to Land Use Change in the Coastal Area of Jiangsu, China  aUrbanization, and the resulting land use/cover change, is a primary cause of the degradation of coastal wetland ecosystems. Reclamation projects are seen as a way to strike a balance between socioeconomic development and maintenance of coastal ecosystems. Our aim was to understand the ecological changes to Jiangsu’s coastal wetland resulting from land use change since 1977 by using remote sensing and spatial analyses. The results indicate that: (1) The area of artificial land use expanded while natural land use was reduced, which emphasized an increase in production-orientated land uses at the expense of ecologically important wetlands; (2) It took 34 years for landscape ecological security and 39 years for ecosystem services to regain equilibrium. The coastal reclamation area would recover ecological equilibrium only after a minimum of 30 years; (3) The total ecosystem service value decreased significantly from $2.98 billion per year to $2.31 billion per year from 1977 to 2014. Food production was the only one ecosystem service function that consistently increased, mainly because of government policy; (4) The relationship between landscape ecological security and ecosystem services is complicated, mainly because of the scale effect of landscape ecology. Spatial analysis of changing gravity centers showed that landscape ecological security and ecosystem service quality became better in the north than the south over the study period.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoastal ecosystems 3acoasts 3aecological balance 3aecosystem services 3afood production 3agravity 3aissues and policy 3aland use change 3alandscape ecology 3alandscapes 3aremote sensing 3asocioeconomic development 3aurbanization 3awetlands 3aChina1 aPu, Lijie1 aZhu, Ming1 aLi, Jianguo1 aChen, Xinjian1 aWang, Xiaohan1 aXie, Xuefeng0 tSustainability.g2016 Aug. 19, v. 8, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su80808163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011900174520143800293592002801731650001401759650001301773650001401786650001501800650002101815650001301836650001601849650001401865650002501879650001901904651001001923700001901933700002001952700001701972700001901989700001602008773013402024856008502158852000902243655001202252IND60672831120221119084701.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067283112DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz048.P11-061-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChowdhury, Ranadip10aVitamin D Status in Early Childhood and Neurodevelopment and Growth at Age 6–9 Years in North India (P11-061-19)  aThe extent to which vitamin-D deficiency (< 10 ng/ml) is associated with neurodevelopment and linear growth in middle childhood. The study is a follow-up of a factorial randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial in 1000 North Indian children 6 to 30 months at enrolment, receiving daily 2 RDAs of vitamin B12 and/or folic acid or placebo for 6 months. When the children were 6–9 years old, we included 791 for cognitive assessments with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4ᵗʰ edition ᴵᴺᴰᴵᴬ (WISC-IV), Crichton Verbal Scale (CVS), NEPSY-II and BRIEF 2 and linear growth. Multiple logistic and linear regressions were used to examine the association between vitamin-D deficiency at baseline and neurodevelopment and growth in middle childhood. Among the 791 children who consented to participate, baseline Vitamin D status was available for 716 children who were included in this analysis. Of these, 251 (35.1%) were vitamin-D deficient (< 10 ng/ml). There were no significant differences in any of the cognitive outcomes between vitamin-D deficient and non-deficient children. Also, we did not find any association between linear growth at follow up and vitamin D deficiency at baseline. The results from this analysis do not support that vitamin-D deficiency in early childhood is important for growth and neurodevelopment in middle childhood.

The present study assessed the diagnostic accuracy of 36-week anthropometric measures, including corresponding < 10th and < 3rd percentile cut points to predict NDI in preterm infants. This study included data from the PreM Growth Cohort Study for preterm infants < 30 weeks of gestational age (GA) and birth weights < 1500 grams. The accuracy with which measured weight, length and head circumference z-scores can predict cognitive impairment (Bayley-III Cognitive Composite score < 80) at 21 months corrected age (born in 2005–2014) and intellectual impairment (Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-3rd and 4th Edition (Intellectual test) score < 70) at 3-years corrected age (born in 2001–2014) was determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). At 21 months 98/621 (15.8%) of infants had low Bayley scores and 57/613 (9.3%) had low Intellectual test scores at 3 years. None of the AUROCs exceeded 0.6 and none were significantly different from 0.5. Sensitivities and specificities for the 10ᵗʰ and 3ʳᵈ percentile cut points were equally poor, with most not exceeding 70% (Figures). The findings were similar between the Fenton 2013 and INTERGROWTH 2015 growth charts. The addition of morbidities increased the accuracy of predicting cognitive impairments except for infants with cerebral palsy, other morbidities had relatively marginal associations with impairment. Preterm infant measures of weight, length, and head circumference z-scores at 36 weeks, including corresponding < 10th and < 3rd percentile cut points, are not accurate as predictors of NDI. This study confirms previous findings that preterm infants show some “catch up” in weight relative to growth references between 37–44 weeks GA.

Thus, resilience should not be viewed as a normative desirable goal, but as a descriptor of complex systems dynamics. From this perspective, we apply resilience thinking concepts to assess the dynamics of inequality, spatial segregation, and sustainability in Chile’s capital city of Santiago. Chile’s economy boosted since democracy was restored in 1990, but continuity of neoliberal reforms and transformations of Pinochet’s dictatorship (1973–1990) seem to have locked Chilean cities in resilient, albeit unsustainable, patterns of uneven development. Socio-economic data from Santiago shows highly resilient patterns of urban inequality and segregation from 1992 to 2009 despite democratic efforts, political agendas and discourses packed with calls for reducing poverty and inequality. We present a conceptual model based on the notion of stability landscapes to explore potential trade-offs between resilience and sustainable development. We mapped Santiago’s spatio-temporal inequality trends and explored if these patterns support an inequality-resilience stability landscape. Analysis of temporal and spatial distribution of development assets across four human development dimensions (i.e., income, education, health, democracy) revealed potential socio-political and spatial feedbacks supporting the resilience of inequality and segregation in Santiago. We argue that urban sustainability may require breaking this resilience, a process where bottom-up stressors such as social movements could play a key role.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3acollective action 3aeducation 3ahuman development 3aincome 3alandscapes 3amodels 3apolitics 3apoverty 3asocioeconomics 3asustainable development 3aChile1 aManuel-Navarrete, David1 aTorres-Salinas, Robinson0 tSustainability.g2016 Aug. 19, v. 8, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su80808203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003300148245015800181300001600339520153300355592002801888650001601916650002601932650001301958650001001971650002001981650002502001650003002026650001402056650003002070650003002100650004502130651000902175700001402184700001502198700001502213700001902228773012602247856008202373852000902455655001202464IND60699940020221119114831.0200624e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069994002DNAL7 a10.1007/s13313-020-00712-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsmaeilzadeh-Hosseini, S.

Polymerase chain reaction using primers P1/P7 and nested PCR using the same primers followed by R16mF2/R16mR2 and R16F2n/R16R2 primer pairs amplified the 16S ribosomal RNA-encoding gene in all the symptomatic plants tested, but not in the asymptomatic ones. RFLP analysis of R16F2n/R16R2 amplicons with AluI, HaeIII, HhaI, HpaI, HpaII, RsaI, MseI and TaqI restriction enzymes showed profiles referable to 16SrII, 16SrVI, 16SrIX, 16SrXII and 16SrXXIX phytoplasma ribosomal groups indicating also the presence of mixed infection in several samples. The identity percentage and the phylogeny obtained after direct sequencing of selected 16S rRNA-encoding gene sequences (R16F2n/R2 amplicons) from symptomatic S. alopecuroides confirmed the presence of phytoplasma strains related to ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma omanense’ (group 16SrXXIX), ‘Ca.

Moreover, in a few samples/amplicons, 16SrXII-A, 16SrIX-H, 16SrVI-F and 16SrXXIX-A phytoplasma subgroups were identified by real and virtual RFLP analyses. The other phytoplasmas detected were classified in subgroups 16SrII-D and 16SrVI-A. This is the first report of the presence of 16SrII and 16SrXXIX phytoplasma groups and of mixed infection of phytoplasma strains belonging to groups 16SrII, 16SrVI, 16SrIX, 16SrXII and 16SrXXIX in S. alopecuroides worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytoplasma 3aSophora alopecuroides 3adwarfing 3agenes 3amixed infection 3anucleotide sequences 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction endonucleases 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aIran1 aSatta, E.1 aBabaei, G.1 aSalehi, M.1 aBertaccini, A.0 tAustralasian plant pathology.g2020 July, v. 49, no. 4 p.403-411dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl32209x0815-31917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13313-020-00712-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001800158245014300176300001600319520172700335592002802062650001502090650001002105650001802115650002002133650001202153650001402165653001802179653002202197653002002219653002402239653001602263700002102279700005902300700001802359773010702377856009302484852000902577655001202586IND60540549920221120113328.0190318e20150115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054054992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2014.08.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGinther, O.J.10aConversion of intraovarian patterns from preovulation to postovulation based on location of dominant follicle and corpus luteum in heifers  ap. 153-161.  aThe conversion of preovulatory intraovarian patterns based on location of the preovulatory follicle (PF) and the associated corpus luteum (cl) to postovulatory patterns based on location of the future and established dominant follicle (DF) and corpus luteum (CL) was studied daily in 26 heifers from Days −5 to 6 (Day 0 = ovulation). The two ipsilateral preovulatory patterns were PF–cl and devoid (neither PF nor cl), and the two contralateral patterns were PF and cl. The postovulatory patterns were DF–CL, devoid, DF, and CL. For the contralateral preovulatory relationships, a conversion from PF to DF–CL and the accompanying conversion from cl to devoid occurred most frequently (17 of 18 conversions, 94%). For the ipsilateral preovulatory relationships, a conversion from PF–cl to CL and from devoid to DF occurred most frequently (6 of 8, 75%). Number of 2-mm follicles during preovulation was greatest (P < 0.05) for the devoid and PF patterns, and number of 6-mm follicles during postovulation was greatest (P < 0.05) for the DF–CL and DF patterns. Blood flow resistance at a color Doppler signal in the ovarian pedicle indicated increasing ovarian perfusion over days in the PF to DF–CL and devoid to DF conversions and decreasing perfusion in the PF–cl to CL and cl to devoid conversions. In addition to formation of the CL from the PF, it was interpreted that the conversion of patterns involved number of newly emerging 2-mm follicles per ovary before ovulation and a continuation of the preovulatory angioarchitecture into postovulation. Results supported the novel hypothesis that the four preovulatory intraovarian patterns determine the frequency of the four postovulatory patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood flow 3acolor 3acorpus luteum 3aflow resistance 3aheifers 3aovulation 0aCorpus luteum 0aDominant follicle 0aFollicular wave 0aIntraovarian effect 0aVascularity1 aSiddiqui, M.A.R.1 aBaldrighi, J.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2915-07771 aHoffman, M.M.0 tTheriogenology.g2015 Jan. 15, v. 83, no. 2 p.153-161dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2014.08.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02441naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245009000176300001600266520133600282592002801618650001301646650002501659650002201684650001901706650001401725650001101739650002401750650002401774650001301798700003701811700002601848773012601874856008202000852000902082655001202091IND60699940120221119114825.0200624e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069994012DNAL7 a10.1007/s13313-020-00697-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMattos, Amanda do Prado10aDetermination of the severity of Septoria leaf spot in tomato by using digital images  ap. 329-356.  aThe aim of this study is to determine the severity of the disease Septoria leaf spot in tomato plants, through computational analysis of digital images of leaves affected. We collected and obtained digital images of tomato leaves with absence and presence of the disease with varying degrees of severity. From a script written in R with the EBImage package, the image was decomposed into three levels of color (RGB) and, through the process of thresholding the image segmentation, was performed separating sheet and injuries in relation to the background, determining the percentage of damaged area. Statistical properties were extracted from the original images and, from them and the severity quantified by software, was realized the process of correlation and regression analysis to indicate a template that determines the percentage of damaged area through the properties of the images. Subsequently, these models were tested, with a new image bank, from the RMSE error measures. The methodology described, was able to identify and quantify the damaged areas of the leaves with symptoms of diseases, extract the statistical properties of the images as allowed to predict mathematical models with acceptable potential and quality for indirect determination of the percentage of injured area through the properties of the images.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSeptoria 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3acomputer software 3adigital images 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3amathematical models 3aregression analysis 3atomatoes1 aTolentino Júnior, João Batista1 aItako, Adriana Terumi0 tAustralasian plant pathology.g2020 July, v. 49, no. 4 p.329-356dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl32209x0815-31917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13313-020-00697-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013800167520118100305592002801486650002801514650001201542650002901554650001601583650001301599650001901612650001901631650001301650650003301663650001901696650002201715650001501737650001601752650001101768650002001779653001701799653002801816653002601844653001201870653002301882700001701905700001701922700001801939700001801957700001701975700001401992700001502006773011302021856008602134852000902220655001202229IND60767151120221120225827.0220509e20220515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076715112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1284442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chunyan13aAn amidase and a novel phenol hydroxylase catalyze the degradation of the antibacterial agent triclocarban by Rhodococcus rhodochrous  aTriclocarban (TCC) is an emerging and intractable environmental contaminant due to its hydrophobicity and chemical stability. However, the antibacterial property of TCC limits its biodegradation, and only the functional enzyme TccA involved in TCC degradation has been characterized to date. In this study, we report a highly efficient TCC-degrading bacterium, Rhodococcus rhodochrous BX2, that could degrade and mineralize TCC (10 mg/L) by 76.8% and 56.5%, respectively, within 5 days. Subsequently, the TCC biodegradation pathway was predicted based on the detection of metabolites using modern mass spectrometry techniques. Furthermore, an amidase (TccS) and a novel phenol hydroxylase (PHIND) encoded by the tccS and PHIND genes, respectively, were identified by genomic and transcriptomic analyses of strain BX2, and these enzymes were further unequivocally proven to be the key enzymes responsible for the metabolism of TCC and its intermediate 4-chloroaniline (4-CA) by using a combination of heterologous expression and gene knockout. Our results shed new light on the mechanism of TCC biodegradation and better utilization of microbes to remediate TCC contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodococcus rhodochrous 3aamidase 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3agene targeting 3agenomics 3aheterologous gene expression 3ahydrophobicity 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3aphenol 3atranscriptomics 0aTriclocarban 0aRhodococcus rhodochrous 0aDegradation mechanism 0aAmidase 0aPhenol hydroxylase1 aSun, Yueling1 aSun, Guanjun1 aZang, Hailian1 aSun, Shanshan1 aZhao, Xinyue1 aHou, Ning1 aLi, Dapeng0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 May 15, v. 430 p.128444-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1284443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03212naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005800153245022700211520150100438592002801939650001401967650001701981650001201998650001902010650003002029650003702059650001002096650001102106650002402117650000902141650001502150650001402165651001102179653002002190653000902210653000902219653001902228653003002247700006802277700001902345700005802364700002302422700001802445700005702463773010102520856008802621852000902709655001202718IND60709463720221119042649.0201104e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070946372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2020.1047492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGardes, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9545-929X10aTemporal trends, sources, and relationships between sediment characteristics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in sediment cores from the major Seine estuary tributary, France  aTemporal trends in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were reconstructed from sediment cores collected in the Martot and Les Damps ponds, downstream of the Eure River watershed. PAHs exhibited a positive correlation with fine fractions, but mainly with the refractory organic carbon measured in the sediments, which suggests PAH inputs from materials largely composed of refractory carbon (e.g. soot). Since around the 1940s, PAH concentrations ranged between 2.93–38.20 and 2.27–28.20 mg kg⁻¹ in sediment cores from the Martot and Les Damps ponds, respectively. Based on the temporal distribution of isomers and diagnostic ratios, the PAHs in the sediments were found to be predominantly of pyrogenic origin, particularly in the 1940s–1960s, when PAH levels were particularly high. PCBs also showed an affinity with the fine fraction and with refractory organic carbon, albeit less so than PAHs. Since around the 1940s, PCB concentrations ranged between 0.02–1.57 in Martot Pond and 0.09–1.60 mg kg⁻¹ in Les Damps Pond. The recorded PCB temporal trends were mainly associated with the production, consumption, and banning of these chemicals in France. According to the temporal distribution of PCB congeners, high levels in the 1950s–1970s were linked to “technical mixture” discharges into waterways, which were mainly composed of “low chlorinated congeners”, whereas PCB levels after the 1970s were of atmospheric origin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aestuaries 3ageochemistry 3aisomers 3aorganic carbon 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aponds 3arivers 3asediment properties 3asoot 3awatersheds 3awaterways 3aFrance 0aTemporal trends 0aPAHs 0aPCBs 0aSediment cores 0aRefractory organic carbon1 aPortet-Koltalo, Florence1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8665-18561 aDebret, Maxime1 aHumbert, Kevin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7116-588X1 aLevaillant, Romain1 aSimon, Michel1 aCopard, Yoann1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6073-51000 tApplied geochemistry.g2020 Nov., v. 122 p.104749-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2020.1047493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03489naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005800155245009800213300001600311520184000327592002802167650001602195650001502211650002202226650001502248650001802263650001402281650002002295650001902315650000902334650001102343650001402354650001002368650001102378650001802389650001302407650001502420650002502435653001402460653002602474653000802500653002002508653002902528653002702557700005602584700002102640700002002661700001902681700001602700700001702716773009102733856009002824852000902914655001202923IND60633549520221117223311.0190425e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063354952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.03.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPohl, Johannes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8120-801910aEmbryotoxicity of ozonated diclofenac, carbamazepine, and oxazepam in zebrafish (Danio rerio)  ap. 191-199.  aPharmaceutical residues are polluting the surface water environments worldwide. Sewage and wastewater treatment, therefore, needs to be improved in order to remove pharmaceutical residues from the effluent. One such treatment improvement is effluent ozonation. Even though ozonation has proven to be very efficient in reducing pharmaceutical parent compound concentrations in wastewater effluents, much remains unclear regarding potentially toxic ozonation by-product (OBP) formation. In this study, we sought to elucidate the aquatic toxicity of ozonated pharmaceuticals in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos in a static 144 h post fertilization (hpf) fish embryotoxicity (ZFET) assay. Three pharmaceuticals commonly detected in wastewater effluents, i.e. carbamazepine, diclofenac, and oxazepam, were selected for testing. Toxicity was assessed before and after 1 min ozonation (0.053 mg L−1 peak O3 concentration) and 10 min ozonation (0.147 mg L−1 peak O3 concentration). Chemical analysis showed that carbamazepine and diclofenac were largely removed by ozone (90 ± 11% and 97 ± 3.8%), whereas oxazepam was removed to a lesser extent (19 ± 5.7%). The ZFET assay revealed diverging toxicities. Diclofenac embryotoxicity decreased with increasing ozonation. Oxazepam did not cause embryotoxicity in the ZFET assay either pre- or post ozonation, but larvae swimming activity was affected at 144 hpf. Carbamazepine embryotoxicity, on the other hand, increased with increasing ozonation. Chemical analysis showed the formation of two OBPs (carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide and 10,11-dihydrocarbamazepine), possibly explaining the increased embryotoxicity. The results of this study highlight the importance of new chemical and toxicological knowledge regarding the formation of OBPs in post-ozonated effluents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3abyproducts 3achemical analysis 3adiclofenac 3adrug residues 3aeffluents 3aembryo (animal) 3aembryotoxicity 3afish 3alarvae 3aozonation 3aozone 3asewage 3asurface water 3aswimming 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aOzonation 0aOzonation by-products 0aOBP 0aPharmaceuticals 0aOzone removal efficiency 0aDevelopmental toxicity1 aAhrens, Lutz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5430-67641 aCarlsson, Gunnar1 aGolovko, Oksana1 aNorrgren, Leif1 aWeiss, Jana1 aÖrn, Stefan0 tChemosphere.g2019 June, v. 225 p.191-199dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.03.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245008900172520128800261592002801549650000801577650001901585650001301604650001301617650001301630650002001643650001101663650001301674650001101687650002101698650001901719650001601738650001301754650001101767653001901778653002601797653002001823700001401843700002001857700001801877700001401895700001601909700001601925773009101941856009002032852000902122655001202131IND60695331920221119004747.0200830e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069533192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1270472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Kaiwei12aA novel strategy for the efficient decomposition of toxic sodium cyanate by hematite  aToxic sodium cyanate is always present in cyanide-contaminated waste. A new technology for the efficient decomposition of toxic sodium cyanate by hematite was first proposed in this study. The decomposition of sodium cyanate under various atmospheres has been studied. Studies show that sodium cyanate decomposes above 782 °C in Ar and above 627 °C in air. Sodium cyanate does not decompose even roasted at 400 °C for 120 min in air. Hematite does not promote the decomposition of sodium cyanate in Ar. However, almost all sodium cyanate decomposes efficiently at 400 °C and the mass ration of hematite to sodium cyanate of 1:1 for 30 min in air or oxygen atmosphere. The increased mass ratio of hematite to sodium cyanate and roasting temperature can both favor the efficient decomposition of sodium cyanate. The efficient decomposition of sodium cyanate occurs within 30 min, and it is almost stagnant with the prolongation of roasting time. When roasted in air or oxygen in the presence of hematite, sodium cyanate decomposes to Na₂CO₃, CO₂ and N₂ and a small amount of NaNO₃ and NOₓ. The optimal efficient decomposition of sodium cyanate is to roast above 400 °C for 30 min in air or O₂ at a mass ration of hematite to sodium cyanate greater than 1:1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbon dioxide 3acyanates 3ahematite 3anitrogen 3anitrogen oxides 3aoxygen 3aroasting 3asodium 3asodium carbonate 3asodium nitrate 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3awastes 0aSodium cyanate 0aThermal decomposition 0aCyanate removal1 aXie, Feng1 aChang, Yongfeng1 aChen, Chunlin1 aWang, Wei1 aLu, Diankun1 aGu, Xiaowei0 tChemosphere.g2020 Oct., v. 256 p.127047-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1270473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03581naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002500156245009600181300001800277520178900295592002802084650002002112650001602132650001802148650001902166650001802185650001002203650001602213650001202229650001502241650001302256650001702269650001602286650001802302650001502320650003902335650002702374650003802401650003002439650001802469650003002487650001802517650002002535650004502555650001302600650001202613650002102625650002802646650001502674650002002689650003402709700002002743700002302763773013202786856004002918852000902958655001202967IND4468666020221118210809.0120727e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446866602DNAL7 a215383672pmid7 a10.1002/jsfa.44252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ados Santos, Cristina10aPhase solubility studies and stability of cholesterol/β‐cyclodextrin inclusion complexes  ap. 2551-2557.  aBACKGROUND: Cyclodextrins (CDs) are able to enhance the solubility, stability and bioavailability of several bioactive hydrophobic compounds by complex formation. They can also be used for removal of undesired components (such as cholesterol, off‐flavors or bitter components) present in foods. Although many patents account for the use of cyclodextrins for removal of cholesterol from dairy foods, there is no available information on the effect of water on encapsulation efficiency and on the stability of sterols in CDs. The aim of this work was to study the inclusion properties and the factors affecting the encapsulation and stability of cholesterol in β‐cyclodextrin (BCD). The optimum encapsulation conditions (ligand–CD molar ratio, stirring time and temperature), and stability of the complexes as a function of storage time and water content were analyzed. RESULTS: Phase solubility study pointed out the formation of 1:1 stoichiometric complexes between cholesterol and β‐cyclodextrin, which was influenced by temperature variations. The process was shown to be exothermic and energetically favored. The presence of cholesterol greatly modified the BCD water sorption curves, being the amount of adsorbed water smaller in the combined systems. The principal ‘driving force’ for complex formation is the substitution of the high‐enthalpy water molecules by an appropriate hydrophobic ligand. The freeze‐dried complexes probed to be stable at different storage conditions. CONCLUSION: The phase solubility and stability data obtained could be essential for selecting the most suitable conditions when CDs are employed either for removing cholesterol or to incorporate functional ingredients (i.e. sitosterol) in the development of innovative food products.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3acholesterol 3acyclodextrins 3adairy products 3aencapsulation 3afoods 3aingredients 3apatents 3asolubility 3asorption 3astorage time 3atemperature 3awater content 2aAdsorption 2aCalorimetry, Differential Scanning 2aCholesterolxchemistry 2aCoordination Complexesxchemistry 2aFood Additivesxchemistry 2aFood Handling 2aFood, Fortifiedxanalysis 2aFreeze Drying 2aHot Temperature 2aHydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions 2aKinetics 2aLigands 2aPhase Transition 2aPhytosterolsxchemistry 2aSolubility 2aWaterxanalysis 2abeta-Cyclodextrinsxchemistry1 aBuera, María P1 aMazzobre, María F0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2011 Nov., v. 91, no. 14 p.2551-2557dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.4425  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245008700176300001600263520167200279592002801951650001701979650001101996650002402007650002302031650001302054650001502067650001502082650001102097650002102108653002102129653001802150653002402168653003102192653002502223653002302248773011002271856009002381852000902471655001202480IND60531153120221118084810.0190318e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053115312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2016.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCerra, Joshua F.10aEmerging strategies for voluntary urban ecological stewardship on private property  ap. 586-597.  aAs global urban populations grow, green spaces in cities are under increasing pressure to provide urban habitat and perform important ecosystem services. While public natural areas are typically called upon to provide key habitat in cities, green spaces on private property make up large parts of the urban land base and provide important roles for habitat and ecosystem services that support city function. However voluntary strategies for encouraging ecological stewardship on private property in cities are not well studied. This paper accesses available literature, case studies, municipal and organizational reports, and first-person interviews to describe four emerging strategies for catalyzing voluntary private property stewardship in cities: (a) indirect incentives; (b) market-based certifications; (c) community-based initiatives; and (d) payments for ecosystem services. Each offers the potential to combine the individual actions of multiple urban landowners in order to optimize the landscape-scale benefits of these actions in a strategic way. Components, methods and drivers are identified for each strategy and examples are provided to illustrate their application. The challenge of scale in optimizing ecological benefits in cities, and the potential for institutional partnering on multi-parcel, private property stewardship efforts to generate both site-scale and landscape-scale ecological outcomes is discussed. Voluntary, urban ecological stewardship strategies offer a different set of solutions than regulatory models, and open a new land base that would otherwise be inaccessible for improving ecological function as cities change and grow.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acities 3aecological function 3aecosystem services 3ahabitats 3ainterviews 3alandowners 3amodels 3aurban population 0aPrivate property 0aUrban ecology 0aHabitat stewardship 0aUrban environmental policy 0aVoluntary incentives 0aEcosystem services0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2017 Jan., v. 157 p.586-597dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2016.06.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010000167300001200267520135600279592002801635650001901663650001601682650001401698650001201712650000901724650001301733650002701746650001101773650003201784650001001816651001101826653003001837653001601867653002701883653002101910700001801931700002201949700002201971773011201993856008502105852000902190655001202199IND50060223820221118210802.0190403e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006022382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2012.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGunulf, Anna10aSecondary spread of Heterobasidion parviporum from small Norway spruce stumps to adjacent trees  ap. 1-8.  aRoot and butt rot from Heterobasidion parviporum on Norway spruce causes severe economic losses in northern Europe and stumps from commercial thinnings are regularly treated to prevent infection. Stumps created at precommercial thinnings are, due to their small size, believed to be unable to transfer the disease. The aims of this study were to investigate the ability of small-sized Norway spruce stumps to transfer infection to neighboring trees and to determine the lower size and age limit for disease transmission. Norway spruce trees, with diameters between 2 and 14cm at stump height, were felled at 14 sites in western Sweden. The resulting stumps were inoculated with H. parviporum and disease transfer recorded at stump height in the adjacent Norway spruce trees 5years later. Stumps covering the whole span of investigated sizes and ages could transfer infection of H. parviporum and consequently a lower limit under which transfer never occurred could not be determined. The probability of finding an inoculated infection in a tree increased with increasing diameter of both tree and stump. For a given stump size, the probability of infection in the nearby tree decreased with increasing age of the stump. It seems prudent to consider the risk of introducing H. parviporum during precommercial thinning in Norway spruce dominated stands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHeterobasidion 3aPicea abies 3aeconomics 3afelling 3arisk 3aroot rot 3asecondary transmission 3astumps 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3aSweden 0aHeterobasidion parviporum 0aPicea abies 0aPrecommercial thinning 0aSecondary spread1 aWang, Liying,1 aEnglund, Jan-Eric1 aRönnberg, Jonas,0 tForest ecology and management.g2013 Jan. 01, v. 287 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2012.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02460naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245014300208520121600351592002801567650001401595650002201609650002201631650001401653650001201667650000701679650001801686653002801704653001201732653003501744653002501779700001601804700001401820700001301834700001401847773011801861856008601979852000902065655001202074IND60746623120221118015638.0220531e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074662312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1134732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Zhaohuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5718-380010aFrom spent Zn–MnO2 primary batteries to rechargeable Zn–MnO2 batteries: A novel directly recycling route with high battery performance  aFor the first time, spent Zn–MnO₂ primary batteries are recycled to directly build rechargeable Zn–MnO₂ batteries with a mixed solution of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide as the leachate, which aimed to the efficient recovery of spent Zn–MnO₂ primary batteries and the realization of high-powered rechargeable Zn–MnO₂ batteries. After simple purification, the leached liquid is directly used as the working solution to prepare an electrolytic rechargeable Zn–MnO₂ battery.

It is persistent in nature and hence found in soil, air and water. The potential use of plants and microorganisms for the removal of endosulfan from soil was studied. Helianthus annuus plant was grown in soil spiked with 5, 10, 25 and 50 mg kg−1 concentrations of endosulfan and inoculated with plant growth promoting rhizobacterial strains Paenibacillus sp. IITISM08, Bacillus sp. PRB77 and Bacillus sp. PRB101 for 40, 80 and 120 days. Potential of plant for endosulfan uptake was evaluated by investigating the endosulfan levels in plant tissues (root and shoot). The results indicated that endosulfan accumulation followed the pattern of root > shoot as well as decrease in uptake of endosulfan in root and shoot of a plant grown in bacterial inoculated soil as compared to un-inoculated soil. Bacterial inoculation had a positive effect on endosulfan degradation. Maximum degradation of 92% at 5 mg kg−1 of endosulfan in soil was observed on inoculation with PRB101 after 120 days of inoculation. The results showed that plant growth promoting bacteria enhances plant biomass production. Lipid peroxidation was also estimated by determining the malondialdehyde (MDA) production, which is a biomarker of oxidative damage. Decrease in MDA formation by root and leaves of plants grown in the bacteria inoculated plant was also observed. The results suggested the effectiveness of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria to boost accumulation potential, biomass production and enhance remediation of endosulfan contaminated soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aHelianthus annuus 3aPaenibacillus 3aair 3abiomarkers 3abiomass production 3aendosulfan 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3anon-food crops 3apesticide application 3aphytomass 3aplant growth 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aplant tissues 3apolluted soils 3aremediation 3aroots 3ashoots 0aEndosulfan 0aPhytoremediation 0aHelianthus annuus 0aEndosulfan degrading bacteria 0aPlant bacteria partnership1 aKumar, Vipin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1077-34401 aUsmani, Zeba1 aGupta, Pratishtha1 aChandra, Avantika0 tChemosphere.g2019 June, v. 225 p.479-489dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.03.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245015500166300001600321520158100337592002801918650001501946650002601961650001601987650001402003650001602017650001302033650002002046653004402066653002902110653001902139653001502158653001602173700001302189773009802202856008602300852000902386655001202395IND60600409720221120215615.0180703e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060040972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.05.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Y.10aInvestigation of combustion, performance and emission characteristics of 2-stroke and 4-stroke spark ignition and CAI/HCCI operations in a DI gasoline  ap. 244-255.  aIn order to develop more efficient and cleaner gasoline engines, a number of new engine operating strategies have been proposed and researched on different engines, including the spark ignition (SI) and controlled autoignition (CAI) or HCCI in both 2-stroke and 4-stroke cycles in a poppet valve engine. In this work, a single cylinder direct injection gasoline engine equipped with an electro-hydraulic valve-train system has been commissioned and used to achieve seven different operating modes, including: 4-stroke throttle-controlled SI, 4-stroke intake valve throttled SI, 4-stroke positive valve overlap SI, 4-stroke negative valve overlap CAI, 4-stroke exhaust rebreathing CAI, 2-stroke CAI and 2-stroke SI. Their performance and emission characteristics were analysed and compared at a typical engine calibration operating condition of 1500rpm and 3.6bar IMEP in 4-stroke or 1.8bar IMEP in 2-stroke. Results show that 4-stroke positive valve overlap SI, 4-stroke NVO CAI and exhaust rebreathing CAI modes have better fuel economy and lower NOx emissions than the conventional throttled 4-stroke SI operation. The 2-stroke CAI operation was found to produce higher combustion efficiency and lower ISFC but lower brake efficiency than the 4-s-stroke operations at the same power output due to the supercharger’s efficiency. But, at the same IMEP as the 4-stroke operation, the 2-stroke CAI operation results in 29% reduction in BSFC, indicating its potential synergy with highly downsized direct injection gasoline engines for much better fuel economy and performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3acombustion efficiency 3acompressors 3aemissions 3agas engines 3agasoline 3anitrogen oxides 0aHomogeneous charge compression ignition 0aControlled auto ignition 0aSpark ignition 0aTwo-stroke 0aFour-stroke1 aZhao, H.0 tApplied energy.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 130 p.244-255dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.05.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04126naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245011100175300001600286520217000302592002802472650001802500650002602518650001302544650002602557650001902583650001302602650001302615650001002628650002302638650001102661650002602672650003802698650001702736650002002753650002902773650001402802650001802816650001102834650001402845650001102859650002102870650001802891650001602909650001402925650001502939651001002954653002602964653001002990653000803000653001803008653001003026653001803036653002003054700005603074700002403130700005903154700002303213700002503236773009703261856008503358852000903443655001203452IND60580979220221122034935.0181011e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058097922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2017.07.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarathe, Nachiket P.10aUntreated urban waste contaminates Indian river sediments with resistance genes to last resort antibiotics  ap. 388-397.  aEfficient sewage treatment is critical for limiting environmental transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In many low and middle income countries, however, large proportions of sewage are still released untreated into receiving water bodies. In-depth knowledge of how such discharges of untreated urban waste influences the environmental resistome is largely lacking. Here, we highlight the impact of uncontrolled discharge of partially treated and/or untreated wastewater on the structure of bacterial communities and resistome of sediments collected from Mutha river flowing through Pune city in India. Using shotgun metagenomics, we found a wide array (n = 175) of horizontally transferable antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) including carbapenemases such as NDM, VIM, KPC, OXA-48 and IMP types. The relative abundance of total ARGs was 30-fold higher in river sediments within the city compared to upstream sites. Forty four ARGs, including the tet(X) gene conferring resistance to tigecycline, OXA-58 and GES type carbapenemases, were significantly more abundant in city sediments, while two ARGs were more common at upstream sites. The recently identified mobile colistin resistance gene mcr-1 was detected only in one of the upstream samples, but not in city samples. In addition to ARGs, higher abundances of various mobile genetic elements were found in city samples, including integron-associated integrases and ISCR transposases, as well as some biocide/metal resistance genes. Virulence toxin genes as well as bacterial genera comprising many pathogens were more abundant here; the genus Acinetobacter, which is often associated with multidrug resistance and nosocomial infections, comprised up to 29% of the 16S rRNA reads, which to our best knowledge is unmatched in any other deeply sequenced metagenome. There was a strong correlation between the abundance of Acinetobacter and the OXA-58 carbapenemase gene. Our study shows that uncontrolled discharge of untreated urban waste can contribute to an overall increase of the abundance and diversity of ARGs in the environment, including those conferring resistance to last-resort antibiotics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abeta-lactamase 3abiocides 3acolistin 3agenes 3agenetic resistance 3aincome 3ainosine monophosphate 3ainterspersed repetitive sequences 3ametagenomics 3ametal tolerance 3amultiple drug resistance 3apathogens 3aribosomal RNA 3arivers 3asediments 3asewage 3asewage treatment 3asurface water 3atigecycline 3avirulence 3awastewater 3aIndia 0aAntibiotic resistance 0amcr-1 0aNDM 0aCarbapenemase 0aIndia 0aAcinetobacter 0aRiver sediments1 aPal, Chandan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0503-88041 aGaikwad, Swapnil S.1 aJonsson, Viktor1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1445-52201 aKristiansson, Erik1 aLarsson, D.G.

We hypothesize that the special waterproof cell lining of Colletes reduces the risk of fungal infection, liquefaction, or desiccation of the stored food and thus liberated the bees from the need to consume the entire provisions before winter, allowing for the exploitation of late-flowering plant taxa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColletes 3abees 3abrood cells 3afungi 3alarvae 3alate flowering 3aliquefaction 3awinter1 aWeibel, Urs0 tApidologie.g2020 June, v. 51, no. 3 p.436-438dSpringer PariswJournal:1968x0044-84357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13592-019-00730-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03749naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245015700204300001600361520209700377592002802474596005802502596005002560596005002610596007502660596005602735650003002791650001202821650003102833650001102864650002302875650001102898650001602909650003702925650002302962650001902985650001303004700001903017700001903036700002503055773013103080856008303211852000903294655001203303IND60780116220221119171130.0220813e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078011622DNAL7 a10.1007/s11273-022-09877-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZinnen, Jack1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5551-378110aFunctional traits and responses to nutrient and mycorrhizal addition are inconsistently related to wetland plant species’ coefficients of conservatism  ap. 513-526.  aFloristic quality assessment (FQA) is a commonly used indicator system to evaluate the condition of wetlands. FQA metrics are based on coefficients of conservatism (C-values), numeric values assigned to plant species by expert botanists. C-values reflect a species’ fidelity to high quality natural areas and intolerance to human impacts. Although FQA metrics are widely used in wetland management, few studies have characterized the ecological traits associated with C-values. These few studies have found consistent relationships between functional traits and C-values. Moreover, some research also suggests that conservative species may benefit from arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). We conducted a greenhouse experiment to characterize the functional and growth characteristics associated with C-values. We grew 42 species found in midwestern (USA) wetlands and measured nine functional traits of the study species, as well as their responses to AMF addition and nutrient addition treatments. We supplemented the greenhouse experiment with leaf functional trait data from 72 wetland species collected in the field. For the greenhouse experiment, we found weak negative associations between C-values and both height and total biomass, and a positive association between C-values and seed mass. However, in both the greenhouse experiment and the field-collected data, most functional traits did not significantly relate to C-values. AMF addition generally decreased biomass, whereas nutrient addition increased biomass. Response to AMF addition was not significantly related to C-values. Species with lower C-values were more responsive to nutrient treatments compared to those with higher C-values, though this relationship was due to nonnative species with C-values of 0. Our findings could reflect functional differences between dominant wetland matrix species with low C-values, especially nonnative species, and species that are smaller and more conservative. Our data indicate that C-values may not consistently or strongly correspond to functional traits and treatment responses.  aPublisher supplied data  aStudent Research GrantcSociety of Wetland Scientists  aResearch GrantcIllinois Native Plant Society  aResearch GrantcIllinois Native Plant Society  aStudent Restoration Research GrantcSociety for Ecological Restoration  a1018621cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aadministrative management 3abiomass 3agreenhouse experimentation 3ahumans 3aintroduced species 3aleaves 3aseed weight 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3awetland management 3awetland plants 3awetlands1 aCharles, Brian1 aZaya, David N.1 aMatthews, Jeffrey W.0 tWetlands ecology and management.g2022 June, v. 30, no. 3 p.513-526dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870260x0923-48617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-022-09877-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245012700165300001800292520100300310592002801313650001701341650003401358650001101392650001001403650001401413650001701427650000901444650002201453650001601475650002601491650001801517653002301535653002601558653003501584653001201619653002001631653001401651700001501665700002201680700001801702773009901720856008401819852000901903655001201912IND60709464220221119042703.0210312e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070946422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.08.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSahu, Ankur10aTemperature differentially modulates the transcriptome response in Oryza sativa to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae infection  ap. 4842-4852.  aBacterial blight is caused by the pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Genome scale integrative analysis on the interaction of high and low temperatures on the molecular response signature in rice during the Xoo infection has not been conducted yet. We have analysed a unique RNA-Seq dataset generated on the susceptible rice variety IR24 under combined exposure of Xoo with low 29/21 °C (day/night) and high 35/31 °C (day/night) temperatures. Differentially regulated key genes and pathways in rice plants during both the stress conditions were identified. Differential dynamics of the regulatory network topology showed that WRKY and ERF families of transcription factors play a crucial role during signal crosstalk events in rice plants while responding to combined exposure of Xoo with low temperature vs. Xoo with high temperatures. Our study suggests that upon onset of high temperature, rice plants tend to switch its focus from defence response towards growth and reproduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aXanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae 3ablight 3agenes 3apathogens 3areproduction 3arice 3asequence analysis 3atemperature 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome 0aXanthomonas oryzae 0aBacterial leaf blight 0aTemperature stress interaction 0aRNA-Seq 0aSystems biology 0aCrosstalk1 aDas, Akash1 aSaikia, Katherine1 aBarah, Pankaj0 tGenomics.g2020 Nov., v. 112, no. 6 p.4842-4852dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12348x0888-75437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.08.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04073naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001600158245019600174300001600370520255300386592002802939650001902967650001602986650001303002650001603015650003403031650001103065650000903076650001203085650001703097650001603114650001003130650001603140650001703156650002903173650001103202653000803213653002103221653001603242653001603258653002303274653001403297700001703311700001803328700001503346773010403361856009303465852000903558655001203567IND60540550420221120150549.0190318e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054055042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2014.06.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFleisch, A.10aReproductive performance of Lacaune dairy sheep exposed to artificial long days followed by natural photoperiod without and with additional progestagen treatment during the nonbreeding season  ap. 320-325.  aThis study compared the reproductive performance of Lacaune dairy ewes exposed to a light program and subsequent male introduction without (n = 36) or with (n = 36) an additional 6-day progestagen treatment during the nonbreeding season. All ewes were exposed to extended day length (16 hours light and 8 hours darkness) for 77 days during winter (December 15 until March 2) followed by increasing natural photoperiod. At the end of the photoperiodic treatment, three blood samples were collected 6 days apart for progesterone (P4) analysis to determine cyclic activity. One half of the ewes were additionally subjected to a 6-day progestagen treatment in combination with PGF2α and eCG at insert withdrawal. Rams fitted with marking harnesses were introduced to females for 45 days and marked ewes recorded. Ewes exposed to the light program only were joined 40 days after the end of photoperiodic treatment, and ewes with additional progestagen treatment were joined 1 day after insert removal (40–44 days after the end of photostimulation). Lambing data were recorded and fertility (percentage of ewes lambing, lambing rate, and litter size) assessed to the first service period and overall. Mean serum P4 concentrations were similarly (P > 0.05) low in both groups (0.4–0.7 ng/mL vs. 0.4–0.6 ng/mL). On the basis of elevated P4 levels (>1 ng/mL), evidence of luteal activity was found in 27.8% of the ewes at the end of the light program. Estrus response was equally high (97.2%) and estrus distribution highly synchronized in progestagen-treated ewes (91.7% within 4 days). In ewes exposed to the light program only, estrous activity was recorded within 4 days (six ewes), from Day 8 to Day 17 (17 ewes) and from Day 19 to Day 25 (12 ewes) after joining. The percentage of ewes that lambed to the first service period was higher (P < 0.05) in ewes exposed to the light program only than that in the group additionally treated with progestagen/PGF2α/eCG (94.4% vs. 69.4%). Overall, the percentage of lambing ewes was similar in both groups (97.2% and 94.4%), and lambing rates (1.4–1.9) and litter sizes (1.9–2.1) were high and not influenced (P > 0.05) by the treatment. In conclusion, this study reports that exposition of Lacaune ewes to artificial long days followed by natural day length and male introduction is highly effective to induce fertile estrous activity during the nonbreeding season and offers a reliable and practical alternative to hormonal manipulation for out-of-season breeding in sheep.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3abreeding 3adairy sheep 3aequine chorionic gonadotropin 3aestrus 3aewes 3alambing 3alambing rate 3alitter size 3amales 3aphotoperiod 3aprogesterone 3areproductive performance 3awinter 0aEwe 0aEstrus induction 0aPhotoperiod 0aProgestagen 0aNonbreeding season 0aFertility1 aBollwein, H.1 aPiechotta, M.1 aJanett, F.0 tTheriogenology.g2015 Feb., v. 83, no. 3 p.320-325dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2014.06.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010000167520141100267592002801678650001201706650001501718650002301733650001801756650001001774650001501784653001401799653001701813653001001830653001401840653000801854653002201862653001201884653001001896653001001906653001001916653000701926653001401933653001001947653000801957653000801965653001201973653001001985653000801995653000902003653000702012653000902019653000802028653001302036653000902049653000702058653000802065653000702073653001002080653000702090700001602097700001602113700001502129700001702144700001802161700001302179773012102192856008202313852000902395655001202404IND60746623420221118015758.0220118e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074662342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2021.1113502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Tengchao10aLINC01116 boosts the progression of pituitary adenoma via regulating miR-744–5p/HOXB8 pathway  aPituitary adenoma (PA) is one of the common intracranial tumors. In order to optimize status quo, seeking out potential biomarkers for pituitary adenoma diagnosis and treatment is urgent and important. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been related with progression of various cancers. Based on this reason and unknown role of long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1116 (LINC01116) in pituitary adenoma, we aimed to explore the function and molecular mechanism of LINC01116 in pituitary adenoma. The RT-qPCR analysis showed that LINC01116 was abnormally overexpressed in pituitary adenoma cells. Down-regulated LINC01116 effectively suppressed cell proliferation and migration as well as epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression in pituitary adenoma. Additionally, LINC01116 could competitively sponge miR-744–5p as shown by RIP, RNA pull down and luciferase reporter assays. Similarly, we also proved that homeobox B8 (HOXB8) was the target gene of miR-744–5p in pituitary adenoma cells. In the end, the rescue assays unmasked that HOXB8 could effectually reverse inhibition effect of LINC016 knockdown on pituitary adenoma cells proliferation, migration and EMT, further suggesting that LINC01116 expedited the pituitary adenoma progression by up-regulating HOXB8. Taken together, LINC01116 boosted the progression of pituitary adenoma cells via regulating miR-744–5p/HOXB8 pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenoma 3abiomarkers 3acell proliferation 3aendocrinology 3agenes 3aluciferase 0aLINC01116 0amiR-744–5p 0aHOXB8 0aMigration 0aEMT 0aPituitary adenoma 0alncRNAs 0amRNAs 0aceRNA 0amiRNA 0aPA 0aLINC01116 0aHOXB8 0aEMT 0aFBS 0aRT-qPCR 0aCCK-8 0aEdU 0aDAPI 0aIF 0aFISH 0aRIP 0aSDS-PAGE 0aPVDF 0aWT 0aMut 0aSD 0aANOVA 0aPC1 aCai, Meiqin1 aChen, Chuan1 aLing, Cong1 aZhang, Baoyu1 aZheng, Wenhan1 aLuo, Lun0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 536 p.111350-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2021.1113503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245012400174500002200298520154100320592002801861650001601889650001501905650002001920650001401940650002101954650002401975650002801999650001402027650002002041650000902061650001902070650001602089650001402105650001302119650001902132650001702151650001502168650001902183650001402202650001302216653002302229653002302252653001302275700001802288700001502306700001902321773008002340856009102420852000902511655001202520IND60672995720221122062901.0191017e20191013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067299572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.1195452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hongxing10aRadiosensitive core/satellite ternary heteronanostructure for multimodal imaging-guided synergistic cancer radiotherapy  aPre-press version  aDeveloping safe, effective and targeting radiosensitizers with clear action mechanisms to achieve synergistic localized cancer treatment is an important strategy for radiotherapy. Herein, we design and synthesize a ternary heteronanostructure radiosensitizer (SeAuFe-EpC) with core/satellite morphology by a simple method to realize multimodal imaging-guided cancer radiotherapy. The mechanistic studies reveal that Se incorporation could drastically improve the electrical conductivity and lower the energy barrier between the three components, resulting in more electrons transfer between Se-Au interface and migration over the heterogeneous junction of Au-Fe3O4 NPs interface. This synergistic interaction enhanced the energy transfer and facilitated more excited excitons generated by SeAuFe-EpC NPs, thus promoting the transformation of 3O2 to 1O2 via resonance energy transfer, finally resulting in irreversible cancer cell apoptosis. Additionally, based on the X-ray attenuation ability and high NIR absorption of AuNPs and the superparamagnetism of Fe3O4, in vivo computer tomography, photoacoustic and magnetic resonance tri-modal imaging have been employed to visualize the tracking and targeting ability of the NPs. As expected, the NPs specifically accumulated in orthotopic breast tumor area and achieved synergistic anticancer efficacy, but showed no toxic side effects on main organs. Collectively, this study sheds light on the potential roles of core/satellite heteronanostructure in imaging-guided cancer radiotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aabsorption 3aadverse effects 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3acomputed tomography 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrons 3aenergy transfer 3agold 3aimage analysis 3airon oxides 3amagnetism 3ananogold 3aneoplasm cells 3aradiotherapy 3asatellites 3asinglet oxygen 3asynergism 3atoxicity 0aRadiosensitization 0aMultimodal imaging 0aSelenium1 aLin, Weiqiang1 aHe, Lizhen1 aChen, Tianfeng0 tBiomaterials.g2019 Oct. 13, dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.1195453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245006700168300001600235520143100251592002801682650001601710650001601726650001101742650001301753650001801766650001501784650001401799650001201813653001801825653001301843653001601856653002601872700001801898700005701916773009501973856008402068852000902152655001202161IND60531153520221118084801.0190401e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053115352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2016.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, Beth M.10aAdolescent energy drink consumption: An Australian perspective  ap. 638-642.  aCaffeinated Energy Drinks (EDs) are not recommended for consumption by children, yet there is a lack of age-specific recommendations and restrictions on the marketing and sale of EDs. EDs are increasingly popular among adolescents despite growing evidence of their negative health effects. In the current study we examined ED consumption patterns among 399 Australian adolescents aged 12–18 years. Participants completed a self-report survey of consumption patterns, physiological symptoms, and awareness of current ED consumption guidelines. Results indicated that ED consumption was common among the sample; 56% reported lifetime ED consumption, with initial consumption at mean age 10 (SD = 2.97). Twenty-eight percent of the sample consumed EDs at least monthly, 36% had exceeded the recommended two standard EDs/day, and 56% of consumers had experienced negative physiological health effects following ED consumption. The maximum number of EDs/day considered appropriate for children, adolescents, and adults varied, indicating a lack of awareness of current consumption recommendations. These findings add to the growing body of international evidence of adolescent ED consumption, and the detrimental impact of EDs to adolescent health. Enforced regulation and restriction of EDs for children’s and adolescents’ consumption is urgently needed in addition to greater visibility of ED consumption recommendations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAustralians 3aadolescents 3aadults 3achildren 3aenergy drinks 3aguidelines 3amarketing 3asurveys 0aEnergy drinks 0aCaffeine 0aAdolescents 0aQuantitative research1 aHayley, Alexa1 aMiller, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6896-54370 tAppetite.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 105 p.638-642dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2016.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01597naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245020300166300001600369520054000385592002800925650001500953650002100968650001700989650002201006650001401028700002201042773015401064856008001218852000901298655001201307IND60521433620221117224654.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052143362DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1974-11-12092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlume, Rüdiger10aSpektralphotometrische Analyse von mehrstufigen Protolyse-Gleichgewichten über einheitliche Teilbereiche / Spectrophotometric Analysis of Multistep Protolyte-Equilibria by Means of Uniform Segments  ap. 734-741.  aA method to analyze spectrophotometric titrations of one-step dissociation-equilibria is applied to titrations of polyelectrolytes with small pK-differences.

The paradigms previously established for the sorption of neutral organic compounds do not always apply to IOCs and the importance of accounting for the particular sorption behavior of IOCs is being increasingly recognized. This review presents the current state of knowledge and summarizes the recent advances on the sorption of IOCs to carbonaceous sorbents. A broad range of sorbents were considered to evaluate the possibility to read across between fields of research that are often considered in isolation (e.g., carbon nanotubes, graphene, biochar, and activated carbon). Mechanisms relevant to IOCs sorption on carbonaceous sorbents are discussed and critically evaluated, with special attention being given to emerging sorption mechanisms including low-barrier, charge-assisted hydrogen bonds and cation-π assisted π–π interactions. The key role played by some environmental factors is also discussed, with a particular focus on pH and ionic strength.Overall the review reveals significant advances in our understanding of the interactions between IOCs and carbonaceous sorbents. In addition, knowledge gaps are identified and priorities for future research are suggested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3abioavailability 3abiochar 3acarbon nanotubes 3adrugs 3aenvironmental factors 3agraphene 3ahydrogen bonding 3aorganic compounds 3apH 3apesticides 3asorbents 3asorption 0aAdsorption 0aIonisable 0aBiochar 0aCarbon nanotubes 0aActivated carbon 0aIonogenic1 aSigmund, Gabriel1 aXiao, Feng1 aHofmann, Thilo0 tWater research.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 124 p.673-692dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2017.07.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245013800167300001400305520111200319592002801431650001901459650001901478650001901497650001301516650001101529650002401540650004401564650001501608650002801623650002301651650001001674650001301684650003101697650004301728650001401771650002201785650001501807650002001822650001101842653001501853653003101868653001301899653002001912653002001932700001601952700001701968700001701985700001702002773010402019856008702123852000902210655001202219IND60536498320221120200132.0190409e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053649832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2014.07.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Kui10aEffects of earthworms on physicochemical properties and microbial profiles during vermicomposting of fresh fruit and vegetable wastes  ap. 45-52.  aThis study aimed to investigate the effect of earthworms on physicochemical and microbial properties during vermicomposting of fresh fruit and vegetable wastes (FVW) by contrasting two decomposing systems of FVW with and without earthworms for 5weeks. Compared to control treatment (without earthworms), vermicomposting treatment resulted in a rapid decrease of electrical conductivity and losses of total carbon and nitrogen from the 2nd week. Quantitative PCR displayed that earthworms markedly enhanced bacterial and fungal densities, showing the higher values than control, during the whole decomposition process. In addition, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis combined with sequencing analysis revealed that earthworms pronouncedly modified bacterial and fungal community structures, through broadening the community diversities of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Ascomycotina. These results suggest that the presence of earthworms promoted the activity and population of bacteria and fungi, and modified their communities, thus altering the decomposition pathway of fresh FVW.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aPezizomycotina 3aProteobacteria 3abacteria 3acarbon 3acommunity structure 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aearthworms 3aelectrical conductivity 3afungal communities 3afungi 3anitrogen 3aphysicochemical properties 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3araw fruit 3asequence analysis 3avegetables 3avermicomposting 3awastes 0aEarthworms 0aFruit and vegetable wastes 0aPCR-DGGE 0aVermicomposting 0aWaste treatment1 aLi, Fusheng1 aWei, Yongfen1 aFu, Xiaoyong1 aChen, Xuemin0 tBioresource technology.g2014 Oct., v. 170 p.45-52dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2014.07.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03886naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245010200175300001600277520213000293592002802423650003202451650002602483650002702509650002302536650002002559650001502579650001802594650002602612650001402638650002402652650002302676650001202699650001902711650001502730650001502745650002302760650001302783651002502796651001002821653001802831653003202849653002202881653002602903700003002929700003202959700003002991700002003021700002103041700002003062773014403082856008503226852000903311655001203320IND60584513920221120131416.0190415e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058451392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mambio.2017.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartín-Díaz, Paula10aIntegrating space and time in predator-prey studies: The case of wildcats and rabbits in SE Spain  ap. 114-122.  aHow species use space and time is central in ecology and evolution as well as for the conservation and management of vulnerable species. Unfortunately, this information is scarce for elusive species such as the threatened European wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris), especially in Mediterranean areas. Using radio-tracking and camera-trapping, we studied the habitat selection and the diel activity of a wildcat population in SE Spain, with particular emphasis on the relationships between wildcats and their main prey, the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). First, we used Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) to analyse the influence of vegetation, rabbit abundance, topography and humanization on wildcat presence at several spatial scales and according to wildcat activity. Second, we used Spearman’s rank correlations to assess the spatial relationship between the relative abundance indexes (RAIs) of wildcats and rabbits. Third, we used kernel density estimates to determine the daily activity patterns of wildcats and rabbits, and compared them by calculating the coefficient of overlap Δ. Patch complexity, rabbit abundance, slope and cover of dense scrubs were the most influential variables on wildcat presence. However, the effects of some environmental variables were scale-dependent. The relationship between rabbit abundance and wildcat presence was positive for the smaller scales and, unexpectedly, negative for the largest one. This result was supported by the quadratic relationship between wildcat RAI and rabbit RAI, indicating that wildcats generally avoided the highest rabbit abundance areas. We observed a typical nocturnal activity for wildcats, which surprisingly did not synchronize with the rabbit activity patterns. Rabbit antipredatory strategies, human pressure avoidance behaviour in wildcats and competition with other carnivores could be behind the observed spatiotemporal mismatch between wildcats and rabbits. Overall, our study highlights the importance of combining spatial and temporal approaches to obtain an integrative view of how resources are exploited by wildlife.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFelis silvestris silvestris 3aOryctolagus cuniculus 3aantipredatory behavior 3aavoidance behavior 3acamera trapping 3acarnivores 3adiel activity 3aenvironmental factors 3aevolution 3ahabitat preferences 3anocturnal activity 3arabbits 3aspace and time 3atopography 3avegetation 3avulnerable species 3awildlife 3aMediterranean region 3aSpain 0aDiel activity 0aFelis silvestris silvestris 0aHabitat selection 0aOryctolagus cuniculus1 aGil-Sánchez, Jose María1 aBallesteros-Duperón, Elena1 aBarea-Azcón, Jose Miguel1 aVirgós, Emilio1 aPardavila, Xosé1 aMoleón, Marcos0 tMammalian biology =.g2018 Jan., v. 88 p.114-122dElsevier GmbHaDeutsche Gesellschaft für SäugetierkundewJournal:12403x1616-50477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mambio.2017.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009500169300001800264520122500282592002801507650000801535650002501543650002401568650002401592650002101616650001601637650001301653650002501666650002001691650001001711650002001721650001401741650003001755650001001785700002301795700002301818773012001841856008101961852000902042655001202051IND60574539120221117034048.0170728e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057453912DNAL7 a10.1007/s10499-017-0135-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajabzadeh, Nadia10aMultiplex PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of bacterial pathogens in rainbow trout  ap. 1569-1575.  aAccurate, rapid, and specific methods are required to identify pathogens for controlling bacterial diseases in fish. Various microbiological and biochemical methods are used to isolate and identify pathogens, but they are not adequately efficient and/or accurate. For example, distinguishing between Streptococcus iniae and Lactococcus garvieae is difficult via microbiological tests. Moreover, these bacteria often cause concurrent infections. Therefore, early and accurate identification of bacterial pathogens in trout is of utmost importance to prevent possible damage. Because of this, the multiplex polymerase chain reaction (multiplex PCR) method was optimized for simultaneous identification of bacterial infections caused by Yersinia ruckeri, S. iniae, and L. garvieae, three harmful bacteria of great importance in aquaculture. Multiplex PCR reaction was optimized on control samples, and the sensitivity and specificity of the test were evaluated. Multiplex PCR reaction was then performed on DNA isolated from samples collected from fish-breeding farms and transported to the laboratory. Multiplex PCR was found to be an accurate and sensitive method to identify simultaneously different species of bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aLactococcus garvieae 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aStreptococcus iniae 3aYersinia ruckeri 3aaquaculture 3abacteria 3abacterial infections 3adisease control 3afarms 3amixed infection 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atrout1 aNaeemipour, Mohsen1 aSeyedabadi, Mohsen0 tAquaculture international.g2017 Aug., v. 25, no. 4 p.1569-1575dSpringer International Publishingx0967-61207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-017-0135-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02978naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245008300174520110300257592002801360650001001388650001801398650002501416650001101441650001201452650002201464650001401486650001101500650001001511650002701521650001401548650002501562651001001587651001101597651001001608651000901618651001301627651001301640651001201653653002901665653000901694653002201703653000901725653001301734700001101747700002701758700001701785700002001802700002801822700001901850700002001869700001601889700002401905700001701929700002101946700002801967700003401995700001702029700001802046700001902064773011502083856008502198852000902283655001202292IND60735560420221120104750.0220606e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073556042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2021.1048732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvi, Mughees Aizaz10aHydatigera taeniaeformis in urban rats (Rattus rattus) in Faisalabad, Pakistan  aHydatigera taeniaeformis formerly referred to as Taenia taeniaeformis is a cestode of cats (definitive hosts) and rodents (intermediate hosts). The prevalence of the metacestode larval stage has been reported in rodents in many parts of the world even though the genetic polymorphisms or intraspecies variation is still understudied. Here, we report a prevalence of 22.09% (38/172) from an urban rodent population in Pakistan and a nucleotide diversity (cox1) of 0.00463 among the population. Infection was higher in male (27.85%) and adult (32.29%) rats than female and sub-adult/young rats. Interestingly, The median-joining network and phylogenetic construction comprising isolates from China, Japan, Kenya, Laos, Malaysia, Senegal, the United Arab Emirates, and countries in Europe demonstrated that Pakistani H. taeniaeformis are closer to Asian and African population than those of European origin. The results of the study will add-in preliminary data for H. taeniaeformis and will also contribute to understand the global molecular epidemiology and population structure of H. taeniaeformis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aRattus rattus 3aTaenia taeniaeformis 3aadults 3afemales 3agenetic variation 3ainfection 3alarvae 3amales 3amolecular epidemiology 3aphylogeny 3apopulation structure 3aChina 3aEurope 3aKenya 3aLaos 3aMalaysia 3aPakistan 3aSenegal 0aHydatigera taeniaeformis 0acox1 0aGenetic diversity 0aRats 0aPakistan1 aLi, Li1 aOhiolei, John Asekhaen1 aQamar, Warda1 aSaqib, Muhammad1 aTayyab, Muhammad Haleem1 aAltaf, Javaria1 aAshfaq, Khurram1 aHassan, Ali1 aJamāl, Muḥammad,1 aWahab, Abdul1 aAlvi, Anum Aizaz1 aʻUs̲mān, Muḥammad,1 aBajwa, Muhammad Rashid Khalid1 aFu, Bao-Quan1 aYan, Hong-Bin1 aJia, Wan-Zhong0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2021 Aug., v. 92 p.104873-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2021.1048733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014000164520110700304592002801411650003101439650001401470650001901484650000901503650000701512650002901519650001801548650002301566650001501589650001401604650001901618653001601637653002501653653002701678653002001705700005901725700001701784700001601801773012501817856008101942852000902023655001202032IND60762956720221119084054.0220222e20220301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076295672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1130972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZou, Xiao-Li10aEffect of sodium bicarbonate on solubility, conformation and emulsion properties of pale, soft and exudative meat myofibrillar proteins  aTo investigate the effects of sodium bicarbonate on aggregation and emulsion properties of pale, soft and exudative (PSE) meat myofibrillar proteins, the changes in pH, turbidity, particle size, free sulfhydryl, surface hydrophobicity, emulsifying ability, and emulsion stability were studied. The pH, solubility, proportion of free sulfhydryl groups, surface hydrophobicity, emulsifying ability, and emulsion stability significantly increased (P < 0.05) with an increase in sodium bicarbonate concentration from 0 g/kg to 6 g/kg. In contrast, zeta potential, turbidity, and particle size significantly decreased (P < 0.05). In summary, the addition of sodium bicarbonate increased the pH of PSE meat myofibrillar proteins and enhanced the electrostatic repulsion between the proteins, causing the absolute value of zeta potential to increase, leading to greater exposure of sulfhydryl and hydrophobic groups and formation of smaller aggregations, enhancing its solubility, emulsifying ability and emulsion stability. Thus, sodium bicarbonate could improve the processing performance of PSE meat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aemulsions 3ahydrophobicity 3ameat 3apH 3apale soft exudative meat 3aparticle size 3asodium bicarbonate 3asolubility 3aturbidity 3azeta potential 0aAggregation 0aEmulsifying activity 0aProcessing performance 0aFree sulfhydryl1 aKang, Zhuang-Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5052-01731 aLi, Yan-ping1 aMa, Han-Jun0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 Mar. 01, v. 157 p.113097-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1130973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245007200166300001600238500001900254520097800273536017301251592002801424596000901452650002201461650001901483650002601502650001001528650001501538650001901553650002201572650001701594650001701611650002001628650002001648650001501668650001101683650002101694650001201715650001501727650001301742650001801755651001001773653001801783653002301801653001201824700001901836700001801855700001801873700002001891700002401911773012001935856008502055852000902140655001202149IND60700639220221120131958.0200702e20200703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070063922DNAL7 a10.1080/10871209.2020.17408372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraos, Ana10aEstimated economic impacts of seven invasive alien species in Chile  ap. 398-403.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis findings abstract presents preliminary estimates of the economic impact of seven invasive alien species (IAS) in Chile on productive sectors of the economy and biodiversity. The study was required by decision-makers as part of the research of the project “Strengthening National Frameworks for Invasive Alien Species Governance” funded by GEF (Global Environmental Facility). The impacts of beaver (Castor canadensis), rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), wild boar (Sus scrofa), American mink (Neovison vison), yellow jacket (Vespula germanica), blackberry (Rubus spp.), and ulex (Ulex europaeus) were assessed. Few impacts could be estimated given the lack of information in Chile. Considering the impacts assessed, Chile may lose at least USD 90 million per year due to these seven IAS. Without implementing control measures, in 20 years, Chile will lose at least approximately USD 2 billion from the impacts of these species on biodiversity and productive sectors.  aThis work was supported by the “Strengthening National Frameworks for Invasive Alien Species (IAS) Governance” project, funded by the Global Environmental Facility.  aPublisher supplied data  a4330 3aCastor canadensis 3aNeovison vison 3aOryctolagus cuniculus 3aRubus 3aSus scrofa 3aUlex europaeus 3aVespula germanica 3abiodiversity 3ablackberries 3adecision making 3aeconomic impact 3agovernance 3ahumans 3ainvasive species 3arabbits 3awild boars 3awildlife 3ayellowjackets 3aChile 0aAlien species 0aeconomic valuation 0aimpacts1 aCerda, Claudia1 aSkewes, Oscar1 aCruz, Gustavo1 aTapia, Patricio1 aBaeriswyl, Fernando0 tHuman dimensions of wildlife.g2020 July 03, v. 25, no. 4 p.398-403dRoutledgewJournal:J000000084x1533-158X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10871209.2020.17408373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245010100163300002000264520105900284592002801343596012701371650001501498650001301513650002201526650003401548650001601582700005801598700001601656700001501672700001601687700001201703700001501715700001501730700001801745700001701763700001701780773012401797856008301921852000902004655001202013IND60756285320221118024039.0211112e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075628532DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-021-06476-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Huxin10aEfficient defect passivation for high performance perovskite solar cell by adding alizarin red S  ap. 19552-19563.  aPlanar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have excellent photoelectric properties and show great commercialization potential. However, there are a lot of crystal defects in the perovskite films prepared by solution method, which reduces the development process of solar cells. In this work, alizarin red s (ARS) was doped into MAPbI₃ films to passivate the defect. It was shown that the addition of ARS increased the quality of perovskite film and doped perovskite film exhibited improved light absorption. In addition, it was found that there was a strong interaction between ARS and perovskite, which reduced the density of defect states. The results showed that the passivated perovskite device had improved PL intensity, increased carrier lifetimes and reduced charge recombination. After passivation, the device obtained a higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.103 V where the control device was 1.055 V, and the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the doped device was 18.82%, which is 11.36% higher than that of the control device of 16.90%.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 2019CXTD04cProgram for Nonferrous Metals Vacuum Metallurgy Innovation Team of Ministry of Science and Technology (CN) 3aabsorption 3aalizarin 3acommercialization 3aelectric potential difference 3asolar cells1 aLiu, Xingchong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3180-37681 aZhuang, Jia1 aLi, Haimin1 aWang, Hanyu1 aMa, Zhu1 aXiang, Yan1 aPeng, Xian1 aOuyang, Yukun1 aZhou, Ruonan1 aGong, Xiaoli0 tJournal of materials science.g2021 Dec., v. 56, no. 35 p.19552-19563dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-021-06476-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245008300175300001800258520089100276592002801167650002701195650001101222650001201233650002101245650001101266650001301277650002201290650001001312650001501322650002501337650002601362650001501388650002001403651001201423651001701435651001501452700002301467700002301490700001901513700002001532700002101552773009901573856008701672852000901759655001201768IND60088512820221121225811.0141102e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008851282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2011.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJauniaux, Thierry10aCytochrome P450 1A1 expression in cetacean skin biopsies from the Indian Ocean  ap. 1317-1319.  aThe study describes cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYPA1) expression in the skin of different cetacean species (Megaptera novaeangliae, n=15; Stenella attenuata, n=7 and Stenella longirostris, n=24) from the Mozambique Channel island of Mayotte. Immunohistochemical examination was performed with a monoclonal antibody against scup cytochrome CYPA1. The sex was determined using a molecular approach consisting in the genotyping sex-specific genes. CYPA1 was detected at the junction between epidermis and blubber on dolphins only, mostly in the endothelial cells. Similar observation was obtained in the dermis of one M. novaeangliae. Immunohistochemical slides were scored to evaluate the expression of the CYPA1 and a higher expression was observed in S. longirostris, suggesting a higher exposure to pollutants for this species. The difference of expression between sexes was not significant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMegaptera novaeangliae 3abiopsy 3ablubber 3acytochrome P-450 3adermis 3adolphins 3aendothelial cells 3agenes 3agenotyping 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apollutants 3awater pollution 3aComoros 3aIndian Ocean 3aMozambique1 aFarnir, Frédéric1 aFontaine, Michael,1 aKiszka, Jeremy1 aSarlet, Michael1 aCoignoul, Freddy0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2011 June, v. 62, no. 6 p.1317-1319dElsevier Ltdx0025-326X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2011.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001100147245008700158520145200245592002801697650001801725650001901743650001801762650002501780650001401805650001801819650001301837650001501850650002101865650002301886650002601909650002301935650001901958650000701977650001101984650002001995650002502015650001202040653003302052653002002085653003502105653002702140653003402167700001502201700005302216773012502269856008102394852000902475655001202484IND60762956820221119084233.0220222e20220301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076295682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1130982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Li10aHigh effective proteinaceous α-amylase inhibitors from grains and control release  aPlant-derived α-amylase inhibitors exhibit great capacity in glycaemic control by restraining dietary starch digestion. However, natural α-amylase inhibitors with strong inhibitory activity and good stability are still scarce. In this study, the inhibitory activity and stability of proteinaceous α-amylase inhibitors derived from eleven grains were examined, and microencapsulation was carried out to protect the inhibitors in gastric fluid. We found that the highland barley protein extract (HBPE) showed the most potent α-amylase inhibitory activity (IC₅₀ = 1.11 mg/mL). HBPE is a reversible noncompetitive α-amylase inhibitor and displayed good stability across various pH and temperatures. It showed high trypsin tolerance but low pepsin tolerance. Thus HBPE-encapsulated microspheres were prepared by the composite of sodium alginate/gellan gum with the internal ionic gelation method. The optimum encapsulation condition was determined, and the prepared microspheres displayed discrete, uniform and regular sphericities with diameters around 53 μm, and better mechanical strength with more than 81% activity retention rate. Moreover, the microspheres protected the HBPE in gastric fluid and extended HBPE release in the small intestinal fluid, revealing excellent control release of HBPE in simulated gastrointestinal digestion. Our study provides a new and effective strategy for the management of postprandial blood glucose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-amylase 3abarley protein 3ablood glucose 3adietary carbohydrate 3adigestion 3agastric juice 3agelation 3agellan gum 3aglycemic control 3ain vitro digestion 3aintestinal secretions 3amicroencapsulation 3amicroparticles 3apH 3apepsin 3asodium alginate 3astrength (mechanics) 3atrypsin 0aProtein extracts from grains 0aHighland barley 0aα-Amylase inhibitory activity 0aComposite microspheres 0aEncapsulation characteristics1 aFan, Qilei1 aZhao, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9495-85080 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 Mar. 01, v. 157 p.113098-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1130983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245008600170520124200256592002801498650001101526650001301537650000901550650001101559650001501570650001901585650001601604650001901620653002201639653002301661653002401684653002101708700006401729700005201793700001501845773010701860856008701967852000902054655001202063IND60678666120221121223335.0201202e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067866612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2019.1172112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Yunlong10aIndices employed for the assessment of “urban outdoor ventilation” - A review  aIn recent years, several ventilation indices have been proposed and applied to assess the efficiency of “urban outdoor ventilation”, i.e. the ability of an urban area to dilute pollutants, heat and moisture by exchanging air between inside and above of the urban canopy. Here, focusing on the pollutant dispersion, the definition of 13 ventilation indices is given, which includes indoor-initially proposed and outdoor directly proposed. Then, 63 literature studies (published until 2018) applying the ventilation indices are selected, analysed and summarized in terms of the types of geometry investigated, the timeline and the frequency of employment of each index, the turbulence models employed. Based on the analysis of such studies, advantages and limitations of each index are provided, which may help the scientific community to choose the most appropriate one depending on the specific application and objective. Future perspectives are also given, suggesting the necessity to correlate ventilation indices with urban morphological parameters, to apply indices in real urban areas characterized by building height variability and complex morphology, as well as to provide threshold values useful for urban planning purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3ageometry 3aheat 3amodels 3apollutants 3aturbulent flow 3aurban areas 3aurban planning 0aUrban ventilation 0aCity breathability 0aVentilation indices 0aUrban morphology1 aBuccolieri, Riccardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0102-72351 aGao, Zhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1657-87341 aDing, Wowo0 tAtmospheric environment.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 223 p.117211-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2019.1172113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03457naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245018800211300001400399520168000413592002802093650001302121650001202134650002102146650001502167650001102182650001402193650001202207650000902219650001502228650001302243650001902256650001802275650001002293650001902303650001402322650001402336650001202350650001602362650001202378650000902390653001102399653001102410653001502421653001402436700002302450700002602473700002002499700002702519773026302546856008502809852000902894655001202903IND60527246620221120052627.0190415e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052724662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.repbio.2015.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRazza, Eduardo M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5193-059610aScreening of biotechnical parameters for production of bovine inter-subspecies embryonic chimeras by the aggregation of tetraploid Bos indicus and diploid crossbred Bos taurus embryos  ap. 34-40.  aThe aggregation of a tetraploid zebu embryo (Bos indicus, a thermotolerant breed) with a diploid taurine embryo (Bos taurus, a thermosensitive breed) should create a complete taurine fetus, whose extra-embryonic components, e.g., the chorion, is derived mainly from the zebu embryo. These zebu-derived extra-embryonic components may interact positively with the taurine embryo/fetus during pregnancy in a tropical environment. We tested different parameters for the production of tetraploid Nelore (Bos indicus) embryos to be combined via aggregation with crossbred Bos taurus (diploid) embryos in order to produce viable chimeric blastocysts. Bovine (Bos indicus or crossbred Bos taurus) embryos were produced in vitro according to standard procedures. Two-cell Bos indicus embryos were submitted to electrofusion with varying numbers of pulses (1 or 2), voltages (0.4, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.4 and 5.0kV/cm) and time (20, 25, 50 and 60μs) to produce tetraploid embryos. Electrofused embryos were cultured with crossbred non-fused embryos to form chimeras that developed until the blastocyst stage. The best fusion parameter was 0.75kV/cm for 60μs. Four chimeric blastocysts (tetraploid Nelore with diploid crossbred Holstein) were formed after 31 attempts in 4 replicates (13%). We established an optimal procedure for the production of tetraploid Bos indicus (4n) embryos and embryonic chimeras by aggregation of crossbred Bos taurus (2n) with Bos indicus (4n) embryos. This technique would be valid in applied research, by producing exclusively taurine calves, but with placental elements from the Bos indicus breed, following transfer of these chimeras into recipient cows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aNellore 3aapplied research 3ablastocyst 3acalves 3achimerism 3achorion 3acows 3acrossbreds 3adiploidy 3aelectric power 3aelectrofusion 3afetus 3aheat tolerance 3apregnancy 3ascreening 3ataurine 3atetraploidy 3atropics 3azebu 0aBovine 0aEmbryo 0aTetraploid 0aChimerism1 aSatrapa, Rafael A.1 aEmanuelli, Isabele P.1 aBarros, Ciro M.1 aNogueira, Marcelo F.G.0 tReproductive Biology.g2016 Mar., v. 16, no. 1 p.34-40dElsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.aSociety for Biology of Reproduction & the Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of Polish Academy of Sciences in OlsztynwJournal:23206x1642-431X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.repbio.2015.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245007300183300001600256500001900272520100500291592002801296650002001324650002201344650002701366650001101393650002201404650001401426650001401440650001301454650002401467651001301491653002601504653002801530653001701558653001401575653001601589653002401605700002001629700002901649700002101678773012001699856008501819852000901904655001201913IND60700639320221120132104.0200702e20200703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070063932DNAL7 a10.1080/10871209.2020.17487692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMogomotsi, Patricia Kefilwe10aFactors influencing community participation in wildlife conservation  ap. 372-386.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBotswana is one of the few countries considered to be a haven for globally threatened wildlife species such as the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and vulnerable ones such as the African elephant (Loxondota Africana). In the recent past, human-wildlife conflicts have increased. This article investigated factors that influence community participation in wildlife conservation. Data were collected using key informant interviews (n = 18) and household surveys with farmers (n = 221). Results indicates that all respondents have had encounters with wildlife through crop-raiding, livestock predation or both. Despite coexistence with wildlife for time immemorial, local communities had negative perceptions and attitudes toward wildlife. These were linked to the spread of the foot and mouth disease (74%), a reduction in the value of livestock (62%), and problems with payment of compensation for damages to crops (58%). Based on these results, implications for policy and practice are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSyncerus caffer 3acommunity service 3afoot-and-mouth disease 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3alivestock 3apredation 3awildlife 3awildlife management 3aBotswana 0aWildlife conservation 0ahuman-wildlife conflict 0acrop-raiding 0acommunity 0aperceptions 0alivestock predation1 aStone, Lesego S1 aMogomotsi, Goemeone E.

This study aims to determine suitable areas for rice production in the inland valley of Tossahou using a GIS-based approach that evaluates and combines biophysical factors such as climate, hydrology, soil and landscape, following the FAO parameter method and guidelines for land evaluation. Soil and landscape suitability was assessed for three different rice cultivation systems: rainfed bunded (RB), cultivation under natural flooding (NF), and irrigated cultivation (RI). The results show that in the inland valley (mostly including the hydromorphic zones and the valley bottom) 52% of the area is suitable for irrigated cultivation, 18% for cultivation under natural flood and 1.2% for rainfed bunded rice. Precipitation and temperature were limiting factors for all cultivation systems. Flooding was the most limiting factor for NF while RI and RB were mostly limited by steep slopes and soil texture respectively. As a first attempt in Benin, this study can play an important role in achieving optimised rice production in inland valleys, and additional studies including socio-economic aspects, carried out in the same area, or in areas under similar conditions, are relevant to close the yield gap and improve the selection approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aclimatic factors 3acrop production 3ageographic information systems 3aguidelines 3ahydrology 3airrigation 3aland evaluation 3alandscapes 3arice 3asocioeconomics 3asoil texture 3atemperature 3avalleys 3aBenin 0aBenin 0aInland valley suitability assessment 0aGIS 0aRice production 0aWetlands1 aJütten, Thomas1 aGiertz, Simone1 aZwart, Sander J.1 aDiekkrüger, B.q(Bernd),0 tAgricultural water management.g2016 Nov., v. 177 p.95-106dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2016.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245017000169300002000339500001900359520165100378592002802029650000802057650001502065650002902080650002802109650003602137650001702173650001702190650003902207650002202246650001902268650001102287650001702298650002102315650001102336650002502347650001402372650001402386700002002400700003102420700001802451700002402469773012502493856007402618852000902692655001202701IND60699610720221118010924.0200620e20200617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069961072DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra03895d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAramesh-Boroujeni, Zahra10aParent and nano-encapsulated ytterbium(iii) complex toward binding with biological macromolecules, in vitro cytotoxicity, cleavage and antimicrobial activity studies  ap. 23002-23015.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo determine the chemotherapeutic and pharmacokinetic aspects of an ytterbium complex containing 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (Me₂Phen), in vitro binding studies were carried out with FS-DNA/BSA by employing multiple biophysical methods and a molecular modeling study. There are different techniques including absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism studies, viscosity experiments (only in the case of DNA), and competitive experiments used to determine the interaction mode between DNA/BSA and the ytterbium-complex. The results showed that the Yb-complex exhibited a high propensity for the interaction of BSA and DNA via hydrophobic interactions and van der Waals forces. Further, a competitive examination and docking study showed that the interaction site of the ytterbium complex on BSA is site III. The results of docking calculations for DNA/BSA were in good agreement with experimental findings. The complex displays efficient DNA cleavage in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, antimicrobial studies of different bacteria and fungi indicated its promising antibacterial activity. In vitro cytotoxicity studies of the Yb-complex, starch nano-encapsulated, and lipid nano-encapsulated were carried out in MCF-7 and A-549 cell lines, which revealed significantly good activity. The results of anticancer activity studies showed that the cytotoxic activity of the Yb-complex was increased when encapsulated with nanocarriers. Based on biological applications of the Yb-complex, it can be concluded that this complex and its nanocarriers can act as novel anticancer and antimicrobial candidates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aantibacterial properties 3aantineoplastic activity 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acytotoxicity 3adrug therapy 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrophobicity 3alipids 3ananocarriers 3apharmacokinetics 3astarch 3avan der Waals forces 3aviscosity 3aytterbium1 aJahani, Shohreh1 aKhorasani-Motlagh, Mozhgan1 aKerman, Kagan1 aNoroozifar, Meissam0 tRSC advances.g2020 June 17, v. 10, no. 39 p.23002-23015dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra03895d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002500113040001800138100001600156245012900172300001600301520129400317592002801611650003101639650003101670650001301701650001301714650002301727650002501750650001201775650001101787650002801798650001601826650001401842650002701856650001601883650004401899650001001943650002201953650001201975700001301987700001402000700001802014700001402032700001202046773010402058856003802162852000902200655001202209IND50088774920221117232458.0140415e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008877492DNAL7 a239348792pmid7 a10.1002/ps.36252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Haiyan10aNematicidal metabolites from roots of Stellera chamaejasme against Bursaphelenchus xylophilus and Bursaphelenchus mucronatus  ap. 827-835.  aBACKGROUND: Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, the causal agent of pine wilt disease, severely damages pine forests, and Bursaphelenchus mucronatus, a species related to B. xylophilus, is weakly pathogenic. Because the use of synthetic pesticides to control pine wilt disease has raised concerns for human and environmental health, a search for useful botanically based compounds is needed. RESULTS: The ethyl acetate layer from an ethanol extract of Stellera chamaejasme L. roots showed significant nematicidal activity against B. xylophilus and B. mucronatus, with LC₅₀ values of 169.7 and 37.7 µg mL⁻¹, respectively, at 72 h. Further purification of the active layer yielded eight effective nematicidal compounds, which were identified by mass and nuclear magnetic resonance spectral data. Among the eight bioactive compounds, chamaejasmenin C induced the highest mortality against B. xylophilus, with an LC₅₀ value of 2.7 µM at 72 h, and chamaechromone exhibited strong nematicidal activity against B. mucronatus, with an LC₅₀ value of 0.003 µM at 72 h. CONCLUSION: The nematicidal metabolites from S. chamaejasme roots could be used as lead compounds for developing botanically based nematicides for the management of pine wilt disease. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aBursaphelenchus mucronatus 3aBursaphelenchus xylophilus 3aStellera 3aacetates 3aconiferous forests 3aenvironmental health 3aethanol 3ahumans 3alethal concentration 50 3ametabolites 3amortality 3anematicidal properties 3anematicides 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aroots 3aspectral analysis 3awilting1 aJin, Hui1 aLiu, Quan1 aYan, Zhiqiang1 aDing, Lan1 aQin, Bo0 tPest management science.g2014 May, v. 70, no. 5 p.827-835dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.3625  aDNAL 7aarticle03432naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245013300173520177700306592002802083650001802111650001902129650001902148650002602167650002602193650002402219650001602243650002902259650001702288650001202305653002302317653001702340653003202357653001802389653002002407653002002427700001602447700002902463700001702492700001502509700001302524700001302537700001602550700001602566700001702582700001202599700001802611700001702629700001602646773011902662856008802781852000902869655001202878IND60716014920221118072012.0211213e20210320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071601492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1432052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Zhenzhen14aThe composition of antibiotic resistance genes is not affected by grazing but is determined by microorganisms in grassland soils  aGrazing is expected to exert a substantial influence on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in grassland ecosystems. However, the precise effects of grazing on the composition of ARGs in grassland soils remain unclear. This is especially the case for grassland soils subject to long-term grazing. Here, we investigated ARGs and bacterial community composition in soils subject to long-term historic grazing (13–39 years) and corresponding ungrazed samples. Using a combination of shotgun metagenomics, amplicon analyses and associated soil physicochemical data, we provide novel insights regarding the structure of ARGs in grassland soils. Interestingly, our analysis revealed that long-term historic grazing had no impacts on the composition of ARGs in grassland soils. An average of 378 ARGs, conferring resistance to 14 major categories of antibiotics (80%), were identified in both grazing and ungrazed sites. Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria were the most prevalent predicted hosts in these soils and were also shown to harbour genetic capacity for multiple-resistant ARGs. Our results suggested that positive effects of bacterial community composition on ARGs could potentially be controlled by affecting MGEs. Soil properties had direct effects on the composition of ARGs through affecting the frequency of horizontal gene transfer among bacteria. Twelve novel ARGs were found in S. grandis steppe grasslands, indicating that different vegetation types might induce shifts in soil ARGs. Collectively, these findings suggest that soil properties, plants and microorganisms play critical roles in shaping ARG patterns in grasslands. Together, these data establish a solid baseline for understanding environmental antibiotic resistance in grasslands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidobacteria 3aActinobacteria 3aProteobacteria 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacterial communities 3acommunity structure 3aenvironment 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3ametagenomics 3asteppes 0aGrazing management 0aMetagenomics 0aAntibiotic resistance genes 0aSoil microbes 0aEurasian steppe 0aGrassland soils1 aLi, Linfeng1 aMakhalanyane, Thulani P.1 aXu, Chunming1 aLi, Kaihui1 aXue, Kai1 aXu, Cong1 aQian, Ruyan1 aZhang, Biao1 aDu, Jianqing1 aYu, Hua1 aCui, Xiaoyong1 aWang, Yanfen1 aHao, Yanbin0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Mar. 20, v. 761 p.143205-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1432053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245013300161300002000294520115800314592002801472596003601500650001401536650002301550650002101573650001001594650001301604650001401617650001701631650001601648700005201664773012401716856008301840852000901923655001201932IND60756285820221118023955.0211112e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075628582DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-021-06488-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Li10aZeolite-templated mesocellular graphene foam with adjustable defects as highly efficient catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction  ap. 19589-19598.  aIn this study, zeolite-templated mesocellular graphene foam was facilely synthesized by pyrolysis under different temperatures for oxygen reduction reaction. Investigations found that MGF can be regulated with different structure properties by controlling the pyrolysis temperature, where the MGF-900 (pyrolyzed under 900 °C) possessed a large BET specific surface area (619 m² g⁻¹), a hierarchically micro–meso–macroporous carbon framework, and a better balance between conductivity and active sites than the other counterparts (MGF-800 and MGF-1000). As a result, MGF-900 had the most excellent catalytic activity, the most positive onset potential of − 0.1 V and the highest current density of 5.01 mA cm⁻² among the different samples and many other reported carbon-based catalysts. More importantly, despite no heterogeneous atoms doping, the catalytic activity of MGF-900 was nearly equal to that of commercial Pt/C catalyst. Regarding tolerance and stability, MGF-900 behaved even better. Therefore, as a superior metal-free electrocatalyst, MGF-900 is proved to be well applied in highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction.  aPublisher supplied data  a51708124cyoung scientists fund 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3afoams 3agraphene 3apyrolysis 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aWang, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2904-60210 tJournal of materials science.g2021 Dec., v. 56, no. 35 p.19589-19598dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-021-06488-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002000176245007700196300001500273520111700288592002801405650001501433650002201448650001101470650001701481650000901498650001101507650001101518700001801529700002201547700003201569700001901601700001801620773015201638856007001790856009401860990002301954852000901977655001201986IND60608494320221118211030.0190510e20170212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060849432DNAL7 a10.3791/549702doi7 aPMC54077072pmcid7 a282875702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeemburg, Susan10aInvestigating motor skill learning processes with a robotic manipulandum  ap. e54970.  aSkilled reaching tasks are commonly used in studies of motor skill learning and motor function under healthy and pathological conditions, but can be time-intensive and ambiguous to quantify beyond simple success rates. Here, we describe the training procedure for reach-and-pull tasks with ETH Pattus, a robotic platform for automated forelimb reaching training that records pulling and hand rotation movements in rats. Kinematic quantification of the performed pulling attempts reveals the presence of distinct temporal profiles of movement parameters such as pulling velocity, spatial variability of the pulling trajectory, deviation from midline, as well as pulling success. We show how minor adjustments in the training paradigm result in alterations in these parameters, revealing their relation to task difficulty, general motor function or skilled task execution. Combined with electrophysiological, pharmacological and optogenetic techniques, this paradigm can be used to explore the mechanisms underlying motor learning and memory formation, as well as loss and recovery of function (e.g. after stroke).  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3aelectrophysiology 3amemory 3aoptogenetics 3arats 3arobots 3astroke1 aIijima, Maiko1 aLambercy, Olivier1 aNallet-Khosrofian, Lauriane1 aGassert, Roger1 aLuft, Andreas0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2017 Feb. 12, , no. 120 p.e54970-e54970dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/549703Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/54970/investigating-motor-skill-learning-processes-with-robotic  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02085naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245007300168300001800241520094900259592002801208650002601236650001101262650002401273650001401297650002301311650001201334650003001346650001101376650001201387650002001399651001001419700001901429700001401448700001301462700001701475773009901492856008701591852000901678655001201687IND60088513220221121110831.0141102e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008851322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2011.03.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGan, Ju-Li10aEnormous PCBs increase in oysters from the coast of Guangdong, China  ap. 1333-1336.  aPCBs equivalent to Aroclor 1242 and 1254 in soft tissues of oysters Crassostrea rivularis from the Guangdong coast, China, were measured using a GC-ECD.

Because of the wide biogeographical distribution of rice, such evaluations are conducted exclusively through modeling efforts. However, geographical forecasts could, potentially, be improved by the inclusion of field-based data on projected increases in temperature and CO₂ concentration from a given rice-growing region. In this study, the latest version of the ORYZA (v3) crop model was evaluated with additional yield data obtained from a temperature-controlled free-air CO₂ enrichment system (T-FACE) in Southeastern China. ORYZA (v3) results were then evaluated in the context of phase five of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) for representative concentration pathways (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 using five global change models (GCMs). Our findings indicate that climate change, i.e., inclusion of CO₂ and temperature effects, decreased mean rice yield by 3.5%, and 9.4% for RCP 4.5; and by 10.5 and 47.9% for RCP 8.5 for the scenarios in the 2050s and 2080s, respectively. The CO₂ fertilizer effect partially compensated but did not offset the negative impacts of rising temperature on rice yields. Warmer temperatures were the primary factor that influenced yield by adversely affecting the spikelet fertility factor and spikelet number. Overall, climate change would have positive effects on rice yields until the middle-century in Southeastern China but negative effects were noted by the end of the century. These results may be of interest for informing policy makers and developing appropriate strategies to improve future rice productivity for this region of China.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3acrop models 3aenvironment 3afertilizers 3afood security 3ageographical distribution 3aissues and policy 3arice 3asimulation models 3aspikelets 3atemperature 3aChina 0aClimate change 0aT-FACE 0aORYZA (v3) model 0aRice yield 0aSoutheastern China1 aYuan, Shen1 aWu, Chao1 aYang, Shenbing1 aZhang, Weiyang1 aXu, Yunji1 aGu, Junfei1 aZhang, Hao1 aWang, Zhiqin1 aYang, Jianchang1 aZhu, Jianguo0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Mar. 20, v. 761 p.143206-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1432063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03502naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013000168300001600298520209000314592002802404650001502432650001402447650001302461650001502474650002202489650001902511650001402530650001202544650002902556650001302585650002202598650001902620650000902639650001602648651002002664653002202684653001502706653001102721653001602732653002002748653002802768700002102796773010702817856008702924852000903011655001203020IND60524874220221118160301.0190405e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052487422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jrurstud.2016.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBryant, Lia10aBounded choices: The problematisation of longterm care for people ageing with an intellectual disability in rural communities  ap. 259-266.  aThe increasing longevity of people with an intellectual disability and concurrent ageing with their older parental carers is generating a problematisation of longterm social care in the community. In rural communities this problematisation is complicated by spacial distribution and paucity of specialist disability and aged care services to cater to the emerging needs of these families. In-depth interviews with six families in rural South Australia were conducted to explore their experiences of caring in the community and future post-parental care plan for their son/daughter with an intellectual disability. The data reveal how the gendered nature of care installs moral responsibility for care through maternal subjectivity and problematizes relinquishing that care. The relinquishing of care was also problematised by a delimited discourse on care transition with a foundation in uncertain futures and bounded choices for longterm post-parental care. Powerful normative constructions of the ‘good mother’ are therefore at the heart of the ‘carescape’ for intellectual disability and shape intersubjective relations between mothers and their sons/daughters, neoliberal community care policy and practices and emotions associated with caring. The ethic of care normalised in the context of this carescape legitimates the State’s limited provision of statutory services and supports for carers and people with disabilities. However, the increasing life-expectancy of people with intellectual disability and the age-related needs of their parental caregivers is problematizing this social service lacuna. The absence of clearly demarcated and suitable pathways for future care transition is an everyday lived uncertainty for older rural carers, subject to the agency of others and a concern that their son/daughter will enter into less desirable forms of care. Delimited agency and opportunity for those who give and receive care requires problematisation of the political, cultural and moral discourses through which longterm social care in the community is constituted.  aPublisher supplied data 3acaregivers 3adaughters 3aemotions 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3along term care 3alongevity 3amothers 3apeople with disabilities 3apolitics 3arural communities 3arural families 3asons 3auncertainty 3aSouth Australia 0aPostparental care 0aDisability 0aAgeing 0aSocial care 0aRural community 0aMaternal subjectivities1 aGarnham, Bridget0 tJournal of rural studies.g2017 Apr., v. 51 p.259-266dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl38039x0743-01677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2016.05.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01899naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001300181245004100194300001800235506007600253520076800329592002801097506003701125650000801162650000801170650002001178650001201198650001701210650002601227650001501253650002101268700001801289773013501307856007401442852000901516655001201525IND60661330020221207130547.0190829e20111114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066133002DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cs00162g2doi7 aPMC55758592pmcid7 a212900322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Nan10aFluorescent DNA-based enzyme sensors  ap. 5756-5770.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFluorescent sensors that make use of DNA structures have become widely useful in monitoring enzymatic activities. Early studies focused primarily on enzymes that naturally use DNA or RNA as the substrate. However, recent advances in molecular design have enabled the development of nucleic acid sensors for a wider range of functions, including enzymes that do not normally bind DNA or RNA. Nucleic acid sensors present some potential advantages over classical small-molecule sensors, including water solubility and ease of synthesis. An overview of the multiple strategies under recent development is presented in this critical review, and expected future developments in microarrays, single molecule analysis, and in vivo sensing are discussed (160 references).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3afluorescence 3amicroarray technology 3amonitoring 3awater solubility1 aKool, Eric T.0 tChemical Society reviews.g2011 Nov. 14, v. 40, no. 12 p.5756-5770dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0cs00162g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245015100162300002000313520123300333592002801566650001101594650001101605650002101616650002201637650002201659650001901681650001501700650001401715653000801729653002701737653003101764653002301795653002401818700002001842700001401862700001401876700001501890700001601905700002101921700001701942773012601959856008002085852000902165655001202174IND60532186020221118024933.0160728e20160727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053218602DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b047702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Xiaohui10aHierarchical Nanocomposite of Hollow N-Doped Carbon Spheres Decorated with Ultrathin WS2 Nanosheets for High-Performance Lithium-Ion Battery Anode  ap. 18841-18848.  aHierarchical nanocomposite of ultrathin WS₂ nanosheets uniformly attached on the surface of hollow nitrogen-doped carbon spheres (WS₂@HNCSs) were successfully fabricated via a facile synthesis strategy. When evaluated as an anode material for LIBs, the hierarchical WS₂@HNCSs exhibit a high specific capacity of 801.4 mA h g–¹ at 0.1 A g–¹, excellent rate capability (545.6 mA h g–¹ at a high current density of 2 A g–¹), and great cycling stability with a capacity retention of 95.8% after 150 cycles at 0.5 A g–¹. The Li-ion storage properties of our WS₂@HNCSs nanocomposite are much better than those of the previously most reported WS₂-based anode materials. The impressive electrochemical performance is attributed to the robust nanostructure and the favorable synergistic effect between the ultrathin (3–5 layers) WS₂ nanosheets and the highly conductive hollow N-doped carbon spheres. The hierarchical hybrid can simultaneously facilitate fast electron/ion transfer, effectively accommodate mechanical stress from cycling, restrain agglomeration, and enable full utilization of the active materials. These characteristics make WS₂@HNCSs a promising anode material for high-performance LIBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbon 3aelectrochemistry 3alithium batteries 3amechanical stress 3ananocomposites 3ananosheets 3asynergism 0aWS2 0ahierarchical structure 0ahollow conductive material 0asynergistic effect 0alithium-ion storage1 aDing, Zhengping1 aMa, Cheng1 aWu, Laidi1 aLiu, Jiatu1 aChen, Libao1 aIvey, Douglas

It could result from polymorphisms in genes coding for proteins involved in the absorption process and in interaction with dietary intakes. To assess whether the extent of cholesterol absorption or synthesis is modified in adult women according to the −493 G/T polymorphism in the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein gene (MTP) and/or the habitual diet. Cholestanol and sitosterol, as well as desmosterol and lathosterol, surrogate markers of cholesterol absorption or synthesis, respectively, were analyzed in the fasting plasma of 69 middle-aged women under a Western-type diet (WD) and after 3 months on a low-saturated fat, low-cholesterol/Mediterranean-type diet (LFLCD). Genotypes for MTP −493G/T polymorphism were determined. Under an usual WD, subjects homozygous for the MTP −493 T allele exhibited higher (P < 0.05) fasting serum concentrations of cholestanol (199.0 ± 30.0 vs. 133 ± 7.4 × 10² mmol/mol cholesterol) and lathosterol (188.7 ± 21.8 vs. 147.6 ± 9.1 × 10² mmol/mol cholesterol), as well as total cholesterol (7.32 ± 0.22 vs. 6.63 ± 0.12 mmol/l) compared to G carrier subjects. After 3 months on a LFLCD, level of absorption markers decreased in TT subjects with no change in synthesis ones, leading to values comparable to those measured in G carriers. The lowering of plasma total and LDL cholesterol due to dietary change was 2.4- and 2.3-fold greater in TT women than in G carriers. The polymorphism −493G/T in MTP modulates the level of cholesterol absorption but not synthesis in women under a WD, an effect abolished under a prudent LFLCD.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3aadults 3aalleles 3ablood serum 3afood intake 3ahomozygosity 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3asitosterols 3atriacylglycerols 3awomen1 aVergnes, Marie-France1 aDefoort, Catherine1 aPlanells, Richard1 aPortugal, Henri1 aNicolay, Alain1 aLairon, Denis0 tGenes & nutrition.g2011 Feb., v. 6, no. 1 p.71-79dSpringer-Verlagx1555-89327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12263-010-0174-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01386naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245020200154300001400356520026500370592002800635650003100663650001600694650002500710650001300735650001500748650001500763700001600778700001600794700001500810700001600825773012400841856007400965852000901039655001201048IND60667283520221119145556.0190919e20141024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066728352DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra90035a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yu10aCorrection: The reduction effect of dietary flavone C- and O-glycosides on the formation of acrylamide and its correlation and prediction with the antioxidant activity of Maillard reaction products  ap. 54199.  aCorrection for ‘The reduction effect of dietary flavone C- and O-glycosides on the formation of acrylamide and its correlation and prediction with the antioxidant activity of Maillard reaction products’ by Yu Zhang et al., RSC Adv., 2014, 4, 24147–24155.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaillard reaction products 3aacrylamides 3aantioxidant activity 3aflavones 3aglycosides 3aprediction1 aChen, Xinyu1 aZheng, Run,1 aJin, Cheng1 aZhang, Ying0 tRSC advances.g2014 Oct. 24, v. 4, no. 97 p.54199-54199dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra90035a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010500160500001400265520147700279592002801756650002701784650002401811650001201835650002201847650001401869650001801883650001401901650001701915650001201932650001401944650000901958650001301967700001901980700001801999700001702017773012302034856007402157852000902231655001202240IND60711791520221121195003.0200928e20200910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071179152DNAL7 a10.3390/nu120927682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShindo, Yutaka 10aInhibition of Mg2+ Extrusion Attenuates Glutamate Excitotoxicity in Cultured Rat Hippocampal Neurons  aNAL-light  aMagnesium plays important roles in the nervous system. An increase in the Mg²⁺ concentration in cerebrospinal fluid enhances neural functions, while Mg²⁺ deficiency is implicated in neuronal diseases in the central nervous system. We have previously demonstrated that high concentrations of glutamate induce excitotoxicity and elicit a transient increase in the intracellular concentration of Mg²⁺ due to the release of Mg²⁺ from mitochondria, followed by a decrease to below steady-state levels. Since Mg²⁺ deficiency is involved in neuronal diseases, this decrease presumably affects neuronal survival under excitotoxic conditions. However, the mechanism of the Mg²⁺ decrease and its effect on the excitotoxicity process have not been elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that inhibitors of Mg²⁺ extrusion, quinidine and amiloride, attenuated glutamate excitotoxicity in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. A toxic concentration of glutamate induced both Mg²⁺ release from mitochondria and Mg²⁺ extrusion from cytosol, and both quinidine and amiloride suppressed only the extrusion. This resulted in the maintenance of a higher Mg²⁺ concentration in the cytosol than under steady-state conditions during the ten-minute exposure to glutamate. These inhibitors also attenuated the glutamate-induced depression of cellular energy metabolism. Our data indicate the importance of Mg²⁺ regulation in neuronal survival under excitotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acentral nervous system 3acerebrospinal fluid 3acytosol 3aenergy metabolism 3aextrusion 3aglutamic acid 3amagnesium 3amitochondria 3aneurons 3aquinidine 3arats 3atoxicity1 aYamanaka, Ryu 1 aHotta, Kohji 1 aOka, Kotaro 0 tNutrients.g2020 Sept. 10, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120927683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245013200156300001800288500002000306520124300326592002801569596006601597596005901663596006201722650001801784650001901802650001601821650001301837650001401850650001801864650001601882650002001898650002401918650002101942650001801963700001701981700001501998700001802013700001402031700001502045700001602060773013702076856007202213852000902285655001202294IND60748916620221121000102.0210827e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074891662DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.51082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yuxuan10aEvaluation of the Acute Effects and Oxidative Stress Responses of Phenicol Antibiotics and Suspended Particles in Daphnia magna  ap. 2463-2473.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSuspended particles (SP) exist widely in various water systems and are able to adsorb other pollutants in water, producing ecotoxic effects on aquatic nontarget species. Until now, however, few studies have focused on the effects of SP on antibiotics. Therefore, the present study investigated the effects of the mixtures of SP and phenicol antibiotics (chloramphenicol [CAP], thiamphenicol [TAP]) on acute toxicity and oxidative stress responses in Daphnia magna. The results indicated that the acute toxicity of phenicol antibiotics in D. magna was increased when combined with SP. Besides, the immobilization of daphnids caused by phenicol drugs in the presence of 10 mg/L of SP was more intense than that with 200 mg/L of SP. Furthermore, the impact of SP with diverse concentrations on the activity of catalase and the level of reduced glutathione in D. magna was different. Notably, almost all CAP + TAP + SP treatments markedly increased malondialdehyde content in D. magna, causing potential cellular oxidative damage in D. magna. In summary, the present study provides insights into the toxic effects of phenicol antibiotic and SP mixtures on aquatic organisms.

However, restoration and conservation are not free; they consume huge amounts of resources that would otherwise support social and economic development. Therefore, excessive conservation creates a risk of creating rather than eliminating poverty. Unfortunately, scientists have largely ignored the balance between these contrasting goals. Here, we discuss the concept of finding the threshold that represents a suitable balance between ecological conservation and economic development, thereby maximizing the benefits for both humans and the environment and promoting sustainable development. To demonstrate the concept, we examined China’s ecological restoration achievements and discussed some of the unforeseen negative consequences that accompanied these achievements to discuss how future policies could better balance ecological and socioeconomic goals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aecological restoration 3apoverty 3arisk 3asocioeconomic development 3asustainable development 3aChina1 aLiu, Zhexi1 aLi, Weiming1 aXian, Junli0 tAmbio.g2021 May, v. 50, no. 5 p.1117-1122dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl28633x0044-74477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-020-01448-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01447naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245010300163300001800266520047200284592002800756650002300784650002100807650002300828650001200851700002500863700001900888700002100907773013400928856007401062852000901136655001201145IND60661330220221122003724.0190829e20110620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066133022DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cs00164c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGladiali, Serafino10aBINEPINES: chiral binaphthalene-core monophosphepine ligands for multipurpose asymmetric catalysis  ap. 3744-3763.  aThe atropisomeric structure of 4,5-dihydro-3H-dinaphtho[2,1-c;1′,2′-e]phosphepine is the common axially chiral scaffold of a library of monophosphine ligands nicknamed BINEPINES that have shown a quite remarkable stereoselection efficiency in a broad variety of enantioselective reactions involving the formation of new C–H or C–C or C–X bonds.

However, if the reaction between NH3 and NOx is unbalanced, it can lead either NH3 or NOx being released into the environment. As NH3 is classified as a dangerous compound in the environment, its accurate measurement is essential. Tuneable Diode Laser (TDL) spectroscopy is one of the methods used to measure raw emissions inside engine exhaust pipes, especially NH3. This instrument requires a real-time exhaust temperature, pressure and other interference compounds in order to adjust itself to reduce the error in NH3 readings. Most researchers believed that exhaust temperature and pressure were the most influential factors in TDL when measuring NH3 inside exhaust pipes. The aim of this paper was to quantify these interference effects on TDL when undertaking NH3 measurement. Surprisingly, the results show that pressure was the least influential factor when compared to temperature, H2O, CO2 and O2 when undertaking NH3 measurement using TDL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3adiesel engines 3adiodes 3aemissions 3anitrogen 3anitrogen oxides 3aoxygen 3apipes 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature 0aTuneable diode laser 0aAmmonia 0aDiesel engine 0aEmission 0aExhaust gas1 aEl-Hamalawi, Ashraf1 aBaxter, Jim1 aBarrett, Richard1 aWheatley, Andrew0 tAtmospheric environment.g2018 Jan., v. 172 p.12-15dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.10.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02119naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245006400169300001100233520088600244592002801130650003901158650002601197650001801223650003001241650001601271650002401287650001601311650001401327650001701341650001101358650001501369650001001384650001301394651001401407700001701421700005501438773012401493856008301617852000901700655001201709IND60733726720221116215011.0211230e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073372672DNAL7 a10.1007/s13314-021-00423-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConstable, Fiona10aViruses in cucurbit seeds from on-line mail-order providers  ap. 10.  aSeeds of three important cucurbit species (cucumber, melon and zucchini) were obtained through on-line mail-order providers and tested for selected viruses of biosecurity and agronomic concern.

The AlCl₃ solution dispersed in petroleum wax (capping media) was firstly dehydrated at 100 °C under inert atmosphere for manufacturing anhydrous AlCl₃-nanorods (length: 50–100 nm; diameter: 5–10 nm). In a second step, this support was oxidized into γ-alumina at 300 °C, under air atmosphere. In the course of the manufacturing process, released chlorine was deposited at the surface of the nanorods (more specifically during the oxidation step). The binding of chlorine (5.35%, w/w at the surface) onto γ-alumina was demonstrated by both electron dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM–EDX) and Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy. Specific surface area reached 230 m² g⁻¹; the average pore size was 7.8 nm. Material characterization was completed by measuring the surface acidity through both temperature-programmed desorption and pyridine desorption. The morphology and the phase structure were investigated using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis, respectively. SAGMA (γ-alumina) can be described as a strong Lewis (1.713 mmol g⁻¹; i.e., about 93% of total acid sites) and Brønsted acid catalyst supported on a mesoporous structure (self-granular size of 177–250 µm). Cumene conversion (through a dealkylation pathway) was tested on SAGMA: maximum catalytic activity reached 87% at 300 °C. The conversion is highly selective: the reaction produces benzene and only traces of ethylbenzene (mass fraction below 4% compared to benzene). Apart from this good catalytic efficiency, the material is characterized by its strong stability in terms of both catalytic activity (loss less than 2%, for optimum conditions) and surface acidity (loss less than 3%), even for long reaction times (i.e., 24 h) under severe conditions (i.e., T 300 °C). This new material, easily manufactured, is characterized by high efficiency and selectivity in cumene conversion into benzene, associated with high acidity and good stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBronsted acids 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacidity 3aair 3aaluminum chloride 3aaluminum oxide 3abenzene 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achlorine 3adealkylation 3adesorption 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aethylbenzene 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amanufacturing 3ananorods 3aoxidation 3apetroleum 3aporosity 3aporous media 3apyridines 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area1 aEl Naga, Ahmed O.

The most frequent criticism of these procedures is that responses of surrogate species in the laboratory are not representative of responses of natural populations. A tiered approach using both laboratory and microcosm exposures (96‐h and 21‐d laboratory bioassays and a 3‐mo field microcosm) was conducted to compare the impacts of sediment‐spiked cadmium on the mortality, development, and abundance of Chironomidae larvae. The 96‐h and 21‐d lethal concentrations of sediment‐spiked Cd to 50% of the species Chironomus riparius were estimated to be 201.07 and 172.66 mg/kg, respectively. In the 21‐d laboratory bioassay, the endpoints, including the development rate and emergence ratio, were compared, and the lowest‐observed‐effect concentration (LOEC) values were 325.8 and 10.7 mg/kg, respectively. The abundance, richness, and biomass of field‐collected larvae were compared among the different treatments in the field microcosm, and it was found that the order of sensitivities using different endpoints was biomass (2.6/5.2 mg/kg of no‐observed‐effect concentration/LOEC) > diversity (10.7/21.2 mg/kg) > abundance (41.2/82.7 mg/kg). The toxicity values based on lethal/sublethal changes in the laboratory bioassays might not fully protect field organisms against damage from chemicals, such as Cd, unless an assessment factor of 5 is used. These findings highlight the need to conduct field validation of criteria/guidelines before they are introduced to protect organisms/ecosystems in the field and provide a preliminary template for future field validation of criteria elsewhere.

While one contig encoded a predicted 2990 amino acid protein with 83 % identity to the recently described posavirus 1, the other contig encoded a predicted 2942 amino acid protein with only 25 % identity limited to the genomic region encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of posavirus 2. Besides RdRp, search of the conserved domain database identified domains associated with picornavirus capsid proteins but failed to identify picornaviral helicase and proteinase domains. In addition, a domain representing a family of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma immunoglobulin-blocking virulence proteins was identified near the 5′-terminus. Phylogenetic analysis found a distant relationship between this novel virus, provisionally named posavirus 3, to the unclassified posaviruses and fisavirus which are proposed to represent different genera in a novel family of the Picornavirales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycoplasma 3aPicornavirales 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aUreaplasma 3aamino acids 3acoat proteins 3adatabases 3afeces 3ametagenomics 3aopen reading frames 3aphylogeny 3aproteinases 3aswine 3avirulence 3aviruses1 aHesse, Richard A.1 aAnderson, Gary A.0 tVirus genes.g2015 Aug., v. 51, no. 1 p.144-147dSpringer USx0920-85697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-015-1215-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02406naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245013200173300001400305520138000319592002801699650002501727650002501752650002401777650002201801650001801823650001901841650002101860773009101881856008801972990002302060852000902083655001202092IND60099381420221123013222.0141105e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009938142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.habitatint.2011.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalaban, Osman14aThe negative effects of construction boom on urban planning and environment in Turkey: Unraveling the role of the public sector  ap. 26-35.  aConstruction sector is usually accepted as the engine that triggers economic growth due to its strong backward and forward linkages with other sectors. On the other hand, it is also argued that increased construction activity could end up with negative economic, social and environmental impacts. The literature emphasizes the role of public sector, especially the national governments in minimizing the negative impacts of construction activity. The related arguments mostly postulate that public sector is well aware of the environmental challenges caused by construction activity and devoted to the understanding of how to improve the sustainability performance of private developers. Yet the case of Turkey provides significant evidences to question these assumptions. In this respect, this paper elaborates on the negative impacts of increased construction activity in Turkey and argues the role of public sector in intensification of the negative environmental effects through deregulation on urban planning and housing production by public agencies. The findings of the research highlight the importance of sustainable construction and verify the need for mainstreaming of sustainable construction into public policy-making at national and local levels, especially in developing countries, where most, if not all, of the future urban population growth will take place.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloping countries 3aenvironmental impact 3agovernment agencies 3apopulation growth 3apublic sector 3aurban planning 3aurban population0 tHabitat international.g2012 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.26-35dElsevier Ltdx0197-39757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2011.05.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01275naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245009400170300001400264520017300278592002800451650002100479650002500500650002500525650001100550650001400561700001800575700002200593700002000615700002700635700002200662700003300684773012500717856007400842852000900916655001200925IND60667284220221119145306.0190919e20141111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066728422DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra90043j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStaver, Mladenka Malenica10aCorrection: Bioactivity of Satureja montana L. honey extracts and their profile screening  ap. 60306.  aCorrection for ‘Bioactivity of Satureja montana L. honey extracts and their profile screening’ by Mladenka Malenica Staver et al., RSC Adv., 2014, 4, 47329–47340.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSatureja montana 3abioactive properties 3achemical composition 3anectar 3ascreening1 aRatkaj, Ivana1 aBroznić, Dalibor1 aJerković, Igor1 aMarijanović, Zvonimir1 aŽeljezić, Davor1 aKraljević Pavelić, Sandra,0 tRSC advances.g2014 Nov. 11, v. 4, no. 104 p.60306-60306dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra90043j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03093naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006200146245013600208300002000344520117000364592002801534596008001562650002501642650003601667650001301703650002301716650000901739650001901748650001801767650002601785650002201811650002101833650001801854650002501872650001601897650002301913653001801936653002301954653002801977700005802005700005802063700001602121700002002137700005702157700005802214700006302272773015002335856008102485852000902566655001202575IND60793360720220914000000.0220914e20220830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079336072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.2c043792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmbrosini, Stefano1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4079-941110aChemical Characterization of a Collagen-Derived Protein Hydrolysate and Biostimulant Activity Assessment of Its Peptidic Components  ap. 11201-11211.  aProtein hydrolysates (PHs) are plant biostimulants consisting of oligopeptides and free amino acids exploited in agriculture to increase crop productivity. This work aimed to fractionate a commercial collagen-derived protein hydrolysate (CDPH) according to the molecular mass of the peptides and evaluate the bioactivity of different components. First, the CDPH was dialyzed and/or filtrated and analyzed on maize, showing that smaller compounds were particularly active in stimulating lateral root growth. The CDPH was then fractionated through fast protein liquid chromatography and tested on in vitro grown tomatoes proving that all the fractions were bioactive. Furthermore, these fractions were characterized by liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry revealing a consensus sequence shared among the identified peptides. Based on this sequence, a synthetic peptide was produced. We assessed its structural similarity with the CDPH, the collagen, and polyproline type II helix by comparing the respective circular dichroism spectra and for the first time, we proved that a signature peptide was as bioactive as the whole CDPH.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcUniversit? degli Studi di Veronadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100007052 3abioactive properties 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acollagen 3aconsensus sequence 3acorn 3afood chemistry 3alateral roots 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3aoligopeptides 3aprotein hydrolysates 3aroot growth 3asynthetic peptides 0abiostimulants 0abioactive peptides 0asustainable agriculture1 aPrinsi, Bhakti1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6641-15371 aZamboni, Anita1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2895-55091 aEspen, Luca1 aZanzoni, Serena1 aSanti, Chiara1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6783-74011 aVaranini, Zeno1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5614-20141 aPandolfini, Tiziana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1658-22310 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2022 Aug. 30, v. 70, no. 36 p.11201-11211dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.2c043793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010700155500001400262520149200276592002801768650002501796650001801821650001801839650001301857650003601870650001801906650001001924650001001934650000901944650002001953650002701973650001402000650001402014650002402028700001502052700002002067700001602087700001402103700001302117700001902130700001502149700001802164700001802182700001502200700001702215773012302232856007402355852000902429655001202438IND60711791920221121195024.0200928e20200911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071179192DNAL7 a10.3390/nu120927702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Chao 10aIntensive Running Enhances NF-κB Activity in the Mice Liver and the Intervention Effects of Quercetin  aNAL-light  aBackground: Emerging evidence has supported that intensive exercise induces weakened performance and immune and metabolic disorders. We systematically evaluated the effects of quercetin against hepatic inflammatory damage caused by repeated intensive exercise and explored the potential mechanism. Methods: Male BALB/c mice were administered quercetin (100 mg/kg BW) for four weeks, and performed a treadmill running protocol of 28 m/min, 5° slope, 90 min/day concurrently for the last seven days. Results: Quercetin administration reduced the leakage of aspartic acid and alanine aminotransferase and improved ultrastructural abnormalities such as swelling, and degeneration caused by high-intensity running in mice. Quercetin significantly decreased the hepatic and plasmatic levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1—provoked by over-exercise. Furthermore, diminished activation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB were found after quercetin treatment through inhibiting IKKα and Iκbα phosphorylation of intensive running mice. Conclusion: Quercetin offers protection for mouse livers against intensive sports-induced inflammatory injury, and the suppression of the NF-κB signal transduction pathway may play a role in its anti-inflammatory effects. Our findings broaden our understanding of natural phytochemicals as a promising strategy to prevent excessive exercise damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine transaminase 3aaspartic acid 3acell adhesion 3aexercise 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainterleukin-6 3aliver 3amales 3amice 3aphosphorylation 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aprotocols 3aquercetin 3asignal transduction1 aLiu, Yang 1 aJiang, Chunjie 1 aLiu, Liang 1 aLi, Juan 1 aLi, Dan 1 aGuo, Xiaoping 1 aWang, Zhu 1 aYang, Yuexin 1 aLiu, Liegang 1 aYao, Ping 1 aTang, Yuhan 0 tNutrients.g2020 Sept. 11, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120927703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245005000208300001200258506007600270520131000346592002801656506003701684650001301721650002001734650001901754650001701773650001401790650001901804650003801823650001101861650001701872650001401889650001701903650001901920650001101939700001701950700002901967773008701996856008102083852000902164655001202173IND60585573820221207115418.0171110e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058557382DNAL7 a10.1007/s12263-010-0185-72doi7 aPMC30407962pmcid7 a214370252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRimbach, Gerald10aChocolate: (un)healthy source of polyphenols?  ap. 1-3.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThere is recent epidemiological evidence that chocolate consumption may improve vascular health. Furthermore, several small-scale human intervention studies indicate that habitual chocolate intake enhances the production of vasodilative nitric oxide and may lower blood pressure. It is hypothesized that potential beneficial effects of chocolate on vascular health are at least partly mediated by cocoa polyphenols including procyanidins. Based on cell culture studies, molecular targets of chocolate polyphenols are endothelial nitric oxide synthetase as well as arginase. However, human bioavailability studies suggest that the plasma concentrations of cocoa polyphenols are manifold lower than those concentrations used in cultured cells in vitro. The experimental evidence for beneficial vascular effects of chocolate in human interventions studies is yet not fully convincing. Some human intervention studies on chocolate and its polyphenols lack a stringent study design. They are sometimes underpowered and not always placebo controlled. Dietary chocolate intake in many of these human studies was up to 100 g per day. Since chocolate is a rich source of sugar and saturated fat, it is questionable whether chocolate could be recommended as part of a nutrition strategy to promote vascular health.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarginase 3abioavailability 3ablood pressure 3acell culture 3achocolate 3acultured cells 3aendothelial nitric oxide synthase 3ahumans 3anitric oxide 3anutrition 3aprocyanidins 3asaturated fats 3asugars1 aEgert, Sarah1 ade Pascual-Teresa, Sonia0 tGenes & nutrition.g2011 Feb., v. 6, no. 1 p.1-3dSpringer-Verlagx1555-89327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12263-010-0185-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245012400159300001600283500001900299520123500318592002801553650001301581650001601594650002201610650001201632650001701644650001601661650000901677650002001686650001801706650002401724650001401748653001401762653001901776653001201795653001101807653001201818653001401830700001601844700001701860700001501877700002001892773013901912856007802051852000902129655001202138IND60740672920221116231214.0210604e20210119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074067292DNAL7 a10.1139/cjas-2020-01052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRico, D.E.10aProduction performance and oxidative stability of milk enriched with n-3 fatty acids in Holstein cows fed flaxseed meal  ap. 329-341.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSix Holstein cows were used in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin Square design to investigate the effect of flaxseed meal on production performance and oxidative stability of milk enriched with n-3 fatty acids. Flaxseed oil was abomasally infused to all cows at 243 g·d⁻¹ which increased milk concentration of α-linolenic acid from 3.08 (pretrial) up to 53.0 mg·g⁻¹ fat. On a dry matter basis, dietary treatments were canola meal (CM; 165 g·kg⁻¹), flaxseed meal (FM; 165 g·kg⁻¹), and CM (165 g·kg⁻¹) + vitamin E (VE; 300 IU·kg⁻¹). Pre-planned contrasts were CM vs. FM and VE vs. FM. No difference was observed on dry matter intake, milk production, and yield of milk protein, and lactose for any of the contrasts evaluated. However, fat yield tended to be lower with FM relative to CM but was not different from VE. Milk enterolactone concentration was 6.8-fold greater with FM than with CM, whereas milk tocopherol was increased by 3.4-fold with VE relative to FM. Increased concentrations of enterolactone or tocopherol were not efficient to significantly modify the time course of appearance of propanal, hexanal, hept-cis-4-enal, and 1-octen-3-one in milk during storage evaluated for 10 d at 4 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3acanola meal 3adry matter intake 3alactose 3alinseed meal 3alinseed oil 3amilk 3amilk production 3amilk proteins 3aoxidative stability 3avitamin E 0adairy cow 0an-3 fatty acid 0alinseed 0acanola 0alignans 0aoxidation1 aGervais, R.1 aSchwebel, L.1 aLebeuf, Y.1 aChouinard, P.Y.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2021 Jan. 19, v. 101, no. 2 p.329-341dCanadian Science PublishingwJournal:1932x0008-39847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjas-2020-01053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02666naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002800183245007100211300001800282506007600300520105200376592002801428506003701456650002201493650002401515650002101539650001301560650002701573700002501600700002001625700001801645700001801663700002101681700001601702700002801718700002601746700001901772700003101791700002501822700002901847700001801876700002201894700002601916773013101942856007802073852000902151655001202160IND60568795220221207062849.0170517e20170517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056879522DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b017732doi7 aPMC54376702pmcid7 a284634982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeenakker, Thomas

Inspired by the rapid reaction rates of cyclophellitol and cyclophellitol aziridineboth covalent retaining β-glucosidase inhibitorswe postulated that the corresponding carba “cyclopropyl” analogue would be a potent retaining β-glucosidase inhibitor for those enzymes reacting through the ⁴H₃ transition-state conformation. Ab initio metadynamics simulations of the conformational free energy landscape for the cyclopropyl inhibitors show a strong bias for the ⁴H₃ conformation, and carba-cyclophellitol, with an N-(4-azidobutyl)carboxamide moiety, proved to be a potent inhibitor (Kᵢ = 8.2 nM) of the Thermotoga maritima TmGH1 β-glucosidase. 3-D structural analysis and comparison with unreacted epoxides show that this compound indeed binds in the ⁴H₃ conformation, suggesting that conformational strain induced through a cyclopropyl unit may add to the armory of tight-binding inhibitor designs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGibbs free energy 3aThermotoga maritima 3abeta-glucosidase 3aepoxides 3amolecular conformation1 aWander, Dennis P.

Their advantages and problems are usually compared with those of conventional liquid/liquid interfaces (size from mm to cm); and with solid/electrolyte interfaces. Three methods of fabrication of micro-liquid/liquid interfaces and one approach to support a nano-liquid/liquid interface are surveyed. The experimental and theoretical aspects are discussed along with possible approaches to characterize these micro- and nanoscopic liquid/liquid interfaces, and the methods to modify them with new functionality. Unique examples of applications of electrochemistry at micro- and nanoscopic liquid/liquid interfaces are provided. Some novel and potential research interests in the future in this field are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aliquids1 aLi, Qing1 aShao, Yuanhua0 tChemical Society reviews.g2011 Apr. 18, v. 40, no. 5 p.2236-2253dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0cs00168f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04026naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100007200151245014900223520253500372592002802907650001502935650001702950650001102967650001602978650001802994650002303012650001803035653003003053653002503083653003103108653003803139653001503177653003103192700002503223700006403248700002203312700002803334700003403362773011303396856008603509852000903595655001203604IND60749082820221121121134.0220809e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074908282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1287632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhaksar Fasaee, Mohammad Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1544-617112aA K-Sensor correlation-based evolutionary optimization algorithm to cluster contamination events and place sensors in water distribution systems  aContaminants that are introduced to drinking water systems can threaten large populations, and the potential for catastrophic consequences accentuates the need for efficient post-disaster strategies, including optimal hydrant flushing. Efficient hydrant flushing can significantly reduce impacts on public health, but performance relies on information about the propagation of a contaminant and the affected regions in a water network. While observations from water quality sensors are useful in timely detections of contaminants, little information on its source, propagation, and affected regions can be inferred. In the absence of such information, opening or closing hydrants might not help discharge contaminants but could accelerate propagation of a plume through the water network due to drops in pressure. To address this limitation of sensor layout optimization models, this research has developed a new model to identify the optimal location of sensors to effectively support hydrant flushing mechanisms. The model has been developed in three steps: (1) contamination events were simulated in a water network; (2) spatially similar propagating contamination events were identified; and (3) the layout of water quality sensors was optimized. In the first step, a representative number of potential contamination events were simulated using a hydraulic model. The second step clustered contamination events based on spatial similarity in their propagation regimes. Finally, the last step identified locations for placing water quality sensors within clusters (identified in the previous step) while minimizing detection time and maximizing probability of detection. This model ensures that when a sensor alarm is activated, contaminated region where hydrants should be opened or closed are spatially restricted. The approach developed in this research was applied to design a sensor network for a benchmark case study, Mesopolis. The layout of 10 water quality sensors was optimized over a set of 9161 contamination events, leading to 76% probability of detection with an average detection time of 8.2 h. The solution was compared with sensor layouts based on existing approaches, and it was found that the new approach could improve the mass of contaminant that was removed from the pipe network through hydrant flushing strategies. The new approach model improves the effectiveness of hydrant flushing strategies by restricting the area where hydrants are flushed to predefined zones based on the activation of sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3amodels 3aprobability 3apublic health 3awater distribution 3awater quality 0aWater distribution system 0aWater quality sensor 0aSensor layout optimization 0aWater network contamination event 0aMitigation 0aJaccard's similarity index1 aMonghasemi, Shahryar1 aNikoo, Mohammad Reza1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3740-43891 aShafiee, M.

Photocatalytic degradation of antibiotic residuals with semiconductor photocatalyst is considered to be more effective method due to its unique superiority. Herein, Au/Pd/g-C₃N₄ nanocomposites were synthesized by loading Au and Pd nanoparticles on the surface of g-C₃N₄ sheets for photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride. The modification of g-C₃N₄ with Au and Pd nanoparticles efficiently enhanced the visible-light absorption, improved the separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons and decreased the recombination of electron–hole pairs. As-prepared Au/Pd/g-C₃N₄ nanocomposites exhibited improved photocatalytic performance with more than 90% degradation rate. Furthermore, the good stability and reusability of Au/Pd/g-C₃N₄ nanocomposites would be beneficial to further photocatalytic degradation application.  aPublisher supplied data  a51703112cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a51772162cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a21571112cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a51572136cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a21601103cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aZR2016BQ28cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province  aZR2017BEM040cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province  a2017M622152cPostdoctoral Research Foundation of China 3aabsorption 3acarbon nitride 3aelectrons 3agold 3ananocomposites 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3apalladium 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asemiconductors 3atetracycline1 aSun, Xiaoxia1 aJin, Yanrou1 aHan, Jishu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3406-40131 aWang, Lei1 aLiu, Fusheng0 tJournal of materials science.g2019 Apr., v. 54, no. 7 p.5445-5456dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-018-03278-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245010600153300001800259500001100277520102500288592002801313596008401341596006301425596005901488596005901547650002701606650001401633650001401647650001501661650001801676650001101694650001401705650001301719700001701732700001601749700001901765700005201784700001601836773013701852856007201989852000902061655001202070IND60748917220221120225005.0210827e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074891722DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.51332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yimeng10aResearch Advances on the Adverse Effects of Nanomaterials in a Model Organism, Caenorhabditis elegans  ap. 2406-2424.  aREVIEW  aAlong with the rapid development of nanotechnology, the biosafety assessment of nanotechnology products, including nanomaterials (NMs), has become more and more important. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a valuable model organism that has been widely used in the field of biology because of its excellent advantages, including low cost, small size, short life span, and highly conservative genomes with vertebral animals. In recent years, the number of nanotoxicological researchers using C. elegans has been growing. According to these available studies, the present review classified the adverse effects of NMs in C. elegans into systematic, cellular, and molecular toxicity, and focused on summarizing and analyzing the underlying mechanisms of metal, metal oxide, and nonmetallic NMs causing toxic effects in C. elegans. Our findings provide insights into what further studies are needed to assess the biosafety of NMs in the ecosystem using C. elegans.

We examined how lyophilization and rehydration affects the morphology and rheological properties of semiflexible (i.e., straight) and highly flexible (i.e., curly) fibrils, the latter made with 80 mM CaCl₂. Straight fibrils were fractured into short rods by lyophilization and rehydration, whereas curly fibrils sustained little damage. This was reflected in the viscosities of rehydrated fibril dispersions, which were much lower for straight fibrils than for curly fibrils. Lyophilized straight or curly fibrils seeded new fibril growth, but viscosity enhancement due to seeding was negligible. We believe that the increase in fibril concentration caused by seeding was counterbalanced by a decrease in fibril length, reducing the ability of fibrils to form physical entanglement networks.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3acalcium chloride 3adispersions 3afoods 3afreeze drying 3agelling agents 3arehydration 3asowing 3aviscosity 3awhey protein 2aAmyloidxultrastructure 2aCalcium Chloridexpharmacology 2aFreeze Drying 2aLactoglobulinsxchemistry 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aMilk Proteinsxchemistryxultrastructure. 2aRheology 2aViscosity 2aWaterxchemistry 0awhey protein self-assembly 0aamyloid-like fibrils 0aseeding 0acalcium 0aionic strength 0arheology 0atransmission electron microscopy1 aSu, Jiahong1 aRao, M.

Phytic acid (PA) is a natural compound found in high-fiber diets, such as soybeans. This study investigated the effects and mechanisms of PA on obesity, hepatic lipid metabolism, and gut–liver axis homeostasis in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. PA was observed to significantly inhibit obesity and alleviate liver steatosis in mice. PA improved HFD-induced liver inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis. Moreover, PA improved HFD-induced colonic inflammation, gut barrier damage and systemic inflammation in mice. Furthermore, PA effectively ameliorated the decreased diversity and gut microbiota composition in HFD-fed mice. Additionally, PA decreased the abundance of harmful bacteria Proteobacteria and Desulfovibrionaceae and increased the abundance of probiotic bacteria Muribaculaceae and Lachnospiraceae. Thus, PA is effective in restoring the homeostasis of the gut–liver axis. It further provides a theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD in patients with obesity by the rational intake of foods containing PA.  aPublisher supplied data  a32172807cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aQT202127cJilin Young Scientific and Technological Talents Promotion Projecdhttps://doi.org/NA 3aDesulfovibrionaceae 3aLachnospiraceae 3aabsorption barrier 3afatty liver 3afibrosis 3afood chemistry 3ahigh fat diet 3ahomeostasis 3ahuman health 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3aobesity 3aoxidative stress 3aphytic acid 3aprobiotics 0aNAFLD 0ahepatic steatosis 0agut−liver axis 0agut microbiota1 aHu, Guiqiu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8808-184X1 aHe, Fuding1 aLi, Kefei1 aLi, Feng1 aXu, Dianwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9895-00761 aLiu, Juxiong1 aFu, Shoupeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2545-89290 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2022 Aug. 30, v. 70, no. 36 p.11401-11411dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.2c044063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245009200160300002000252520133200272592002801604650001601632650002001648650002601668650002601694653002301720653001501743653003601758653001901794653002501813700001401838700002001852700001501872700001301887700001901900700001801919700001901937700001701956700001601973773012901989856007802118852000902196655001202205IND60532186620221118025207.0160728e20160727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053218662DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b048682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Haipeng10aSimple and Versatile Strategy to Prevent Surface Wrinkling by Visible Light Irradiation  ap. 19127-19134.  aA stiff film bonded to a compliant substrate is susceptible to surface wrinkling when it is subjected to in-plane compression. Prevention of surface wrinkling is essential in many cases to maintain the integrity and functionality of this kind of system. Here we report a simple versatile technique to restrain surface wrinkling of an amorphous poly(p-aminoazobenzene) (PAAB) film by visible light irradiation. The key idea is to use the combined effects of photosoftening of the PAAB film and the stress release induced by the reversible photoisomerization. The main finding given by experiments and dimensional analysis is that the elastic modulus Ef of the film is well modulated by the ratio of light intensity and the release rate, i.e., I/V. Furthermore, the explicit solution describing the correlation of I/V with Ef is derived for the first time. The difference between the calculated critical wrinkling strain εc,ₜ based on Ef and the experimentally measured value εc enables us to quantitatively evaluate the release amount of the compressive stress in the film. These key solutions provide a simple strategy to prevent the undesired surface wrinkling. Additionally, they allow us to propose a wrinkling-based technique to investigate photoinduced changes in the mechanical properties of azo-containing materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3airradiation 3alight intensity 3amechanical properties 3amodulus of elasticity 0aphotoisomerization 0aazobenzene 0aprevention of surface wrinkling 0aphotosoftening 0adimensional analysis1 aZhao, Yan1 aZong, Chuanyong1 aXie, Jixun1 aHan, Xue1 aWang, Juanjuan1 aZhao, Jingxin1 aJiang, Shichun1 aCao, Yanping1 aLu, Conghua0 tACS applied materials .g2016 July 27, v. 8, no. 29 p.19127-19134dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.6b048683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245011600167300001500283520161000298592002801908650001601936650001801952650001001970650003301980650001502013650001502028650001802043650001802061650001502079650001102094650001302105651002302118651001902141651001702160700002402177700002202201700001702223700002102240700002502261773007902286856008102365852000902446655001202455IND4477227920221118030802.0141111e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447722792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hal.2012.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorkman, David G.10aToxic Alexandrium peruvianum (Balech and de Mendiola) Balech and Tangen in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island (USA)  ap. 92-100.  aPhytoplankton monitoring in Wickford Cove, Rhode Island, US (41°34′10.13″N, 71°26′45.76″W), located in Narragansett Bay, detected an unusual species of Alexandrium in the spring of 2009. Thecal plate analysis using brightfield and SEM microscopy revealed a plate morphology consistent with that of Alexandrium peruvianum (Balech and de Mendiola) Balech and Tangen. Molecular analyses indicated that the sequences of the SSU, ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2 and LSU through the D region of the 18S gene were similar to those of A. peruvianum from North Carolina. Toxin analyses of cells brought into culture revealed saxitoxins, gymnodimine and fast-acting spiroimines were present in the cultured clone. Saxitoxins detected included GTX 2, GTX3, B1, STX, C1 and C2. Also present in the Wickford cove isolates of A. peruvianum were 12-methyl gymnodimine and 13-desmethyl spirolide C. A. peruvianum was detected at four sites in lower Narragansett Bay: at two sites in Wickford and two sites in Jamestown, RI. A. peruvianum was observed in the spring of 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 at maximum abundance levels ranging from tens of cells per liter to 14,000cells L⁻¹. The discovery of A. peruvianum in Rhode Island coastal waters, with its potential threat to public health, is notable as it appears to be an emergent bloom species globally. The presence of A. peruvianum in Narragansett Bay is the third confirmed observation of this species on the Atlantic coast of North America. Monitoring efforts in the southern New England region should incorporate measures to detect the presence of A. peruvianum toxins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlexandrium 3acoastal water 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amicroscopy 3amonitoring 3aphytoplankton 3apublic health 3asaxitoxins 3aspring 3atoxicity 3aNew England region 3aNorth Carolina 3aRhode Island1 aSmayda, Theodore J.1 aTomas, Carmelo R.1 aYork, Robert1 aStrangman, Wendy1 aWright, Jeffrey L.C.0 tHarmful algae.g2012 Sept., v. 19 p.92-100dElsevier B.V.x1568-98837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2012.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245014100163300002000304520135300324592002801677650002101705650001501726650001801741650001901759650001301778650001301791650004701804650001001851650001101861650001401872650001201886650002601898650001301924653002701937653002601964653001901990653001702009653002702026653002102053700002002074700001702094700001802111700002202129700001902151773012902170856007802299852000902377655001202386IND60532186720221118025112.0160728e20160727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053218672DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b049132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNair, Baiju G.10aHigh Density of Aligned Nanowire Treated with Polydopamine for Efficient Gene Silencing by siRNA According to Cell Membrane Perturbation  ap. 18693-18700.  aHigh aspect ratio nanomaterials, such as vertically aligned silicon nanowire (SiNW) substrates, are three-dimensional topological features for cell manipulations. A high density of SiNWs significantly affects not only cell adhesion and proliferation but also the delivery of biomolecules to cells. Here, we used polydopamine (PD) that simply formed a thin coating on various material surfaces by the action of dopamine as a bioinspired approach. The PD coating not only enhanced cell adhesion, spreading, and growth but also anchored more siRNA by adsorption and provided more surface concentration for substrate-mediated delivery. By comparing plain and SiNW surfaces with the same amount of loaded siRNA, we quantitatively found that PD coating efficiently anchored siRNA on the surface, which knocked down the expression of a specific gene by RNA interference. It was also found that the interaction of SiNWs with the cell membrane perturbed the lateral diffusion of lipids in the membrane by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. The perturbation was considered to induce the effective delivery of siRNA into cells and allow the cells to carry out their biological functions. These results suggest promising applications of PD-coated, high-density SiNWs as simple, fast, and versatile platforms for transmembrane delivery of biomolecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aadsorption 3acell adhesion 3acell membranes 3acoatings 3adopamine 3afluorescence recovery after photobleaching 3agenes 3alipids 3ananowires 3asilicon 3asmall interfering RNA 3atopology 0ahigh-density nanowires 0abioinspired materials 0ananotopography 0apolydopamine 0atransmembrane delivery 0aRNA interference1 aHagiwara, Kyoji1 aUeda, Motoki1 aYu, Hsiao-hua1 aTseng, Hsian-Rong1 aIto, Yoshihiro0 tACS applied materials .g2016 July 27, v. 8, no. 29 p.18693-18700dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.6b049133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02412naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005500146245008800201300001800289500001900307520133100326592002801657650002101685650003001706650002301736650002101759650002201780700001801802700002301820700001801843773013601861856008001997852000902077655001202086IND60733727320221116220035.0210411e20210325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073372732DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c091182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Luca, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2963-338110aPullout Force and Inlet Oscillation in Telescopic Carbon Nanotubes: A Quantum Study  ap. 7305-7313.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe noncovalent interaction energy as a function of the core extension in double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNT) was accurately calculated in the frame of density functional theory, considering dispersion correction and without resorting to adjustable parameters. A linear correlation between the change of the noncovalent energy and core displacement was established for the first time through a pure quantum mechanics approach; hence, the force needed to pull out the DWCNT core was accurately calculated. This force was found to be in good agreement with experimental values reported in the literature. Furthermore, the effect of the DWCNT edges was considered in the calculation of the potential energy profile, and the frequency, associated with the oscillation of core inlet, was calculated for the first time through a quantum approach. This frequency falls in the low infrared region, and it depends on the chemical nature of the oscillator edges. The work highlights that the noncovalent H···π interaction controls the inner shell oscillation and it should be considered, beyond the stacking between inner and outer walls, as a driving force for the activation of the telescopic process. As a result, this noncovalent interaction can be tuned for the design of nano-dynamometers with well-defined force constants.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3adensity functional theory 3aphysical chemistry 3apotential energy 3aquantum mechanics1 aScarcello, A.1 aLuque Di Salvo, J.1 aCaputi, L.

In experiment 2, twelve treatments including one basal diet, five diets supplied with 0.5, 0.9, 1.3, 1.7, or 2.1 g·kg⁻¹ inorganic P, and six diets supplied with 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, or 2000 FTU·kg⁻¹ phytase were fed to chickens from days 7 to 21 post hatching.

In conclusion, age of birds to start feeding PD diet affected their performance, and hybrid 6-phytase may partly replace MCP in a PD diet for broiler chickens.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4-phytase 3abody weight changes 3adiet 3adigestibility 3afeed intake 3aileum 3amodels 3amonocalcium phosphate 3amortality 3atibia 0aequivalency 0aphosphorus 0aphytase 0apoultry1 aJendza, Joshua A.1 aAder, Peter1 aAdeola, Olayiwola0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2020 Nov. 12, v. 101, no. 2 p.263-273dCanadian Science PublishingwJournal:1932x0008-39847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjas-2020-01263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03175naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245012200209300001600331506007600347520172200423592002802145506003702173650001402210650001702224650001302241650001102254650001902265650002202284650003702306650001902343650001702362650001302379650001602392650002502408650002402433650003702457700001902494700002402513773009002537856008102627852000902708655001202717IND60585574120221207130050.0171110e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058557412DNAL7 a10.1007/s12263-010-0179-52doi7 aPMC30929092pmcid7 a214841562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShakibaei, Mehdi10aCurcumin synergizes with resveratrol to stimulate the MAPK signaling pathway in human articular chondrocytes in vitro  ap. 171-179.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is stimulated in differentiated chondrocytes and is an important signaling cascade for chondrocyte differentiation and survival. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β) play important roles in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this study, we investigated whether curcumin and resveratrol can synergistically inhibit the catabolic effects of IL-1β, specifically the inhibition of the MAPK and subsequent apoptosis in human articular chondrocytes. Chondrocytes were either left untreated or treated with 10 ng/ml IL-1β or 1 μM U0126, a specific inhibitor of MAPK pathway alone for the indicated time periods or pre-treated with 10 μM curcumin, 10 μM resveratrol or 10 μM resveratrol and 10 μM curcumin for 4 h followed by co-treatment with 10 ng/ml IL-1β or 1 μM U0126 and 10 μM resveratrol, 10 μM curcumin or 10 μM resveratrol and 10 μM curcumin for the indicated time periods. Cultures were evaluated by immunoblotting and transmission electron microscopy. Incubation of chondrocytes with IL-1β resulted in induction of apoptosis, downregulation of β1-integrins and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2). Interestingly, U0126 induced apoptosis and blocked the above-mentioned proteins in a similar way to IL-1β. Furthermore, curcumin and resveratrol inhibited IL-1β- or U0126-induced apoptosis and downregulation of β1-integrins and Erk1/2 in human articular chondrocytes. These results suggest that combining these two natural compounds activates MEK/Erk signaling, a pathway that is involved in the maintenance of chondrocyte differentiation and survival.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3achondrocytes 3acurcumin 3ahumans 3aimmunoblotting 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aosteoarthritis 3apathogenesis 3aproteins 3aresveratrol 3arheumatoid arthritis 3asignal transduction 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aMobasheri, Ali1 aBuhrmann, Constanze0 tGenes & nutrition.g2011 May, v. 6, no. 2 p.171-179dSpringer-Verlagx1555-89327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12263-010-0179-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01670naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009400166300001600260520051000276592002800786650002200814650001300836650003700849650002200886650001100908650002400919650001400943650001900957651001000976700001700986700001901003700002101022700001801043700002001061700001901081773008201100856008101182852000901263655001201272IND60440045820221119084245.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044004582DNAL7 a10.1007/s11262-015-1211-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamamoto, Eiji10aComplete genome sequence of pigeon circovirus detected in racing pigeons in western Japan  ap. 140-143.  aWe report the genetic analysis of a pigeon circovirus (PiCV/Japan/2/2010) detected in a racing pigeon with diarrheal symptoms in western Japan.

Numerous studies have been conducted to clarify the dynamic changes and functions of various proteins and the composition of amino acids during embryo development. However, the physiological characteristics of extraembryonic fluid (allantoic and amniotic), especially allantoic fluid (AF), remain largely unexplored; furthermore, how information is transmitted from embryonic fluid is unknown. In this study, AF-derived exosomes ranging from 60 to 160 nm in diameter from fertilized eggs at 13 d of incubation of fast-growth chickens (WG chicken), medium-growth chickens (Silky N4 chicken), and slow-growth chickens (Huiyang Beard chicken) were isolated and purified by different ultra-centrifugations and further verified by transmission electron microscopy and a flow nano-analyzer. Expression of the exosomal positive biomarkers of ALIX and HSP70 as well as lack of the epithelium marker GRP78 was observed by Western blotting. In addition, small RNA sequencing revealed that AF-derived exosomes at 13 d of incubation contained a large number of known miRNAs (32.62%–65.83%). The top 10 most abundant and co-expressed miRNAs were primarily related to development, growth, and immunity. In addition, AF-derived exosomes promoted DF-1 cell migration. These findings broadened our understanding of the characteristic of AF-derived exosomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallantoic fluid 3abiomarkers 3acell movement 3achick embryos 3achickens 3aembryogenesis 3aepithelium 3aexosomes 3aimmunity 3amicroRNA 3atransmission electron microscopy 0achicken 0amiRNAs 0acell migration1 aQu, Hao1 aJi, Jian1 aWang, Yan1 aLiu, Tianfei1 aHe, Jingyi1 aWang, Jie1 aShu, Dingming1 aLuo, Chenglong0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2020 Dec. 9, v. 101, no. 2 p.307-317dCanadian Science PublishingwJournal:1932x0008-39847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjas-2020-01303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006400140245016600204300001800370500001900388500002000407520157500427592002802002596003902030596003902069650003102108650002202139650001802161650002002179700006202199700006402261700006702325700006202392700006002454700006002514773011702574856007402691852000902765655001202774IND60726236820221122060617.0210202e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072623682DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.153432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSucharitakul, Jeerus1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3834-796110aModulations of the reduction potentials of flavin‐based electron bifurcation complexes and semiquinone stabilities are key to control directional electron flow  ap. 1008-1026.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe flavin‐based electron bifurcation (FBEB) system from Acidaminococcus fermentans is composed of the electron transfer flavoprotein (EtfAB) and butyryl‐CoA dehydrogenase (Bcd). α‐FAD binds to domain II of the A‐subunit of EtfAB, β‐FAD to the B‐subunit of EtfAB and δ‐FAD to Bcd. NADH reduces β‐FAD to β‐FADH⁻, which bifurcates one electron to the high potential α‐FAD•⁻ semiquinone followed by the other to the low potential ferredoxin (Fd). As deduced from crystal structures, upon interaction of EtfAB with Bcd, the formed α‐FADH⁻ approaches δ‐FAD by rotation of domain II, yielding δ‐FAD•⁻. Repetition of this process leads to a second reduced ferredoxin (Fd⁻) and δ‐FADH⁻, which reduces crotonyl‐CoA to butyryl‐CoA. In this study, we measured the redox properties of the components EtfAB, EtfaB (Etf without α‐FAD), Bcd, and Fd, as well as of the complexes EtfaB:Bcd, EtfAB:Bcd, EtfaB:Fd, and EftAB:Fd. In agreement with the structural studies, we have shown for the first time that the interaction of EtfAB with Bcd drastically decreases the midpoint reduction potential of α‐FAD to be within the same range of that of β‐FAD and to destabilize the semiquinone of α‐FAD. This finding clearly explains that these interactions facilitate the passing of electrons from β‐FADH⁻ via α‐FAD•⁻ to the final electron acceptor δ‐FAD•⁻ on Bcd. The interactions modulate the semiquinone stability of δ‐FAD in an opposite way by having a greater semiquinone stability than in free Bcd.  aPublisher supplied data  aRSA5980062cThailand Research Fund  aRTA5980001cThailand Research Fund 3aAcidaminococcus fermentans 3aelectron transfer 3aflavoproteins 3aoxidoreductases1 aButtranon, Supacha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7432-78961 aWongnate, Thanyaporn1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5072-97381 aChowdhury, Nilanjan Pal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7645-37061 aProngjit, Methinee1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7799-116X1 aBuckel, Wolfgang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8280-12601 aChaiyen, Pimchai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8533-16040 tFEBS journal.g2021 Feb., v. 288, no. 3 p.1008-1026dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.153433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245006800166300001600234520140000250592002801650650001301678650002001691650001401711650001701725650002301742650001201765650001001777650001101787650001101798650002501809650001801834650002201852650001201874650001901886650002001905650001201925650001001937650001501947651001001962653001701972653001301989653002002002653002702022700002202049700001702071700001402088700001702102773014002119856007802259852000902337655001202346IND60681689820221120204748.0200226e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068168982DNAL7 a10.3920/JIFF2016.00612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPomalégni, S.C.B.10aTraditional use of fly larvae by small poultry farmers in Benin  ap. 187-192.  aHouse fly larvae (Musca domestica) are a suitable and sustainable source of protein for poultry in Africa, but their traditional use in family farming has never been demonstrated and quantified. A large survey among traditional poultry farmers in Benin shows that on the average, 5.7% of them produce house fly larvae to feed their poultry. In one politico-administrative sub-unit (department) 25.7% of farmer feed their poultry with larvae. The farmers using house fly larvae as protein source tend to have a higher income from poultry farming; have higher level of education and a larger flock than those that do not use larvae. They also give termites to their poultry more often than other farmers. Farmers keeping their poultry in confinement also use fly larvae more often than those whose flocks are scavenging. Fly larvae are produced by exposing various wastes as substrates to attract naturally occurring flies. A total of 28 substrates used to produce larvae were cited by farmers. The most cited substrates were soy and maize bran, pig and chicken manure as well as animal cadavers. This information will be used to optimise the dissemination of the use of fly larvae in poultry feed to smallholder farmers in Benin. The fact that poultry farmers already produce fly larvae on farm also provides opportunities to integrate indigenous knowledge in the development of new technologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIsoptera 3aMusca domestica 3acorn bran 3adead animals 3aeducational status 3afarmers 3afarms 3aflocks 3aincome 3aindigenous knowledge 3ainsect larvae 3alivestock farming 3apoultry 3apoultry manure 3aprotein sources 3asurveys 3aswine 3atechnology 3aBenin 0apoultry feed 0aproteins 0ainsects as feed 0afamily poultry farming1 aGbemavo, D.S.J.C.1 aKpadé, C.P.1 aKenis, M.1 aMensah, G.A.0 tJournal of insects as food and feed.g2017 Sept., v. 3, no. 3 p.187-192dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:27298x2352-45887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/JIFF2016.00613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01634naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011700164300001800281520047100299592002800770650001300798650002000811650001000831650001900841653001600860653001600876653001300892653001400905653001500919653004200934653002300976653001300999653001901012653001301031653001401044773008801058856008101146852000901227655001201236IND60520926520221120023607.0160526e20101020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052092652DNAL7 a10.2478/v10058-010-0030-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlymenko, S.10aMorphological Characteristics of Male Genitalia in Some Species of the Genus Eurytoma (Eurytomidae, Hymenoptera)  ap. e-42-e-46.  aBased on the analysis of morphological characteristics of related species of the genus Eurytoma, several groups of cryptic species poorly distinguishing by external morphology, but clearly confined to certain hosts are shown to have morphological differences of male genitalia that are highly species-specific and can be useful for identification of cryptic species of the genus Eurytoma (E. rosae Nees, E. strigifrons Thomson, and E. jaceae Mayr species complexes).  aPublisher supplied data 3aEurytoma 3acryptic species 3ahosts 3amale genitalia 0aHymenoptera 0aEurytomidae 0aEurytoma 0agenitalia 0aphallobase 0aгенитальный аппарат 0aфаллобаза 0aEurytoma 0aE. strigifrons 0aE. rosae 0aE. jaceae0 tVestnik zoologii.g2010 Oct. 20, v. 44, no. 5 p.e-42-e-46dVersitax2073-23337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10058-010-0030-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245010500170300001800275520130300293592002801596650002501624650001901649650001701668650001301685650001201698650003101710650001601741650001601757650001801773650000901791650001601800650001601816650001601832650000901848650001501857700002401872700002101896700002201917700002301939700002101962700002301983773010602006856008302112990002302195852000902218655001202227IND60098176520221118014600.0141104e20121015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009817652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.06.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, Jessal J.10aHypothermia inhibits osteoblast differentiation and bone formation but stimulates osteoclastogenesis  ap. 2237-2244.  aIt has long been known that core body temperature declines with age, with temperatures of 35.5°C or below common in the elderly. However, the effects of temperature reduction on bone cell function and skeletal homeostasis have been little studied. We investigated the effects of mild hypothermia (35.5°C) and severe hypothermia (34°C) on bone-forming osteoblasts, and bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Formation of ‘trabecular’ bone structures by rat calvarial osteoblasts was reduced by 75% at 35.5°C and by 95% at 34°C after 14–16 days culture, compared to 37°C. In addition to reductions in osteoblast cell number, expression of mRNAs for Runx2, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and type I collagen were also down-regulated in hypothermia. In contrast, formation of osteoclasts in mononuclear cell cultures derived from mouse marrow, showed a 1.5 to 2-fold stimulation in hypothermia; resorption pit formation was similarly increased. Taken together, these data show that hypothermia exerts reciprocal effects on bone cell function by retarding osteoblast differentiation and bone formation, whilst increasing osteoclastogenesis and thus resorption. These results suggest the possibility that hypothermia in the elderly could potentially have a direct, negative impact on bone metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abone formation 3acell culture 3acollagen 3aelderly 3agene expression regulation 3ahomeostasis 3ahypothermia 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aosteoblasts 3aosteocalcin 3aosteoclasts 3arats 3aresorption1 aUtting, Jennifer C.1 aKey, Michelle L.1 aOrriss, Isabel R.1 aTaylor, Sarah E.B.1 aWhatling, Philip1 aArnett, Timothy R.0 tExperimental cell research.g2012 Oct. 15, v. 318, no. 17 p.2237-2244dElsevier Inc.x0014-48277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.06.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03386naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245016900165300001600334520158600350592002801936650002101964650001501985650001502000650002702015650001702042650002002059650002902079650001802108650001802126650001102144650001202155650001802167650002202185650001802207650001302225650002302238653001402261653001302275653002102288653000902309653002502318653000902343653000902352653001102361653000702372653001002379653000902389653000902398653000802407653001102415653000902426700001602435700001802451700005302469773014602522856008302668852000902751655001202760IND60590428820221119085410.0200419e20180304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059042882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.02.1302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhan, Xiaoni10aEffects of PQ's cytotoxicity on secretory vesicles in astroglia: Expression alternation of secretogranin II and its potential interaction with intracellular factors  ap. 675-682.  aIt has been extensively characterized that paraquat (PQ) selectively targets to the substantia nigra and exerts neurotoxic actions on dopaminergic neurons. However, a little knowledge is available about astroglia in PQ exposure, especially its complex secretory machinery. To explore this point, we built up a PQ-induced model in cultural U118 astrocyte. Since the granin family is considered as a master regulator of cargo sorting and large dense core vesicles (LDCVs) biogenesis in the regulated secretory pathway of nervous and neuroendocrine cells, the current study focused on one member, secretogranin II (SCG2) and investigated its alternation and potential relationship with other astrocyte-derived factors under PQ insult. We found that PQ upregulated SCG2 expression on both RNA and protein levels and stimulated the mRNA expression of neurotrophic factors, cytokines and glutamine synthetase (GS) simultaneously. RNAi knockdown of SCG2 did not rescue the cell cycle arrest induced by PQ but affected expressions of IL-6 and GS on mRNA and protein levels. Further studies on subcellular location showed that SCG2-positive secretory granules were partially colocalized with IL-6 but not GS in PQ exposure astrocyte. Taken together, our findings indicate that the expression alternation of SCG2 under astroglial activation by PQ may be necessary compensation for cargo sorting and LDCV biogenesis. The involvement of the IL-6 and GS suggests that the SCG2 may potentially regulate inflammatory factors and excitatory neurotransmitter to the cytotoxicity of PQ on astroglia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aastrocytes 3abiogenesis 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acytotoxicity 3agene expression 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3ainterleukin-6 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3aneurons 3aneurotoxicity 3aneurotransmitters 3aneurotrophins 3aparaquat 3asecretory granules 0aAstroglia 0aParaquat 0aSecretogranin II 0aIL-6 0aglutamine synthetase 0aSCG3 0aGFAP 0aS100β 0aGS 0aGLT-1 0aBDNF 0aGDNF 0aTNF 0aIL-1β 0aIL-61 aLi, Fengrui1 aChu, Qiaohong1 aPang, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6606-64380 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Mar. 04, v. 497, no. 2 p.675-682dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.02.1303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245006100164300001600225520127200241592002801513650002701541650001201568650002101580650001501601650001701616650002401633653001101657653001301668653001701681653000901698653001101707653001501718773012801733856007901861852000901940655001201949IND60480765420221119073954.0160706e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048076542DNAL7 a10.3138/jvme.38.4.3492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsborne, Carl A.10aFollowership and Leadership: Promoting Unity in Academia  ap. 349-352.  aAs we plan our future in the twenty-first century, many believe that we face more problems than ever before, including the rising cost of sustaining teaching, research, and service programs in a climate in which state support for higher education is declining. Some commonly held opinions blame leaders and thus propose solutions that are based on the premise that leaders who are perceived to be ineffective should be replaced by those who promise to correct the situation. Leadership is a frequently discussed term, whereas the concept of followership is generally ignored. Followership, however, has been an unidentified facet of leadership in veterinary academia. The present article examines the premise that the primary way to solve the expanding list of problems facing academia is by zealously seeking, teaching, and encouraging leadership. Organizations such as universities succeed or fail on the basis of how well followers follow in addition to how well leaders lead. The truth is that without followers there would be no leaders. Yet the train of followers is almost nonexistent in most educational settings. Striving to recruit and entertain the proper balance of followers and leaders should be one of the goals of every college of veterinary medicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3aclimate 3ahigher education 3aleadership 3auniversities 3aveterinary medicine 0afollow 0afollower 0afollowership 0alead 0aleader 0aleadership0 tJournal of veterinary medical education.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 38, no. 4 p.349-352dUniversity of Toronto Pressx0748-321X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3138%2Fjvme.38.4.3493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245011100164300001800275520148000293592002801773650001101801650001101812650001001823650001901833650003801852650001701890650002501907650004501932650001501977650002401992700001702016700001802033700001502051700001502066700001802081700002002099700001602119700002402135700001802159773010602177856008302283990002302366852000902389655001202398IND60098176620221118014349.0141104e20121015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009817662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHowley, R.10aComparative genomic and proteomic analysis of high grade glioma primary cultures and matched tumor in situ  ap. 2245-2256.  aDeveloping targeted therapies for high grade gliomas (HGG), the most common primary brain tumor in adults, relies largely on glioma cultures. However, it is unclear if HGG tumorigenic signaling pathways are retained under in-vitro conditions. Using array comparative genomic hybridization and immunohistochemical profiling, we contrasted the epidermal and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (EGFR/PDGFR) in-vitro pathway status of twenty-six primary HGG cultures with the pathway status of their original HGG biopsies. Genomic gains or amplifications were lost during culturing while genomic losses were more likely to be retained. Loss of EGFR amplification was further verified immunohistochemically when EGFR over expression was decreased in the majority of cultures. Conversely, PDGFRα and PDGFRβ were more abundantly expressed in primary cultures than in the original tumor (p<0.05). Despite these genomic and proteomic differences, primary HGG cultures retained key aspects of dysregulated tumorigenic signaling. Both in-vivo and in-vitro the presence of EGFR resulted in downstream activation of P70s6K while reduced downstream activation was associated with the presence of PDGFR and the tumor suppressor, PTEN. The preserved pathway dysregulation make this glioma model suitable for further studies of glioma tumorigenesis, however individual culture related differences must be taken into consideration when testing responsiveness to chemotherapeutic agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abiopsy 3abrain 3acarcinogenesis 3acomparative genomic hybridization 3adrug therapy 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aplatelet-derived growth factor receptors 3aproteomics 3asignal transduction1 aKinsella, P.1 aBuckley, P.G.1 aAlcock, L.1 aJansen, M.1 aHeffernan, J.1 aStallings, R.L.1 aBrett, F.M.1 aAmberger-Murphy, V.1 aFarrell, M.A.0 tExperimental cell research.g2012 Oct. 15, v. 318, no. 17 p.2245-2256dElsevier Inc.x0014-48277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.06.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02984naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007300140245008600213300001600299500002000315520162100335592002801956596005601984650002202040650001902062650001402081650002202095650003402117650002602151650002102177650001702198700005602215700004502271700002002316700006602336773011202402856007502514852000902589655001202598IND60786764320221119073123.0220805e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078676432DNAL7 a10.1002/csc2.206822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRojas‐Gutierrez, Juan Diego1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7452-837510aGenome‐wide association analysis of freezing tolerance in soft red winter wheat  ap. 637-647.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFreezing tolerance is likely to be an important adaptation for both natural populations and crop cultivars like winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). In the United States, winter wheat represents 80% of the total wheat production. Understanding the genetic basis of freezing tolerance in wheat furthers our knowledge of abiotic stress tolerance in plants and may inform breeding programs aimed at adjusting the level of freezing tolerance for a given region. We examined freezing tolerance in a 267‐line panel of elite soft red winter wheat that has previously been used for genome‐wide association study (GWAS) on agronomically important traits. We were specifically interested in determining the extent of genetic variation for freezing tolerance within the panel, what the genetic basis of that variation is, and if there are correlations between freezing tolerance and other agronomically important traits. We found significant variation in freezing tolerance among the lines, measured as survival through three total days at −8 °C. We performed a GWAS on freezing tolerance and identified 13 candidate loci, with nearby candidate genes involved in different functions potentially associated with freezing tolerance. In addition, we found significant correlations between freezing tolerance and seven previously published yield related traits. In summary, we found considerable variation in freezing tolerance in this panel that is associated with yield related traits. Thus, these lines may be useful for breeding programs seeking to optimize freezing tolerance for present and future climatic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  a1013073cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aTriticum aestivum 3aabiotic stress 3acultivars 3agenetic variation 3agenome-wide association study 3asoft red winter wheat 3astress tolerance 3awinter wheat1 aLee, Gwonjin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2207-39751 aSanderson, B.

The high redox potential of this catalyst system is achieved by a consecutive photoinduced electron transfer process (conPET) and allows the room temperature conversion of brominated and chlorinated nucleobases or nucleobase precursors as starting materials. In contrast to many transition-metal-based syntheses, a direct C–H arylation of nitrogen-containing halogenated heterocycles is possible without protection of the N–H groups. The method provides a simple, metal-free alternative for the synthesis of biologically interesting arylated heterocycles under mild conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aarylation 3abromination 3acatalysts 3achemical structure 3aelectron transfer 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganic compounds 3aphotocatalysis 3aredox potential1 aGhosh, Indrajit1 aKönig, Burkhard,0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2017 Apr. 07, v. 82, no. 7 p.3552-3560dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.7b000883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010400165300001600269520121500285592002801500650002001528650001501548650002001563650002501583650002201608650001601630650001401646650001501660650000901675650001901684650001301703650002101716650001201737653001601749653001101765653001101776700001701787700005901804700005701863700002201920773023001942856008202172852000902254655001202263IND60699798020221120184316.0201223e20200720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069979802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jgg.2020.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yicheng12aA facile and sensitive method of quantifying glutaminase binding to its inhibitor CB-839 in tissues  ap. 389-395.  aMany cancer types reprogram their metabolism to become addicted to glutamine. One of the critical enzymes in the utilization of glutamine in these cells is glutaminase. CB-839 (telaglenastat) is a drug that targets glutaminase that is currently being evaluated in many clinical trials for efficacy in various cancer types that are known to be driven by glutamine metabolism. Despite its use, there are limited assays available for testing the pharmacodynamic on-target effects of CB-839 on the limited, small-volume patient samples that are obtained in early-phase clinical trials. Thus, we developed an assay based on the cellular thermal shift assay technique using AlphaLISA technology to show that CB-839 specifically engages glutaminase in colon cancer cell lines in vitro and in minute quantities of mouse xenograft tumors. Notably, we show that this assay detects CB-839 binding to glutaminase in platelets of patients collected while receiving CB-839 on a clinical trial. This assay may be used to study the pharmacodynamic profile of CB-839 in very small tissue samples obtained from patients on a clinical trial and may be useful in future studies designed to screen other inhibitors of glutaminase.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood platelets 3acell lines 3aclinical trials 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aglutaminase 3aglutamine 3ametabolism 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3apatients 3apharmacodynamics 3atissues 0aGlutaminase 0aMethod 0aCancer1 aZhao, Yiqing1 aBajor, David L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2702-50081 aWang, Zhenghe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1546-10801 aSelfridge, J.

The cytokine IL-27 can exert a variety of immune-regulatory functions including cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes activation and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production. In this study, we developed an effective and gene modified tumor cell vaccine. Lewis lung cancer cell LL/2 transfected with the DOTAP:cholesterol cationic liposome could express the mouse IL-27 (mIL-27) gene at a relative high level. The resultant transfectants were then irradiated with X-ray and used as a tumor cell vaccine. This tumor cell vaccine not only contained tumor associated antigen (TAA) of LL/2 cells but also secreted mIL-27 which could induce immune response in mice. The mice vaccinated with LL/2-mIL-27 performed strong tumor inhibiting effect accompanied with a high IFN-γ production. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were significantly elevated in these mice vaccinated with LL/2-mIL-27 cell vaccine. Moreover, after depletion of CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes by injection of antibodies against CD4 and CD8, the vaccinated mice inoculated with autologous LL/2 cells were not protected from tumor challenge. In contrast, vaccinated mice inoculated with autologous LL/2 cells were treated with antibody against natural killer (NK)cells or normal rat IgG still possessed strong antitumor activity. Our data suggested that DOTAP:cholesterol cationic liposome was quite useful in generating an autologous tumor cell vaccine and mIL-27 could be therapeutically used to potentiate the host antitumor immunity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aX-radiation 3aantibodies 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aantigens 3acytotoxicity 3agenes 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukins 3alung neoplasms 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3arats 3avaccines 0aTumor cell vaccine 0aCationic liposome 0aLL/2 0aIL-27 0aImmunotherapy1 aTian, Hongwei1 aLi, Can1 aCheng, Lin1 aZhang, Shuang1 aZhang, Xiaomei1 aWang, Ruibo1 aXu, Fen1 aDai, Lei1 aShi, Gang1 aChen, Xiaolei1 aLi, Yiming1 aDu, Tao1 aDeng, Jie1 aLiu, Yu1 aYang, Yang1 aWei, Yuquan1 aDeng, Hongxin0 tMolecular Immunology.g2013 Oct., v. 55 p.264-274dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2013.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02385naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245011700166300002000283520128400303592002801587650002401615650002101639650001701660650001201677650001801689650001301707700002501720700002101745700002301766700001901789700001901808773012501827856007401952852000902026655001202035IND60666866120221119033340.0190919e20141107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066686612DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra09342a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiradar, Siddanagouda10aEffects of the alkyl group in (dialkylamino)perfluorophenazines on the melting point and fluorescence properties  ap. 59387-59396.  aThe alkyl groups in 2-(dialkylamino)- and 2,7-bis(dialkylamino)perfluorophenazines drastically affected the melting point and solid-state fluorescence. 2-(Dialkylamino)- and 2,7-bis(dialkylamino) derivatives such as 2-(dioctylamino)-, 2-(didodecylamino)-, and 2,7-bis(dioctylamino)perfluorophenazines were liquid at ambient temperature, whereas shorter and longer dialkylamino derivatives were solid. 2-(Dioctadecylamino)perfluorophenazine exhibited a fluorescence maximum at 581 nm, being significantly blue-shifted compared with the other derivatives, with the most intense fluorescence quantum yield of 0.29 in the crystalline form. This result is attributed to the isolated dimer-type packing coming from long octadecyl groups. 2-(Dimethylamino)perfluorophenazine showed positive fluorescence solvatochromism due to a large dipole moment in the excited state. The computational analysis of (2-(dimethylamino)perfluorophenazine suggests that the red-shift of the fluorescence maximum in the crystalline form, compared with that in solution, mainly comes from π–π interactions with adjacent molecules. The fluorescence lifetime of 2-(dioctadecylamino)perfluorophenazine was significantly longer compared with 2-(dioctadecylamino)phenazine owing to the aromatic C–F bonds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3achemical bonding 3afluorescence 3aliquids 3amelting point 3amoieties1 aShigemitsu, Yasuhiro1 aKubota, Yasuhiro1 aFunabiki, Kazumasa1 aSato, Hiroyasu1 aMatsui, Masaki0 tRSC advances.g2014 Nov. 07, v. 4, no. 103 p.59387-59396dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra09342a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011500166300001600281520142000297592002801717650002101745650002501766650001701791650001501808650001501823650001601838650001801854650002601872650001801898653002601916653002101942653002601963653001901989700001502008700002002023700005702043773009402100856008502194852000902279655001202288IND60529741420221117195603.0161020e20160810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052974142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2016.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Junjun10aStepwise modular pathway engineering of Escherichia coli for efficient one-step production of (2S)-pinocembrin  ap. 183-192.  aDeveloping efficient microbial processes to produce flavonoids has been a metabolic engineering goal over the past decade due to their important functions. Previously, the de novo production of the main flavonoid precursor (2S)-pinocembrin was achieved. However, low productivity and two separate fermentation steps made it inappropriate for industrial scale low-cost production. Here, a stepwise modular engineering approach was introduced to systematically identify and eliminate metabolic pathway bottlenecks. The overall pathway was firstly divided into four modules and analysis then revealed that efficient conversion of l-phenylalanine to (2S)-pinocembrin is the major limiting factor. Therefore, the pathway from l-phenylalanine to (2S)-pinocembrin was re-cast into three modules to alleviate this bottleneck by modifying both the gene copy number and promoter strength. Furthermore, the expression of the rate-limiting enzyme PAL was found to be correlated with 5′ region of mRNA structure. The efficiency of the synthetic pathway was then improved by customizing the PAL expression level based on modification of the mRNA secondary structure. Fed-batch cultivation of engineered strains in a 3-L fermentor resulted in a final (2S)-pinocembrin production of 432.4mg/L. The results presented here pave the way for the development of an economical and simple process for microbial production of flavonoids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3abiochemical pathways 3afermentation 3afermenters 3aflavonoids 3agene dosage 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolic engineering 3aphenylalanine 0aPlant natural product 0aPhenylpropanoids 0aMetabolic engineering 0amRNA structure1 aZhang, Xia1 aDong, Mingsheng1 aZhou, Jingwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3269-12400 tJournal of biotechnology.g2016 Aug. 10, v. 231 p.183-192dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2016.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01038naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009100166300001600257520018100273592002800454650001400482650002200496650002700518650001900545651001100564700002200575773009400597856004800691852000900739655001200748IND50089037320221119150817.0140426e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008903732DNAL7 a10.1134/S00138738140201222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShmakov, A.

The heating processes applied in this study, in most cases, did not cause essential changes in the indices of pro-health properties of fatty acid, therefore meat in the majority fulfil the latest recommendations of EFSA and FAO/WHO according to human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDuroc 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aWorld Health Organization 3acrossbreds 3adiet 3afatty acid composition 3aforage 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3ahuman health 3alamb meat 3alambs 3alandraces 3alegs 3alinseed 3alongissimus muscle 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3apork 3arams 3arapeseed oil 3araw materials 3aroasting 3arump 3asaturated fatty acids 3aswine 0aPork 0aLamb 0aThermal processing 0aFatty acid profile1 aGrześkowiak, Eugenia1 aLisiak, Dariusz1 aBorys, Bronisław1 aBorzuta, Karol1 aPospiech, Edward1 aPoławska, Ewa0 tMeat science.g2016 Jan., v. 111 p.161-167dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2015.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02758naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245010200177300001400279520125300293592002801546650002201574650001601596650002201612650001401634650001101648650001401659650001901673650000901692650003701701650001701738650002201755650000901777650001801786650000701804650001501811650001601826650001101842650001601853650002101869650003701890653002301927653001801950653001601968653001801984700002802002773011602030856008502146852000902231655001202240IND60593478420221122055505.0180429e20170201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059347842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.11.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarvalho, Samira S.F.10aDye degradation by green heterogeneous Fenton catalysts prepared in presence of Camellia sinensis  ap. 82-88.  aThis work describes the synthesis and characterization of supported green iron catalysts, prepared with Camellia sinensis tea extract, and their application in heterogeneous Fenton degradation of pollutant dyes. The influence of the catalyst synthesis conditions in the iron and organic content were investigated by X-ray fluorescence and thermogravimetric analyses. Irregular, chain-like nanoparticles, in the size range of 20–100 nm, capped by polyphenolic natural compounds, were visualized by TEM micrographs. TEM-EDS revealed a high iron content in the nanoparticles as well as a high carbon content all over the catalyst surface, indicating the coverage by the polyphenolic compounds of the tea. X-ray powder diffraction revealed the amorphous nature of the nanoparticles, tentatively ascribed to iron(II)/(III) oxides and oxohydroxides composites. The Fenton degradation of different dyes was successfully accomplished, leading to complete decolourization in less than 3 h of reaction. Influence of hydrogen peroxide concentration, catalyst dosage, pH, temperature and catalyst support, were investigated. The catalysts prepared with black tea over silica furnished the higher iron contents and were the most actives for dye degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamellia sinensis 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3ablack tea 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3adecolorization 3adyes 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afluorescence 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apollutants 3apolyphenols 3asilica 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aIron nanoparticles 0aPlant extract 0aDye removal 0aFenton system1 aCarvalho, Nakédia M.F.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2017 Feb. 01, v. 187 p.82-88dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.11.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03083naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245015200172300001600324520099100340592002801331650002101359650001201380650003501392650001201427650001201439650001301451650002101464650001101485650001101496650000901507650002601516650000901542650001201551650000901563650001401572650001001586650001401596650001401610650002701624650001201651650002001663650001301683650002601696650001201722650001101734650001401745650003301759650000901792650001301801650001101814650000901825650001001834650002101844650000901865651001101874653002401885653001901909653001101928653001001939653001101949653000801960700003101968700002201999700002402021700002102045700001502066700001902081773010702100856008502207852000902292655001202301IND60573683620221122041833.0170724e20170603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057368362DNAL7 a10.1080/19440049.2017.13103972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNikolic, Dragica10aMineral composition and toxic element levels of muscle, liver and kidney of intensive (Swedish Landrace) and extensive (Mangulica) pigs from Serbia  ap. 962-971.  aMineral composition (Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, Se, Cr, Co, Ni, Na, K, Mg, Ca) and toxic element levels (Cd, Pb, Hg, As) of soil, feed and tissue (muscle, liver and kidney) from intensive (Swedish Landrace, housed indoors, fed a known diet, 4 years) and extensive (Mangulica, free-roaming, non-specified diet, 7–8 months) pigs were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Controlled nutrition produced pigs with higher concentrations of most minerals (muscle: Mn, Se, K, Mg; liver: Zn, Cu, Mn, Se, Cr, Ca; kidney: Zn, Cu, Mn, Se, K, Mg), but for Fe the opposite trend was found. Long-term free-ranging pigs have a higher risk of contamination by toxic elements (Cd exceeded the maximum residue level in kidney).

This study aimed to predict the environmental suitability for malaria vectors in Iran under climate change scenarios in 2030s and 2050s. Literature search was performed to find documents on the spatial distribution of Anopheles stephensi Liston, 1901, Anopheles culicifacies s.l. Giles, 1901, Anopheles fluviatilis s.l. James, 1902, Anopheles superpictus s.l. Grassi, 1899, Anopheles dthali Patton, 1905, Anopheles maculipennis s.l. Meigen, 1818, and Anopheles sacharovi Favre, 1903 (Diptera: Culicidae) published between 1970 and 2017. The bioclimatic data under three climate change scenarios (representative concentration pathway 2.6 [RCP2.6], RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) and MaxEnt model were used to predict the ecological niches for each species. Comparison between the two study periods under the three scenarios for each species revealed that RCP8.5 would reduce the area at risk for An. culicifacies s.l., An. dthali and An. superpictus s.l. in the 2050s compared to the 2030s, but the reverse will be induced by RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 scenarios. For An. fluviatilis s.l., RCP2.6 will reduce the risk areas in the 2050s, whereas an increase is expected under the two other scenarios. Moreover, all scenarios would decrease the high-risk areas of An. maculipennis s.l. in the 2050s. For An. sacharovi, RCP2.6 would increase its high-risk areas, whereas RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 would decrease its exposure. The high-risk area of An. stephensi is expected to increase under RCP8.5 in the 2030s and RCP4.5 in 2050s, but it will be almost unchanged or reduced under other scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data  a963233cNational Institute for Medical Research Developmentdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100012155 3aAnopheles culicifacies 3aAnopheles fluviatilis 3aAnopheles maculipennis 3aAnopheles sacharovi 3aAnopheles stephensi 3aAnopheles superpictus 3aclimate change 3ainsect vectors 3amalaria 3amodels 3aniches 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3avector-borne diseases 3aIran 0aAnopheles 0amalaria vector 0aecological niche modeling1 aVatandoost, Hassan1 aYaghoobi-Ershadi, Mohammad Reza1 aFoley, Janet0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2020 Jan. 09, v. 57, no. 1 p.50-64dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl45776x1938-29287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjz1313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02486naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245011000155520150400265592002801769650001701797650000901814650003501823650001401858650001401872650001701886650002801903700001601931700001701947773012601964856007302090852000902163655001202172IND60651907720221119185452.0190712e20170210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065190772DNAL7 a10.3390/su90202512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jiuping10aEquilibrium Strategy Based Recycling Facility Site Selection towards Mitigating Coal Gangue Contamination  aEnvironmental pollution caused by coal gangue has been a signiﬁcant challenge for sustainable development; thus, many coal gangue reduction approaches have been proposed in recent years. In particular, coal gangue facility (CGF) construction has been considered as an efﬁcient method for the control and recycling of coal gangue. Meanwhile, the identiﬁcation and selection of suitable CGF sites is a fundamental task for the government. Therefore, based on the equilibrium strategy, a site selection approach under a fuzzy environment is developed to mitigate coal gangue contamination, which integrates a geographical information system (GIS) technique and a bi-level model to identify candidate CGF sites and to select the most suitable one. In this situation, the GIS technique used to identify potential feasible sites is able to integrate a great deal of geographical data toﬁtwithpracticalcircumstances;thebi-levelmodelusedtoscreentheappropriatesitecanreasonably dealwiththeconﬂictsbetweenthelocalauthorityandthecolliery. Moreover,aKarush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) condition-based approach is used to ﬁnd an optimal solution, and a case study is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results across different scenarios show that appropriate site selection can achieve coal gangue reduction targets and that a suitable excess stack level can realize an environmental-economic equilibrium. Finally, some propositions and management recommendations are given.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acoal 3ageographic information systems 3apollution 3arecycling 3aspatial data 3asustainable development1 aFan, Lurong1 aLv, Chengwei0 tSustainability.g2017 Feb. 10, v. 9, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su90202513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03533naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001400190245014900204300001800353520182000371592002802191650001602219650002302235650002502258650001902283650001402302650001802316650002002334650003102354650001002385650001802395650001102413650001902424650001602443650001802459650001602477650001302493650001402506650001302520650001702533650002102550650002002571650001802591650001402609650002602623650003202649650001402681700001302695700001502708773010502723856008302828990002302911852000902934655001202943IND60098177120221118014501.0141104e20121101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009817712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.07.0112doi7 aPMC34257312pmcid7 a228201622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Y.10aRetinoic acid and tumor necrosis factor-α induced monocytic cell gene expression is regulated in part by induction of transcription factor MafB  ap. 2407-2416.  aAll-trans-retinoic acid (RA), the major active metabolite of vitamin A, is a regulator of gene expression with many roles in cell differentiation. In the present study, we investigated RA in the regulation of MafB, a basic leucine-zipper transcription factor with broad roles in embryonic development, hematopoiesis and monocyte-macrophage differentiation. In RA-treated THP-1 human monocytic cells, MafB mRNA and protein levels were up-regulated by RA dose and time-dependently, while, additionally, RA and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, also known to induce monocyte to macrophage differentiation, increased MafB expression synergistically. Screening of potential targets containing Maf recognition elements (MARE motifs) in their promoter regions identified SPOCK1, Blimp1 and CCL2 as potential targets; these genes are related to cell communication, recruitment and differentiation, respectively. Across cell treatments, SPOCK1, Blimp1 and CCL2 mRNA levels were highly correlated (P<0.001) with MafB. ChIP assays demonstrated increased MafB protein binding to MARE elements in the promoter regions of SPOCK1, Blimp1 and CCL2 in RA and TNFα-treated cells, as well as acetylation of histone-H4 in MARE-containing regions, indicative of chromatin activation. Conversely, reducing MafB protein by microRNA silencing significantly decreased the expression of SPOCK1, Blimp1 and CCL2 (P<0.01). Moreover, the reduction in MafB expression and these downstream targets correlated with decreased cell differentiation as determined by cell-surface CD11b expression and phagocytic activity. We conclude that MafB may be a key factor in mediating the ability of RA and TNFα to regulate monocytic cell communication, recruitment and differentiation through regulation of MafB target genes including SPOCK1, CCL2 and Blimp1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylation 3acell communication 3acell differentiation 3achemokine CCL2 3achromatin 3aembryogenesis 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahematopoiesis 3ahumans 3aleucine zipper 3amacrophages 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolites 3amicroRNA 3amonocytes 3anecrosis 3aphagocytosis 3apromoter regions 3aprotein binding 3aretinoic acid 3ascreening 3atranscription factors 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avitamin A1 aChen, Q.1 aRoss, A.C.0 tExperimental cell research.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 318, no. 18 p.2407-2416dElsevier Inc.x0014-48277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.07.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100005600181245011600237300001600353506007600369520091900445592002801364596010001392506003701492650001801529650002101547650002001568650001501588650002201603650002101625650001501646650002401661650001101685650001101696650001601707650001501723650001101738651001001749653001001759653001301769653002201782653001201804653002101816700002101837700002501858700001801883700002101901700002401922700001901946700002101965700002401986773013302010856007502143852000902218655001202227IND60687155320221207132850.0200623e20200109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068715532DNAL7 a314002022pmid7 aPMC69510342pmcid7 a10.1093/jme/tjz1322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMyer, Mark H1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1697-545410aMapping Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) and Aedes albopictus Vector Mosquito Distribution in Brownsville, TX  ap. 231-240.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAedes mosquitoes are vectors of several emerging diseases and are spreading worldwide. We investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) mosquito trap captures in Brownsville, TX, using high-resolution land cover, socioeconomic, and meteorological data. We modeled mosquito trap counts using a Bayesian hierarchical mixed-effects model with spatially correlated residuals. The models indicated an inverse relationship between temperature and mosquito trap counts for both species, which may be due to the hot and arid climate of southern Texas. The temporal trend in mosquito populations indicated Ae. aegypti populations peaking in the late spring and Ae. albopictus reaching a maximum in winter. Our results indicated that seasonal weather variation, vegetation height, human population, and land cover determine which of the two Aedes species will predominate.  aPublisher supplied data  aDW8992298301cOak Ridge Institute for Science and Educationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000062290 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAedes aegypti 3aAedes albopictus 3aBayesian theory 3aarid zones 3aemerging diseases 3ahuman population 3aland cover 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3aspring 3atemperature 3avegetation 3awinter 3aTexas 0aAedes 0aBayesian 0astatistical model 0aweather 0amosquito control1 aFizer, Chelsea M1 aMcpherson, Kenneth R1 aNeale, Anne C1 aPilant, Andrew N1 aRodríguez, Arturo,1 aWhung, Pai-Yei1 aJohnston, John M1 aAndreadis, Theodore0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2020 Jan. 09, v. 57, no. 1 p.231-240dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl45776x1938-29287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjz1323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245007700158300001400235520123900249592002801488650001401516650001301530650001901543650001301562650001501575650001901590650001701609650002501626650001001651651000901661653001601670653001801686653001901704700001501723700001601738700001801754700002101772700001501793700001901808773014001827856007801967852000902045655001202054IND60681690520221121221046.0200226e20180615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068169052DNAL7 a10.3920/JIFF2017.00052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeigel, T.14aThe impact of small-scale cricket farming on household nutrition in Laos  ap. 89-99.  aWe examined the potential of cricket farming as an innovative solution to improving household nutrition in Laos, where edible insects are already part of traditional diets. We conducted research with a total of 40 rural households in Central Laos, in which small-scale cricket farming was introduced to 20 intervention households. Nutritional situation and changes of all households and cricket production and consumption of the intervention households were assessed. Malnutrition was prevalent amongst the study population and we found indications for dietary inadequacies. Despite fluctuating harvest results and some production failures, most intervention households successfully produced and harvested crickets over five production cycles. Cricket farming was not only appreciated by the project participants, but also spread to non-project households. 70% of the total cricket harvest were used for own consumption and crickets were eaten by all family members, including small children and women, in amounts that improved nutritional adequacy during the brief period following harvest. To increase the nutritional impact, production has to be stabilised and adapted to provide a more continuous supply of crickets over the year.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGryllidae 3achildren 3aedible insects 3afoodways 3ahouseholds 3ainsect rearing 3amalnutrition 3anutritional adequacy 3awomen 3aLaos 0aentomophagy 0afood security 0aSoutheast Asia1 aFèvre, S.1 aBerti, P.R.1 aSychareun, V.1 aThammavongsa, V.1 aDobson, E.1 aKongmanila, D.0 tJournal of insects as food and feed.g2018 June 15, v. 4, no. 2 p.89-99dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:27298x2352-45887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/JIFF2017.00053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02431naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245016300172300001800335520114500353592002801498650001201526650001101538650001501549650002401564650001401588650000901602650002001611650001201631651001001643653000901653653002001662653002401682653002401706700001601730700001601746700001701762700001301779773012101792856008701913852000902000655001202009IND60606635120221123001531.0180727e20160215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060663512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Weiqing10aApplication of fault tree approach for the causation mechanism of urban haze in Beijing—Considering the risk events related with exhausts of coal combustion  ap. 1128-1135.  aHaze weather has become a serious environmental pollution problem which occurs in many Chinese cities. One of the most critical factors for the formation of haze weather is the exhausts of coal combustion, thus it is meaningful to figure out the causation mechanism between urban haze and the exhausts of coal combustion. Based on above considerations, the fault tree analysis (FAT) approach was employed for the causation mechanism of urban haze in Beijing by considering the risk events related with the exhausts of coal combustion for the first time. Using this approach, firstly the fault tree of the urban haze causation system connecting with coal combustion exhausts was established; consequently the risk events were discussed and identified; then, the minimal cut sets were successfully determined using Boolean algebra; finally, the structure, probability and critical importance degree analysis of the risk events were completed for the qualitative and quantitative assessment. The study results proved that the FTA was an effective and simple tool for the causation mechanism analysis and risk management of urban haze in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgebra 3acities 3acombustion 3afault tree analysis 3apollution 3arisk 3arisk management 3aweather 3aChina 0aHaze 0aCoal combustion 0aCausation mechanism 0aFault tree analysis1 aFan, Hongbo1 aQiu, Yongfu1 aCheng, Zhiyu1 aQian, Yu0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Feb. 15, v. 544 p.1128-1135dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245012300177300001600300520160800316592002801924650001301952650001101965650001701976650002101993650001502014650001102029650001102040650001402051650001602065650002302081651001102104653000802115653000802123653000802131653000802139653000802147653000902155653000902164653000802173653000902181653000902190653000902199653000902208653000802217653000802225653001302233653001102246653002002257653002402277653001002301653001902311653001202330653001302342700002602355700001902381700002802400773011902428856008802547852000902635655001202644IND60606635220221123015831.0220124e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060663522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.10.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIoannou, Panagiotis10aOccurrence and variability of iodinated trihalomethanes concentrations within two drinking-water distribution networks  ap. 505-513.  aNon-iodo-containing trihalomethanes (TTHM) are frequently detected in chlorinated tap water and currently regulated against their carcinogenic potential. Iodinated THM (ITHM) may also form in disinfected with chlorine waters that are high in iodine content, but little is known about their magnitude and variability within the drinking-water pipe distribution network of urban areas. The main objective of this study was to determine the magnitude and variability of ITHM and TTHM levels and their corresponding daily intake estimates within the drinking water distribution systems of Limassol and Nicosia cities of Cyprus, using tap samples collected from individual households (n=37). In Limassol, mean household tap water ITHM and TTHM levels was 0.58 and 38μgL⁻¹, respectively. Dichloroiodomethane (DCIM) was the dominant species of the two measured ITHM compounds accounting for 77% of total ITHM and in the range of 0.032 and 1.65μgL⁻¹. The range of DCIM concentrations in Nicosia tap water samples was narrower (0.032 – 0.848μgL⁻¹). Mean total iodine concentration in tap water samples from the seaside city of Limassol was 15μgL⁻¹ and approximately twice to those observed in samples from the mainland Nicosia city. However, iodine concentrations did not correlate with the ITHM levels. The calculated chronic daily intake rates of ITHM were low when compared with those of TTHM, but because of their widespread occurrence in tap water and their enhanced mammalian cell toxicity, additional research is warranted to assess the magnitude and variability of human ITHM exposures.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorine 3acities 3acytotoxicity 3adominant species 3ahouseholds 3ahumans 3aiodine 3atap water 3aurban areas 3awater distribution 3aCyprus 0aDBP 0aTHM 0aHAA 0aNOM 0aTCM 0aBDCM 0aDBCM 0aTBM 0aDCIM 0aBCIM 0aTTHM 0aITHM 0aCHO 0aCDI 0aU.S. EPA 0aIodine 0aTrihalomethanes 0aDistribution system 0aUrban 0aDrinking-water 0aBromine 0aChlorine1 aCharisiadis, Pantelis1 aAndra, Syam S.1 aMakris, Konstantinos C.0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 543 p.505-513dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.10.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024003900136024004600175040001800221100001300239245004900252300001600301506002800317506003600345506007600381506003100457520110000488592002801588596004501616506003701661650001501698650002401713650001201737650001901749650001601768650000801784650001301792650003101805650001901836650001001855650001701865650001001882650001401892650002101906650002101927650002201948651001801970653001801988653002002006653001302026653002902039700001402068700001402082700001902096700002002115773009502135856008602230903002402316852000902340655001202349IND60526122420221207053204.0190403e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052612242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2015.09.0092chorus7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2015.09.0092doi7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2015.09.0092chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Y.10aControlling pests in dry-cured ham: A review  ap. 183-191.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aDry-cured hams can become infested with ham mites, red-legged beetles, cheese skippers, and larder beetles during the aging process. Though other methods may be used for beetles and cheese skippers, methyl bromide is the only available fumigant that is effective at controlling ham mites in dry-cured ham plants in the United States. However, methyl bromide will be phased out of all industries by approximately 2015. This paper will review and explore potential alternatives that have been investigated to determine their feasibility for replacing methyl bromide to control pest infestations in dry-cured ham plants in the United States. Potential alternatives include: 1) fumigants such as phosphine and sulfuryl fluoride; 2) physical control approaches through cold treatment, modified atmosphere, inert dusts, etc.; 3) pesticides and bioactive compounds; 4) food-grade processing aids. The most promising potential alternatives to date include the use of propylene glycol on the ham surface, the exploration of alternative fumigants, and implementation of an integrated pest management plan.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aColeoptera 3abioactive compounds 3acheeses 3acold treatment 3acured meats 3aham 3aindustry 3aintegrated pest management 3amethyl bromide 3amites 3apest control 3apests 3aphosphine 3aphysical control 3apropylene glycol 3asulfuryl fluoride 3aUnited States 0aDry-cured ham 0aPest management 0aHam mite 0aTyrophagus putrescentiae1 aAbbar, S.1 aAmoah, B.1 aPhillips, T.W.1 aSchilling, M.W.0 tMeat science.g2016 Jan., v. 111 p.183-191dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2015.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle03801naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245012600176500001900302520220100321592002802522650001802550650001202568650001102580650001202591650001702603650001802620650002302638650001102661650001902672650001602691650001102707650001402718650002602732650001202758650000902770650000902779650002002788650002402808650002302832650000902855650002302864651001702887653003302904653002202937653001502959653000902974700001902983700002103002700001703023773010103040856008503141852000903226655001203235IND60699798720221120184310.0201024e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069979872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2020.1041512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGilardino, Alessandro10aComparison of different methods for consideration of multifunctionality of Peruvian dairy cattle in Life Cycle Assessment  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn Andean dairy systems, livestock generates a daily income through the sale of milk and cheese but also fulfils other roles which are crucial for rural livelihoods such as the contribution of protein to local diets, the provision of draught power and organic fertilizer, the reduction of economic risk and the accrual of savings. The objective of this study was to compare different approaches to cope with multifunctionality of livestock in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Based on local data from a smallholder dairy production system in the Southern Peruvian Andes environmental impacts of 1 kg energy corrected milk (ECM) were calculated with LCA methodology considering nine livestock functions: production of dairy products (1) and meat (2) for the market, production of milk for family consumption (3) and as food for calves (4), provision of organic fertilizer (5) and draught power (6), role as savings asset (7), risk insurance (8) and part of family tradition (9). Impacts were distributed among these functions using different methodological approaches: NA, no allocation; EM, economic allocation to market products; ET, economic allocation to all livestock functions; FP, allocation according to farmers´ perception and SE, system expansion (substitution). The results varied considerably depending on the method used. 1 kg of ECM contributed to global warming with 1.65, 1.38, 1.25, 0.71 and 0.89 kg CO₂-equivalents using mehods NA, EM, ET, FP and SE, respectively. Similar patterns were observed for acidification and eutrophication potentials. Enteric fermentation was the main source of greenhouse gases whereas eutrophication and acidification potentials were determined by alfalfa pasture management. The results of the study showed that: (i) LCA results are highly sensitive to the number and types of livestock functions considered and the allocation criteria applied, (ii) that the economic value of livestock functions does not necessarily reflect their importance for rural livelihoods and (iii) that the application of system expansion/substitution to livestock systems is limited due to lacking equivalency of functions and products from alternative production systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aalfalfa 3aassets 3acheeses 3adairy cattle 3adraft animals 3aeconomic valuation 3aenergy 3aeutrophication 3agreenhouses 3aincome 3ainsurance 3alife cycle assessment 3amarkets 3ameat 3amilk 3amilk production 3aorganic fertilizers 3apasture management 3arisk 3arumen fermentation 3aAndes region 0aLivestock multifunctionality 0aDairy system, LCA 0aAllocation 0aPeru1 aQuispe, Isabel1 aPacheco, Maribel1 aBartl, Karin0 tLivestock science.g2020 Oct., v. 240 p.104151-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2020.1041513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245015100170300001800321520152600339592002801865650001001893650001901903650001801922650001501940650001001955650002501965650002201990650002502012650001202037650001102049650001402060650001302074650001902087650001902106650001302125650001802138650001402156700001902170700001802189700002302207700002202230700002902252700003402281773010502315856008302420990002302503852000902526655001202535IND60098177420221118014515.0141104e20121101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009817742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadwanska, Agata10aOverexpression of lumican affects the migration of human colon cancer cells through up-regulation of gelsolin and filamentous actin reorganization  ap. 2312-2323.  aCell migration is a multistep process initiated by extracellular matrix components that leads to cytoskeletal changes and formation of different protrusive structures at the cell periphery. Lumican, a small extracellular matrix leucine-rich proteoglycan, has been shown to inhibit human melanoma cell migration by binding to α2β1 integrin and affecting actin cytoskeleton organization. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of lumican overexpression on the migration ability of human colon adenocarcinoma LS180 cells. The cells stably transfected with plasmid containing lumican cDNA were characterized by the increased chemotactic migration measured on Transwell filters. Lumican-overexpressing cells presented the elevated filamentous to monomeric actin ratio and gelsolin up-regulation. This was accompanied by a distinct cytoskeletal actin rearrangement and gelsolin subcellular relocation, as observed under laser scaning confocal microscope. Moreover, LS180 cells overexpressing lumican tend to form podosome-like structures as indicated by vinculin redistribution and its colocalization with gelsolin and actin at the submembrane region of the cells. In conclusion, the elevated level of lumican secretion to extracellular space leads to actin cytoskeletal remodeling followed by an increase in migration capacity of human colon LS180 cells. These data suggest that lumican expression and its presence in ECM has an impact on colon cancer cells motility and may modulate invasiveness of colon cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3aadenocarcinoma 3acell movement 3achemotaxis 3acolon 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acomplementary DNA 3aextracellular matrix 3afilters 3ahumans 3aintegrins 3amelanoma 3amicrofilaments 3aneoplasm cells 3aplasmids 3aproteoglycans 3asecretion1 aLitwin, Monika1 aNowak, Dorota1 aBaczynska, Dagmara1 aWegrowski, Yanusz1 aMaquart, Francois-Xavier1 aMalicka-Błaszkiewicz, Maria,0 tExperimental cell research.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 318, no. 18 p.2312-2323dElsevier Inc.x0014-48277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.07.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245010800209300001600317500001900333520143200352592002801784650001801812650001501830650001201845650001801857650002501875650001501900650002201915650001501937650001501952650001101967650002001978650001301998650002602011650000902037650001002046653004202056653002802098653004002126653003502166653001402201653003002215700002102245700005502266700002102321773013102342856008402473961001302557852000902570655001202579IND60728239820221123020420.0210219e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072823982DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-06-20-0221-RVW2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStandish, J.

The fungicide applications can be the single greatest operating cost for commercial growers and the return on that investment is impacted by fungicide resistance. V. effusa produces multiple generations of conidia per season, exhibits substantial genetic diversity, overwinters as stromata in the tree, and is under immense selection from the applied fungicides, all of which lead to a high risk for developing fungicide resistance. Since the mid-1970s, resistance or reduced sensitivity has been observed in isolates of V. effusa to the methyl benzimidazole carbamates, demethylation inhibitors, quinone outside inhibitors, organotin compounds, and the guanidines. Over the last 10 years, several studies have been conducted that have improved both scab management and fungicide resistance management in V. effusa. The aim of this review is to summarize recent developments in our understanding of fungicide resistance in V. effusa in the context of scab management in southeastern pecan orchards. The history, modes of action, general use of the labeled fungicides, and mechanisms and stability of fungicide resistance in V. effusa are discussed; conclusions and future research priorities are also presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzimidazole 3acarbamates 3aconidia 3ademethylation 3afungicide resistance 3afungicides 3agenetic variation 3aguanidines 3apecan scab 3apecans 3aplant pathology 3aquinones 3aresistance management 3arisk 3atrees 0aantimicrobial or fungicide resistance 0ademethylation inhibitor 0adisease control and pest management 0amethyl benzimidazole carbamate 0aorganotin 0aquinone outside inhibitor1 aBrenneman, T.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of boar taint in pig carcasses from 30 Spanish farms located in different regions of the country. Hot carcass weight and subcutaneous fat thickness means were 79.4±8.19kg and 18.4±5.09mm, respectively. Subcutaneous fat samples were classified into different levels according to androstenone and skatole concentrations in adipose tissue measured using GC–MS and HPLC. Androstenone results were: 87.4% of the carcasses below 0.50μg/g, 7.1% from 0.50 to 1.00μg/g (medium level), and 5.5% ≥1.00μg/g (high level). Skatole results were: 88.9% of the carcasses below 0.10μg/g, 4.5% from 0.10 to 0.20μg/g (medium level), and 6.6% ≥0.20μg/g (high level). Given these results, a future online method to classify carcasses according to boar taint is strongly recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3aboar taint 3acarcass weight 3afarms 3afat thickness 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ameat quality 3aodors 3apig carcasses 3askatole 3asubcutaneous fat 3aswine 0aAndrostenone (PubChem CID: 6,852,393) 0aSkatole (PubChem CID: 6736) 0aBoar taint 0aAndrostenone 0aSkatole 0aPig castration 0aEntire male pigs1 aPanella-Riera, N.1 aZammerini, D.1 aOlivares, A.1 aGarrido, M.D.1 aMartínez, B.1 aGil, M.1 aGarcía-Regueiro, J.A.1 aOliver, M.A.0 tMeat science.g2016 Jan., v. 111 p.177-182dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2015.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014100169500001900310520153700329592002801866650002301894650002401917650002201941650000701963650002501970653002601995653001202021653001302033653002402046700002802070700005802098700001602156700002302172700005902195700002402254773010802278856008202386852000902468655001202477IND60728897220221121224951.0210401e20210429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072889722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2021.3383472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLardeux, Honorine10aAlternative mobile phase additives for the characterization of protein biopharmaceuticals in liquid chromatography – Mass spectrometry  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWhen analyzing large complex protein biopharmaceuticals, ion-pairing agents imparting low pH are widely used as mobile phase additives to improve the chromatographic performance. However, one of the most effective additives in RPLC and HILIC, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), is known as a strong suppressor of the MS signal and limits its use in hyphenated techniques. In this study, we evaluated a wide range of acidic additives to find alternatives to TFA that provided comparable chromatographic performance and improved MS sensitivity. It was observed that stronger acidic additives were required for intact level analysis compared to subunit level analysis and that the additive nature had a larger impact on the chromatographic performance in HILIC mode compared to RPLC. Therefore, four additives were identified as valuable alternatives to TFA in RPLC mode, namely, difluoroacetic acid (DFA), dichloroacetic acid (DClAA), trichloroacetic acid (TClAA), and methanesulfonic acid (MSA). Only one of these additives provided acceptable performance in HILIC mode, namely, TClAA.After evaluation of the MS performance, TClAA was discarded due to the apparent loss of intensity in both RPLC-MS and HILIC-MS mode. Together, these results demonstrate that for HILIC-MS analysis TFA remains the gold standard additive. However, DFA was found as promising alternative to TFA for RPLC-MS analysis and could play an important role in the development of methods for the characterization of the increasingly complex protein biopharmaceuticals.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopharmaceuticals 3adichloroacetic acid 3amass spectrometry 3apH 3atrichloroacetic acid 0aMobile phase additive 0aRPLC-MS 0aHILIC-MS 0aMonoclonal antibody1 aDuivelshof, Bastiaan L.1 aColas, Olivier1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4342-37891 aBeck, Alain1 aMcCalley, David V.1 aGuillarme, Davy1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7883-58231 aD’Atri, Valentina0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2021 Apr. 29, v. 1156 p.338347-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11651x0003-26707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2021.3383473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001800176245007000194300001500264520152000279592002801799650002501827650001501852650002501867650001101892650002001903650001301923650001901936650001201955650001801967650001501985650001402000650003102014650002302045650002402068650002002092650002702112700001802139700002302157700002002180700001902200700001802219773015102237856007002388856010202458990002302560852000902583655001202592IND60608547620221119100813.0190510e20170512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060854762DNAL7 a10.3791/556562doi7 aPMC56079372pmcid7 a285705262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAulas, Anaïs10aMethods to classify cytoplasmic foci as mammalian stress granules  ap. e55656.  aCells are often challenged by sudden environmental changes. Stress Granules (SGs), cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein complexes that form in cells exposed to stress conditions, are implicated in various aspects of cell metabolism and survival. SGs modulate cellular signaling pathways, post-transcriptional gene expression, and stress response programs. The formation of these mRNA-containing granules is directly connected to cellular translation. SG assembly is triggered by inhibited translation initiation, and SG disassembly is promoted by translation activation or by inhibited translation elongation. This relationship is further highlighted by SG composition. Core SG components are stalled translation pre-initiation complexes, mRNA, and selected RNA-binding Proteins (RBPs). The purpose of SG assembly is to conserve cellular energy by sequestering translationally stalled housekeeping mRNAs, allowing for the enhanced translation of stress-responsive proteins. In addition to the core constituents, such as stalled translation preinitiation complexes, SGs contain a plethora of other proteins and signaling molecules. Defects in SG formation can impair cellular adaptation to stress and can thus promote cell death. SGs and similar RNA-containing granules have been linked to a number of human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer, leading to the recent interest in classifying and defining RNA granule subtypes. This protocol describes assays to characterize and quantify mammalian SGs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA-binding proteins 3acell death 3acytoplasmic granules 3aenergy 3agene expression 3agranules 3ahuman diseases 3amammals 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3aneoplasms 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aribonucleoproteins 3asignal transduction 3astress response 3atranslation (genetics)1 aFay, Marta M.1 aSzaflarski, Witold1 aKedersha, Nancy1 aAnderson, Paul1 aIvanov, Pavel0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2017 May 12, , no. 123 p.e55656-e55656dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/556563Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/55656/methods-to-classify-cytoplasmic-foci-as-mammalian-stress-granules  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245015400154300002000308520164800328592002801976650002502004650003002029650001402059650001402073650002602087650001502113650001602128700002602144700001602170700001802186773012502204856007402329852000902403655001202412IND60666866920221119033518.0190919e20141106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066686692DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra09358e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJamal, M.10aMechanical and thermodynamical properties of hexagonal compounds at optimized lattice parameters from two-dimensional search of the equation of state  ap. 57903-57915.  aWe have calculated the mechanical and thermodynamical properties of selected hexagonal structures by using the optimized lattice parameters (a and c) from two-dimensional (2D) search of the equation of state (EOS) within the appropriate exchange–correlation functional. To overcome the deficiency of density functional theory (DFT) for compounds with localized electrons, a PBE + U approximation was used with our calculated effective U parameter. For calculating the elastic constants of hexagonal structure, the Hex-elastic package was used which is compatible with the highly accurate all electron full-potential (Linearized) augmented plane-wave plus local orbital [FP-(L)APW + lo] method as implemented in the WIEN2k code. The obtained results of the 2D-search of the EOS for the optimized lattice parameters (a and c) are in good agreement with the experimental data. This method clearly shows its superiority compared to the 1D-search of the EOS method. Furthermore, the obtained elastic constants by using the optimized lattice parameters (a and c) from the 2D-search, were in good agreement with the available experimental data and better than the previous theoretical calculations. Our calculations show that the PBE + U approximation improves the results for elastic constants. Consequently, we can claim the following predictions; first, we suggest the value of Poisson's ratio as a boundary condition to predict the type of bonds. Second, we make a one-to-one correspondence between two quantities, shear modulus and C₅₅.

Measured at the state level, the top 10 percent of income earners amassed roughly 43% of total income, and economic growth only enhanced this inequality between the ultrarich and the rest of citizens. This paper examines whether social capital plays a positive role in mitigating income inequality at the state level, with an emphasis on racial diversity and its relation to church attendance. The empirical findings demonstrate that social capital, whether measured by Robert Putnam’s state-level social capital index (SCI), or a new measure that improves SCI’s original measurement, fails to improve income equality. In comparison, racial diversity is found to be a consistent contributor of income inequality. In states with a greater proportion of minority population, the ultra-rich tend to share more wealth and social capital potentially facilitates the ultra-rich to enjoy the benefit of economic growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic development 3aincome 3asocial capital 3asocial inequality 3aUnited States1 aWei, Yehua Dennis1 aSimon, Christopher A.0 tSustainability.g2017 Feb. 10, v. 9, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su90202483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002100191245012700212300001600339506007600355520099600431592002801427506003701455650002301492650001301515650002601528650002201554650002001576650003001596650001401626653001101640653001101651653000801662653000801670653000801678653000701686653000701693653001301700653001201713653003001725653002001755653002001775700002301795700002201818700002101840773008501861856008401946852000902030655001202039IND60113859520221207102859.0161019e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011385952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2013.03.0102doi7 aPMC37833582pmcid7 a236024512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHubbard, Mark A.10aStereo-selective binding of monoclonal antibodies to the poly-gamma-d-glutamic acid capsular antigen of Bacillus anthracis  ap. 337-344.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBacillus anthracis is surrounded by an anti-phagocytic capsule that is entirely composed of γ-linked d-glutamic acid (γDPGA). γDPGA is required for virulence and is produced in large quantities following spore germination. We have previously described the isolation of several γDPGA-reactive mAbs. The reagents are effective in both immunoprotection and diagnostic applications. The current work was done to further investigate the specificity of γDPGA-reactive mAbs. The specificity of each mAb was characterized using surface plasmon resonance. Our results indicate that each mAb is stereoselective for binding to d-glutamic acid oligomers, but to varying degrees. In particular, mAb F26G3 is highly selective for γDPGA; alterations in stereochemistry disrupted recognition. These differences in mAb reactivity suggest that binding of γDPGA by mAb F26G3 is more specific than non-directional ionic interactions between a negatively charged antigen and a positively charged antibody.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus anthracis 3aantigens 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aspore germination 3astereochemistry 3asurface plasmon resonance 3avirulence 0aγDPGA 0aγLPGA 0amAb 0apAb 0aSPR 0aKI 0aKD 0aAntibody 0aAnthrax 0aPolyglutamic acid capsule 0aStereoselective 0aMolecular model1 aThorkildson, Peter1 aWelch, William H.1 aKozel, Thomas R.0 tMolecular Immunology.g2013 Oct., v. 55 p.337-344dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2013.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012100165300001400286520149600300592002801796650002801824650002901852650001401881650001301895650001901908650004101927650001801968650001301986650001601999650001502015650001202030650001102042653001002053653000802063653000902071653000702080653000702087653001102094653000702105653000902112653000702121653001102128653000702139653000902146653000802155653000802163653001502171653002202186653001702208700003002225700001802255700002202273700001702295700002602312773010502338856008202443852000902525655001202534IND60699799020221120161610.0200705e20200925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069979902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nbt.2020.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgawa, Minami10aMapping the intracellular metabolome of yeast biocapsules - Spherical structures of yeast attached to fungal pellets  ap. 55-60.  aCo-culture conditions are beneficial for study due to the advances which arise from symbiotic interactions and which cannot be replicated under pure culture conditions. Here, the focus is on the connection between two fungi – a yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and a filamentous fungus, Penicillium chrysogenum – in a yeast immobilization system termed’ yeast biocapsules’, where the yeast and filamentous fungus are strongly attached to one another, forming spherical structures. This co-culture condition hinders filamentous fungal biomass growth, while immobilization of yeast cells continues to increase. The effect of the co-culture condition on endometabolites or intracellular metabolites were tracked during the beginning and end of the yeast biocapsule formation period, and metabolites analyzed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Detector (GC-MSD). Distinct metabolite profiles were found between single culture conditions, involving each organism separately, and with the co-culture condition, where there were differences in 54 endometabolites. Specifically, co-culture condition compounds such as fructose, glycolic acid and glyceric acid were present in higher concentrations at the end of biocapsule formation. These results shed light on the mechanisms and biochemical impact of the interaction between the yeast and filamentous fungus and serve as a basis to apply and further develop yeast biocapsules as a new biotechnological tool with benefits for industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPenicillium chrysogenum 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3acoculture 3afructose 3afungal biomass 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aglycolic acid 3aindustry 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3apellets 3ayeasts 0aANOVA 0aBFM 0aFAME 0aFC 0aff 0aGC-MSD 0aIS 0aNOPA 0aPC 0aPLS-DA 0aYC 0aY-FC 0aYPD 0aYPG 0aCo-culture 0aYeast biocapsules 0aMetabolomics1 aGarcía-Martínez, Teresa1 aBisson, Linda1 aMauricio, Juan C.1 aMoreno, Juan1 aMoreno-García, Jaime0 tNew biotechnology.g2020 Sept. 25, v. 58 p.55-60dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4392691x1871-67847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2020.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005900144245013600203500002000339520116500359592002801524596006101552596004701613596002301660596003401683596002401717596004201741650001101783650002001794650001901814650000901833650002101842650002801863650001701891650001401908650000901922650000901931650001901940650001601959650001501975650001701990650001702007700001602024700001702040700002102057700002202078773011402100856007802214852000902292655001202301IND60748914820221121114815.0210827e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074891482DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2020002982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Tanya M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8175-820810aTeeth reveal juvenile diet, health and neurotoxicant exposure retrospectively: What biological rhythms and chemical records tell us  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIntegrated developmental and elemental information in teeth provide a unique framework for documenting breastfeeding histories, physiological disruptions, and neurotoxicant exposure in humans and our primate relatives, including ancient hominins. Here we detail our method for detecting the consumption of mothers’ milk and exploring health history through the use of laser ablation‐inductively coupled plasma‐mass spectrometry (LA‐ICP‐MS) mapping of sectioned nonhuman primate teeth. Calcium‐normalized barium and lead concentrations in tooth enamel and dentine may reflect milk and formula consumption with minimal modification during subsequent tooth mineralization, particularly in dentine. However, skeletal resorption during severe illness, and bioavailable metals in nonmilk foods, can complicate interpretations of nursing behavior. We show that explorations of the patterning of multiple elements may aid in the distinction of these important etiologies. Targeted studies of skeletal chemistry, gastrointestinal maturation, and the dietary bioavailability of metals are needed to optimize these unique records of human health and behavior.  aPublisher supplied data  cUS National Institutes of Health, Office of the Director  aR00HD087523cNational Institutes of Health  cHarvard University  cAustralian Academy of Science  cGriffith University  cIcahn School of Medicine at Mt.

The structures of the perovskite films with various ingredients were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis absorption, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We found that with the addition of MAI material the evaporated PbCl₂ films were initially transformed to PbI₂, then to standard a stoichiometric perovskite and finally to the MAPbI₃·xMAI phase. The film composition ingredients strongly affect the device performance. An unmatched PbCl₂ to MAI ratio in the evaporated films resulted in reduced conversion efficiency and higher moisture sensitivity.

Sixty-two participants were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Fat mass was measured with Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. AMedDiet and physical activity (PA) were assessed with the PREDIMED and Global PA Questionnaire (GPAQ). Maximal aerobic power was assessed using the 6-min walk test. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure (BP) were measured with Omron M6, and double product (DP) and mean BP (MBP) were calculated. Kinanthropometry proportionality variables related to obesity were also calculated. Participants with a low CRF as an independent factor or together with a low AMedDiet obtained significantly higher BP, total and trunk fat mass, and proportionality variables (all p ˂ 0.0001). According to the multiple nonlinear regression analysis, Vo2max, AMedDiet, and sex explained 53.4% of SBP, with this formula: 238.611 - (3.63*Vo2max) + (0.044*Vo2max²) - (13.051*AMedDiet) + (0.68*AMedDiet²) + (12.887*sex). SBP and p rediction SBP with the new formula showed a correlation of 0.731 (p ˂ 0.0001); showing a difference between the values of -0.278 (p = 0.883). In conclusion, CRF as an independent factor and combined with AMedDiet can be associated with BP, body composition, and proportionality in overweight and obese middle-aged and older adults.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean diet 3ablood pressure 3abody composition 3acardiorespiratory fitness 3acorrelation 3across-sectional studies 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3amass 3aobesity 3apeak oxygen uptake 3aphysical activity 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis1 aGonzález-Gálvez, Noelia 1 aEspeso-García, Alejandro 1 aAbelleira-Lamela, Tomás 1 aLópez-Vivancos, Abraham 1 aVaquero-Cristóbal, Raquel 0 tNutrients.g2020 Sept. 10, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120927503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024003500126040001800161100002800179245009100207506007600298506003100374520180800405592002802213596000902241596004702250506003702297650001402334650001102348650002802359650001402387650001302401651001802414700002502432700002002457700002302477700002702500700002702527700002502554700002402579700002702603700002302630773011202653856007902765852000902844655001202853IND60739322420221207092856.0220901e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073932242DNAL7 a10.1098/rstb.2019.08152doi7 a10.1098/rstb.2019.08152chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarreaux, Antoine M.

The impacts of physical barriers could potentially be boosted by the addition of a mechanism that kills mosquitoes as they attempt to enter the house. One example is to combine household screening with EaveTubes, which are insecticide-treated tubes inserted into closed eaves that attract and kill host-searching mosquitoes. The epidemiological impact of screening + EaveTubes is being evaluated in a large cluster randomized trial in Cote d'Ivoire. The study presented here is designed as a complement to this trial to help better understand the functional roles of screening and EaveTubes. We began by evaluating householder behaviour and household condition in the study villages. This work revealed that doors (and to some extent windows) were left open for large parts of the evening and morning, and that even houses modified to make them more ‘mosquito proof’ often had possible entry points for mosquitoes. We next built two realistic experimental houses in a village to enable us to explore how these aspects of behaviour and household quality affected the impact of screening and EaveTubes. We found that screening could have a substantial impact on indoor mosquito densities, even with realistic household condition and behaviour. By contrast, EaveTubes had no significant impact on indoor mosquito density, either as a stand-alone intervention or in combination with screening. However, there was evidence that mosquitoes recruited to the EaveTubes, and the resulting mortality could create a community benefit. These complementary modes of action of screening and EaveTubes support the rationale of combining the technologies to create a ‘Lethal House Lure’.  aPublisher supplied data  cBMGF  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCulicidae 3ahumans 3ainsecticide application 3amortality 3avillages 3aCote d'Ivoire1 aOumbouke, Welbeck A.1 aBrou, N'Guessan1 aTia, Innocent Zran1 aAhoua, Alou Ludovic P.1 aDoudou, Dimi Théodore1 aKoffi, Alphonsine A.1 aN'Guessan, Raphaël1 aSternberg, Eleanore D.1 aThomas, Matthew B.0 tPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.dThe Royal Societyx0962-84527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2019.08153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02107naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245012200158300001800280520086500298592002801163650001201191650000901203650002301212650001701235650002101252650001601273650003701289650000901326700002001335700002401355700002501379700001901404700002301423700002301446700002401469773013201493856007501625852000901700655001201709IND60538816520221120140933.0160815e20130417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053881652DNAL7 a10.1021/ja401406q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Zhaochuan10aFrom Sphere to Multipod: Thermally Induced Transitions of CdSe Nanocrystals Studied by Molecular Dynamics Simulations  ap. 5869-5876.  aMolecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to show that a spherical zinc blende (ZB) nanocrystal (NC) can transform into a tetrapod or an octapod as a result of heating, by a local zincblende-to-wurtzite phase transformation taking place in the NC. The partial sphere-to-tetrapod or sphere-to-octapod transition occurs within simulation times of 30 ns and depends on both temperature and NC size. Surprisingly, the wurtzite (WZ) subdomains are not formed through a slip mechanism but are mediated by the formation of highly mobile Cd vacancies on the ZB{111} Cd atomic planes. The total potential energy of a tetrapod is found to be lower than that of a ZB sphere at the same numbers of atoms. The simulation results are in good agreement with experimental high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) data obtained on heated colloidal CdSe NCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3aheat 3amolecular dynamics 3ananocrystals 3aphase transition 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azinc1 aYalcin, Anil O.1 aTichelaar, Frans

Despite considerable research efforts aimed at understanding the progression of the disease, the specific mechanisms leading to alcohol-induced damage remain elusive. Numerous proteins are known to have alcohol-induced alterations in their dynamics. Defining these defects in protein trafficking is an active area of research. In general, two trafficking pathways are affected: transport of newly synthesized secretory or membrane glycoproteins from the Golgi to the basolateral membrane and clathrin-mediated endocytosis from the sinusoidal surface. Both impaired secretion and internalization require ethanol metabolism and are likely mediated by acetaldehyde. Although the mechanisms by which ethanol exposure impairs protein trafficking are not fully understood, recent work implicates alcohol-induced modifications on tubulin or components of the clathrin machinery as potential mediators. Furthermore, the physiological ramifications of impaired protein trafficking are not fully understood. In this review, we will list and discuss the proteins whose trafficking patterns are known to be impaired by ethanol exposure. We will then describe what is known about the possible mechanisms leading to impaired protein trafficking and how disrupted protein trafficking alters liver function and may explain clinical features of the alcoholic patient.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetaldehyde 3aalcohol drinking 3aclathrin 3adisease course 3aendocytosis 3aethanol 3aliver diseases 3aliver function 3amembrane glycoproteins 3ametabolism 3apatients 3aprotein transport 3asecretion 3atubulin 3aUnited States1 aFernandez, David J.1 aTuma, Pamela L.0 tGenes & nutrition.g2010 June, v. 5, no. 2 p.129-140dSpringer-Verlagx1555-89327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12263-009-0156-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245012000173300001600293520142500309592002801734650002901762650001901791650001301810650001101823650001501834650001101849650002201860650001201882650001101894651001801905700002801923700001901951700003101970773009302001856008802094990002302182852000902205655001202214IND60099379320221119002010.0141105e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009937932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.habitatint.2010.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWard, Peter M.10aSelf-help housing policies for second generation inheritance and succession of “The House that Mum & Dad Built”  ap. 467-485.  aThis paper explores how 30 years after their formation as squatter and irregular settlements self-built consolidated dwellings in Latin America are being passed from the original first generation low income home builders to their children and grandchildren. Today these original peripheral settlements are located in the intermediate ring of cities and these self-built homes have significant exchange values often in excess of $30,000, but they also continue to have use value for second generation adult children, many of whom continue to live on the lots with their parents. Always in part conceived as an eventual “patrimony for the children”, these homes are now being inherited by the children and grandchildren as the original owner-parents die. Therefore national and local processes of inheritance and succession become central to the transfer of title and property across generations. However, few people have wills and most die intestate, creating new forms of irregularity and “clouded” land titles. Drawing primarily upon Mexican inheritance and succession law examples, this paper evaluates housing policies that will expedite inheritance and title transfers at low cost thereby providing title security to second and third generation households. This is essential for ongoing housing improvements and housing rehab in what have often evolved into high density and heavily deteriorated settlements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysanthemum morifolium 3aadult children 3achildren 3acities 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3aparents 3apeople 3aLatin America1 aJiménez Huerta, Edith,1 aGrajeda, Erika1 aUbaldo Velázquez, Claudia0 tHabitat international.g2011 July, v. 35, no. 3 p.467-485dElsevier Ltdx0197-39757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2010.12.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001300143245019200156520155700348592002801905650003101933650001001964650001601974650001601990650001502006650001702021650000902038650001302047650002402060650001902084650001402103650003902117650002402156650001602180650002702196700002002223700002102243700001502264773011902279856007802398852000902476655001202485IND60766873120221119183009.0220211e20220125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076687312DNAL7 a10.3390/foods110303302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Han 10aEffects of Cathepsins on Gel Strength and Water-Holding Capacity of Myofibrillar Protein Gels from Bighead Carp (Aristichthys nobilis) under a Hydroxyl Radical-Generation Oxidizing System  aThis study investigates the effects of cathepsins on the gel strength and water-holding capacity (WHC) of myofibrillar protein gels from bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis) under a hydroxyl radical-generation oxidizing system. The myofibrillar proteins were divided into control group (with cathepsins) and E64 group (without cathepsins). The changes of cathepsin B and cathepsin L activities, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), protein oxidation (total sulfhydryl and carbonyl contents), and chemical interactions (nonspecific association, ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and disulfides) of myofibrillar protein and gels, as well as the gel strength and WHC of two groups under 0–100 mM H₂O₂, were measured. The results indicated that mild oxidation (10 mM H₂O₂) made a better gel strength and WHC. Cathepsin B and L activities decreased with increasing H₂O₂ concentrations but their effects on myofibrillar protein degradation still existed during 0.1–50 mM H₂O₂, which was expressed by higher carbonyl contents and ionic bonds at 0.1 and 50 mM H₂O₂, higher total sulfhydryl contents at 0 mM H₂O₂, and a lower intensity of MHC and actin of the control group than the E64 group. Besides more protein degradation, cathepsin proteolysis also resulted in lower gel strength and WHC in control gels than E64 gels under mild oxidation, which could be explained by lower hydrophobic interaction and moderate disulfides bonds between gel protein molecules of control gels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypophthalmichthys nobilis 3aactin 3acathepsin B 3acathepsin L 3adisulfides 3agel strength 3agels 3ahydrogen 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3aoxidation 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein degradation 3aproteolysis 3awater holding capacity1 aLiang, Yunhong 1 aZhang, Xiangmei 1 aWen, Gang 0 tFoods.g2022 Jan. 25, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods110303303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100007500144245008700219500002000306520120600326592002801532596008701560596006301647650001801710650002301728650000801751650005201759650001501811650001501826650002501841650002001866650001101886650001301897650002001910650001601930650001701946650001601963650003701979650001502016650001302031650001202044700001902056700001902075700002202094773011402116856007802230852000902308655001202317IND60748915020221121062837.0210827e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074891502DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2021000872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValdés‐Fernández, Bianca N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4802-759810aPersonalized health and the coronavirus vaccines—Do individual genetics matter?  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aVaccines represent preventative interventions amenable to immunogenetic prediction of how human variability will influence their safety and efficacy. The genetic polymorphism among individuals within any population can render possible that the immunity elicited by a vaccine is variable in length and strength. The same immune challenge (virus and/or vaccine) could provoke partial, complete or even failed protection for some individuals treated under the same conditions. We review genetic variants and mechanistic relationships among chemokines, chemokine receptors, interleukins, interferons, interferon receptors, toll‐like receptors, histocompatibility antigens, various immunoglobulins and major histocompatibility complex antigens. These are the targets for variation among macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, T‐ and B‐lymphocytes, and complement. The technology platforms (mRNA, viral vectors, proteins) utilized to produce vaccines against SARS‐CoV‐2 infections may each trigger genetically distinct immune reactogenic profiles. With DNA biobanking and immunoprofiling of recipients, global COVID‐19 vaccinations could launch a new era of personalized healthcare.  aPublisher supplied data  a2U54‐MD007600‐33cNational Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities  a2R25GM061151‐19cNational Institutes of General Sciences 3aB-lymphocytes 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aDNA 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3achemokines 3acomplement 3agenetic polymorphism 3ahealth services 3ahumans 3aimmunity 3aimmunoglobulins 3ainterferons 3ainterleukins 3amacrophages 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3aprediction 3avaccines 3aviruses1 aDuconge, Jorge1 aEspino, Ana M.1 aRuaño, Gualberto0 tBioEssays.g2021 Sept., v. 43, no. 9 p.e2100087-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938457x0265-92477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2021000873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02362naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012900159300002000288520132700308592002801635650001501663650001701678650001001695650002501705650001401730650001101744650001401755650001601769700001601785700001601801773012401817856007401941852000902015655001202024IND60667281720221119145249.0190919e20150210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066728172DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra17320a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hongsheng10aAtomistic insight into the oxidation of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides: from structures to electronic properties  ap. 17572-17581.  aMonolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) stand out in two-dimensional (2D) materials due to their potential applications in future microelectronic and optoelectronic devices. In experiments, field effect transistors (FET) based on the MoS₂ monolayer are sensitive to environmental gases, especially O₂. Thus, the oxidation of monolayer TMDs is a critical concern. By first-principles calculations, we reveal that a perfect single-layer sheet of TMDs stays intact when exposed in O₂ due to the weak physical adsorption of O₂. However, O₂ can be chemically adsorbed onto the monolayer of TMDs (including MoS₂, MoSe₂, MoTe₂, WS₂, WSe₂, and WTe₂) with single vacancies of chalcogen, which are the most common defects in realistic TMD materials. The adsorption configurations and dissociation behavior of the O₂ molecule at vacancy sites, as well as the possible diffusion behavior of oxygen adatoms on the TMD monolayer surface were explored. Oxidation significantly influenced the electronic properties of a defective MoS₂ monolayer, while other defective TMD monolayers (especially MoTe₂ and WTe₂) suffered less from oxidation. Our theoretical results provide valuable atomistic insight into the oxidation of TMD monolayers and are useful for the future design of TMD-based 2D devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adissociation 3agases 3amolybdenum disulfide 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aselenides 3atransistors1 aHan, Nannan1 aZhao, Jijun0 tRSC advances.g2015 Feb. 10, v. 5, no. 23 p.17572-17581dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra17320a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245012400164520140200288592002801690650004301718650002601761650001901787650001201806650001901818650001201837650003501849650001801884650001301902650001401915700002001929700002101949700002101970700001901991700002402010773011902034856007802153852000902231655001202240IND60766873220221119182915.0220211e20220125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076687322DNAL7 a10.3390/foods110303322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHammad, Ahmed M.10aLoads of Coliforms and Fecal Coliforms and Characterization of Thermotolerant Escherichia coli in Fresh Raw Milk Cheese  aThe aim of this study was to assess the hygienic status of raw milk cheese and determine the trends of virulence and antimicrobial resistance in thermotolerant Escherichia coli. Two hundred samples of karish, a popular Egyptian fresh raw milk cheese, were analyzed for coliforms and fecal coliforms using a standard most probable number (MPN) technique. Overall, 85% of samples were unsuitable for consumption, as they exceeded Egyptian standards for coliforms (10 MPN/g), and 65% of samples exhibited coliforms at 44.5 °C. Of 150 recovered thermotolerant strains, 140 (93.3%) were identified as E. coli. Importantly, one Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) strain carrying a striking virulence pattern, stx1−, stx2+, eae−, was detected. Eleven strains (7.8%, 11/140) showed resistance to third-generation cephalosporins. Antibiotic resistance genes included blaSHV, blaCTX₋M, qnrS, tet(A), and tet(B), which were present in 4.3%, 2.8%, 0.71%, 2.1%, and 0.71% of isolates, respectively. In conclusion, this study indicated that hygienic-sanitary failures occurred throughout the production process of most retail karish cheese. Furthermore, our findings emphasize the need for adopting third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli as an indicator for monitoring antimicrobial resistance in raw milk cheese to identify the potential public health burden associated with its consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli 3aantibiotic resistance 3acephalosporins 3acheeses 3aheat tolerance 3ahygiene 3amost probable number technique 3apublic health 3araw milk 3avirulence1 aEltahan, Amira 1 aHassan, Hamdy A.1 aAbbas, Nasser H.1 aHussien, Heba 1 aShimamoto, Tadashi 0 tFoods.g2022 Jan. 25, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods110303323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245009800165500001400263520141500277592002801692650002701720650001401747650002401761650000901785650001801794650002001812650003101832700002401863700002901887700003301916700002701949700003401976700003002010773012302040856007402163852000902237655001202246IND60711789920221121045213.0200928e20200910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071178992DNAL7 a10.3390/nu120927542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia-Yu, Irene  A.10aCocoa-Rich Chocolate and Quality of Life in Postmenopausal Women: A Randomized Clinical Trial  aNAL-light  aMenopause has a negative impact on quality of life (QoL). The aim of the present study was to analyse the effect on QoL of adding 10 g per day of chocolate with a high concentration of cocoa (99%) to the habitual diet, for 6 months, in a sample of postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal women (n = 140) aged 50–64 years were randomised to either an addition of 10 g per day of cocoa-rich chocolate to their usual diet or no supplement addition. All variables were measured at baseline and after six months of intervention. QoL was evaluated using the 3-level version of EuroQol-5D (EuroQoL-5D-3L), the EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) and the Cervantes scale. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) analyses adjusted for the main determinants of QoL considered in this study showed no changes in the global score of QoL evaluated with the EuroQoL-5D-3L. The intervention group showed an increase of 6.0 points (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.4, 11.7) in the EQ-VAS compared to the control group (p = 0.036). No significant changes were observed between groups in the global score of QoL nor in the dimensions and subdimensions measured with the Cervantes scale. The additional daily contribution of 10 g of cocoa-rich chocolate in postmenopausal women could have a slight impact on their perception toward their health state, although without modifying the health-related QoL or the dimensions that compose it.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of covariance 3achocolate 3aconfidence interval 3adiet 3apostmenopause 3aquality of life 3arandomized clinical trials1 aGarcia-Ortiz, Luis 1 aGomez-Marcos, Manuel  A.1 aRodriguez-Sanchez, Emiliano 1 aTamayo-Morales, Olaya 1 aMaderuelo-Fernandez, Jose  A.1 aRecio-Rodriguez, Jose  I.0 tNutrients.g2020 Sept. 10, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120927543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245008700177300001600264520162500280592002801905650001901933650002501952650001501977650002901992650002102021650001902042650001102061650002202072650002502094650001602119650001102135650001902146650002502165650001202190651001002202700002002212700002502232773009302257856008802350990002302438852000902461655001202470IND60099379520221118231019.0141105e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009937952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.habitatint.2011.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDulal, Hari Bansha10aClimate change mitigation in the transport sector through urban planning: A review  ap. 494-500.  aThe transport sector contributes significantly to the emission of global greenhouse gases (GHGs) resulting in a rise in global temperature and climate change. A troubling aspect of emissions from the transport sector is that they are increasing rapidly. With the ongoing rapid increase in population, expansion of middle class in developing countries, and availability of cheaper vehicles such as Tata Nano in India, the desire to own private vehicles is within reach now than ever for millions of people in the developing world. This could have a huge implication on ongoing effort towards containment of GHG emissions. We look at the role of urban design forms – settlement density – housing and employment activities and the effects they could have in reducing travel demands, motor vehicle dependency and GHG emissions. Although urban planning has a limited effect on the reduction of GHG emissions, in the short term, due to the time needed to build up the necessary infrastructures, in the long term, it can be very effective through the shift from private vehicle dependency to public and other alternative environmentally friendly modes of transports (such as walking and cycling). A mixture of high residential and employment density could influence shorter commuter journeys and a reduction in private vehicle use if it is supported by an efficient public transport system and appropriate fiscal and regulatory instruments. Among the set of available instruments to reduce GHGs from the transport sector, urban planning, may be equally important, if not more to contain emissions from the transport sector.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3adeveloping countries 3aemployment 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ainfrastructure 3apeople 3apopulation growth 3asocioeconomic status 3atemperature 3atravel 3aurban planning 3avehicles (equipment) 3awalking 3aIndia1 aBrodnig, Gernot1 aOnoriose, Charity G.0 tHabitat international.g2011 July, v. 35, no. 3 p.494-500dElsevier Ltdx0197-39757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2011.02.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245009100160300002000251520150200271592002801773650001701801650002501818650002101843650001801864650001201882650001701894650001501911650001601926650001301942650004301955650001101998650001402009650000902023650002102032650001402053650001202067650002002079650001802099650000902117653001502126653001702141653002002158653002302178653001802201700001302219700001702232700001902249700001502268700001702283773012502300856008002425852000902505655001202514IND60568793620221119064505.0170517e20170517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056879362DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b048012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yonghui10aMultifunctional Hydrogels Prepared by Dual Ion Cross-Linking for Chronic Wound Healing  ap. 16054-16062.  aThe creation of a moist environment and promotion of blood vessel formation are critical for wound healing. Sodium alginate (SA) hydrogel, which has good biocompatibility and is able to provide a moist environment, has been widely used as a wound dressing. However, it lacks antibacterial ability and bioactivities, which would facilitate chronic wound healing. On the basis of the gelation characteristics of SA and the bioactive hardystonite (HS) bioceramic, we designed a unique, bioactive, injectable composite hydrogel through double ion cross-linking, in which divalent ions, such as Ca²⁺ and Zn²⁺ function as cross-linkers; Zn²⁺ also functions as an antibacterial component and as nutrition for wound healing, and Si ions play a key role in determining the bioactivity of the hydrogel. With the controlled release of divalent ions, such as Ca²⁺ and Zn²⁺ from HS, the gelation process of the composite hydrogel could be efficiently controlled. In addition, in vitro results reveal that the composite hydrogel stimulated proliferation and migration of both human dermal fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and the in vivo results show that the wound-healing process is obviously enhanced, and the formation of epithelium and blood vessels are evidently advanced. This study indicates the potential of the SA/HS hydrogel as a multifunctional injectable wound dressing with the ability to inhibit bacterial growth and stimulate angiogenesis and wound healing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3abioactive properties 3abiocompatibility 3ablood vessels 3acalcium 3acrosslinking 3aepithelium 3afibroblasts 3agelation 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ahumans 3ahydrogels 3aions 3amicrobial growth 3anutrition 3asilicon 3asodium alginate 3atissue repair 3azinc 0ainjectable 0ahardystonite 0amultifunctional 0acomposite hydrogel 0awound healing1 aHan, Yan1 aWang, Xiaoya1 aPeng, Jinliang1 aXu, Yuhong1 aChang, Jiang0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 May 17, v. 9, no. 19 p.16054-16062dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b048013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01871naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245006400163300001800227520091900245592002801164650001101192650001601203650002101219650002201240650001101262650001401273650001101287650001301298700001701311773013401328856007401462852000901536655001201545IND60661328720221120055103.0190829e20110620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066132872DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cs00149j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBélanger, Daniel,10aElectrografting: a powerful method for surface modification  ap. 3995-4048.  aElectrografting refers to the electrochemical reaction that permits organic layers to be attached to solid conducting substrates. This definition can be extended to reactions involving an electron transfer between the substrate to be modified and the reagent, but also to examples where a reducing or oxidizing reagent is added to produce the reactive species. These methods are interesting as they provide a real bond between the surface and the organic layer. Electrografting applies to a variety of substrates including carbon, metals and their oxides, but also dielectrics such as polymers. Since the 1980s several methods have been developed, either by reduction or oxidation, and some of them have reached an industrial stage. This critical review describes the methods that are used for electrografting, their mechanism, the formation and growth of the layers as well as their applications (742 references).  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adielectrics 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3ametals 3aoxidation 3aoxides 3apolymers1 aPinson, Jean0 tChemical Society reviews.g2011 June 20, v. 40, no. 7 p.3995-4048dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0cs00149j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245005400208300001600262500001100278506007600289520130700365592002801672506003701700650001901737650003501756650002001791650001501811650001701826650002601843650001301869650001901882650001201901650001801913650001601931650002301947650001001970650001501980650001701995650001402012650002102026650001102047650001302058650002802071700002202099700002102121700002002142700001902162700001902181700002102200700002302221773009102244856008102335852000902416655001202425IND60585571620221207103953.0171110e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058557162DNAL7 a10.1007/s12263-009-0159-92doi7 aPMC28851672pmcid7 a206068112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aComporti, Mario10aEthanol-induced oxidative stress: basic knowledge  ap. 101-109.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAfter a general introduction, the main pathways of ethanol metabolism (alcohol dehydrogenase, catalase, coupling of catalase with NADPH oxidase and microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system) are shortly reviewed. The cytochrome P₄₅₀ isoform (CYP2E1) specifically involved in ethanol oxidation is discussed. The acetaldehyde metabolism and the shift of the NAD/NADH ratio in the cellular environment (reductive stress) are stressed. The toxic effects of acetaldehyde are mentioned. The ethanol-induced oxidative stress: the increased MDA formation by incubated liver preparations, the absorption of conjugated dienes in mitochondrial and microsomal lipids and the decrease in the most unsaturated fatty acids in liver cell membranes are discussed. The formation of carbon-centered (1-hydroxyethyl) and oxygen-centered (hydroxyl) radicals during the metabolism of ethanol is considered: the generation of hydroxyethyl radicals, which occurs likely during the process of univalent reduction of dioxygen, is highlighted and is carried out by ferric cytochrome P₄₅₀ oxy-complex (P₄₅₀–Fe³⁺O ₂ ·⁻) formed during the reduction of heme-oxygen. The ethanol-induced lipid peroxidation has been evaluated, and it has been shown that plasma F₂-isoprostanes are increased in ethanol toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aabsorption 3aacetaldehyde 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3acatalase 3acell membranes 3aethanol 3afree radicals 3ahepatocytes 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3ametabolism 3amitochondria 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3atoxicity 3aunsaturated fatty acids1 aSignorini, Cinzia1 aLeoncini, Silvia1 aGardi, Concetta1 aCiccoli, Lucia1 aGiardini, Anna1 aVecchio, Daniela1 aArezzini, Beatrice0 tGenes & nutrition.g2010 June, v. 5, no. 2 p.101-109dSpringer-Verlagx1555-89327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12263-009-0159-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03156naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100005300137245016300190300001800353500001900371500002000390520177400410592002802184596005902212596008802271596009102359650002502450650002202475650001302497651001002510700001302520700001402533700001202547700001702559773012602576856007102702852000902773655001202782IND60726234720221122094347.0210202e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072623472DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.61392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3128-673X10aBroflanilide effectively controls Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera exigua exhibiting diverse susceptibilities to chlorantraniliprole and emamectin benzoate  ap. 1262-1272.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner), and the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua (Hübner), are two major polyphagous lepidopteran pests of cultivated crops. They develop various levels of resistance to many frequently applied broad‐spectrum insecticides. Here, the larval susceptibilities of a laboratory population and six field‐collected populations per pest from Hunan Province, China to three insecticides were determined using a standard leaf‐dipping method in the laboratory. Field‐plot trials were conducted to verify the control efficacies of broflanilide 100 g L⁻¹ suspension concentrate (SC), chlorantraniliprole 5% SC and emamectin benzoate 5.7% water‐dispersible granule, against H. armigera and S. exigua larvae using foliar sprays in 2013 and 2019. RESULTS: Variations among H. armigera and S. exigua field populations in their susceptibility levels to the three insecticides were observed in Linli, Yueyang and Changsha counties from 2013 to 2019. They were still high susceptibility to broflanilide only, but developed low and/or moderate levels of resistance to chlorantraniliprole and emamectin benzoate. In addition, broflanilide at 25 g ha⁻¹ provided an excellent control efficacy of 81.92% to 96.46% against these pests during the 3–14‐days period after treatment in both years, whereas chlorantraniliprole at 50 g ha⁻¹ and emamectin benzoate at 4.5 g ha⁻¹ exhibited significantly decreased efficacies, which were consistent with their corresponding toxicity levels. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that broflanilide should be an important new tool for the effective control of diamide‐ and avermectin‐resistant H. armigera and S. exigua. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a31501673cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2019LS02cAgricultural Science&Technology Innovation Fund Program of Hunan Province  a201203038cSpecial Fund for Agro‐Scientific Research in the Public Interest of China 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3aSpodoptera exigua 3atoxicity 3aChina1 aHu, Fang1 aWang, Pei1 aFu, Wei1 aLiu, Xueyuan0 tPest management science.g2021 Mar., v. 77, no. 3 p.1262-1272dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.61393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02180naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245012000165300001400285506002800299520092000327592002801247506003701275650002001312650001701332650001201349650001901361650002201380650001301402651000901415653002101424653002501445653001501470700002001485700003301505700001901538773013701557856007901694852000901773655001201782IND60784847920221207103646.0200625e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078484792DNAL7 a10.22103/jab.2012.11672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzadi, Zahra Mir10aSite quality and Essential oil composition of Myrtus Communis L.

Since, medicinal plants have important roles for their uses as food sources and as disease treatments in the world, researchers attempt to identified essential oil compositions of these plants. <em>Myrtus communis</em> is one of the most valuable medicinal plants that widely extended in Iran. This study aimed to determine essential oil yield and composition, extracted from the <em>Myrtus communis</em> leaves. The leaves of Myrtus communis were collected from Cham Moord area in Lorestan province in 1389. Essential oils were extracted by hydrodistillation and essential oil components were identified by GC and GC/MS.Based on results, 21 different components in the essential oils were identified that limonene (18.5), α pinen(13.32) and cineol 1,8 (10.58) had the most essential oil yield, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMyrtus communis 3acase studies 3acineole 3aessential oils 3ahydrodistillation 3alimonene 3aIran 0amedicinal plants 0achemical composition 0acham moord1 aVar, Babak Pile1 aMeshaktosadat, Mohammad Hadi1 aKaramian, Reza0 tBiyutiknuluzhī-i kishāvarzī.g2012 Jan., v. 3, no. 2 p.71-80dShahid Bahonar University of KermanwJournal:27822x2228-65007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.22103/jab.2012.11673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03379naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245009500174520187500269592002802144650001202172650001902184650002202203650001802225650001602243650001402259650002402273650001702297650002102314650002502335650001002360650001602370650001902386651001002405653002902415653002902444653002902473653002702502653003502529653002202564653002402586700001802610700002502628700002402653773011302677856008602790852000902876655001202885IND60749080520221120041632.0211206e20211020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074908052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1287252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeelam, Khandelwal10aThermo-economic analysis of an integrated solar thermal cycle (ISTC) using thermal storage  aSolar integrated power plants are a combination of the concentrated solar power plant and thermal power plant. The thermal energy storage systems, when integrated with concentrated solar power based solar cycle, can address issues related to energy availability during non-solar hours.This study presents an integration of concentrated solar power technology based solar energy capture and storage with the 210 MW conventional Rankine cycle based thermal power plant in Dadri (India). The mathematical model of Integrated Solar Thermal Cycle (ISTC) has been developed which includes the modelling of the Linear Fresenel reflector solar system, steam power cycle, and two tank thermal storage method. Here, water and molten salt are chosen as heat transfer fiuid in the collector loops as a medium to transfer and store the solar thermal energy. A MATLAB code is used as a simulation tool to analyse the ISTC performance for different parametric variations such as temperature difference in the solar receiver, solar output, the mass flow rate of heat transfer fluids, fuel-saving ratio by varying direct normal irradiation. Based on the simulation, it is discussed that the integration of solar field with power cycle offers enhanced efficiency along with the reduction of emission of carbon dioxide. Integration of solar field with Thermal Energy Storage (TES) using two tank method with molten salt further improves the efficiency of the power cycle up to 40%. Based on results of simulations, it is discussed that ISTC using two tank method with molten salt results into the saving of large amount of fuel by replacement of one and two feed water heater(s) which ensures the recovery of the capital expenditure within approximately 10 years. Further, this improvisation contributes to environment and society by curtailing the emission of carbon dioxide drastically.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3acarbon dioxide 3aeconomic analysis 3aheat transfer 3airradiation 3amass flow 3amathematical models 3apower plants 3asolar collectors 3asolar thermal energy 3asteam 3atemperature 3athermal energy 3aIndia 0aConcentrated solar power 0aLinear fresnel reflector 0aDirect normal irradiance 0aThermal energy storage 0aIntegrated solar thermal cycle 0aFeed water heater 0aHeat transfer fluid1 aMeeta, Sharma1 aOaṅhāra Siṅgha,1 aKumar, Shukla Anoop0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Oct. 20, v. 320 p.128725-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1287253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245008400165300001800249520132400267592002801591650002501619650002501644650002101669650004101690650001801731650001601749650002601765650004401791650001401835650001901849650001301868650001801881650001101899700002701910700002701937773013201964856007502096852000902171655001202180IND60538816820221120130839.0160815e20130417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053881682DNAL7 a10.1021/ja401535g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastillo, Dorianne
A.13aAn Effective Strategy for Exploring Unknown Metabolic Pathways by Genome Mining  ap. 5885-5894.  aPlants allocate an estimated 15–25% of their proteome to specialized metabolic pathways that remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we describe a genome mining strategy for exploring such unknown pathways and demonstrate this approach for triterpenoids by functionally characterizing three cytochrome P450s from Arabidopsis thaliana. Building on proven methods for characterizing oxidosqualene cyclases, we heterologously expressed in yeast known cyclases with candidate P450s chosen from gene clustering and microarray coexpression patterns. The yeast cultures produced mg/L amounts of plant metabolites in vivo without the complex phytochemical background of plant extracts. Despite this simplification, the product multiplicity and novelty overwhelmed analytical efforts by MS methods. HSQC analysis overcame this problem. Side-by-side HSQC comparisons of crude P450 extracts against a control resolved even minor P450 products among ∼100 other yeast metabolites spanning a dynamic range of >10 000:1. HSQC and GC–MS then jointly guided purification and structure determination by classical NMR methods. Including our present results for P450 oxidation of thalianol, arabidiol, and marneral, the metabolic fate for most of the major triterpene synthase products in Arabidopsis is now at least partially known.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3abiochemical pathways 3acytochrome P-450 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agenome mining 3ametabolites 3amicroarray technology 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3aplant extracts 3aproteome 3atriterpenoids 3ayeasts1 aKolesnikova, Mariya D.1 aMatsuda, Seiichi P.

In 11 mares, estrus was induced seven times with 5 mg PGF₂α given at 14-day intervals. The first estrus was a control (no treatment). During the third estrus, mares received glucocorticoid (GC) treatment (20 mg isoflupredone acetate) every 12 h, for three consecutive days. The fifth estrus was the Infected treatment (intrauterine infusion of 1 × 10⁹ colony-forming unit/mL Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus). Finally, the seventh was a combination of GC + Infected treatment (infusion of bacteria 24 h after the first GC treatment). At 12 h after the end of each treatment, uterine samples were collected and submitted to two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) for protein separation and mass spectrometry. Both GC treatment and uterine lumen infection induced proteomic alterations in the endometrial fluid of susceptible mares, characterized by an increase, decrease, or both in the relative optic density and/or frequency of inflammatory acute phase proteins (APP), with major alterations occurring when corticotherapy was applied in the presence of an infectious process. Corticotherapy in the presence of infection increased α₁-antitrypsin (AAT), transthyretin (TT), and actin, but reduced immunoglobulin G, whereas intrauterine infection increased haptoglobin (Hp) and apolipoprotein A-1 (ApoA-1) and decreased transferrin (TF). Infection reduced levels of α₁-antitrypsin and transthyretin, whereas corticotherapy in the presence of infection increased their frequency. We concluded that GC influenced the immune response, not only as suppressors, but also as enhancers of local defense mechanisms, through an immunomodulatory action. Short-term corticotherapy could be beneficial for treatment of uterine infectious processes in the mare.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus equi 3aacetates 3aacute phase proteins 3aapolipoprotein A-I 3adefense mechanisms 3aendometritis 3aestrus 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunomodulation 3aintrauterine administration 3amares 3amass spectrometry 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprealbumin 3aproteomics 3atransferrin 2aAcute-Phase Proteinsxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aApolipoprotein A-Ixmetabolism 2aDisease Susceptibilityxveterinary 2aEndometritisxdrug therapyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aEndometriumxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aFluprednisolonexanalogs & derivativesxtherapeutic use. 2aGlucocorticoidsxtherapeutic use 2aHorse Diseasesxdrug therapyxmicrobiology. 2aHorses 2aProteomics 2aStreptococcus equi 2aTransferrinxmetabolism 2aalpha 1-Antitrypsinxmetabolism1 aMaslchitzky, E.1 aGregory, R.M.1 aJobim, M.I.M.1 aMattos, R.C.0 tTheriogenology.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 77, no. 7 p.1351-1359dElsevier Inc.x0093-691X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2011.10.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245012500177300001600302520181900318592002802137650001402165650001302179650001702192650002002209650001602229650001202245650001202257650001402269650001102283650001802294650001102312651001002323700002502333700002202358773009302380856008802473990002302561852000902584655001202593IND60099379620221118231153.0141105e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009937962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.habitatint.2011.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, Lawrence W.C.10aSegregation legal and natural: An empirical study of the legally protected and free market housing ownership on the Peak  ap. 501-507.  aThe phenomenon of protectionism in land policy has survived in the globalised age for various reasons. This case study on the destruction of racially discriminatory zoning in laissez-faire Colonial Hong Kong shows what could happen when protectionist measures are removed by the government. Approaching the reality of discrimination from Cheung’s (1974) economic theory of price controls, this paper argues, on the basis of the records of official speeches and writings and a small sample of post-war assignments for housing lots, that the pre-World War II segregation law was motivated more by economic protectionism in favour of Europeans rather than by any social stigma against non-Europeans or genuine environmental externalities generated by Chinese housing. The paper approaches the same phenomenon from a new perspective and with a better method. It was revealed that natural or contractual, as opposed to legal, agglomeration could happen even under written discriminatory laws that allowed a degree of inclusion for the ethnic group that suffered discrimination. This revelation was based on an examination of the ethnicity of the original owners and subsequent purchasers of all identifiable 627 housing lots on the Peak in Hong Kong for 115 years from 1876 to 1990, as found in the 421 relevant Crown Leases and 1255 assignments. These housing lots fell into 23 street neighbourhoods and could be classified by altitude. The key findings lend support to the arguments that even if the post-war colonial literature evaded or even distorted the subject, there was no true racial animosity between European and Chinese citizens because the exclusionary laws were driven by economic protectionist motives and the repeal of the laws was socially and economically beneficial for both Chinese and Europeans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropeans 3aaltitude 3acase studies 3aeconomic theory 3aland policy 3aleasing 3amarkets 3aownership 3aprices 3asocial stigma 3azoning 3aChina1 aKwong, Valerius W.C.1 aKwong, Jason W.Y.0 tHabitat international.g2011 July, v. 35, no. 3 p.501-507dElsevier Ltdx0197-39757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2011.02.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245016000204300001800364520161800382592002802000596007602028596007602104596008102180596005302261596005902314650001302373650001602386650002102402650001202423650001502435650002102450650001102471700005202482700005402534700005902588700006002647773012102707856008302828852000902911655001202920IND60627496420221117231150.0190329e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062749642DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-018-03194-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Tingjian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3146-690610aImproved electrochemical performance of P2-type Na0.67Lix(Mn0.5Fe0.25Co0.25)1−xO2 cathode materials from Li ion substitution of the transition metal ions  ap. 5584-5594.  aIn this work, we report the preparation and the enhanced electrochemical performance of P2-type Na₀.₆₇Liₓ(Mn₀.₅Fe₀.₂₅Co₀.₂₅)₁₋ₓO₂ layered cathode materials with different Li substitutions via a nanomilling-assisted solid-state method. The experimental results show that the introduced lithium ions can greatly improve the performance of the material after entering the transition metal layer. Among these synthesized samples, the Na₀.₆₇Li₀.₀₃(Mn₀.₅Fe₀.₂₅Co₀.₂₅)₀.₉₇O₂ electrode exhibits an exceptionally high specific capacity of 190.6 mAh g⁻¹ at 0.1 C rate and a capacity retention of 89.5% after 30 cycles. Obviously, the specific capacity retention is improved by 15.3% compared with the pristine Na₀.₆₇(Mn₀.₅Fe₀.₂₅Co₀.₂₅)O₂ without Li incorporation (the specific capacity retention is only 74.2% after 30 cycles). Simultaneously, the sample also shows a large increase in rate performance compared to the pristine material. All of the enhancement can be explained by the fact that the introduced Li ions suppress the phase transition during the charge–discharge process and avoid the volume expansion of the electrode, which significantly reduce the occurrence of micro-cracks within the electrode. The reduced polarization, the decreased internal resistance of the prepared electrodes and the increased sodium ion diffusion coefficient, as confirmed from the CV and EIS measurements, can be regarded as the three major reasons for the enhanced electrochemical performance of the Li ion-substituted materials.  aPublisher supplied data  a14520503100cScience and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality  a13PJ1407400cScience and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality  a201310-JD-B2-009cScience and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality  a15ZZ095cShanghai Municipal Education Commission  a21306113cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3acathodes 3adiffusivity 3aelectrochemistry 3alithium 3ametal ions 3aphase transition 3asodium1 aGuan, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0316-25181 aXiao, Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0664-02311 aChang, Tong-un,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6763-23231 aChang, Chengkang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2908-77980 tJournal of materials science.g2019 Apr., v. 54, no. 7 p.5584-5594dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-018-03194-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003100143245014900174520135300323592002801676650001901704650001401723650001001737650001401747650001101761650000801772650001401780650002101794650001501815650001501830650001601845650001401861650001101875700002901886700003501915700003101950700002401981700003002005700003402035700003302069773011902102856007802221852000902299655001202308IND60766873420221119183109.0220211e20220125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076687342DNAL7 a10.3390/foods110303332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaucar-Carrión, Cristina 10aIncorporation of Limosilactobacillus fermentum UCO-979C with Anti-Helicobacter pylori and Immunomodulatory Activities in Various Ice Cream Bases  aLimosilactobacillus fermentum UCO-979C is a probiotic strain possessing anti-Helicobacter pylori and immunomodulatory activity. The aim of this work was to examine if this strain maintains its probiotic properties and its viability when added to dairy-based ice creams (cookies and cream, Greek yogurt, and chocolate with brownie) or to fruit-based ice creams (pineapple and raspberry) stored at −18 °C for 90 days. The probiotic anti-H. pylori activity using the well diffusion test, its immunomodulatory activity was measured using transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β₁) cytokine production by human gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) cells, and its viability was measured using the microdrop technique. Assays were performed in triplicate. The L. fermentum UCO-979C strain maintained strong anti-H. pylori activity in dairy-based ice creams and mild activity in fruit-based ice cream. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokine TGF-β₁ on AGS cells was higher in the probiotic recovered from Greek yogurt ice cream, maintaining a viability exceeding 10⁷ colony-forming units/mL. The addition of the probiotic to ice creams did not significantly influence the physicochemical properties of the product. These data show the great potential of the L. fermentum UCO-979C strain in producing probiotic dairy-based and fruit-based ice creams.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenocarcinoma 3achocolate 3acream 3acytokines 3ahumans 3aice 3aice cream 3aimmunomodulators 3apineapples 3aprobiotics 3araspberries 3aviability 3ayogurt1 aEspinoza-Monje, Marcela 1 aGutiérrez-Zamorano, Cristian 1 aSánchez-Alonzo, Kimberly 1 aCarvajal, Romina I.1 aRogel-Castillo, Cristian 1 aSáez Carrillo, Katia Lorena,1 aGarcía-Cancino, Apolinaria 0 tFoods.g2022 Jan. 25, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods110303333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001600156245014700172300001800319520127400337592002801611650001601639650001401655650001901669650001301688650001701701650003301718650001801751650002301769650004301792650003301835650006001868650004101928650001301969650001001982650002401992650004102016653001002057653002402067653002402091653002302115700002002138700002102158773013202179852000902311856007502320655001202395IND4463657720221117081405.0160905e20120523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446365772DNAL7 a225402852pmid7 a10.1021/jf300697f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Xiaofen10aComparison of Fast Gas Chomatography–Surface Acoustic Wave (FGC-SAW) Detection and GC-MS for Characterizing Blueberry Cultivars and Maturity  ap. 5099-5106.  aA novel analytical method using fast gas chromatography–surface acoustic wave detection (FGC-SAW) was employed to rapidly characterize blueberry volatile profiles according to genotypes and fruit maturity. Fourteen FGC-SAW peaks were observed and 11 peaks were tentatively identified in the 15 s chromatogram. Peak identifications were confirmed by matching retention index values with similar values from GC-MS analyses of the same samples. Eighty peaks were observed in the 40 min GC-MS analysis of identical samples. Principal component analysis (PCA) score plots of FGC-SAW and GC-MS data both differentiated blueberries according to genotype, maturity stage, and harvest date even though FGC-SAW PCA’s used far fewer peak area values. PCA plots clearly separated ‘FL02-40′, ‘Snowchaser’, ‘Jewel’, and ‘Primadonna’ blueberry cultivars into four quarters using two-dimensional PCA projections. FGC-SAW was also successful in differentiating three berry maturity stages in PCA score plots for both ‘Jewel’ and ‘Primadonna’ cultivars. FGC-SAW is an effective technique for rapid analysis of major blueberry volatiles, but could not determine many mid- and low-level volatiles as they were often coeluted with higher concentration volatiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablueberries 3acultivars 3afruit maturity 3agenotype 3aharvest date 3aprincipal component analysis 3arapid methods 3avolatile compounds 2aBlueberry Plantsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aChromatography, Gasxmethods 2aFruitxchemistryxclassificationxgrowth & development. 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aGenotype 2aSound 2aSpecies Specificity 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxanalysis 0azNose 0ablueberry volatiles 0ablueberry cultivars 0ablueberry maturity1 aOlmstead, James1 aRouseff, Russell0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2012 May 23, v. 60, no. 20 p.5099-5106dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf300697f3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02763naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245012100202300001800323520105400341592002801395596006401423596006401487596006401551650002201615650001601637650002301653650002101676650001301697650001901710650001401729650000701743650003701750700005401787700005601841700005301897700005501950700005702005700005502062773012102117856008202238852000902320655001202329IND60627496520221117231044.0190329e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062749652DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-018-3092-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Jiejie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5620-641X10aPhenylboronic acid-functionalized ultra-pH-sensitive micelles for enhanced tumor penetration and inhibition in vitro  ap. 5695-5711.  aIn this work, the tumor-targeted ultra-pH-responsive conjugates (PBA/Dex-g-OE) and nontargeted conjugates (Dex-g-OE) were successfully prepared and could easily self-assemble into stable micelles with lower CMC values in neutral aqueous solution. Transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering measurement indicated that the resulting micelles have desirable size distribution and regular spherical shape. The PBA/Dex-g-OE micelles possessed high stability in physiological condition and were pH sensitive to both extracellular and intracellular acidic conditions. Doxorubicin (DOX) was efficiently loaded to give the DOX-loaded micelles (PBA/Dex-g-OE-DOX and Dex-g-OE-DOX) with the desirable drug loading contents. In vitro cellular uptake and growth inhibition assays suggested that PBA/Dex-g-OE-DOX micelles were more efficiently internalized by monolayer tumor cells and three-dimensional multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) than nontargeted micelles (Dex-g-OE-DOX), leading to the fast and complete destruction of MCTS in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data  a21174054cNatural Science Foundation of Jilin Province (CN)  a21004030cNatural Science Foundation of Jilin Province (CN)  a51503001cNatural Science Foundation of Jilin Province (CN) 3aaqueous solutions 3adoxorubicin 3agrowth retardation 3alight scattering 3amicelles 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apH 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aHuang, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3017-07751 aYan, Guoqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1467-915X1 aWang, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9687-76481 aHu, Liefeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5159-01061 aZhang, Panpan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2452-90351 aTang, Rupei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2885-50490 tJournal of materials science.g2019 Apr., v. 54, no. 7 p.5695-5711dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-018-3092-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02142naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245008400172300001600256520110700272592002801379650001501407650002501422650002601447650001601473650001201489650001101501650001801512651001001530700002101540700001801561773009301579856008801672990002301760852000901783655001201792IND60099379820221119002050.0141105e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009937982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.habitatint.2011.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas Ng, S.10aApplying Z-score model to distinguish insolvent construction companies in China  ap. 599-607.  aFierce competition in the construction industry in China in recent years has brought many challenges to construction contractors. It is important that any potential company insolvency be recognized at the earliest opportunity. Using financial ratios and the Altman Z-score modelling methodology, an insolvency warning model is developed in order to evaluate the performance of construction contractors in China. The model derived from this study has consistent predictability based on a three-year window of data. It combines seven financial ratios, covering a company’s finance of operation, profitability, solvency and cash flow. A single performance index is derived to differentiate whether a company has good financial standing or exhibits characteristics of insolvent companies. A mechanism to detect insolvent contractors is proposed for sustaining corporate development in construction. It is recommended for a contractor to develop a complete precaution system of financial crisis and have a regular checking of the key financial ratios as well as operation status so as to avoid insolvency.  aPublisher supplied data 3abankruptcy 3abusiness enterprises 3aconstruction industry 3acontractors 3afinance 3amodels 3aprofitability 3aChina1 aWong, James M.W.1 aZhang, Jiajie0 tHabitat international.g2011 Oct., v. 35, no. 4 p.599-607dElsevier Ltdx0197-39757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2011.03.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03701naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245015100158520234300309592002802652650001702680650000902697650001902706650002002725650001202745650001502757650001702772650000902789650002102798650002602819650001702845650000702862650003902869650002102908650001002929700001402939700001602953700002102969700001602990700001403006700001703020773011903037856007803156852000903234655001203243IND60766873620221119124559.0220211e20220125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076687362DNAL7 a10.3390/foods110303352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Disha 10aPreparation of an Immunoaffinity Column Based on Bispecific Monoclonal Antibody for Aflatoxin B1 and Ochratoxin A Detection Combined with ic-ELISA  aA novel and efficient immunoaffinity column (IAC) based on bispecific monoclonal antibody (BsMAb) recognizing aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁) and ochratoxin A (OTA) was prepared and applied in simultaneous extraction of AFB₁ and OTA from food samples and detection of AFB₁/OTA combined with ic-ELISA (indirect competitive ELISA). Two deficient cell lines, hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HGPRT) deficient anti-AFB₁ hybridoma cell line and thymidine kinase (TK) deficient anti-OTA hybridoma cell line, were fused to generate a hybrid-hybridoma producing BsMAb against AFB₁ and OTA. The subtype of the BsMAb was IgG₁ via mouse antibody isotyping kit test. The purity and molecular weight of BsMAb were confirmed by SDS-PAGE method. The cross-reaction rate with AFB₂ was 37%, with AFG₁ 15%, with AFM₁ 48%, with AFM₂ 10%, and with OTB 36%. Negligible cross-reaction was observed with other tested compounds. The affinity constant (Ka) was determined by ELISA. The Ka (AFB₁) and Ka (OTA) was 2.43 × 10⁸ L/mol and 1.57 × 10⁸ L/mol, respectively. Then the anti-AFB₁/OTA BsMAb was coupled with CNBr-Sepharose, and an AFB₁/OTA IAC was prepared. The coupling time and elution conditions of IAC were optimized. The coupling time was 1 h with 90% coupling rate, the eluent was methanol–water (60:40, v:v, pH 2.3) containing 1 mol/L NaCl, and the eluent volume was 4 mL. The column capacities of AFB₁ and OTA were 165.0 ng and 171.3 ng, respectively. After seven times of repeated use, the preservation rates of column capacity for AFB₁ and OTA were 69.3% and 68.0%, respectively. The ic-ELISA for AFB₁ and OTA were applied combined with IAC. The IC₅₀ (50% inhibiting concentration) of AFB₁ was 0.027 ng/mL, the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.004 ng/mL (0.032 µg/kg), and the linear range was 0.006 ng/mL~0.119 ng/mL. The IC₅₀ of OTA was 0.878 ng/mL, the LOD was 0.126 ng/mL (1.008 µg/kg), and the linear range was 0.259 ng/mL~6.178 ng/mL. Under optimum conditions, corn and wheat samples were pretreated with AFB₁-OTA IAC. The recovery rates of AFB₁ and OTA were 95.4%~105.0% with ic-ELISA, and the correlations between the detection results and LC-MS were above 0.9. The developed IAC combined with ic-ELISA is reliable and could be applied to the detection of AFB₁ and OTA in grains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaflatoxin B1 3acorn 3across reaction 3adetection limit 3aguanine 3ahybridomas 3ahypoxanthine 3amice 3amolecular weight 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aochratoxin A 3apH 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3athymidine kinase 3awheat1 aWang, Xu 1 aSu, Ruijue 1 aCheng, Yongjian 1 aWang, Hong 1 aLuo, Lin 1 aXiao, Zhili 0 tFoods.g2022 Jan. 25, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods110303353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02304naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006000144245009300204500002000297520110300317592002801420650001801448650001101466650001601477650001301493650001701506650001501523650001501538650001701553650002101570650001701591700001701608700001801625700002301643700002201666700001701688773011401705856007801819852000901897655001201906IND60748915520221123004436.0210827e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074891552DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2020003072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrye, Richard E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4442-293710aPhysiological mediators of prenatal environmental influences in autism spectrum disorder  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRecent research has pointed to the importance of the prenatal environment in the etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but the biological mechanisms which mitigate these environmental factors are not clear. Mitochondrial metabolism abnormalities, inflammation and oxidative stress as common physiological disturbances associated with ASD. Network analysis of the scientific literature identified several leading prenatal environmental factors associated with ASD, particularly air pollution, pesticides, the microbiome and epigenetics. These leading prenatal environmental factors were found to be most associated with inflammation, followed by oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Other prenatal factors associated with ASD not identified by the network analysis were also found to be significantly associated with these common physiological disturbances. A better understanding of the biological mechanism which mediate the effect of prenatal environmental factors can lead to insights of how ASD develops and the development of targeted therapeutics to prevent ASD from occuring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aautism 3aepigenetics 3aetiology 3ainflammation 3ametabolism 3amicrobiome 3amitochondria 3aoxidative stress 3atherapeutics1 aCakir, Janet1 aRose, Shannon1 aPalmer, Raymond F.1 aAustin, Christine1 aCurtin, Paul0 tBioEssays.g2021 Sept., v. 43, no. 9 p.e2000307-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938457x0265-92477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2020003073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03921naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072001700166072001700183072001700200072001700217100001800234245007900252300001800331500001500349520182700364650002602191650001702217650002502234650001602259650002402275650001902299650001902318650002202337650002402359650001702383650001402400650002602414650001802440650002002458650002302478650002202501650001202523650002102535650002102556650003102577650002102608650001202629650001402641650002302655650003102678650002902709650002202738651001302760651001002773651001302783653003202796653001102828653002702839700001502866700001502881700001302896700001302909773007602922852000902998856008703007930003303094945002503127946001103152655001203163IND4385986320221118221828.0061214e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438598632DNAL7 a171698962pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/26.12.15652doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Field observations indicated linear relationships between whole-leaf conductance and the ratio of infiltrated to non-infiltrated leaf area (open stomata area) in Dipterocarpus sublamellatus Foxw. and Neobalanocarpus heimii (King) Ashton in a tropical rain forest in Peninsular Malaysia, whereas the ratio of infiltrated to non-infiltrated area rapidly increased up to the whole-leaf conductance at which the entire leaf was infiltrated in Cinnamomum camphora Sieb. in a temperate evergreen forest in Japan and in Azadirachta indica Juss. in a tropical monsoon area in Thailand. These results strongly suggest small ranges in bell-shaped stomatal conductance distributions in C. camphora and A. indica and bimodal stomatal conductance distributions in D. sublamellatus and N. heimii. The values of normalized maximum carboxylation rate at 25 °C (Vcmax25) derived from gas-exchange measurements were not constant, but decreased with decreasing whole-leaf conductance in D. sublamellatus and N. heimii. A gas-exchange model analysis revealed a linear relationship between whole-leaf conductance and the ratio of infiltrated to non-infiltrated leaf area for bimodal stomatal conductance distributions, whereas for bell-shaped distributions, the relationships were nonlinear. Midday depression of apparent Vcmax25 in these species was mainly caused by bimodal stomatal closure. The bimodal stomatal distribution model could also explain diurnal changes in photosynthetic assimilation and transpiration rates in these species. 3atropical rain forests 3agas exchange 3aspatial distribution 3ameasurement 3aCinnamomum camphora 3amonsoon season 3aphotosynthesis 3astomatal movement 3amathematical models 3aforest trees 3aequations 3anet assimilation rate 3aDipterocarpus 3atemperate zones 3aAzadirachta indica 3adiurnal variation 3astomata 3aplant morphology 3aleaf conductance 2aMagnoliopsidaxphysiology. 2aCircadian Rhythm 2aClimate 2aEcosystem 2aModels, Biological 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiology 2aPlant Leavesxphysiology 2aTreesxphysiology 3aThailand 3aJapan 3aMalaysia 0aDipterocarpus sublamellatus 0aleaves 0aNeobalanocarpus heimii1 aKosugi, Y.1 aMatsuo, N.1 aTani, M.1 aOhte, N.0 tTree physiology.g2006 Dec., v. 26, no. 12 p.1565-1578x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/26.12.15653Available from publisher's Web site  a20070123b20070202c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/01/23  aNon-US 7aarticle04625naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072001700166072001700183072001700200072001700217072001700234100001400251245011100265300001800376500001500394520249800409650001702907650001902924650001802943650001702961650002202978650003103000650001803031650001903049650002803068650001103096650002403107650001703131650002003148650001803168650001403186650002603200650002603226650002803252650002103280650001303301650002503314650002203339650001803361650001603379650003803395650003303433650002803466650001303494650002503507650004603532650004103578653002803619700001503647773007603662852000903738856008703747930003303834945002503867946001103892655001203903IND4385392620221118222013.0061121e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438539262DNAL7 a168773302pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/26.11.14572doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aZhang, S.10aEffects of carbon dioxide concentration and nutrition on photosynthetic functions of white birch seedlings  ap. 1457-1467.  a2019-12-04  aTo investigate the interactive effects of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]) and nutrition on photosynthesis and its acclimation to elevated [CO2], a two-way factorial experiment was carried out with two nutritional regimes (high- and low-nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K)) and two CO2 concentrations (360 and 720 ppm) with white birch seedlings (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) grown for four months in environment-controlled greenhouses. Elevated [CO2] enhanced maximal carboxylation rate (Vcmax), photosynthetically active radiation-saturated electron transport rate (Jmax), actual photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) in the light (ΔF/Fm') and photosynthetic linear electron transport to carboxylation (Jc) after 2.5 months of treatment, and it increased net photosynthetic rate (An), photosynthetic water-use efficiency (WUE), photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) and photosynthetic phosphorus-use efficiency (PUE) after 2.5 and 3.5 months of treatment, but it reduced stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration rate (E) and the fraction of total photosynthetic linear electron transport partitioned to oxygenation (Jo/JT) after 2.5 and 3.5 months of treatment. Low nutrient availability decreased An, WUE, Vcmax, Jmax, triose phosphate utilization (TPU), (/Fm' - F)//Fm' and Jc, but increased Jo/JT and NUE. Generally, Vcmax was more sensitive to nutrient availability than Jmax. There were significant interactive effects of [CO2] and nutrition over time, e.g., the positive effects of high nutrition on An, Vcmax, Jmax, ΔF/Fm' and Jc were significantly greater in elevated [CO2] than in ambient [CO2]. In contrast, the interactive effect of [CO2] and nutrition on NUE was significant after 2.5 months of treatment, but not after 3.5 months. High nutrient availability generally increased PUE after 3.5 months of treatment. There was evidence for photosynthetic up-regulation in response to elevated [CO2], particularly in seedlings receiving high nutrition. Photosynthetic depression in response to low nutrient availability was attributed to biochemical limitation (or increased mesophyll resistance) rather than stomatal limitation. Elevated [CO2] reduced leaf N concentration, particularly in seedlings receiving low nutrition, but had no significant effect on leaf P or K concentration. High nutrient availability generally increased area-based leaf N, P and K concentrations, but had negligible effects on K after 2.5 months of treatment. 3agas exchange 3acarbon dioxide 3adose response 3afluorescence 3aelectron transfer 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3aair pollution 3aphotosynthesis 3anutrient use efficiency 3aleaves 3amathematical models 3aforest trees 3aplant nutrition 3acarboxylation 3aequations 3anet assimilation rate 3anutrient requirements 3adry matter partitioning 3astress tolerance 3anitrogen 3awater use efficiency 3aBetula papyrifera 3agrowth models 3achlorophyll 2aBetulaxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCarbon Dioxidexpharmacology 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPhotosynthesisxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aSeedlingsxdrug effectsxphysiology. 0adry matter accumulation1 aDang, Q.L.0 tTree physiology.g2006 Nov., v. 26, no. 11 p.1457-1467x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/26.11.14573Available from publisher's Web site  a20061130b20061202c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/11/30  aNon-US 7aarticle03764naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072001700166072001700183100002000200245006900220300001800289520176800307650001802075650001102093650001102104650001702115650002202132650001902154650002602173650001602199650002002215650002002235650002602255650001002281650002002291650001302311650002802324650002202352650002502374650002502399650001202424650001502436650002402451650001402475650001202489650001402501650001302515650002302528650002302551650002102574650001902595650002902614650000902643650001602652651001002668651001002678700001902688700002102707700001602728700001702744700001602761773007602777852000902853856008702862930003302949945002502982946001103007655001203018IND4385392520141222000000.0061121e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438539252DNAL7 a168773292pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/26.11.14452doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDiaz-Espejo, A.10aModeling photosynthesis in olive leaves under drought conditions  ap. 1445-1456.  aWe quantified parameters for a model of leaf-level photosynthesis for olive, and tested the model against an independent dataset. Specific temperature-dependence parameters of the model for olive leaves were measured, as well as the relationship of the model parameters with area-based leaf nitrogen (N) content. The effect of soil water deficit on leaf photosynthesis was examined by applying two irrigation treatments to 29-year-old trees growing in a plantation: drip irrigation sufficient to meet the crop water requirements (I) and dry-farming (D). In both treatments, leaves had a higher photosynthetic capacity in April than in August. In August, photosynthetic capacity was lower in D trees than in I trees. Leaf photosynthetic capacity was linearly and positively related to leaf N content on an area basis (Na) and to leaf mass per unit area (LMA), and the regression slope varied with irrigation treatment. The seasonal reduction in Na was used in the model to predict photosynthesis under drought conditions. Olive leaves showed a clear limitation of photosynthesis by triose phosphate utilization (TPU) even at 40 °C, and the data suggest that olive invests fewer resources in TPU than other species. The seasonal decrease in photosynthetic capacity moderated the stomatal limitation to carbon dioxide (CO2) fixation as soil water deficit increased. Further, it enabled leaves to operate close to the transition point between photosynthetic limitation due to RuBP carboxylation capacity and that due to RuBP regeneration capacity, and resulted in a near constant value of internal CO2 concentration from April to August. Under well watered conditions, N-use efficiency of the olive leaves was enhanced at the expense of reduced water-use efficiency. 3aOlea europaea 3aolives 3aleaves 3awater stress 3adrought tolerance 3aphotosynthesis 3anet assimilation rate 3atemperature 3amicroirrigation 3adryland farming 3airrigation scheduling 3aroots 3anutrient uptake 3anitrogen 3anutrient use efficiency 3adiurnal variation 3astomatal conductance 3awater use efficiency 3atrioses 3aphosphates 3amathematical models 3aequations 2aClimate 2aDisasters 2aKinetics 2aModels, Biological 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aOleaxphysiology 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPlant Leavesxphysiology 2aRain 2aTemperature 3aSpain 0aSpain1 aWalcroft, A.S.1 aFernández, J.E.1 aHafridi, B.1 aPalomo, M.J.1 aGiron, I.F.0 tTree physiology.g2006 Nov., v. 26, no. 11 p.1445-1456x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/26.11.14453Available from publisher's Web site  a20061130b20061202c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/11/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02776naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002200110040001800132100001700150245016000167300001600327520093300343650002901276650002101305650001201326650001201338650001601350650001001366650002101376650001701397650002801414650003401442650001201476650001801488650003301506650001301539650001701552650005001569650001301619650007401632650002801706653001701734653001401751653001401765653001401779653001401793653002701807653001401834653001401848653001401862653001401876653003401890700001601924700001601940700001801956700001701974773006701991852000902058930003302067945001302100946001302113655001202126IND2037375420221118221603.0940217e199310  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203737542DNAL7 a82439932pmid7 aPMC12056342pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVinh, D.B.N.10aGenetic evidence for functional interactions between actin noncomplementing (Anc) gene products and actin cytoskeletal proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 275-286.  aWe describe here genetic interactions between mutant alleles of Actin-NonComplementing (ANC) genes and actin (ACT1) or actin-binding protein (SAC6, ABP1, TPM1) genes. The anc mutations were found to exhibit allele-specific noncomplementing interactions with different act1 mutations. In addition, mutant alleles of four ANC genes (ANC1, ANC2, ANC3 and ANC4) were tested for interactions with null alleles of actin-binding protein genes. An anc1 mutant allele failed to complement null alleles of the SAC6 and TPM1 genes that encode yeast fimbrin and tropomyosin, respectively. Also, synthetic lethality between anc3 and sac6 mutations, and between anc4 and tpm1 mutations was observed. Taken together, the above results strongly suggest that the ANC gene products contribute to diverse aspects of actin function. Finally, we report the results of tests of two models previously proposed to explain extragenic noncomplementation. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3astructural genes 3aalleles 3amutants 3amutagenesis 3aactin 3abinding proteins 3acytoskeleton 3agenetic complementation 2aActinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAlleles 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aGenotype 2aHeterozygote 2aMicrofilament Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlasmids 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aTransformation, Genetic 0ainteractions 0aanc1 gene 0aanc2 gene 0aanc3 gene 0aanc4 gene 0aactin binding proteins 0aact1 gene 0asac6 gene 0aabp1 gene 0atpm1 gene 0aextragenic noncomplementation1 aWelch, M.D.1 aCorsi, A.K.1 aWertman, K.F.1 aDrubin, D.G.0 tGenetics.g1993 Oct., v. 135, no. 2 p.275-286x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02837naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072001700165072001700182072001700199072001700216072001700233100001700250245011700267300001800384520104200402650001901444650002001463650001801483650001601501650002801517650002001545650002001565650001401585650001801599650002101617650002701638650002601665650001801691650001801709650002401727650001401751650001101765650005501776650001001831650001001841650005901851650005801910651001201968700001501980773007601995852000902071856008602080930003302166945002502199946001102224655001202235IND4384700520221118221547.0061025e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438470052DNAL7 a167404982pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/26.9.12272doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAphalo, P.J.10aSpacing of silver birch seedlings grown in containers of equal size affects their morphology and its variability  ap. 1227-1237.  aSilver birch (Betula pendula Roth) seedlings were grown individually in containers arranged in rows radiating from a central point (Nelder plot) at densities spanning the range from 207 to 891 plants m-2. Height of one set of seedlings was measured at weekly intervals and additional seedlings were harvested each week for dry mass and leaf area measurements. Height and shoot:root dry mass ratio increased with plant density. Seedling-to-seedling variability in dry mass, but not height, increased with increasing plant density. The red to far-red (R:FR) photon ratio in horizontally propagated radiation decreased with increasing density, even when plant densities and leaf area index values were low. In a separate experiment, elongating internodes of seedlings were irradiated locally by red and far-red light emitting diodes and stem elongation measured. Far-red light markedly increased stem elongation, suggesting that changes in light quality sensed by growing internodes are involved in the observed responses to growth density. 3aBetula pendula 3aseedling growth 3aplant density 3arow spacing 3adry matter accumulation 3amineral content 3alight intensity 3ared light 3afar-red light 3aplant morphology 3acontainer-grown plants 3agreenhouse production 3anursery crops 3agrowth models 3amathematical models 3aequations 3aheight 2aBetulaxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & development. 2aColor 2aLight 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & developmentxradiation effects. 2aSeedlingsxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & development. 3aFinland1 aRikala, R.0 tTree physiology.g2006 Sept., v. 26, no. 9 p.1227-1237x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/26.9.12273Available from publisher's Web site  a20061113b20061202c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/11/13  aNon-US 7aarticle04002naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072001700165072001700182072001700199100001300216245013500229300001800364500001500382520200800397650002002405650001902425650001702444650002202461650001802483650001302501650001402514650002902528650001702557650002002574650002002594650002102614650001002635650001202645650001602657650001102673650003702684650002802721650001902749650005102768650005102819650005502870650003402925651001202959653001402971653002202985700001703007700001703024700001403041700001703055700001603072773007603088852000903164856008603173930003303259945002503292946001103317655001203328IND4384699720221118221613.0061025e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438469972DNAL7 a167404942pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/26.9.11852doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

White spruce and jack pine seedlings were inoculated with three ECM fungi selected for their in vitro tolerance to excess Na+ and Cl-: Hebeloma crustuliniforme (Bull) Quel. UAMH 5247, Laccaria bicolor Maire (Orton) UAMH 8232 and a Suillus tomentosus (Kauff.) Sing., Snell and Dick isolate from a salt-affected site. The physiological responses of the seedlings to a gradient of NaCl concentration (0, 50, 100 and 200 mM) were assessed over four weeks by: (1) Na+ accumulation and allocation; (2) chlorophyll a fluorescence; (3) growth, (4) water content; and (5) organic osmolyte accumulation. Jack pine seedlings were more sensitive than white spruce seedlings to increasing Na+ and Cl- concentrations. Both species showed decreasing biomass accumulation, and increasing concentrations of organic osmotica and Na with increasing NaCl concentration. White spruce seedlings inoculated with the S. tomentosus isolate had the best growth response at all NaCl concentrations tested. Although jack pine seedlings inoculated with the L. bicolor or S. tomentosus isolate exhibited the highest growth in the 50 and 100 mM NaCl treatments, both fungi increased the photochemical stress and dehydration of their hosts in the 200 mM NaCl treatment. At the latter concentration, jack pine seedlings inoculated with H. crustuliniforme showed the greatest tolerance to salt stress. Although the different fungi altered the physiological response of the host in different ways, inoculation with salt-stress-tolerant ECM fungi increased growth and reduced the negative effects of excess NaCl. Use of controlled mycorrhization may increase survival of coniferous seedlings used for revegetation of salt-affected sites. 3aectomycorrhizae 3asalt tolerance 3aforest trees 3amycorrhizal fungi 3adose response 3asalinity 3aseedlings 3aHebeloma crustuliniforme 3aPicea glauca 3aPinus banksiana 3asodium chloride 3aLaccaria bicolor 3aroots 3aSuillus 3asalt stress 3ashoots 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aMycorrhizaexphysiology 2aPhotochemistry 2aPiceaxdrug effectsxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aPinusxdrug effectsxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aSeedlingsxdrug effectsxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 3aAlberta 0asymbiosis 0aSuillus tomentosa1 aBigras, F.J.1 aBertrand, A.1 aPiche, Y.1 aFung, M.Y.P.1 aKhasa, D.P.0 tTree physiology.g2006 Sept., v. 26, no. 9 p.1185-1196x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/26.9.11853Available from publisher's Web site  a20061108b20061202c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/11/08  aNon-US 7aarticle03711naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002800181245014600209300001800355500002400373506007600397520183800473506003702311650001902348650002702367650001302394650001202407650001002419650001602429650001202445650002202457650001202479650002002491650001302511650002502524650002502549650003502574650002902609650001802638650003302656650003102689650001102720650004202731650003002773650002202803650003402825700002402859700002302883700002202906773011602928852000903044856008003053655001203133IND4435536820221207105223.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443553682DNAL7 a201945932pmid7 aPMC28635512pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.01450-092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrice, Christopher T.D.10aIndispensable Role for the Eukaryotic-Like Ankyrin Domains of the Ankyrin B Effector of Legionella pneumophila within Macrophages and Amoebae  ap. 2079-2088.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Dot/Icm-translocated ankyrin B (AnkB) effector of Legionella pneumophila exhibits molecular mimicry of eukaryotic F-box proteins and is essential for intracellular replication in macrophages and protozoa. In addition to two eukaryotic-like ankyrin (ANK) domains, AnkB harbors a conserved eukaryotic F-box domain, which is involved in polyubiquitination of proteins throughout the eukaryotic kingdom. We have recently shown that the F-box domain of the AnkB effector is essential for decoration of the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) with polyubiquitinated proteins within macrophages and protozoan hosts. To decipher the role of the two ANK domains in the function of AnkB, we have constructed in-frame deletion of either or both of the ANK domain-encoding regions (ankBΔA1, ankBΔA2, and ankBΔA1A2) to trans-complement the ankB null mutant. Deletion of the ANK domains results in defects in intracellular proliferation and decoration of the LCV with polyubiquitinated proteins. Export of the truncated variants of AnkB was reduced, and this may account for the observed defects. However, while full-length AnkB ectopically expressed in mammalian cells trans-rescues the ankB null mutant for intracellular proliferation, ectopic expression of AnkBΔA1, AnkBΔA2, and AnkBΔA1A2 fails to trans-rescue the ankB null mutant. Importantly, ectopically expressed full-length AnkB is targeted to the host cell plasma membrane, where it recruits polyubiquitinated proteins. In contrast, AnkBΔA1, AnkBΔA2, and AnkBΔA1A2 are diffusely distributed throughout the cytosol and fail to recruit polyubiquitinated proteins. We conclude that the two eukaryotic-like ANK domains of AnkB are essential for intracellular proliferation, for targeting AnkB to the host membranes, and for decoration of the LCV with polyubiquitinated proteins.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aF-box proteins 3aLegionella pneumophila 3aProtozoa 3acytosol 3ahosts 3amacrophages 3amammals 3amolecular mimicry 3amutants 3aplasma membrane 3avacuoles 2aAmoebaxmicrobiology 2aAnkyrinsxphysiology 2aBacterial Proteinsxphysiology 2aCell Membranexchemistry 2aGene Deletion 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aHost-Pathogen Interactions 2aHumans 2aLegionella pneumophilaxpathogenicity 2aMacrophagesxmicrobiology 2aSequence Deletion 2aVirulence Factorsxphysiology1 aAl-Khodor, Souhaila1 aAl-Quadan, Tasneem1 aAbu Kwaik, Yousef0 tInfection and immunity.g2010 May, v. 78, no. 5 p.2079-2088dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01450-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01737naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100001600117245006700133246013900200300001600339500001500355520084800370650001101218650003701229653001101266700002101277700001801298773008101316852000901397939003301406945000801439655001201447991561265580742620221118221722.0700301e197002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7090282082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeute, M.K.12aA survey of viruses in field-grown Gladiolus in North Carolina3 aSurvey of viruses in field-grown Gladiolus in North Carolina.

While Yersinia pestis has multiple iron transporters, the yersiniabactin (Ybt) siderophore-dependent system plays a major role in iron acquisition in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we determined that the Ybt system is required for the use of iron bound by transferrin and lactoferrin and examined the importance of the Ybt system for virulence in mouse models of bubonic and pneumonic plague. Y. pestis mutants unable to either transport Ybt or synthesize the siderophore were both essentially avirulent via subcutaneous injection (bubonic plague model). Surprisingly, via intranasal instillation (pneumonic plague model), we saw a difference in the virulence of Ybt biosynthetic and transport mutants. Ybt biosynthetic mutants displayed an ~24-fold-higher 50% lethal dose (LD₅₀) than transport mutants. In contrast, under iron-restricted conditions in vitro, a Ybt transport mutant had a more severe growth defect than the Ybt biosynthetic mutant. Finally, a Δpgm mutant had a greater loss of virulence than the Ybt biosynthetic mutant, indicating that the 102-kb pgm locus encodes a virulence factor, in addition to Ybt, that plays a role in the pathogenesis of pneumonic plague.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aYersinia pestis 3aanimal models 3alactoferrin 3alethal dose 50 3aloci 3amutants 3apathogenesis 3aplague 3asiderophores 3asubcutaneous injection 3atransferrin 3atransporters 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aIronxmetabolism 2aLethal Dose 50 2aMice 2aPhenolsxmetabolism 2aPlaguexmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aSurvival Analysis 2aThiazolesxmetabolism 2aVirulence 2aVirulence Factorsxdeficiencyxmetabolism. 2aYersinia pestisxpathogenicity1 aKirillina, Olga1 aBobrov, Alexander G.1 aPaulley, James T.1 aPerry, Robert D.0 tInfection and immunity.g2010 May, v. 78, no. 5 p.2045-2052dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01236-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01557naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100002000117245008400137246014800221300001600369500003000385520057700415650001000992650001501002650001901017700002001036700001801056700001901074700001901093773008101112852000901193939003301202945000801235655001201243991561265470742620221118221639.0700301e197002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7090282212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdwardson, J.R.12aA virus isolated from Desmodium canum; characterization and electron microscopy3 aVirus isolated from Desmodium canum; characterization and electron microscopy.

Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cells contain different O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase (OASTL) enzymes that catalyze the biosynthesis of Cys. Because they are localized in the cytosol, plastids, and mitochondria, this results in multiple subcellular Cys pools. Much progress has been made on the most abundant OASTL enzymes; however, information on the less abundant OASTL-like proteins has been scarce. To unequivocally establish the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by the minor cytosolic OASTL isoform CS-LIKE (for Cys synthase-like; At5g28030), we expressed this enzyme in bacteria and characterized the purified recombinant protein. Our results demonstrate that CS-LIKE catalyzes the desulfuration of L-Cys to sulfide plus ammonia and pyruvate. Thus, CS-LIKE is a novel L-Cys desulfhydrase (EC 4.4.1.1), and we propose to designate it DES1. The impact and functionality of DES1 in Cys metabolism was revealed by the phenotype of the T-DNA insertion mutants des1-1 and des1-2. Mutation of the DES1 gene leads to premature leaf senescence, as demonstrated by the increased expression of senescence-associated genes and transcription factors. Also, the absence of DES1 significantly reduces the total Cys desulfuration activity in leaves, and there is a concomitant increase in the total Cys content. As a consequence, the expression levels of sulfur-responsive genes are deregulated, and the mutant plants show enhanced antioxidant defenses and tolerance to conditions that promote oxidative stress. Our results suggest that DES1 from Arabidopsis is an L-Cys desulfhydrase involved in maintaining Cys homeostasis, mainly at late developmental stages or under environmental perturbations.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aammonia 3adevelopmental stages 3agenes 3aoxidative stress 3aphenotype 3arecombinant proteins 3agene expression 3aenzymatic reactions 3ahomeostasis 3acysteine 3aleaves 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3atranscription factors 3atransfer DNA 3amutation 3aantioxidants 3abiosynthesis 3acystathionine gamma-lyase 3aplastids 3amutants 3asulfides 3abacteria 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCarbon-Oxygen Lyasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCystathionine gamma-Lyasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCysteinexmetabolism 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aHomeostasis 2aMutagenesis, Insertional. 2aOxidative Stress 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aSulfatesxmetabolism 0asenescence1 aCalo, Leticia1 aRomero, Luis C.1 aGarcía, Irene.1 aGotor, Cecilia0 tPlant physiology.g2010 Feb., v. 152, no. 2 p.656-669dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.109.1479753Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04083naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002100181245014300202300001800345500002400363506007600387520166400463506003702127650003002164650002502194650002202219650002302241650001002264650002402274650001102298650001702309650001002326650000902336650001102345650000902356650001402365650003102379650002102410650001602431650001302447650001402460650001202474650003302486650004202519650003702561650002802598650002102626650003802647650001102685650002302696650000902719650002302728650001502751650002802766650003402794650001702828650004902845650003702894650005402931700002302985700002103008700002203029700001803051700001903069700002003088773011603108852000903224856008003233655001203313IND4435536020221207111726.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443553602DNAL7 a201767972pmid7 aPMC28634942pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.01142-092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSukumar, Neelima10aCross-Species Protection Mediated by a Bordetella bronchiseptica Strain Lacking Antigenic Homologs Present in Acellular Pertussis Vaccines  ap. 2008-2016.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Bordetella species are Gram-negative bacterial pathogens that are characterized by long-term colonization of the mammalian respiratory tract and are causative agents of respiratory diseases in humans and animals. Despite widespread and efficient vaccination, there has been a world-wide resurgence of pertussis, which remains the leading cause of vaccine-preventable death in developed countries. It has been proposed that current acellular vaccines (Pa) composed of only a few bacterial proteins may be less efficacious because of vaccine-induced antigenic shifts and adaptations. To gain insight into the development of a newer generation of vaccines, we constructed a Bordetella bronchiseptica strain (LPaV) that does not express the antigenic homologs included in any of the Pa vaccines currently in use. This strain also lacks adenylate cyclase toxin, an essential virulence factor, and BipA, a surface protein. While LPaV colonized the mouse nose as efficiently as the wild-type strain, it was highly deficient in colonization of the lower respiratory tract and was attenuated in induction of inflammation and injury to the lungs. Strikingly, to our surprise, we found that in an intranasal murine challenge model, LPaV elicited cross-species protection against both B. bronchiseptica and Bordetella pertussis. Our data suggest the presence of immunogenic protective components other than those included in the pertussis vaccine. Combined with the whole-genome sequences of many Bordetella spp. that are available, the results of this study should serve as a platform for strategic development of the next generation of acellular pertussis vaccines.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBordetella bronchiseptica 3aBordetella pertussis 3aadenylate cyclase 3abacterial proteins 3adeath 3adeveloped countries 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3alungs 3amice 3amodels 3anose 3apathogens 3arespiratory tract diseases 3asurface proteins 3avaccination 3avaccines 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxblood 2aBordetella bronchisepticaximmunology 2aBordetella pertussisximmunology 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aCross Protection 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFemale 2aHistocytochemistry 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMicroscopy 2aOpsonin Proteinsxblood 2aPertussis Vaccineximmunology 2aPhagocytosis 2aRespiratory Systemxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aVaccines, Attenuatedximmunology 2aWhooping Coughximmunologyxprevention & control.1 aSloan, Gina Parise1 aConover, Matt S.1 aLove, Cheraton F.1 aMattoo, Seema1 aKock, Nancy D.1 aDeora, Rajendar0 tInfection and immunity.g2010 May, v. 78, no. 5 p.2008-2016dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01142-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02906naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245018300201300001800384500002400402506007600426520121300502506003701715650002501752650001901777650001801796650002101814650001101835650001701846650002201863650003701885650001901922650002601941650003601967650001702003700001902020700001702039700001902056700002002075700001802095700001802113700001502131700001802146700001902164773011602183852000902299856008002308655001202388IND4435536220221207111722.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443553622DNAL7 a10.1128/IAI.00118-102doi7 aPMC28635502pmcid7 a202314112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoon, Young Mee10aBacteroides fragilis Enterotoxin Induces Human β-Defensin-2 Expression in Intestinal Epithelial Cells via a Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase/IκB Kinase/NF-κB-Dependent Pathway  ap. 2024-2033.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEnterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) produces an approximately 20-kDa heat-labile enterotoxin (BFT) that plays an essential role in mucosal inflammation. Although spontaneous disappearance of ETBF infection is common, little information is available on regulated expression of antibacterial factors in response to BFT stimulation. This study investigates the role of BFT in human β-defensin 2 (hBD-2) induction from intestinal epithelial cells. Stimulation of HT-29 and Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cell lines with BFT resulted in the induction of hBD-2. Activation of a reporter gene for hBD-2 was dependent on the presence of NF-κB binding sites. In contrast, suppression of AP-1 did not affect hBD-2 expression in BFT-stimulated cells. Inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) using SB203580 and small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection resulted in a significant reduction in BFT-induced IκB kinase (IKK)/NF-κB activation and hBD-2 expression. Our results suggest that a pathway including p38 MAPK, IKK, and NF-κB activation is required for hBD-2 induction in intestinal epithelial cells exposed to BFT, and may be involved in the host defense following infection with ETBF.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacteroides fragilis 3aIKappaB kinase 3abinding sites 3aepithelial cells 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3aintestinal mucosa 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3areporter genes 3asmall interfering RNA 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atransfection1 aLee, Jin Young1 aYoo, Doyoung1 aSim, Young-Suk1 aKim, Young-Jeon1 aOh, Yu-Kyoung1 aKang, Ju Seop1 aKim, Sunil1 aKim, Joo Sung1 aKim, Jung Mogg0 tInfection and immunity.g2010 May, v. 78, no. 5 p.2024-2033dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.00118-103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02669naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002200110040001800132100001400150245014600164300001400310500001500324520076600339650003101105650002801136650001001164650001701174650001601191650001401207650001901221650001001240650002301250650002801273650001201301650001101313650002701324650002801351650001601379650001201395650001601407650003001423650003801453650001101491650001801502650003301520650002601553650000901579650002101588650003001609650001401639653001101653653002001664653002201684653001501706653001601721653002901737653002801766700001301794700001701807700001301824773006601837852000901903930003301912945001301945946001301958655001201971IND2036863520221118221540.0940125e199309  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203686352DNAL7 a82248292pmid7 aPMC12056282pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorok, T.10aP-lacW insertional mutagenesis on the second chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster: isolation of lethals with different overgrowth phenotypes  ap. 71-80.  a2019-12-05  aA single P-element insertional mutagenesis experiment was carried out for the second chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster using the P-lacW transposon. Out of 15,475 insertions on the second chromosome, 2,308 lethal and 403 semilethal mutants (altogether 2,711) were recovered. After eliminating clusters, 72% of the mutants represent independent insertions. Some of the mutants with larval, prepupal or pupal lethal phases have a prolonged larval period and show gradual overgrowth of the imaginal discs, brain and/or the hematopoietic organs (lymph glands). In this paper, 16 overgrowth mutants are described. As revealed by in situ hybridization, none of the mutations corresponds to any of the previously known overgrowth mutations on the second chromosome. 3anucleic acid hybridization 3ainsertional mutagenesis 3apupae 3alethal genes 3achromosomes 3aphenotype 3aimaginal discs 3abrain 3achromosome mapping 3agenetic complementation 3amutants 3alarvae 3abiological development 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3atransposons 2aAnimals 2aChromosomes 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGenes, Lethal 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aMale 2aMultigene Family 2aMutagenesis, Insertional. 2aPhenotype 0agrowth 0ahemolymph nodes 0arecessive lethals 0abody parts 0amutagenesis 0achromosome rearrangement 0achromosome polymorphism1 aTick, G.1 aAlvarado, M.1 aKiss, I.0 tGenetics.g1993 Sept., v. 135, no. 1 p.71-80x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a19940202b19940204c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02518naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001900142245012400161300001600285500002400301520100300325650002001328650001301348650001701361650001801378650003001396650001601426650002601442650001301468650002301481650001701504650001301521650003201534650002201566650001601588650001901604650004401623650001001667700002201677700001801699700001901717700001901736700001801755700002301773700002001796773010501816852000901921856008201930655001202012IND4435306220221118221614.0100409s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443530622DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2009002272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaruna, Michal10aIsolation, structure elucidation and biological activity of angucycline antibiotics from an epiphytic yew streptomycete  ap. 135-142.  aIncludes references  aIn the course of study of epiphytic microorganisms occurring on the surface of roots of Taxus baccata L. a new strain Streptomyces sp.

This strain cultivated in an arginine glycerol medium produced three major metabolites identified as (-)-8-O -methyltetrangomycin (1), 8-O -methyltetrangulol (2) and 8-O -methyl-7-deoxo-7-hydroxytetrangomycin (3). The chemical structures of these angucyclines were elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR as well as by mass spectrometry. Isolated angucycline metabolites showed significant antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus and Listeria mocytogenes. Cytotoxic activities of compounds 1, 2 and 3 against four cell lines (B16, HT-29 and non - tumor V79, L929) were evaluated.

The objective of this work was to determine the effects of different carbon and nitrogen sources on the growth and bacteriocin production of this microorganism. A fractional factorial design 3⁵⁻¹ was applied to evaluate the effects of five nutrients (glucose, lactose, yeast extract, tryptone and meat peptone), at three different concentrations (0, 1 and 2%). Results were statistically analyzed for linear and quadratic effects of nutrients, along with their interactions. All the nutrients tested stimulated the cell growth and bacteriocin production, but lactose had not a significant influence on the last response. The linear effects of higher magnitude on biomass and bacteriocin production were those of yeast extract and tryptone. The results demonstrated that there were significant interactions between the different nutrients, depending on the response evaluated. Maximum bacteriocin production was reached in different growth media with a lower cost than conventional culture media used in the laboratory. These findings will contribute to the design of a pharmaceutical product for the restoration of ecological balance of urogenital tract. (© 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The P cytotype, which represses transposition and associated phenomena, exhibits both a maternal effect and maternal inheritance. The genetic and molecular mechanisms of this regulation are complex and not yet fully understood. In a previous study, using P-lacZ fusion genes, we have shown that P element regulatory products were able to inhibit the activity of the P promoter in somatic tissues. However, the repression observed did not exhibit the maternal effect characteristic of the P cytotype. With a similar approach, we have assayed in vivo the effect of P element regulatory products in the germline. We show that the P cytotype is able to repress the P promoter in the germline as well as in the soma. Furthermore, this repression exhibits a maternal effect restricted to the germline. On the basis of these new observations, we propose a model for the mechanism of P cytotype repression and its maternal inheritance. 3amaternal effect 3apromoter regions 3arecombinant DNA 3agerm cells 3ainsertional mutagenesis 3abeta-galactosidase 3agene expression 3ahistochemistry 3areporter genes 3atestes 3acytoplasmic inheritance 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3atransposons 2aAnimals 2aDNAxgenetics 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aLac Operon 2aMale 2aOvaryxenzymology 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic. 2aTestisxenzymology 2abeta-Galactosidasexgenetics 0alacz gene 0agenetic regulation 0atransposition 0aovaries 0agenetic change 0amaternal inheritance1 aRonsseray, S.1 aCoen, D.0 tGenetics.g1993 Sept., v. 135, no. 1 p.149-160x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a19940202b19940204c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01586naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245009700171300001600268500002400284520074500308650001301053650001401066650001901080773013901099852000901238856008501247655001201332IND4435276620221118221400.0100409s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443527662DNAL7 a10.1134/S106235901002007X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMamkaev, I︠U︡.

Four steps are distinguished in the evolution of biological systems: (1) formation of morphofunctional system by units of the lower structural level, (2) polymerization of morphofunctional units of a system, (3) oligomerization of morphofunctional units of system by means of their reduction, uniting, or differentiation, (4) integration and stabilization of a system owing to development of morphofunctional connections between its parts. 3aProtozoa 3aevolution 3apolymerization0 tBiology bulletin of the Russian Academy of Sciences.g2010 Apr., v. 37, no. 2 p.138-145dSP MAIK Nauka/Interperiodicax1062-35907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S106235901002007X3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01507naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245012500164300001600289500002400305520051200329650002300841650001000864650001400874700001900888700002200907700002100929700002200950773013900972852000901111856008501120655001201205IND4435276920221118221617.0100409s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443527692DNAL7 a10.1134/S106235901002010X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKulikov, A.

  1 aČermák, J.10aTree water storage and its diurnal dynamics related to sap flow and changes in stem volume in old-growth Douglas-fir trees  ap. 181-198.  a2019-12-04  aDiurnal and seasonal tree water storage was studied in three large Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) trees at the Wind River Canopy Crane Research site. Changes in water storage were based on measurements of sap flow and changes in stem volume and tissue water content at different heights in the stem and branches. We measured sap flow by two variants of the heat balance method (with internal heating in stems and external heating in branches), stem volume with electronic dendrometers, and tissue water content gravimetrically. Water storage was calculated from the differences in diurnal courses of sap flow at different heights and their integration. Old-growth Douglas-fir trees contained large amounts of free water: stem sapwood was the most important storage site, followed by stem phloem, branch sapwood, branch phloem and needles. There were significant time shifts (minutes to hours) between sap flow measured at different positions within the transport system (i.e., stem base to shoot tip), suggesting a highly elastic transport system. On selected fine days between late July and early October, when daily transpiration ranged from 150 to 300 liters, the quantity of stored water used daily ranged from 25 to 55 liters, i.e., about 20% of daily total sap flow. The greatest amount of this stored water came from the lower stem; however, proportionally more water was removed from the upper parts of the tree relative to their water storage capacity. In addition to lags in sap flow from one point in the hydrolic pathway to another, the withdrawal and replacement of stored water was reflected in changes in stem volume. When point-to-point lags in sap flow (minutes to hours near the top and stem base, respectively) were considered, there was a strong linear relationship between stem volume changes and transpiration. Volume changes of the whole tree were small (equivalent to 14% of the total daily use of stored water) indicating that most stored water came from the stem and from its inelastic (sapwood) tissues. Whole tree transpiration can be maintained with stored water for about a week, but it can be maintained with stored water from the upper crown alone for no more than a few hours. 3amathematical models 3aforest trees 3astems 3atree age 3aequations 3asap flow 3adiurnal variation 3awater content 3aseasonal variation 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3ameasurement 2aCircadian Rhythmxphysiology 2aPlant Stemsxphysiology 2aPlant Transpirationxphysiology 2aPseudotsugaxphysiology 2aSeasons 2aTreesxphysiology 2aWaterxphysiology 0aWashington1 aKucera, J.1 aBauerle, W.L.1 aPhillips, N.q(Nahid)1 aHinckley, T.M.0 tTree physiology.g2007 Feb., v. 27, no. 2 p.181-198x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/27.2.1813Available from publisher's Web site  a20070816b20070902c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/08/16  aNon-US 7aarticle01938naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245017600165300001400341500002400355520069700379650002201076650001701098650001501115650001101130650001301141650001201154650003701166650001401203650001901217700002101236700002001257700002001277700002001297700001701317773012401334852000901458856008501467655001201552IND4435247420221118221126.0100409s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443524742DNAL7 a10.3103/S00963925100100372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBondarev, N.

I. Contrasts between the vermilion and forked loci  ap. 89-99.  a2019-12-05  aWe have surveyed three natural populations of Drosophila ananassae for restriction map variation at the forked (f) and vermilion (v) loci, using 6-cutter restriction enzymes. Both loci are located in the centromeric region of the X chromosome. Two major conclusions can be drawn from the data. First, we found strong evidence for population subdivision, i.e., significant differences in the frequency distributions of polymorphisms and/or haplotypes between the Burma, India, and Brazil populations. Secondly, the pattern of DNA sequence variation between the two loci is unexpectedly different. The level of nucleotide variation in the v locus region is reduced (relative to f), especially in the Burma population. Furthermore, in contrast to v, we found no insertions/deletions larger than 700 bp and no significant linkage disequilibrium at f. The genetic differentiation among subpopulations can readily be attributed to restricted migration as the predominant evolutionary force. According to population genetics theory, the differences in DNA polymorphisms between the two loci are in qualitative agreement with the hypothesis that recombination is reduced in the v locus region ("centromere effect") but not at f. In order to test this hypothesis directly, we determined the cytogenetic positions of several loci in the centromeric region by in situ hybridization and found by comparison with the genetic map that recombination at v is indeed very low, much lower than at f. 3acytogenetic analysis 3aDNA 3agenetic variation 3aDrosophila 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aCentromere 2aChromosomes 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDrosophilaxgenetics 2aGenetics, Population 2aHaplotypes 2aMutation 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSpecies Specificity 2aX Chromosome 0achromosome polymorphism 0agenetic techniques and protocols1 aLangley, C.H.0 tGenetics.g1989, v. 121, no. 1 p.89-99x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02943naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198100001600215245010600231300001600337500001500353520140200368650002401770650001701794650001401811650002501825650001301850650001801863650002201881650002301903650001201926650001601938650001301954650002801967650001401995650003602009650002202045650002202067651001002089653001002099700001302109700001602122700001502138773007302153852000902226856008502235930003302320945002502353946001102378655001202389IND4389143120221118221153.0070319e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438914312DNAL7 a172419592pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/27.2.1612doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Don) forest from sap flow measurements of individual trees. Measurements of tree biometrics (diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree sapwood area (AS_tree)), and tree-to-tree and radial variations in xylem sap flux density (Fd) were made in two stand plots, an upper slope plot (UP) and a lower slope plot (LP), during a growing season characterized by significant variations in environmental factors. We then investigated how mean stand sap flux density (JS) and a tree stem allometric relationship (DBH-AS_tree) varied between the stands. Appropriate sample sizes for estimating representative JS values were determined. Both a unique and a general function allowed description of the allometric relationship along the slope, but the data for its formulation was required for both the UP and LP. Values of JS in the UP and LP were similar during the study period despite differences in tree density and size between the plots, implying that JS measured in a partial stand in a watershed is a reasonable estimate of JS in other stands in the watershed, and that stand sapwood area calculated from AS_tree is a strong determinant of water use in a forest watershed. To estimate JS in both the UP and LP, it was necessary to sample at least 10 trees in each plot. 3amathematical models 3aforest trees 3aequations 3aCryptomeria japonica 3asap flow 3atranspiration 3adiurnal variation 3aseasonal variation 3asapwood 3ameasurement 2aAltitude 2aCryptomeriaxphysiology 2aEcosystem 2aPlant Transpirationxphysiology 2aTreesxphysiology 2aXylemxphysiology 3aJapan 0axylem1 aAoki, S.1 aShimizu, T.1 aOtsuki, K.0 tTree physiology.g2007 Feb., v. 27, no. 2 p.161-168x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/27.2.1613Available from publisher's Web site  a20070816b20070902c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/08/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03573naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002200110040001800132100002100150245011300171300001600284500001500300520182100315650001702136650001402153650002102167650002002188650002002208650002902228650002802257650001202285650002302297650003202320650002102352650005502373650001102428650002302439650002002462650000902482650002102491650001602512650001402528650002702542650003302569650003302602653001602635653001602651653001402667653001402681653002002695653001602715653001402731700001802745700001902763700001902782773006602801852000902867930003302876945001302909946001302922655001202935IND2038475420221118222043.0940404e199305  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203847542DNAL7 a85141322pmid7 aPMC12054262pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPokholkova, G.V.10aObservations on the induction of position effect variegation of euchromatic genes in Drosophila melanogaster  ap. 231-242.  a2019-12-05  aIn the T(1;2)dor(var7) translocation, the 1A-2B7-8 segment of the X chromosome is brought to the vicinity of 2R-chromosome heterochromatin resulting in position effect variegation of dor, BR-C and more distal genes, as well as compaction of chromatin in this segment. By irradiation of T(1;2)dor(var7), nine reversions (rev) to a normal phenotype were recovered. In two cases (rev27, rev226), the 1A-2B7-8 section is relocated to the 19A region of the X chromosome, forming free duplications (1A-2B7-8/19A-20F-X-het). Modifiers of position effect do not change the normal expression of the BR-C C and dor genes in these duplications. In five reversions (rev3, rev40, rev60, rev167, rev175), free duplications have formed from the 1A-2B7-8 fragment and X chromosome heterochromatin. In these rearrangements, modifiers of position effect (low temperature, removal of Y and 2R-chromosome heterochromatin and a genetic enhancer (E-var(3)201) induce position-effect again. Two reversions (rev45 and rev110) are associated with additional inversions in the original dor(var7) chromosomes. The inversions relocate part of the heterochromatin adjacent to the 1A-2B7-8 section into new positions. In T(1;2)dor(rev45), position-effect is seen in the 2B7-8-7A element as compaction spreading from 2B7-8 proximally in some cases as far as the 5D region. Thus, in rev45 the pattern of euchromatin compaction is reciprocal to that of the initial dor(var7) strain. Apparently, it is due to the same variegation-evoking center near the 2R centromere in both cases. In all nine revertants, weakening or complete disappearance of the position-effect is observed despite retention of the 20-kb heterochromatic segment adjacent to the LA-2B7-8 region. Thus, a 20-kb heterochromatic sequence does not inactivate euchromatin joined to it. 3aX chromosome 3aautosomes 3agene interaction 3agene expression 3aheterochromatin 3achromosome translocation 3aDrosophila melanogaster 2aAnimals 2aChromosome Banding 2aChromosomesxultrastructure 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgeneticsxultrastructure. 2aFemale 2aGene Rearrangement 2aHeterochromatin 2aMale 2aMultigene Family 2aMutagenesis 2aPhenotype 2aTranslocation, Genetic 2aX Chromosomexultrastructure 2aY Chromosomexultrastructure 0aduplication 0aeuchromatin 0amodifiers 0achromatin 0aposition effect 0avariegation 0ainversion1 aMakunin, I.V.1 aBelyaeva, E.S.1 aZhimulev, I.F.0 tGenetics.g1993 May, v. 134, no. 1 p.231-242x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02054naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002500110245006300135300001600198500010800214520097400322650002201296650001301318650001101331650001701342650002201359650001401381650001001395650001501405650001001420651001201430651001101442651001801453700001601471773014501487856005101632852000901683655001201692IND4502404820221118221257.0150202e20141029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450240482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorocko-Bicevska, I.10aFire blight in Latvia: occurrence, management and problems  ap. 133-136.  aPaper presented XIII International Workshop on Fire Blight held on July 2-5, 2013, Zurich (Switzerland)  aFire blight, caused by Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winslow et al., is one of the most destructive and invasive diseases of commercial pear and apple, as well as ornamentals in the Rosaceae family. This pathogen is endemic to North America and was first detected in England over 50 years ago. Owing to this, it has spread and established itself throughout most European countries despite quarantine, restrictions on moving plant material, and eradication actions. Since 2004 a protected zone status for E. amylovora has been in effect for the whole territory of Latvia. The first fire blight outbreak in Latvia occurred in 2007 and was detected in 26 localities. Strict eradication actions were applied to infected zones in 2007, whereby more than 2,500 trees in commercial and home gardens were eradicated. Eradication continued and in 2012 no positive cases were detected by NPPO but in 2013 the disease was detected in eight locations in different parts of the country. 3aErwinia amylovora 3aRosaceae 3aapples 3ahome gardens 3aornamental plants 3apathogens 3apears 3aquarantine 3atrees 3aEngland 3aLatvia 3aNorth America1 aMaldute, S.0 tActa horticulturae.g2014 Oct. 29, , no. 1056 p.133-136dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1056/1056_19.htm  aDNAL 7aarticle02165naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007400126300001600200500010800216520093800324650002401262650002201286650000901308650001601317650001301333650003001346650001401376650001401390650002601404650001201430650001501442650001701457650001401474700001601488700001701504700001401521700001501535773014501550856005101695852000901746655001201755IND4502404320221118221445.0150202e20141029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450240432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuebert, C.10aDevelopment of antagonistic bacteria for field control of fire blight  ap. 107-110.  aPaper presented XIII International Workshop on Fire Blight held on July 2-5, 2013, Zurich (Switzerland)  aFlower infections caused by Erwinia amylovora can be prevented only during the short period of epiphytic colonization. Bacterial antagonists like Erwinia tasmaniensis and Bacillus spp. are able to repress E. amylovora growth at this initial stage and prevent further intrusion of the pathogen. They can be applied as biological control agents if a suitable formulation can be produced. To investigate inhibitory effects of different antagonists and dried formulations, we used several test systems in the laboratory, including co-cultivation experiments, agar diffusion assay and detached-flower assays. A luminescent reporter strain of E. amylovora was used to distinguish between pathogen and antagonist growth. In laboratory studies, application of dry formulations was as efficient as with antagonists derived from batch culture. Samples from test-formulations were also applied in field trials according to EPPO guideline 1/166. 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aErwinia amylovora 3aagar 3aantagonists 3abacteria 3abiological control agents 3acoculture 3aepiphytes 3afield experimentation 3aflowers 3aguidelines 3aluminescence 3apathogens1 aWensing, A.1 aJelkmann, W.1 aJunge, H.1 aDietel, K.0 tActa horticulturae.g2014 Oct. 29, , no. 1056 p.107-110dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1056/1056_14.htm  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245011000123300001600233500010800249500001500357520147600372650001201848650002201860650001101882650002301893650001101916650001401927650001401941650001301955650001401968650001001982650002001992650003002012650001802042650001202060650003202072650002802104650001302132653003002145700001502175700001102190700001502201773014502216856005102361852000902412655001202421IND4502405220221118221422.0150202e20141029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450240522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Y.12aAnalternative sigma factor cascade regulates expression of type III secretion system in Erwinia Amylovora  ap. 155-160.  aPaper presented XIII International Workshop on Fire Blight held on July 2-5, 2013, Zurich (Switzerland)  a2019-12-04  aIn bacteria, gene expression is mainly regulated at the transcription initiation level and its core RNA polymerase (RNAP) requires sigma factors for promoter recognition and initiation. In Erwinia amylovora, alternative sigma factor HrpL-RNAP complex regulates the transcription of hrp-type III secretion (T3SS) genes by binding to a consensus sequence known as the hrp box in hrp gene promoters. In turn, expression of hrpL has been proposed to be positively controlled by another alternative sigma factor, sigma 54 (RpoN), and HrpS, a member of Ï54 enhancer-binding proteins (EBPs). However, the function of both HrpS and RpoN has not been genetically characterized in E. amylovora. In this study, we examined an alternative sigma factor cascade with an emphasis on components of HrpS-RpoN-RNAP complex in regulating T3SS gene expression in E. amylovora. Results showed mutations in hrpS, hrpL, rpoN and yhbH, but not rpoS, another alternative sigma factor, resulted in non-pathogenic phenotype on apple and immature pear fruits, and no hypersensitive response on non-host tobacco, suggesting that HrpL, HrpS, RpoN, and YhbH, a novel ribosome-binding protein, are essential for virulence and absolutely required for T3SS gene expression in E. amylovora. We also determined the regulons of both HrpS and HrpL in vivo using oligo array. These results suggest that an alternative sigma factor cascade in E. amylovora regulates expression of T3SS and controls virulence. 3aregulon 3aErwinia amylovora 3aapples 3aconsensus sequence 3afruits 3aphenotype 3asecretion 3amutation 3avirulence 3apears 3agene expression 3atype III secretion system 3asigma factors 3atobacco 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3ahypersensitive response 3abacteria 0aType III secretion system1 aAncona, V.1 aLi, W.1 aLee, J.

Mutations in the forked locus alter this structure and result in aberrant development of macrochaetae, microchaetae and trichomes. The locus has been characterized at the molecular level by walking, mutant characterization and transcript analysis. Expression of the six forked transcripts is temporally restricted to midlate pupal development. At this time, RNAs of 6.4, 5.6, 5.4, 2.5, 1.9 and 1.1 kilobases (kb) are detected by Northern analysis. The coding region of these RNAs has been found to be within a 21-kb stretch of genomic DNA. The amino terminus of the proteins encoded by the 5.4- and 5.6-kb forked transcripts contain tandem copies of ankyrin-like repeats that may play an important role in the function of forked-encoded products. The profile of forked RNA expression is altered in seven spontaneous mutations characterized during this study. Three forked mutations induced by the insertion of the gypsy retrotransposon contain a copy of this element inserted into an intron of the gene. In these mutants, the 5.6-, 5.4- and 2.5-kb forked mRNAs are truncated via recognition of the polyadenylation site in the 5' long terminal repeat of the gypsy retrotransposon. These results help explain the role of the forked gene in fly development and further our understanding of the role of transposable elements in mutagenesis. 3aretrotransposons 3amessenger RNA 3ainsertional mutagenesis 3aloci 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3aphenotype 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3asetae (animal) 3atranscription (genetics) 3aexons 3aintrons 3aDrosophila melanogaster 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAnkyrinsxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aConsensus Sequence 2aDNAxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aDrosophila Proteins 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgeneticsxultrastructure. 2aGene Expression 2aInsect Hormonesxgenetics 2aMicrofilament Proteins 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Insertional. 2aPhenotype 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTranscription, Genetic 0amolecular sequence data 0aforked locus 0agenetic regulation 0amutagenesis 0amutation 0aspontaneous mutations 0agenbank/x69871 0anucleotide sequences1 aChien, A.J.1 aCorces, V.G.0 tGenetics.g1993 Oct., v. 135, no. 2 p.507-526x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01249naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002200115245004300137300001600180500001500196520047200211650002600683650001500709650002600724650002000750653002500770773007600795852001300871939003300884945000800917946001300925852000900938655001200947991561235770742620221118221054.0880725e198711  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880022392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajagopalan, K.V.10aMolybdenum--an essential trace element  ap. 321-328.  a2019-12-04  aThe essential functional role of the trace element molybdenum (Mo) in the activity of several key enzymes is discussed.

In the present work, we have further investigated the implicit effects of chromosomal lesions on progression through meiosis by exposing yeast cells to X-irradiation at various times during sporulation. We find that exposure of RAD9 cells to X-irradiation early in meiosis prevents sporulation, arresting the cells at a stage prior to premeiotic DNA replication. rad9 meiotic cells are much less responsive to X-irradiation damage, completing sporulation after treatment with doses sufficient to cause arrest of RAD9 strains. These findings thereby reveal a RAD9-dependent checkpoint function in meiosis that is distinct from the G2 arrest previously shown to result from cdc13 dysfunction. Analysis of the spores that continued to be produced by either RAD9 or rad9 cultures that were X-irradiated in later stages of sporulation revealed most spores to be viable, even after exposure to radiation doses sufficient to kill most vegetative cells. This finding demonstrates that the lesions induced by X-irradiation at later times fail to trigger the checkpoint function revealed by cdc13 arrest and suggests that the lesions may be subject to repair by serving as intermediates in the recombination process. Strains mutant for chromosomal synapsis and recombination, and therefore defective in meiotic disjunction, were tested for evidence that X-ray-induced lesions might alleviate inviability by promoting recombination. Enhancement of spore viability when spo11 (but not hop1) diploids were X-irradiated during meiosis indicates that induced lesions may partially substitute for SPO11-dependent functions that are required for the initiation of recombination. 3aDNA replication 3asporulation 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3agenes 3agenetic recombination 3ameiosis 3aX-radiation 2aGenes, Fungalxradiation effects 2aMeiosisxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aMutation 2aRecombination, Geneticxradiation effects 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexcytologyxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aSpores, Fungalxradiation effects 0adna modification 0adna lesions 0acell division 0arad9 gene 0acell cycle1 aByers, B.0 tGenetics.g1993 May, v. 134, no. 1 p.29-42x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01426naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001900133245005900152300001600211520052700227650001400754650001200768650001300780650004200793650001100835650001100846650002400857650002600881650001400907773010400921852000901025939003301034945000801067946001301075655001201088991561235120742620221118221409.0880729e198712  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880023722DNAL7 a33165842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPicciano, M.F.10aInsulin-dependent diabetes and lactational performance  ap. 838-840.  aA brief report discusses the effect of insulin-dependent diabetes on human and animal maternal lactational performance.

In the parasitoid wasp Nasonia, incompatibility results in improper condensation and fragmentation of the paternal chromosomes in fertilized eggs. Some form of genome imprinting may be involved. Because of haplodiploidy, incompatibility results in conversion of (diploid) female eggs into (haploid) males. Experiments show that bacterial density is correlated with compatibility differences between male and female Nasonia. Males from strains with high bacterial numbers are incompatible with females from strains with lower numbers. Temporal changes in compatibility of females after tetracycline treatment are generally correlated with decreases in bacterial levels in eggs. However, complete loss of bacteria in mature eggs precedes conversion of eggs to the "asymbiont" compatibility type by 3-4 days. This result is consistent with a critical "imprinting" period during egg maturation, when cytoplasmic bacteria determine compatibility. Consequent inheritance of reduced bacterial numbers in F1 progeny has different effects on compatibility type of subsequent male vs. female progeny. In some cases, partial incompatibility occurs which results in reduced offspring numbers, apparently due to incomplete paternal chromosome elimination resulting in aneuploidy. 3aNasonia vitripennis 3acytoplasmic inheritance 3aWolbachia 3asymbionts 3asexual reproduction 3astrains 3aplate count 3aova 3ahaploidy 3adiploidy 3achromosome elimination 3amales 3afemales 2aAnimals 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aCytoplasmxphysiology 2aFemale 2aMale 2aReproductionxgenetics 2aSpecies Specificity 2aWaspsxgeneticsxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 0aincompatibility 0ahaplodiploidy 0apartial incompatibility1 aWerren, J.H.0 tGenetics.g1993 Oct., v. 135, no. 2 p.565-574x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01327naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245006300133300001400196520048500210650001300695650002200708650002300730650002100753651001300774700001500787700001500802700001800817700002000835773008300855852000900938939003300947945000800980946001300988655001201001991561218730742620221118220930.0880802e198801  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880024192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFunnell, M.M.10aDevelopment of a curriculum for type II diabetes education  ap. 40-45.  aThe experience and characteristics of a curriculum is discussed, developed by the Michigan Diabetes Research and Training Center, to educate diabetes patients and to aid diabetes educators.

Lessons from this experience can benefit future efforts. Apparent problems related, for example, to data, methodology, feasibility, and clarity have hindered the implementation and monitoring of progress on several goals. A major step toward improvement is the development of standard criteria for evaluating proposed objectives. Dietitians and nutritionists have a special interest and responsibility in developing the National Nutrition Objectives for the Year 2000. They also have special opportunities for integrating current and future nutrition objectives into programs at the state and local levels.(author) 3adietitians 3anutritionists 3afood and nutrition programs 3aobjectives 3anational planning 2aHealth Promotionxtrends 2aNutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aPrimary Prevention 2aPublic Policy 2aResearch 0aUnited States1 aStephenson, M.G.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g1987 Dec., v. 87, no. 12 p.1665-1667x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19880816c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02072naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007100126300001600197520094200213650001901155650002001174650002201194650002701216650002401243650002201267650001501289650001301304650001301317650001401330650001501344651001001359653001401369653001101383653001501394653001501409700001601424700001501440700001301455773009201468852000901560930003301569945001301602946001101615655001201626IND2205233620221118221148.0000613e199412  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220523362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsumura, Y.10aGeographical clines of chloroplast DNA variation in Abies mariesii  ap. 922-926.  aWhere its populations are isolated in higher mountain regions, Abies mariesii is one of the more important conifers of Japan's alpine forest zone. In this study we tried to clarify the genetic variation of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) in A. mariesii. Cones and fresh needles were collected from seven mountain regions. Total DNAs were extracted from individual seedlings, and these were digested by 15 restriction endonucleases. Southern hybridization was then done using cpDNA clones of Cryptomeria japonica and tobacco as probes. CpDNA variation was detected with enzyme-probe combinations: HindIII+pCS10 probe, HindIII+pCS7, and BglII+pCS7 in preliminary screening. These variations were considered to be caused by the same insertion, deletion or inversion. All populations surveyed for the combination HindIII+pCS10 resulted in only two frequency variations in each population. This indicates a gradual cline along latitude and longitude. 3aAbies mariesii 3achloroplast DNA 3agenetic variation 3ageographical variation 3arestriction mapping 3aSouthern blotting 3aDNA probes 3alatitude 3amutation 3alongitude 3apopulation 3aJapan 0adeletions 0aclines 0ainsertions 0ainversions1 aTaguchi, H.1 aSuyama, Y.1 aOhba, K.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1994 Dec., v. 89, no. 7/8 p.922-926x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03107naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001600141245010700157300001800264500001500282520191200297650001402209650001602223650002302239650000902262650001302271650001402284650001002298650001202308650002102320650001602341653000902357700001602366700001602382700001902398773010702417852000902524856008102533930003302614945002502647946001302672655001202685IND4367904120221118221140.0050324s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436790412DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-1200375532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParvizi, Y.10aGrowth, nutrient status, and chlorophyll meter readings in wheat as affected by nitrogen and manganese  ap. 1387-1399.  a2019-12-04  aMineral nutrition of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in highly calcareous soils low in available nitrogen (N) and manganese (Mn) requires further investigations. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effect of N and Mn on the growth, nutrient concentration and uptake, and chlorophyll meter readings (CMR) in wheat grown in greenhouse conditions. The experiment was conducted on a highly calcareous soil (fine-loamy, carbonatic, thermic, Typic Calcixerepts) relatively low in available N and Mn. Treatments consisted of a factorial arrangement of five N rates (0, 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg kg(-1) as NH4NO3) and three Mn levels (0, 15, and 30 mg kg(-1) as MnSO4) in a completely randomized design with four replications. Plants were grown for 60 d and hand-held chlorophyll meter (Minolta SPAD-502) readings were used to evaluate dry matter (DMY) and N, Mn, iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu) concentration of wheat in aerial parts. Applied N increased DMY and concentration and uptake of N, Mn, Fe, Zn, and Cu, and Mn:Fe ratios. A significant correlation was obtained between DMY and applied N (R2 = 0.75). Manganese had no significant effect on DMY, N, Zn, Cu concentration and uptake, and Fe uptake. However, Mn rate increased Mn concentration and uptake and Mn:Fe ratio and reduced Fe concentration. Interaction of N x Mn did not affect DMY, concentration, or uptake of any of the nutrients. The CMR increased significantly with N rate but was not influenced by Mn addition. Highly significant correlations were observed between CMR and DMY (R2 = 0.84), and the concentrations of N (R2 = 0.97), Mn (R2 = 0.70), Fe (R2 = 0.73), Zn (R2 = 0.93), and Cu (R2 = 0.90). It is concluded that portable chlorophyll meter is a quick, reliable, and nondestructive tool for assessing DMY and nutrients affecting leaf greenness in wheat. However, further investigation in field conditions is recommended. 3amanganese 3acorrelation 3ameters (equipment) 3azinc 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3awheat 3areading 3acalcareous soils 3achlorophyll 0asoil1 aRonaghi, A.1 aMaftoun, M.1 aKarimian, N.A.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2004, v. 35, no. 9-10 p.1387-1399x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-1200375533Available from publisher's Web site  a20110315b20110402c00000000  aINDdTEMeCRN 2011/0  aOther US 7aarticle03011naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001700141245011200158300001500270520180200285650001902087650001402106650001502120650001802135650001802153650002002171650001802191650001102209650001202220650001402232650001202246650001502258700002302273700001402296700001502310773010302325852000902428856008102437930003302518945002502551946001302576655001202589IND4368020620221118221214.0050329s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436802062DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-1200276372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPorter, G.S.10aManganese solubility and phytotoxicity affected by soil moisture, oxygen levels, and green manure additions  ap. 99-116.  aManganese (Mn) toxicity is common in tropical acid soils, second only to aluminum toxicity. Changes in soil pH and redox potential (E(h)) caused by soil moisture conditions and organic amendments certainly affect Mn solubility and toxicity to plants grown in soils with high Mn reserves. Laboratory incubation and greenhouse experiments were conducted to quantify such effects using a high-Mn Oxisol and a moderate-Mn Mollisol from Hawaii, with soybean (Glycine max L. cv. Kahala) being a test crop. The soils were mixed with a green manure (leucaena leaf) at 0, 10, and 20 g kg(-1), and were incubated at 24+/-1 degrees C at 80% of field water holding capacity-equilibrated with air (FC), or N2 gas (N2)-or submerged under 8 cm of water. Soil pH, E(h), and soluble Mn as measured in saturated paste extract, Mehlich-3 and hydroxylamine hydrochloride (NH2OH) solutions were periodically determined over 56 days of incubation. The submergence and N2 treatments increased soil pH towards 7.0 and decreased soil E(h) from 600 mV to between 300 and 400 mV, indicating a more reducing environment, which seemed to be controlled by the MnO2-Mn(2+) and/or FeOOH-Fe(2+) redox couples. Green manure additions had similar effects, but to a lesser extent. Consequently, soluble soil Mn concentrations increased by 100-1000 fold relative to those of the controls (no manure, at FC). There was a marked decrease in soybean growth and a marked increase in leaf Mn concentration in the treatments of submergence and green manure additions. A 10% reduction in dry matter yield was expected when leaf Mn exceeded 200 mg kg(-1), leaf Ca/Mn (weight-to-weight) <80, saturated paste Mn>0.50 mg L(-1), Mehlich3 Mn>200 mg kg(-1), and NH2OH Mn>1100 mg kg(-1). The effects were most evident at 14-28 days after incubation. 3atropical soils 3amanganese 3asolubility 3asoil toxicity 3aphytotoxicity 3asoil amendments 3agreen manures 3aoxygen 3asoil pH 3aMollisols 3aOxisols 3asoil water1 aBajita-Locke, J.B.1 aHue, N.V.1 aStrand, D.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2004, v. 35, no. 1-2 p.99-116x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-1200276373Available from publisher's Web site  a20110402b20110507c00000000  aINDdTEMeCRN 2011/0  aOther US 7aarticle02204naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245013000131300001600261500001500277520079600292650001701088650002501105650002101130650003601151650002301187650002901210650001001239650002301249650003201272650001501304650001901319650002801338650002501366650004301391653002801434653001601462653001401478653001401492653001301506653002701519700001801546773009201564852000901656930003301665945001301698946001101711655001201722IND2205233120221118221615.0000613e199412  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220523312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStockinger, E.J.10aPto3 and Pto4: novel genes from Lycopersicon hirsutum var. glabratum that confer resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato  ap. 879-884.  a2019-12-05  aAccessions of wild Lycopersicon germplasm were screened for resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (Ps. tomato).

Resistance to race-0 derived from L. hirsutum var. glabratum (Pto3) appeared to be inherited independently of Pto1 and Pto2. Filial and backcross generations derived from interspecific crosses between L. esculentum and L. hirsutum var. glabratum revealed that Pto3 resistance was inherited in a complex fashion and was incompletely dominant under conditions of high bacteria inocula. Resistance to P.s. tomato race-1 (Pto4) was also identified in L. hirsutum var. glabratum. Pto3 and Pto4 segregated independently of each other. 3abackcrossing 3aSolanum habrochaites 3ainoculum density 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. tomato 3aSolanum peruvianum 3aSolanum pimpinellifolium 3agenes 3adisease resistance 3ainterspecific hybridization 3apathotypes 3awild relatives 3agenetic complementation 3aincomplete dominance 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0aexperimental infections 0asegregation 0apto4 gene 0apto3 gene 0agenotype 0ainheritance (genetics)1 aWalling, L.L.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1994 Dec., v. 89, no. 7/8 p.879-884x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01928naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245012100161300001400282500002400296520087500320650001501195650001901210650001901229650002401248650001301272650000901285650001501294650001001309700001901319700001701338700001901355773011001374852000901484856008501493655001201578IND4430461320221118221414.0091225s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443046132DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-009-0348-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKo, Hwi Jin10aSpecificity of odorant-binding proteins: a factor influencing the sensitivity of olfactory receptor-based biosensors  ap. 55-62.  aIncludes references  aOdorant-binding proteins (OBPs) primarily function in the transport of hydrophobic odorants. In this study, OBPs originating from rat and pig were cloned into a mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3, and expressed in HEK-293 cells, and their specificity for odorants and olfactory receptors was examined. Results suggest that OBPs have a high affinity for the olfactory receptors when both the OBP and receptor originate from the same species. The rat OBPs were bound not only to the rat olfactory receptor I7 but also to the odorant specific to I7. The solubility of the odorant was increased by both OBP2 and OBP3, which originate from rat, but with different efficiencies. These results demonstrate that OBPs specifically interact with odorants as well as olfactory receptors, and these interactions can influence the sensitivity of olfactory receptor-based biosensors. 3abiosensors 3ahydrophobicity 3aodor compounds 3aolfactory receptors 3aproteins 3arats 3asolubility 3aswine1 aYi, Sang-hŏn.1 aOh, Eun-hae.1 aPark, Tai Hyun0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2010 Jan., v. 33, no. 1 p.55-62dSpringer-Verlagx1615-75917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-009-0348-33Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02058naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245006700165300001300232500002400245520102700269650001501296650001201311650001701323650002001340650001801360650001001378650001401388650002001402650001301422650002101435650001401456700002301470773010901493852000901602856008501611655001201696IND4430461220221118221436.0091225s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443046122DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-009-0369-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSung, Jong Hwan10aIn vitro microscale systems for systematic drug toxicity study  ap. 5-19.  aIncludes references  aAfter administration, drugs go through a complex, dynamic process of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. The resulting time-dependent concentration, termed pharmacokinetics (PK), is critical to the pharmacological response from patients. An in vitro system that can test the dynamics of drug effects in a more systematic way would save time and costs in drug development. Integration of microfabrication and cell culture techniques has resulted in ‘cells-on-a-chip' technology, which is showing promise for high-throughput drug screening in physiologically relevant manner. In this review, we summarize current research efforts which ultimately lead to in vitro systems for testing drug's effect in PK-based manner. In particular, we highlight the contribution of microscale systems towards this goal. We envision that the ‘cells-on-a-chip' technology will serve as a valuable link between in vitro and in vivo studies, reducing the demand for animal studies, and making clinical trials more effective. 3aabsorption 3aanimals 3acell culture 3aclinical trials 3adrug toxicity 3adrugs 3aexcretion 3ain vivo studies 3apatients 3apharmacokinetics 3ascreening1 aShuler, Michael L.0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2010 Jan., v. 33, no. 1 p.5-19dSpringer-Verlagx1615-75917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-009-0369-y3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02269naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245014000129300001600269500001500285520087000300650004501170650001801215650001201233650002201245650000901267650001801276650001301294650001901307650002301326650001301349650002301362650001501385650003201400650002001432650002601452653001401478653001401492653001601506653002301522653001501545700001801560700001201578700001501590773009201605852000901697930003301706945001301739946001101752655001201763IND2205232320221118221450.0000613e199412  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220523232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRayapati, P.J.12aA linkage map of diploid Avena based on RFLP loci and a locus conferring resistance to nine isolates of Puccinia coronata var.

Eighty-eight F2 individuals were used to construct an RFLP linkage map representing the A genome of cultivated hexaploid oat. Two hundred and eight RFLP loci have been placed into 10 linkage groups. This map covers 2416 cM, with an average of 12 cM between RFLP loci. Eighty-eight F3 lines, derived from F2 individuals used to construct the map, were screened for resistance to 9 isolates of P. coronata. One locus, Pca, was found to confer a dominant resistance phenotype to isolates 203, 258, 263, 264B, 290, 298, 325A, and 345. Pca also conferred resistance to isolate 276; however, an unlinked second gene may also be involved. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3arust diseases 3ahybrids 3aPuccinia coronata 3aloci 3aAvena wiestii 3adiploidy 3alinkage groups 3achromosome mapping 3agenotype 3adisease resistance 3aAvena nuda 3ainterspecific hybridization 3agenetic markers 3agenetic recombination 0adominance 0apca locus 0asegregation 0alinkage (genetics) 0acrown rust1 aGregory, J.W.1 aLee, M.1 aWise, R.P.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1994 Dec., v. 89, no. 7/8 p.831-837x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02094naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009100127300001600218520095100234650001301185650002001198650001501218650001801233650002001251650001401271650002301285650002101308650000901329650000801338650004701346650001601393653001701409653000901426653001901435700001301454700001701467700001801484773009201502852000901594930003301603945001301636946001101649655001201660IND2205232520221118221530.0000613e199412  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220523252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandry, B.S.10aPhylogeny analysis of 25 apple rootstocks using RAPD markers and tactical gene tagging  ap. 847-852.  aRAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) markers were used to fingerprint eight commercially available apple rootstocks (Nertchinsk, Northern Spy, Osman, Heyer 12, M.1, M.9, M.26 and MM.106), 10 winter hardy offsprings derived from the cross of Nertchinsk x M.9, six winter hardy offsprings derived from the cross of Nertchinsk x M.26 and one winter hardy offspring derived from each of the two crosses between Osman x Heyer 12 and Northern Spy x M.1.

SIT4 encodes a type 2A-related protein phosphatase that is required in late G1 for normal G1 cyclin expression and for bud initiation. Overexpression of SIS2, which contains an extremely acidic carboxyl terminal region, stimulated the rate of CLN1, CLN2, SWI4 and CLB5 expression in sit4 mutants. Also, overexpression of SIS2 in a CLN1 cln2 cln3 strain stimulated the growth rate and the rate of CLN1 and CLB5 RNA accumulation during late G1. The SIS2 protein fractionated with nuclei and was released from the nuclear fraction by treatment with either DNase I or micrococcal nuclease, but not by RNase A. This result, combined with the finding that overexpression of SIS2 is extremely toxic to a strain containing lower than normal levels of histones H2A and H2B, suggests that SIS2 might function to stimulate transcription via an interaction with chromatin. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3astructural genes 3aphosphoprotein phosphatase 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3acell division 3aproteins 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3agene interaction 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Compartmentation 2aCell Cyclexgenetics 2aCell Cycle Proteins 2aCell Nucleusxchemistry 2aChromatinxphysiology 2aCyclinsxbiosynthesis 2aDNA-Binding Proteins 2aFungal Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aGene Deletion 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGenes, Fungalxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPhosphoprotein Phosphatasesxgenetics 2aProtein Phosphatase 2 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTranscription Factors 2aTranscription, Genetic 0agrowth rate 0agenetic regulation 0aswi4 gene 0acln1 gene 0acln2 gene 0asis2 gene 0acell budding 0acyclin 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u018781 aBose, R.1 aArndt, K.T.0 tGenetics.g1995 Jan., v. 139, no. 1 p.95-107x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03144naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072001700151072001700168100001800185242010800203245011300311300001400424500002400438520155100462650001902013650002202032650001102054650002002065650003202085650001402117650001602131650001402147650003002161650002302191650001502214650001602229650001702245650002502262653001702287653002902304700001602333700001702349700001702366773007402383852000902457856009102466930003302557945002502590946001102615655001202626IND4363441220221118221215.0040717e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||por||7 aIND436344122DNAL7 a10.1590/S1519-566X20040001000112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Here we evaluated the effect of the domatia on the predatory mite Iphiseiodes zuluagai Denmark & Muma, manipulating these structures on the leaves of Coffea arabica L. var. Catua.̕ The tests were done using arenas made of coffee leaves placed up side down inside petri dishes. The survivorship of I. zuluagai was evaluated when released on leaves with closed domatia (T1); leaves with open domatia plus prey (T2) and leaves with open domatia without prey (T3). The experiment was checked every 24h, measuring the number of alive adults, oviposition site and the number of I. zuluagai eggs/treatment. Significant difference was found between treatments. Mites were alive until the end of the experiments on leaves with open domatia (T2 and T3), which did not happen on leaves with closed domatia (T1). The predators oviposited preferentially inside the domatia on treatments with open domatia, and on the edge of the leaves, next to the moist cotton bordering the leaves, on the treatment with closed domatia. The results indicate the role of domatia on the survivorship of the predators on the coffee plants, suggesting a possible mutualist interactions plant-predator. On coffee crops, a mutualistic plant-predator interaction mediated by domatia could be used in practices of natural biological control, selecting coffee plants with domatia to harbor predatory mites and thereby protecting plants against harmful herbivore mites. 3aCoffea arabica 3acoffee (beverage) 3aleaves 3apredatory mites 3apredator-prey relationships 3amortality 3aoviposition 3amutualism 3abiological control agents 3abiological control 3aherbivores 3aplant pests 3amite control 3aIphiseiodes zuluagai 0aleaf domatia 0aplant-predator mutualism1 aPallini, A.1 aChaves, F.F.1 aGalbiati, C.0 tNeotropical entomology.g2004 , v. 33, no. 1 p.57-63x1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-566X20040001000113Available from publisher's Web site  a20050104b20050130c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/01/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03758naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002200110040001800132100002000150245011400170300001600284500001500300520151700315650001801832650000901850650002101859650002501880650001401905650001601919650002001935650002001955650002801975650002502003650001802028650002802046650001002074650001202084650003502096650002402131650005102155650001102206650003102217650002802248650002502276650003002301650003102331650000902362650002002371650001302391650004002404650004802444650003802492650002202530650001702552650002402569650003602593650004202629650001702671653001202688653001502700653001502715653001302730653001302743653001502756653001202771653001202783700001702795700001702812773006702829852000902896930003302905945001302938946001302951655001202964IND2045296220221118221357.0950328e199501  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204529622DNAL7 a77056262pmid7 aPMC12063212pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlusarski, D.C.10aMutations that alter the timing and pattern of cubitus interruptus gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster  ap. 229-240.  a2019-12-05  aThe cubitus interruptus (ci) gene is a member of the Drosophila segment polarity gene family and encodes a protein with a zinc finger domain homologous to the vertebrate Gli genes and the nematode tra-l gene. Three dasses of existing mutations in the a locus alter the regulation of ci expression and can be used to examine ci function during development The first class of ci mutations causes interruptions in wing veins four and five due to inappropriate expression of the ci product in the posterior compartment of imaginal discs. The second class of mutations eliminates ci protein early in embryogenesis and causes the deletion of structures that are derived from the region including and adjacent to the and expressing cells. The third class of mutations eliminates ci protein later in embryogenesis and blocks the formation of the ventral naked cuticle. The loss of ci expression at these two different stages in embryonic development correlates with the subsequent elimination of wingless expression. Adults heterozygous for the unique ci(.Ce) mutation have deletions between wing veins three and four. A similar wing defect is present in animals mutant for the segment polarity gene fused that encodes a putative serine/threonine kinase. In ci(.Ce)/+ and fused mutants, the deletions between wing veins three and four correlate with increased ci protein levels in the anterior compartment. Thus, proper regulation of both the ci mRNA and protein appears to be critical for normal Drosophila development. 3amessenger RNA 3aloci 3astructural genes 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aphenotype 3amutagenesis 3aembryo (animal) 3agene expression 3agenetic complementation 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aembryogenesis 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3awings 2aAnimals 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aDrosophila Proteins 2aDrosophila melanogasterxembryologyxgenetics. 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGenes, Insectxgenetics 2aHomeodomain Proteins 2aInsect Hormonesxgenetics 2aLarvaxanatomy & histology 2aMale 2aModels, Genetic 2aMutation 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinasesxgenetics. 2aProto-Oncogene Proteinsxgenetics 2aSequence Deletion 2aTime Factors 2aTissue Distribution 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics 2aWingxanatomy & histologyxembryology 2aWnt1 Protein 0afu gene 0afused gene 0aci protein 0amutation 0aci locus 0awing veins 0aci gene 0acuticle1 aMotzny, C.K.1 aHolmgren, R.0 tGenetics.g1995 Jan., v. 139, no. 1 p.229-240x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03687naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002200110040001800132100001900150245012100169300001600290500001500306520170900321650001502030650002402045650001602069650001402085650002302099650002102122650001902143650001702162650002602179650002202205650001402227650002702241650002802268650001002296650003002306650003702336650001202373650003402385650002802419650007302447650002202520650001102542650002202553650001502575650002502590650000902615650001702624651002002641651003302661653001702694653002502711653002602736653001302762653002402775653002302799653001502822700001702837773006702854852000902921930003302930945001302963946001302976655001202989IND2045296620221118221358.0950328e199501  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204529662DNAL7 a77056282pmid7 aPMC12063232pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLatter, B.D.H.10aGenetic adaptation to captivity and inbreeding depression in small laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster  ap. 255-266.  a2019-12-05  aThe rate of adaptation to a competitive laboratory environment and the associated inbreeding depression in measures of reproductive fimess have been observed in populations of Drosophila melanogaster with mean effective breeding size of the order of 50 individuals. Two large wild-derived populations and a long-established laboratory cage population were used as base stocks, from which subpopulations were extracted and slowly inbred under crowded conditions over a period of 210 generations. Comparisons have been made of the competitive ability and reproductive fitness of these subpopulations, the panmictic populations produced from them by hybridization and random mating and the wild- or cage-base populations from which they were derived. After an average of approximately 180 generations in the laboratory, the wild-derived populations exceeded the resampled natural populations by 75% in fitness under competitive conditions. The cage-derived panmictic population, after a total of 17 years in the laboratory, showed a 90% superiority in competitive ability over the corresponding wild population. In the inbred lines derived from the wild-base stocks, the average rate of adaptation was estimated to be 0.33 + 0.06% per generation. However, the gain in competitive ability was more than offset by inbreeding depression at an initial rate of approximately 2% per generation. The effects of both adaptation and inbreeding on reproductive ability in a noncompetitive environment were found to be minor by comparison. The maintenance of captive populations under noncompetitive conditions can therefore be expected to minimize adaptive changes due to natural selection in the changed environment. 3apopulation 3aenzyme polymorphism 3abody weight 3afecundity 3alaboratory animals 3agenetic distance 3aheterozygosity 3ainbred lines 3ainbreeding depression 3agenetic variation 3aallozymes 3abiological development 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3acages 3aintraspecific competition 2aAdaptation, Biologicalxgenetics 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Laboratoryxgenetics 2aAnimals, Wildxgenetics 2aDrosophila melanogasterxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aEnzymesxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGenetic Variation 2aInbreeding 2aIsoenzymesxgenetics 2aMale 2aReproduction 3aNew South Wales 3aAustralian Capital Territory 0areproduction 0areproductive fitness 0apanmictic populations 0acrowding 0acompetitive ability 0aanimal competition 0aadaptation1 aMulley, J.C.0 tGenetics.g1995 Jan., v. 139, no. 1 p.255-266x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03121naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002200110040001800132100001800150245004400168300001600212520128900228650002601517650002701543650002001570650001801590650002101608650002401629650001001653650001201663650002001675650001801695650001201713650001001725650002501735650001301760650002701773650002101800650002401821650001201845650001801857650002801875650003101903650002001934650001201954650002801966650001601994650002302010650003002033650002902063650002302092650002702115650003402142650003602176650002802212653001602240653001402256653001402270700001602284773006702300852000902367930003302376945001302409946001302422655001202435IND2045295220221118221254.0950328e199501  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204529522DNAL7 a77056202pmid7 aPMC12063142pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurland, T.G.10aHomologous gene replacement in Physarum  ap. 147-158.  aThe protist Physarum polycephalum is useful for analysis of several aspects of cellular and developmental biology. To expand the opportunities for experimental analysis of this organism, we have developed a method for gene replacement. We transformed Physarum amoebae with plasmid DNA carrying a mutant allele, ardD delta 1, of the ardD actin gene; ardD delta 1 mutates the critical carboxy-terminal region of the gene product. Because ardD is not expressed in the amoeba, replacement of ardD+ with ardD delta 1 should not be lethal for this cell type. Transformants were obtained only when linear plasmid DNA was used. Most transformants carried one copy of ardD delta 1 in addition to ardD+, but in two (5%), ardD+ was replaced by a single copy of ardD delta 1. This is the first example of homologous gene replacement in Physarum. ardD delta 1 was stably maintained in the genome through growth, development and meiosis. We found no effect of ard delta 1 on viability, growth, or development of any of the various cell types of Physarum. Thus, the carboxy-terminal region of the ardD product appears not to perform a unique essential role in growth or development. Nevertheless, this method for homologous gene replacement can be applied to analyze the function of any cloned gene. 3aPhysarum polycephalum 3agenetic transformation 3aplasmid vectors 3agene transfer 3astructural genes 3acomplementary genes 3aactin 3aalleles 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3aintrons 3aexons 3aalternative splicing 3amutation 3ainheritance (genetics) 2aActinsxgenetics 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aGenes, Fungalxgenetics 2aGenes, Protozoanxgenetics 2aGenetic Vectors 2aMeiosis 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis 2aPhysarumxgenetics 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aTransformation, Genetic 0asegregation 0adeletions 0aardd gene1 aPallota, D.0 tGenetics.g1995 Jan., v. 139, no. 1 p.147-158x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02516naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008600128300001600214500001500230520134000245650002501585650003101610650001801641650001901659650001601678650003001694650002301724650001001747650002301757650001401780650002201794650002001816653001501836653002801851653004301879700001501922773009101937852000902028930003302037945001302070946001102083655001202094IND2322808020221118221319.0010830e200103  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232280802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVicente, J.G.10aCharacterisation of disease resistance gene-like sequences in Brassica oleracea L  ap. 555-563.  a2019-12-05  aSeveral cloned disease resistance genes from a wide range of plant species are known to share conserved regions with similar structural motifs. Degenerate primers based on conserved sequences of the nucleotide binding site of the genes RPS2, N and L6 were used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification from genomic DNA of two doubled haploid lines of Brassica oleracea. Sequences of amplified products were highly variable, but most of them showed similarity to known disease resistance genes, including RPS5, RPS2 and N, and to disease resistance gene-like sequences (RGLs) from different species. Primers based on B. oleracea sequences amplified five groups of RGLs. Products were mapped through cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence assays onto four different linkage groups of B. oleracea. PCR amplification from cDNA and allele analysis indicated that four locus-specific RGL fragments are expressed in cauliflower. Screening of a B. oleracea bacterial artificial chromosome library (BAC) with four B. oleracea RGL probes identified a small number of clones, suggesting that the four RGLs may not be highly copied. Screening of a BAC library of A. thaliana with the same probes identified clones that mapped onto four different chromosomes. These map positions correspond to known disease resistance loci of A. thaliana. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aDNA libraries 3alinkage groups 3aDNA primers 3apolymerase chain reaction 3achromosome mapping 3agenes 3adisease resistance 3ascreening 3aBrassica oleracea 3agenetic markers 0aDNA probes 0amolecular sequence data 0acleaved amplified polymorphic sequence1 aKing, G.J.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2001 Mar., v. 102, no. 4 p.555-563x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a20011101b20011108c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02753naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009000128300001600218500001500234520156100249650002801810650001401838650001901852650002301871650004301894650002501937650001701962650001301979650002201992650002002014653002402034653002002058653002102078700001502099700001702114700001602131700001502147773009102162852000902253930003302262945001302295946001102308655001202319IND2322805320221118221304.0010830e200103  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232280532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomkins, J.P.10aEvaluation of genetic variation in the daylily (Hemerocallis spp.) using AFLP markers  ap. 489-496.  a2019-12-05  aThe daylily (Hemerocallis spp.) is one of the most economically important ornamental plant species in commerce. Interestingly, it is also one of the most heavily bred crops during the past 60 years. Since the American Hemerocallis Society began acting as the official registry of daylily cultivars in 1947, more than 40 000 registrations have been processed. In order to determine the effects of intensive breeding on cultivar development, and to study relationships among different species, genetic variation in the daylily was estimated using AFLP markers. Nineteen primary genotypes (species and early cultivars) and 100 modern cultivars from different time periods were evaluated using 152 unambiguous bands (average 79% polymorphism rate) derived from three AFLP primer combinations. Overall, pairwise similarity estimates between entries ranged between 0.618 and 0.926 (average=0.800). When comparing cultivar groups from different time periods (1940-1998), genetic similarity was initially increased, compared to the primary diploid genotypes, remained constant from 1940 to 1980, and then steadily increased as breeding efforts intensified and hybridizers began focusing on a limited tetraploid germplasm pool derived by colchicine conversion. Among modern (1991-1998) daylily cultivars, genetic similarity has increased by approximately 10% compared to the primary genotypes. These data were also used to evaluate recent taxonomic classifications among daylily species which, with a few minor exceptions, were generally supported by the AFLP data. 3ainterspecific variation 3acultivars 3aplant breeding 3aselection response 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aartificial selection 3aHemerocallis 3agenotype 3agenetic variation 3agenetic markers 0aspecies differences 0aearly cultivars 0amodern cultivars1 aWood, T.C.1 aBarnes, L.S.1 aWestman, A.1 aWing, R.A.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2001 Mar., v. 102, no. 4 p.489-496x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a20011101b20011108c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01489naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245000900132300001400141300002800155500001500183520070700198650002600905651001400931653002100945653003200966653002500998773007801023852001301101939003301114945000801147946001101155852000901166655001201175991561202730742620221118221511.0870529s1986    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870010802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoeser, H.P.10aIron  ap. 82-92.  ap. 82-92. ill., charts.  a2019-12-06  aA review article supports the Australian dietary recommendation for iron. Dietary iron has many biochemical functions, most of which are carried out in conjunction with protein. Almost 95 per cent of the functional iron in the body is in the form of metalloproteins only about 10 per cent of dietary iron is absorbed from the intestines, because there is no physiological mechanism for iron excretion. Toxicity occurs in rare individuals who absorb all of the iron they ingest. It is far more common, however, to see iron deficiency symptoms. Because iron is lost in blood during menstruation, women are most susceptible to iron deficiency, and thus have higher daily requirements of the nutrient.(lsp) 3anutrient requirements 3aAustralia 0anutrient sources 0arecommended dietary intakes 0anutrition physiology0 tJournal of food & nutrition.g1986, v. 42, no. 2 p.82-92x0728-47137nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19870529c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US  aDNAL 7aarticle02158naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245005600123300001800179500001500197520103200212650001801244650002001262650001901282650001801301650001401319650001301333650001501346650002101361650002201382650002301404651001101427653003701438653002001475653002201495700001801517700001401535700001501549773009401564852000901658930003301667945001301700946001101713655001201724IND2322104920221118221332.0010719e200105  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232210492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, J.10aAnalysis of a combined F1/F2 diallel cross in wheat  ap. 1076-1081.  a2019-12-05  aAnalysis of a conventional diallel cross offers only perfect-fit estimates of the genetic components of variation, but no test for the goodness of fit of the model based on these estimates. When F2 progenies are available, however, combining F1 and F2 diallels in a single experiment overcomes these problems. Least-squares estimates of these components can be calculated, errors attached to them and the goodness of fit of the resultant model tested. This analysis was applied to data on the severity of yellow rust infection in an F1/F2 half-diallel cross among eight bread wheat lines adapted to the East African highlands. After removing two interacting arrays, genetic analysis indicated that an additive/dominance model of gene action satisfactorily explained the variation observed among the remaining six parents and their progenies, in both the individual F1 and F2 diallels and the combined F1/F2 diallel. Resistance to yellow rust was dominant to susceptibility and genes for increased resistance were more frequent. 3arust diseases 3aadditive effect 3aplant breeding 3aleast squares 3ahighlands 3acrossing 3acrop yield 3adiallel analysis 3aTriticum aestivum 3adisease resistance 3aUganda 0agenetic techniques and protocols 0agenetic effects 0adominance effects1 aWagoire, W.W.1 aOrtiz, R.1 aStolen, O.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2001 May, v. 102, no. 6/7 p.1076-1081x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02937naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245012600130300001800256500001500274520164100289650001501930650002201945650004301967650000902010650001902019650002302038650001002061650002002071650002002091653001402111653001602125653003002141653003702171653002302208700001902231700001702250700002002267700001602287700001602303773009402319852000902413930003302422945001302455946001102468655001202479IND2322103320221118221529.0010719e200105  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232210332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuedraogo, J.T.10aIdentification of AFLP markers linked to resistance of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) to parasitism by Striga gesnerioides  ap. 1029-1036.  a2019-12-05  aAFLP and bulked segregant analysis were used to identify molecular markers linked to resistance of cowpea [Vigna ungiculata (L.) Walp.] to parasitism by Striga gesnerioides (Willd.) Vatke. Segregation analysis of F2 progeny from a cross of Tvx3236, a Striga-susceptible line, with IT82D-849, a resistant cultivar, showed that resistance to S. gesnerioides race 1 from Burkina Faso was controlled by a single dominant gene, designated Rsg2-1. Three AFLP markers were identified that are tightly linked to Rsg2-1: E-AAC/M-CAA300 (2.6 cM), E-ACT/M-CAA524 (0.9 cM), and E-ACA/M-CAT140/150 (0.9 cM), which appears to be codominant. Segregation analysis of a different F2 population resulting from a cross of the Striga-susceptible line IT84S-2246-4 with Tvu 14676, a S. gesnerioides race 3 resistant line, showed that resistance to S. gesnerioides race 3 resistant line, showed that resistance to S. gesnerioides race 3 was also controlled by a single dominant gene, designated Rsg4-3. Six AFLP markers linked to Rsg4-3 were identified: E-ACA/M-CAG120 (10.1 cM), E-AGC/M-CAT80 (4.1 cM), E-ACA/M-CAT150 (2.7 cM), E-AGC/M-CAT150 (3.6 cM), E-AAC/M-CAA300 (3.6 cM), and E-AGC/M-CAT70 (5.1 cM). Segregation analysis of the E-AAC/M-CAA300 and E-ACA/M-CAG120 markers in recombinant inbred lines derived from IT84S-2049x524B determined that both are located within linkage group 1 of the cowpea genetic map. The identification of AFLP markers linked to Striga resistance provides a stepping stone for a marker-assisted selection program and the eventual cloning and characterization of the gene(s) encoding resistance to this noxious parasitic weed. 3aparasitism 3aVigna unguiculata 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aloci 3alinkage groups 3achromosome mapping 3agenes 3apest resistance 3agenetic markers 0adominance 0asegregation 0abulked segregant analysis 0agenetic techniques and protocols 0alinkage (genetics)1 aMaheshwari, V.1 aBerner, D.K.1 aSt Pierre, C.A.1 aBelzile, F.1 aTimko, M.P.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2001 May, v. 102, no. 6/7 p.1029-1036x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03690naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141072001700158100001500175245011500190300001800305500001500323520207300338650001602411650001502427650002802442650001502470650001302485650001002498650002402508650002202532650001902554650002202573650001202595650004102607650002002648651001302668653002102681653001202702653001102714653001702725653002002742700001802762700001702780700001902797700001702816700001702833773011302850852000902963856008102972930003303053945002503086946001303111655001203124IND4363222720221118221433.0040701e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436322272DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-1200252172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPopp, M.P.10aAnalysis of a novel bedded planting system for dry clay soil management of full-season and double-crop soybean  ap. 2925-2950.  a2019-12-04  aClay soils are difficult to manage to obtain a soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] stand, especially when dry. A novel production system, recently observed on several farms in Arkansas, consists of bedding the dry clayey soil with disk-bedders, broadcasting the soybean seed over the surface, re-bedding the seedbed to cover the seed, rolling the beds to flatten the tops and finally furrow irrigating immediately thereafter. Typically this planting system provides a stand of soybean within 4 to 6 days after irrigation and is designated as "hipped" after the common reference of a disk-bedder as a hipper. Studies were conducted on Sharkey soil at Keiser, AR from 1998 to 2000 for comparing this "hipped" system to more widely used planting methods. On dry clayey soils, a randomized complete block design with three replications was used to compare full-season soybean under a conventional 96-cm row system, drilled-planting into a stale seedbed, and the "hipped" system. A similar study for double-cropped wheat-soybean involved straw management (burn or leave) coupled with no-till drill, tilled drill, and "hipped" systems. Other small studies on the "hipped" system were conducted to investigate the sensitivity to planting depth, soybean plant population, and suitability for obtaining a stand on other crops such as cotton [Gossypium hirsutum (L.)] and grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]. The "hipped" system worked well for obtaining stands of soybean, cotton, and grain sorghum. In essence the "hipped" system 1) provides insurance against poor planting conditions; 2) allows for a reduction in the uncertainty of planting and stand establishment time required; 3) can be used to achieve high plant populations; 4) requires a relatively higher seeding rate in double-crop than full-season systems; 5) shows promise for situations when wheat stubble burning becomes curtailed especially if planting can occur early to lead to improved canopy coverage and 6) leads to yield reductions in fields where depth of seed placement cannot be controlled easily. 3aGlycine max 3aclay soils 3acrop residue management 3ano-tillage 3asoybeans 3awheat 3aseedbed preparation 3afurrow irrigation 3adirect seeding 3aTriticum aestivum 3aburning 3aagricultural machinery and equipment 3adouble cropping 3aArkansas 0abroadcast sowing 0atillage 0asowing 0adisk bedders 0asoil management1 aManning, P.M.1 aOliver, L.R.1 aKeisling, T.C.1 aGordon, E.C.1 aCounce, P.C.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2003 Nov., v. 34, no. 19-20 p.2925-2950x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-1200252173Available from publisher's Web site  a20050426b20050501c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/02/02  aOther US 7aarticle02743naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141072001700158072001700175100002800192245006600220300001800286500001500304520144500319650002801764650001101792650002001803650001301823650001801836650002101854650002101875650001601896650001701912651000901929653001501938653002201953700002201975700001401997773011302011852000902124856008102133930003302214945002502247946001302272655001202285IND4363222020221118221627.0040701e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436322202DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-1200251982doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A randomized block design with five treatments and three replications was used. The treatments were conventional irrigation practice (L0), two excess irrigation on preplanting (L1), one excess irrigation on preplanting (L2), one excess irrigation after planting (L3), and two excess irrigation after planting (L4). Changes of soil salinity were measured at two depths of 0-25 and 25-50 cm, at preplant, 3-4 days after every leaching or irrigation and after harvesting. Straw and grain yield of barley was also determined. Soil salinity was acceptably decreased for all treatments at the end of experiment. Except for treatment L0, the final ECe values of surface soil were below the EC of irrigation water. Electrical conductivity in surface soil was decreased from 67.1 dS m(-1) before experiment) to 7.1 dS m(-1) (after plant harvesting) by L1 treatment. In the L1, soil salinity was lower than other treatments, during the germination and seedling stages; therefore grain and straw yields were increased significantly compared to the others. Grain yield was increased from 121.3 Kg ha(-1) (control) to 2675 Kg ha(-1) (L1 treatment). The results of this experiment showed that addition of water in excess of that required by the crop can be applied to ensure leaching of salts. 3aelectrical conductivity 3abarley 3aHordeum vulgare 3aleaching 3asoil salinity 3aland restoration 3airrigation rates 3agrain yield 3asaline soils 3aIran 0airrigation 0aexcess irrigation1 aShariatmadari, H.1 aVakil, R.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2003 Nov., v. 34, no. 19-20 p.2875-2883x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-1200251983Available from publisher's Web site  a20050426b20050501c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/02/02  aOther US 7aarticle01666naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245009600133300001400229300002200243500001500265520074800280650001101028650002601039650002101065650001701086651001401103653001301117700001501130700001901145773007801164852001301242939003301255945000801288946001101296852000901307655001201316991561200990742620221118221357.0870619s1985    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870012552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWills, R.B.H.10aComparison of sugar levels in sweetened and unsweetened fruit juices and fruit juice drinks  ap. 18-20.  ap. 18-20. charts.  a2019-12-06  aThe level of refined sugars in the diet is of great concern to many, particularly in view of the suggestion to increase consumption of complex carbohydrates. In order to determine the levels of individual sugars in both sweetened and unsweetened juices, 49 varieties were analyzed for fructose, glucose and sucrose. Sweetened varieties proved to contain 20-30 per cent more sucrose than unsweetened juice of the same fruit, while some unsweetened juices of a naturally high sugar content contained more sucrose than sweetened juices of other fruit types. All juices examined were below the allowable additive limits. These findings suggest that labels of unsweetened juices should be more specific for consumers to make informed choices.(jd-b) 3asugars 3aartificial sweeteners 3afood composition 3afruit juices 3aAustralia 0alabeling1 aFord, N.J.1 aGreenfield, H.0 tJournal of food & nutrition.g1985, v. 42, no. 1 p.18-20x0728-47137nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19870619c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US  aDNAL 7aarticle01476naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002400115245007200139300001400211300002200225520054000247650001300787650002100800650002000821650001800841650002600859651002200885700002400907700002100931700002200952773007800974852001301052939003301065945000801098946001101106852000901117655001201126991561200350742620221118221114.0850122s1984    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850065132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHitchcock, Nancy E.10aNutrition of healthy children in the second and third years of life  ap. 13-16.  ap. 13-16. charts.  aThe data from the first year of a prospective study of Australian children started in 1979 are reported.

The results indicate that computerized nutrient analysis programs based on Metric Tables of Composition of Australian Foods and those based on British tables of food composition are unlikely to give significantly different mean values. The only exception--niacin equivalents--is explained by the fact that the methods of calculating niacin equivalents differ. Evaluating the nutrient intake based on both British and American tables, the values may be significantly different for group data for a number of nutrients including iron, retinol equivalents, sodium, and niacin. With the exception of sodium, these values are higher for analyses based on the American program. This difference probably results from the more widespread fortification of foods with the nutrients in question in the US than in the other countries. When evaluating the nutrient intake of individuals, particularly for vitamins and trace minerals, there is considerably more error even when food tables appropriate to the region are used, and this may be expected to be even greater when foreign tables are used as the basis for nutrient analysis.

However, the magnitude of the decrease - the stomatal sensitivity - varies considerably both within and between species. Here we analysed data from a variety of sources employing both porometric and sap flux estimates of g(s) to evaluate the hypothesis that stomatal sensitivity is proportional to the magnitude of g(s) at low D (< or = 1 kPa). To test this relationship we used the function g(s) = g(sref) - m(.)InD where m is the stomatal sensitivity and g(sref) = g(s) at D = 1 kPa. Regardless of species or methodology, m was highly correlated with g(sref) (average r(2) = 0.75) with a slope of approximately 0.6. We demonstrate that this empirical slope is consistent with the theoretical slope derived from a simple hydraulic model that assumes stomatal regulation of leaf water potential. The theoretical slope is robust to deviations from underlying assumptions and variation in model parameters. The relationships within and among species are close to theoretical predictions, regardless of whether the analysis is based on porometric measurements of g(s) in relation to leaf-surface D (D(s)), or on sap flux-based stomatal conductance of whole trees (G(si)), or stand-level stomatal conductance (G(s)) in relation to D. Thus, individuals, species, and stands with high stomatal conductance at low D show a greater sensitivity to D, as required by the role of stomata in regulating leaf water potential. 3ainterspecific variation 3amathematical models 3astomatal conductance 3asurface area 3aequations 3aleaf water potential 3adata analysis 3avapor pressure 3astomata 3awater vapor 3aprediction 0aspecies differences 0aliterature reviews 0amethodology 0aplants1 aSperry, J.S.1 aKatul, G.G.1 aPataki, D.E.1 aEwers, B.E.1 aPhillips, N.q(Nahid)1 aSchafer, K.V.R.0 tPlant, cell and environment.g1999 Dec., v. 22, no. 12 p.1515-1526x0140-77917nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01585naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245012800130300001400258300002200272520062500294650001200919650001200931650001000943650002000953650002600973651002500999653002701024700001501051700001701066773007801083852001301161930003301174945000801207946001101215852000901226655001201235991561199270742620221118221455.0850122s1984    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850065192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHailes, J.10aCalcium intake in women attending menopause clinics: Considerations with regard to currently recommended dietary allowances  ap. 37-39.  ap. 37-39. charts.  aThe average daily intake of calcium of women attending a menopausal clinic was calculated from data obtained by recall.

We demonstrate here that ethylene suppression through an antisense ACC oxidase (ACO) gene considerably reduced the sensitivity of Charentais cantaloupe melons to chilling injury. In contrast to wild-type fruit, antisense ACO melons did not develop the characteristic chilling injury of pitting and browning of the rind neither when stored at low temperature (3 weeks at 2 degrees C) nor upon rewarming. Treating antisense melons with 10 p.p.m. ethylene for more than 1 d prior to cold storage resulted in the restoration of chilling sensitivity. When the ethylene treatment was performed after cold storage, the chilling injury symptoms did not appear. The tolerance to chilling was associated with a lower accumulation of ethanol and acetaldehyde, reduced membrane deterioration and higher capacity of the fruit to remove active oxygen species. The activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase and peroxidase were markedly increased in antisense ACO fruit in comparison with wild-type fruit, particulary upon rewarming and post-storage ethylene treatment. Severe chilling injury symptoms were correlated with a lower activity of activated oxygen scavenging enzymes. These results demonstrate that ethylene acts in conjunction with low temperature to induce metabolic shifts that participate in the development of chilling injury. 3aCucumis melo 3amelons 3aethylene production 3aoxygenases 3aantisense RNA 3acooling 3acold storage 3afood storage 3aethylene 3aethanol 3aacetaldehyde 3acell membranes 3aoxides 3acatalase 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aperoxidase 3atransgenic plants 3achilling injury 0asymptoms 0astorage disorders 0ainhibition1 aLatche, A.1 aBouzayen, M.1 aPech, J.C.1 aRomojaro, F.0 tPlant, cell and environment.g1999 Dec., v. 22, no. 12 p.1579-1586x0140-77917nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02462naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141072001700158072001700175072001700192072001700209072001700226100001800243245006800261300001800329520110300347650001301450650000901463650001501472650001301487650002001500650002501520650002701545650001201572650001801584650002101602650002401623651001301647653002901660700001601689773011401705852000901819856008101828930003301909945002501942946001301967655001201980IND4363239420221118221505.0040706e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436323942DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-1200240562doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aOverman, A.R.10aModel analysis of corn response to applied nitrogen and tillage  ap. 2177-2191.  aCrop production depends upon many factors such as level of applied nutrients, available water, stage of growth, crop species, soil type, and harvest interval (for perennials). Mathematical models provide a framework for linking these factors in a quantitative manner. In this article the extended logistic model is used to describe production (dry matter and plant N uptake) of corn (Zea mays L.) in response to applied N and method of tillage (minimal vs. plow). The model provides reasonable description of response curves (yield, plant N uptake, and plant N concentration vs. applied N). It also describes the phase relationships (yield and plant N concentration vs. plant N uptake) predicted by the model. All the difference in response to minimal vs. plow tillage is accounted for in the intercept parameters of the model, which relates to crop response at low levels of applied N. It is concluded that moldboard plowing turns under crop residue which releases nitrogen in the soil for utilization by the succeeding crop. Production at high-applied N is similar for the two methods of tillage. 3aZea mays 3acorn 3acrop yield 3anitrogen 3anutrient uptake 3anitrogen fertilizers 3afertilizer application 3aplowing 3acrop residues 3anitrogen content 3amathematical models 3aMaryland 0aextended logistic models1 aBrock, K.H.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2003 Sept., v. 34, no. 15-16 p.2177-2191x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-1200240563Available from publisher's Web site  a20050705b20050802c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/02/04  aOther US 7aarticle02852naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141100002700158245008100185300001800266520171500284650001801999650001902017650002602036650001202062650001202074650002302086650002002109650001302129700001702142700001502159700001702174773011402191852000902305856008102314930003302395945002502428946001302453655001202466IND4363238520221118221351.0040706e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436323852DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-1200240482doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLima-Rodrigues, L. de.10aComparison of three soil test methods for estimating plant-available silicon  ap. 2059-2071.  aSilicon (Si) confers increased disease resistance and nutritional benefits for both sugarcane and rice. Sugarcane is the primary crop grown in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) in south Florida, USA, and production inputs routinely include Si fertilization. Soil testing for Si is based on a 0.5 N acetic acid extraction procedure that was developed for rice grown on the organic and mineral soils found in the EAA. The objective of this study was to compare a Florida based acetic acid extraction protocol with the sodium acetate buffer method used in Japan and Korea, and the 0.01M calcium chloride method used in Australia. The three procedures were used to extract Si from soil samples collected from 31 countries, collectively representing 137 mineral soils. The collectors were asked to sample Oxisols, Ultisols, and coarse textured soils. A subset of the soil collection was classified as deficient (requiring Si fertilization for rice and/or sugarcane), based on published critical soil-test Si values specific to each extraction procedure. The sodium acetate buffer extracted the greatest amounts of Si (0 to 509 mg kg(-1)), followed by acetic acid (1 to 239 mg L(-1)) and calcium chloride (3 to 109 mg kg(-1)). Acetic acid and sodium acetate buffer soil-test Si values were fairly well correlated (r = 0.77) and both methods performed well across a wide range of soils. Results with calcium chloride were less well correlated with acetic acid (r = 0.73) and were poorly related to sodium acetate buffer (r = 0.57). When considering only the subset of soils testing at or below the critical value, the correlation between acetic acid and sodium acetate buffer extractions was improved (r = 0.84). 3asoil analysis 3asoil fertility 3anutrient availability 3asilicon 3aOxisols 3aagricultural soils 3asugarcane soils 3aUltisols1 aDaroub, S.H.1 aRice, R.W.1 aSnyder, G.H.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2003 Sept., v. 34, no. 15-16 p.2059-2071x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-1200240483Available from publisher's Web site  a20050705b20050802c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/02/03  aOther US 7aarticle04184naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245011900124300001600243500007700259500001500336520264000351650003802991650002103029650001903050650002303069650002103092650002803113650001303141650002603154650002603180650001403206650001603220650002003236650001103256650002303267650001303290650001903303650002003322650001603342653003003358653002303388653001103411653002803422653001603450653001103466700001403477773008503491852000903576930003303585945001303618946001103631655001203642IND2202086620221118221140.0991228e199906  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220208662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStitt, M.14aThe interaction between elevated carbon dioxide and nitrogen nutrition: the physiological and molecular background  ap. 553-621.  aIn the special issue: Plant responses to rising CO2 / edited by S. Long.  a2019-12-05  aThis review first summarizes the numerous studies that have described the interaction between the nitrogen supply and the response of photosynthesis, metabolism and growth to elevated [CO(2)]. The initial stimulation of photosynthesis in elevated [CO(2)] is often followed by a decline of photosynthesis, that is typically accompanied by a decrease of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), an accumulation of carbohydrate especially starch, and a decrease of the nitrogen concentration in the plant. These changes are particularly marked when the nitrogen supply is low, whereas when the nitrogen supply is adequate there is no acclimation of photosynthesis, no major decrease in the internal concentration of nitrogen or the levels of nitrogen metabolites, and growth is stimulated markedly. Second, emerging evidence is discussed that signals derived from nitrate and nitrogen metabolites such as glutamine act to regulate the expression of genes involved in nitrate and ammonium uptake and assimilation, organic acid synthesis and starch accumulation, to modulate the sugar-mediated repression of the expression of genes involved in photosynthesis, and to modulate whole plant events including shoot-root allocation, root architecture and flowering. Third, increased rates of growth in elevated [CO(2)] will require higher rates of inorganic nitrogen uptake and assimilation. Recent evidence is discussed that an increased supply of sugars can increase the rates of nitrate and ammonium uptake and assimilation, the synthesis of organic acid acceptors, and the synthesis of amino acids. Fourth, interpretation of experiments in elevated [CO(2)] requires that the nitrogen status of the plants is monitored. The suitability of different criteria to assess the plant nitrogen status is critically discussed. Finally the review returns to experiments with elevated [CO(2)] and discusses the following topics: is, and if so how, are nitrate and ammonium uptake and metabolism stimulated in elevated [CO(2)], and does the result depend on the nitrogen supply? Is acclimation of photosynthesis the result of sugar-mediated repression of gene expression, end-product feedback of photosynthesis, nitrogen-induced senescence, or ontogenetic drift? Is the accumulation of starch a passive response to increased carbohydrate formations, or is it triggered by changes in the nutrient status? How do changes in sugar production and inorganic nitrogen assimilation interact in different conditions and at different stages of the life history to determine the response of whole plant growth and allocation to elevated [CO(2)]? 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aplant physiology 3acarbon dioxide 3anutritional status 3anitrogen content 3aorganic acids and salts 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3anutrient deficiencies 3aglutamine 3aacclimation 3anutrient uptake 3astarch 3aammonium compounds 3anitrates 3aphotosynthesis 3aprotein content 3ametabolites 0acarbon dioxide enrichment 0aliterature reviews 0agrowth 0acarbohydrate metabolism 0agrowth rate 0aplants1 aKrapp, A.0 tPlant, cell and environment.g1999 June, v. 22, no. 6 p.553-621x0140-77917nnas  aDNAL  a20000302b20000309c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02637naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141072001700158100001700175245014500192300001800337500001500355520114100370650003701511650001101548650002101559650002101580650002201601650001301623650001401636650002801650650001701678650001401695650002301709650002001732650001001752650001101762650001501773653001401788700002601802700001301828700001501841773011401856852000901970856008101979930003302060945002502093946001302118655001202131IND4363242920221118220819.0040706e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436324292DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-1200240642doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Under water stress, plants colonized by AM fungi exhibited root dry weights and root/shoot ratios, which were lower than un-inoculated plants. G. deserticola had more effect on N uptake whereas G. intraradices and G. mosseae had more effect on phosphorus (P) uptake under the water-limited conditions tested. Nodulation was inhibited and AM colonization rate was increased by water stress in D. pentaphyllum seedlings inoculated with G. deserticola. Root NR activity increased significantly in G. deserticola-colonized plants, under both well-watered (by 137%) and drought-stressed conditions (by 140%), with respect to uninoculated plants. NR activity could be used as an index for assessing the effectiveness of fungus-host plant combinations for mitigation of water-deficit stress. 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aGlomus 3anutrient content 3anitrogen content 3anitrate reductase 3anitrogen 3aDorycnium 3adry matter accumulation 3awater stress 3apotassium 3asoil water deficit 3aenzyme activity 3aroots 3aleaves 3aphosphorus 0asymbiosis1 aMar Alguacil, M. del.1 aDiaz, G.1 aRoldan, A.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2003 Sept., v. 34, no. 15-16 p.2291-2302x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-1200240643Available from publisher's Web site  a20050705b20050802c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/02/04  aOther US 7aarticle02546naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141100002200158245007500180300001800255500001500273520133400288650001301622650001801635650001601653650001101669650001501680650001701695650001501712650001501727653002101742700001401763700001701777700001501794700001301809700001501822773011401837852000901951856008101960930003302041945002502074946001302099655001202112IND4363243020221118220641.0040706e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436324302DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-1200240652doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aEgrinya Eneji, A.10aChanges in humic substances and phosphorus fractions during composting  ap. 2303-2314.  a2019-12-04  aThe behavior of humic substances (HS) and phosphorus (P) fractions in livestock manure co-composted with rice straw was studied by chemical and spectroscopic analyses. Composting was accompanied by a decrease in the levels of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) as well as HS and fulvic acid (FA) fractions. The elemental content (weight %) of humic acid (HA) extracted from the compost showed a high C content and low oxygen (O) content, possibly due to a low degree of oxidation. The N/C and H/C ratios of HA decreased as the compost matured, whereas the O/H and O/C increased. The decline in the H/C ratio from 1.24 at 0d to 1.0 at 195d indicated an increase in the aromatic structure of the HA. The absorbance curve for the HS showed a decrease in the slope with time, up to 42d. The optical density of HS increased with time of composting with a peak at 42d. Also the delta log K values of FA increased appreciably with time of composting whereas those of HS and HA were little changed. Water-soluble and HCl-soluble-P were the dominant fractions of P in the compost, and ranged between 18 and 39% and 18 and 36%, respectively. However, the former declined progressively with time of composting, while the latter increased, indicating transformation of the more vulnerable water soluble P to the more recalcitrant HCl-extractable P. 3anitrogen 3acattle manure 3ahumic acids 3acarbon 3arice straw 3afulvic acids 3aphosphorus 3acomposting 0ahumic substances1 aHonna, T.1 aYamamoto, S.1 aMasuda, T.1 aEndo, T.1 aIrshad, M.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2003 Sept., v. 34, no. 15-16 p.2303-2314x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-1200240653Available from publisher's Web site  a20050705b20050802c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/02/04  aOther US 7aarticle01379naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002900115245001500144300001600159300002400175520046300199650002200662650001500684650002600699650002500725650002000750650002300770650002300793650001700816651001100833651001900844773008000863852001300943939003300956945000800989946001100997852000901008655001201017991561195400742620221118220810.0860121s1984    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860088462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRutishauser, Ingrid H.E.10aRiboflavin  ap. 119-126.  ap. 119-126. charts.  aVarious aspects of riboflavin requirements and its functions are summarized in a detailed review.

Karst. was studied by restriction mapping and Southern hybridization. Conspicuous length variation was found in the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of P. abies, although the length of this region is highly conserved both within and among most of the plant species. Two types of ITS variants (A and B), displaying a size difference of 0.5 kb in the ITS2 region, were present within individuals of P. abies from Sweden. Central Europe and Siberia. A preliminary survey of 14 additional Eurasian and North American species of Picea suggested that length variation in the ITS region is widespread in this genus. Alltogether three length variants (A, B and C) were identified. Within individuals of eight Picea species, two length variants were present within the genome (combinations of A and B variants in P. glehnii, P. maximowiczii, P. omorika, P. polita and P. sitchensis and variants B and C in P jezoensis, P. likiangensis and P. spinulosa). Within individuals from five species, however only one rDNA variant was present in their genome (variant A in P. aurantiaca, P. engelmannii, P. glauca, P. koraiensis and P. koyamai; variant B in P. bicolor). The ITS length variation will be useful as a molecular marker in evolutionary studies of the Picea species complex, whose phylogeny is controversial. The presence of intraindividual variation in, and shared polymorphism of the, ITS length variants raises questions about the occurrence of interspecific hybridization during the evolutionary history of Picea. 3aSouthern blotting 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3ainterspecific variation 3arestriction mapping 3aribosomal DNA 3agenetic variation 3aPicea abies 3alength 3aintergenic DNA 3apopulation 3arepetitive sequences 3aCentral European region 3aSiberia 3aSweden 3aEast Asia 3aNorth America 0aAsia 0aEurope 0aspecies differences 0achromosome mapping 0aPicea1 aSzmidt, A.E.1 aSavolainen, O.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1994 Dec., v. 89, no. 7/8 p.969-974x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02187naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141100001700158245005600175300001800231520125100249650002601500650001001526650002801536650002401564700001601588773010801604852000901712856008101721930003301802945002501835946001301860655001201873IND4366043020221118221028.0041214s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436604302DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-2000364742doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMurray, T.P.10aCurrent fertilizer salt index tables are misleading  ap. 2867-2873.  aIn the 1940s, fertilizer materials that were available at that time were evaluated for changes that occurred in the soil solution osmotic pressure upon application. The term "salt index" was then used to compare the increase in osmotic pressure for 45 fertilizer materials against the same weight of sodium nitrate. During the 1950s a simplified laboratory method was developed where salt index was measured by electrical conductance rather than by osmotic pressure. Current salt-index tables in fertilizer references have combined the values from the two methods. The objective of this study was to evaluate five potassium (K) sources by the electrical-conductance method. Sources included potassium chloride, potassium sulfate, potassium nitrate, sulfate of potash magnesia, and potassium thiosulfate. Salt-index values obtained from the laboratory method are significantly higher than values reported in the original soil study. These differences range from 28.6% for potassium chloride to 141.2% for potassium sulfate. These limited results with potassium fertilizer materials indicate that a new system for evaluation should be developed or that current fertilizer materials should be evaluated under the same set of experimental conditions. 3apotassium fertilizers 3asalts 3aelectrical conductivity 3afertilizer analysis1 aClapp, J.G.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2004, v. 35, no. 19-20 p.2867-2873x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-2000364743Available from publisher's Web site  a20080310b20080404c00000000  aINDdGHKe2005/01/10  aOther US 7aarticle02111naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011000125300001800235520088300253650001901136650004501155650003101200650001901231650001001250650002201260650002001282650001801302650002901320650001501349650002901364653001301393653001401406653001401420653003101434700001701465700001701482700001801499773009401517852000901611930003301620945001301653946001101666655001201677IND2205236120221118221014.0000613e199412  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220523612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDohmen, G.10aCMS in rye: comparative RFLP and transcript analyses of mitochondria from fertile and male-sterile plants  ap. 1014-1018.  aThe mitochondrial (mt) genomes of rye (Secale cereale L.) lines with "normal" and cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) inducing "Pampa" cytoplasm were compared by detailed restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and Northern analyses. RFLP analyses using several heterologous mt genes as probes revealed considerable differences in the overall structure of the two mt genomes. With cob and atpA, the data indicate intragenic re-combination and/or different copy numbers of these genes in the two cytoplasms. In spite of this heterogeneity at DNA level, the transcriptional patterns of nine out of ten mitochondrial genes analysed are unaffected. The exception is in the "Pampa" cytoplasm which contains an additional cob-homologous transcript. Since this transcript is strongly reduced in the presence of restorer genes, it might causally be correlated to the CMS phenotype. 3aSecale cereale 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3acytoplasmic male sterility 3amale fertility 3agenes 3amitochondrial DNA 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3aintragenic recombination 3aDNA probes 3atranscription (genetics) 0acob gene 0aatpa gene 0aatp9 gene 0adifferential transcription1 aHessberg, H.1 aGeiger, H.H.1 aTudzynski, P.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1994 Dec., v. 89, no. 7/8 p.1014-1018x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01843naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002200115245005300137300001600190300002300206520089300229650002401122650002201146650002001168650000901188650002301197653001901220653001801239711011901257773008001376852000901456939003301465945000801498946001101506655001201517991561191330742620221118220757.0830916s1982    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI830024512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParkinson, Susan.10aNutrition in the South Pacific--past and present  ap. 121-125.  ap. 121-125 charts.  aNutritional aspects of the past and present for peoples of the South Pacific are discussed, with emphasis on various nutrients and current dietary patterns.

People planned their food supplies for protection against hardship; this is no longer necessary since international food aid is always available. However, the carefully balanced nutritional status of the South Pacific peoples has been endangered by the uncontrolled introduction of foreign foods. While it is probably impossible to reverse modern trends, countries should seriously consider the health and economic problems which will arise from an increasing dependence on imported cereals, fats, and sugar.

Percentages of children of different heights whose weights were 110-120% (overweight) and over 120% (obese) of the mean weight value (as well as below 80% and from 80-90%) are given. It appeared that between 4-10% of the boys should be classed as obese, and a further 7-13% as overweight. For girls, these values were 6-9% and 6-16% for obese and overweight, respectively. About 1-5% of the boys and 1-6% of the girls were below the 80% weight-for-height standard, and might be considered as marasmic. Using the median weights and heights from the Boston growth series, about 10% of the boys and 13% of the girls would be classed as obese, with an additional 22% of the boys and 20% of the girls considered as overweight. As much public concern should be expressed about the underweight children as about those overweight.

The risk of abnormal fetal development in this area is statistically associated with consumption of water which has 3 or more times the nitrate level found in the drinking water of other nearby areas. Mean nitrate concentrations were reported for 4 seasons of the year in both the low nitrate areas and other areas. Wide variations occur by season and vegetable type. The highest nitrate value was found in lettuce and the lowest in onions. Comparison was also made to values reported for the same vegetables grown in the US. There was no suggestion of an overall elevation in the nitrate content of samples from this area of Australia.

Probes coding for cob, coxI, coxII and atp6 did not detect differences between the CMS lines and male-fertile lines. atpA transcripts seemed to be dependent on the cytotype but were not related to the CMS trait in the genotypes studied. However, the atp9 probe detected transcripts of 500 and 1,100 nt in the CMS-PEF1, while the fertile forms showed a single transcript of 650 nt. Nuclear genes that restore fertility specifically rectified this alteration, suggesting that modified atp9 transcripts are associated with CMS in PEF1 sunflower. Cloning and sequencing of atp9 from CMS-PEF1 and comparison with the corresponding male-fertile gene showed the insertion of a 0.5-kbp sequence in the 3' UTR of the gene that may be at the origin of the PEF1-CMS and the altered transcripts detected in this study. 3aHelianthus annuus 3acytoplasmic male sterility 3amitochondrial DNA 3agenes 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3anucleotide sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 0amolecular sequence data1 aCrouzillat, D.1 aQuétier, F.1 aLedoigt, G.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2001 June, v. 102, no. 8 p.1185-1189x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02617naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001700141245010200158300001600260520168300276650001301959650001601972650001401988650001602002650001402018650001802032700001502050700001702065700001802082773015002100856004402250852000902294655001202303IND4503575720221118220740.0150202e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450357572DNAL7 a10.13031/aea.30.105502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Hanping10aDevelopment of a Pincette-Type Pick-Up Device for Automatic Transplanting of Greenhouse Seedlings  ap. 547-556.  aA new pincette-type pick-up device for automatic transplanting of seedlings in greenhouse was developed and evaluated in a laboratory. The pick-up device is a gantry-structure robotic mechanism consisting of a manipulator, an end-effector and two conveyors. The manipulator consists of a motor, a linear module and a rodless cylinder, which moves the end-effector to the desired working position. The end-effector, which extracts seedlings from a breeding tray, is a pincette-type mechanism using two cylinder fingers and four pins. The conveyors are designed to move the plug tray/pot to the end-effectorâs working space. Being the first prototype, its optimal machine parameters and performance were examined under various conditions. In the optimum tests, it was found that the root lump moisture content exerted the greatest effect on the success ratio in picking up seedlings, followed by other influential factors such as the penetration angle, the seedling age, the extraction speed, and the grasping force of the root lump with the least being the penetration depth. For cauliflower seedlings, when the seedling age was 30 days, the root lump moisture content was 55% to 60%, the penetration angle was 8AÂ°, the penetration depth was 35 mm, the grasping force of the root lump was 4 N, and the extraction speed was 600 mm/s, the best success ratio was achieved. To verify the optimal machine parameters, the performance tests were further conducted. For the four locally produced vegetable seedlings, when the transplanting rate was 22 seedlings/min, the average success ratio in picking up seedlings was 90.14%. The performance of transplanting was satisfactory. 3abreeding 3acauliflower 3aconveyors 3agreenhouses 3aseedlings 3awater content1 aHan, Luhua1 aHu, Jianping1 aKumi, Francis0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2014 July, v. 30, no. 4 p.547-556dAmerican Society of Agricultural EngineerswJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13031/aea.30.10550  aDNAL 7aarticle01628naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001400154245009400168300001600262500001500278520061400293650001600907650001500923650003000938650001800968650001400986650001101000653001501011653002001026653003001046773009201076852000901168856005701177939003301234946001101267655001201278IND8804605820221118220653.0881031e198810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880460582DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0876772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEapen, S.10aCallus induction from mesophyll and hypocotyl protoplasts of mungbean (Vigna radiata (L))  ap. 441-443.  a2019-12-04  aMesophyll and hypocotyl protoplasts were isolated from Vigna radiata using a combination of Cellulase Onozuka RIO (1%) and Macerozyme (0·2%).

FDR-NCO gametes are considered superior to those formed by FDR with crossing over (FDR-CO), which can pass on to the progenies approximately 80% of the heterozygosity and a large fraction of the epistasis. However, 2n-pollen formation by FDR-NCO mechanism requires the incorporation (in homozygous condition) of at least two recessive alleles. In the present work, 40 tetraploid families derived from complete 4x-2x factorial crosses were evaluated under short-day conditions to verify whether or not the postulated genetic superiority of FDR-NCO over FDR-CO gametes holds true for eight quantitative traits in potato. Families were derived from crosses between four 4x commercial cultivars, and a random sample of ten diploid Solanum phureja-haploid S. tuberosum hybrids producing 2n-pollen by either FDR-CO or FDR-NCO. The results indicated no significant superiority of FDR-NCO over FDR-CO families for total tuber yield (TTY) and six other traits (haulm maturity--HM; plant vigor--PV; plant uniformity--PU; eye depth--ED; number of tubers per hill--NTH; and commercial over total yield index--CTI). Based upon cytological observations, the FDR-CO and FDR-NCO gametes are expected to be genetically equivalent for all loci between the centromeres and the chromosomal site of maximum recombination. In our experiment, differences between FDR-CO- and FDR-NCO-derived progenies were not observed for TTY. Therefore, our results can be interpreted as additional evidence for the hypothesis that genes with major effect on TTY expression might have a physical location between centromeres and proximal crossovers in the potato chromosomes. In addition, a similar trend was observed for HM, PV, and ED but apparently not for commercial yield--CY (i.e., tubers with more than 33 mm in diameter). 3acultivars 3ahaploidy 3aloci 3adiploidy 3acrossing over 3asubtropics 3atetraploidy 3ageneral combining ability 3aagronomic traits 3aphotoperiod 3ainterspecific hybridization 3ameiosis 3apollen 3aSolanum tuberosum subsp. andigenum 3aquantitative traits 3aBrazil 0aunreduced gametes 0aSolanum tuberosum 0acrossing 0aSolanum phureja1 aReifschneider, F.J.B.1 aBoiteux, L.S.1 aPeloquin, S.J.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1999 June, v. 98, no. 8 p.1311-1319x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02257naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007300126300001800199520129200217650001701509650001401526650001601540650003801556650001101594650002501605650001401630650002001644653002801664700001501692700001501707700001501722773009201737852000901829930003301838945001301871946001101884655001201895IND2202351420221118221050.0000201e199906  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220235142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKomatsu, S.10aPhosphorylation upon cold stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings  ap. 1304-1310.  aThe response of plants to cold stress is not well understood at the biochemical level, although it has been studied extensively at the ecological level. To investigate whether protein phosphorylation may play an important role in cold stress, we exposed rice seedlings to low temperatures, prepared protein extracts from the leaves and incubated these in the presence of [gamma-(32)P]ATP. The proteins were then separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. While several proteins were found to be phosphorylated upon cold stress one protein, pp35, which has an isoelectric point of 8.0, was more phosphorylated than the others. The pp35 protein was found to be phosphorylated when rice seedlings were incubated for 6 h at 5 degrees C before the leaf protein extract was prepared and radioactive labeling was performed. The pp35 was, however, significantly more phosphorylated in cold-tolerant rice varieties. Antibodies were raised against purified pp35 in adult rabbits. Using this pp35 antibody, which can recognize the RuBisCO large-chain subunit (LSU), and from amino acid sequencing of pp35, we were able to identify and confirm the pp35 protein as the fragment of RuBisCO LSU (EC 4.1.1.39). Phosphorylation of the RuBisCO LSU may be important in cold tolerance. 3aOryza sativa 3aseedlings 3acold stress 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aleaves 3aamino acid sequences 3avarieties 3aphosphoproteins 0amolecular sequence data1 aKaribe, H.1 aHamada, T.1 aRakwal, R.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1999 June, v. 98, no. 8 p.1304-1310x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a20060205b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03078naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001600141245011000157300001600267520164600283650001301929650001201942650001001954650001601964650001201980650001201992650002002004650001302024650001502037650001602052650002502068650001402093650001502107650002102122650001702143650001302160650001102173650001002184650002202194651001002216700001902226700001602245700002002261700002002281700001202301700001402313700001802327773015002345856004402495852000902539655001202548IND4503576420221118220718.0150202e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450357642DNAL7 a10.13031/aea.30.104752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Zhihui10aInfluence of Water Temperature and Spraying Interval on Cooling Effect of Sprinkler System in Dairy Barns  ap. 611-617.  aHeat stress has a detrimental effect on the health and production performance of dairy cattle. In Southeastern China, sprinkle cooling systems are widely used in dairy barns to reduce heat stress of cows. To investigate the system performance, a trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of water temperature and spraying interval on alleviating heat stress of dairy cows. Based on the parity, days in milk, and milk yield, 48 Chinese Holstein dairy cows were assigned to four groups using different treatments: 45 s spraying out of 4.75 min cycle (SIa) or 6.75 min cycle (SIb) by using water from a tank with thermal insulation (TI) or without thermal insulation (NTI). The trial was carried out for two 7-day periods using a nested design. The results showed that water temperature was 2.8Â°C lower for the TI tank than the NTI tank. No differences were observed between the TI and NTI groups in terms of rectal, udder, abdomen, and back temperatures of the cows. Respiration rate and vulva temperature of the cows were lower for TI compared with NTI. Udder, abdomen, and back temperatures were lower for SIb compared with SIa in both TI and NTI group. Vulva temperature and respiration rate were lower for SIb compared with SIa in TI group. Serum concentration of K was higher but Ca and growth hormone were lower for TI compared with NTI. Serum cortisol concentrations were higher for SIa compared with SIb in both TI and NTI groups. Results of the study showed that the cooling effect of the spraying system could be improved in lactating dairy cows by adding thermal insulation for the water tank and reducing the spraying interval. 3aHolstein 3aabdomen 3abarns 3ablood serum 3acalcium 3acooling 3acooling systems 3acortisol 3adairy cows 3aheat stress 3ainsulating materials 3alactation 3amilk yield 3arespiratory rate 3asomatotropin 3aspraying 3audders 3avulva 3awater temperature 3aChina1 aWang, Chaoyuan1 aLi, Baoming1 aZhang, Guoqiang1 aShi, Zhengxiang1 aLi, Hao1 aWang, Hao1 aYuan, Yaoming0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2014 July, v. 30, no. 4 p.611-617dAmerican Society of Agricultural EngineerswJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13031/aea.30.10475  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001800141245010700159300001600266520130600282650000801588650001501596650001101611650002901622650000901651650001801660650001101678650001701689650001601706650001801722650002201740700001701762700002101779700001401800700002001814773015001834856004401984852000902028655001202037IND4503576220221118220707.0150202e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450357622DNAL7 a10.13031/aea.30.105742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Huiling11aADistributed Parameter Model Predictive Control Method for Forced Air Ventilation through Stored Grain  ap. 593-600.  aThe grain temperature and moisture are non-uniformly distributed in grain stores. This article proposed a distributed parameter model predictive control (DP-MPC) method for the forced air ventilation process through stored grain. The goal of DP-MPC was to control the grain temperature and moisture and to save energy. The grain bulk was divided into different control units to consider the distribution of grain bulk characteristics. The controller was designed with a heat and mass transfer predictive model and an objective function. The objective function was solved with particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. In each control cycle, one control unit was taken as the controlled objective. A control unit shift strategy was proposed to shift controlled objectives. Both simulations and experiments were carried out to validate the control effectiveness. Results showed that the proposed DP-MPC method could control the whole grain bulk temperature and moisture content and optimize the system energy consumption. The maximum grain temperature and moisture content differences between the controlled value and the set point were less than 1Â°C and 1%, respectively. The energy consumed during ventilation with the DP-MPC was 15.5% less than that consumed during ventilation without control. 3aair 3aalgorithms 3aenergy 3agrain storage facilities 3aheat 3amass transfer 3amodels 3astored grain 3atemperature 3awater content 3awhole grain foods1 aLiu, Jingyun1 aJayas, Digvir S.1 aWu, Zidan1 aZhou, Xiaoguang0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2014 July, v. 30, no. 4 p.593-600dAmerican Society of Agricultural EngineerswJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13031/aea.30.10574  aDNAL 7aarticle01634naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002200115245006600137300001400203300002200217520077500239650001701014650000901031650002401040651001401064653003301078700002001111700001901131700001901150773007801169852000901247939003301256945000801289946001101297655001201308991561177800742620221118220741.0840127s1983    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840039572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWorsley, Anthony.10aPrimary children's beliefs about Australian dietary practices  ap. 41-42.  ap. 41-42. charts.  aAs part of a national study of the effects of daily physical education, 883 children (10 years of age) in 7 state and territory capitals were asked 6 questions by class teachers on whether Australians ate the right amounts of fruit, vegetables, salt, fatty foods, and sugar, and whether sugar was rich in vitamins, energy, or both. Only 1/3 thought that insufficient fruits and vegetables were consumed, while only 1/4 knew that people consume too much salt. Half the children had erroneous beliefs about the vitamin content of sugar. The results indicate that many children are unaware of current dietary habits, and suggest that primary school nutrition education courses may successfully impart this basic knowledge.

The studies cover: ascorbic acid in 60 samples of 9 brands of frozen vegetables obtained from supermarkets; ascorbic acid retention in a hospital, and an improved cook-freeze system; and the nutritional ascorbic acid status of a meals-on-wheels service. Variations in ascorbic acid content in frozen vegetables ranged from 2 mg/100 g (carrots) to 27 mg/100 g (peas). Retention of ascorbic acid in plated vegetables in hospital meals ranged from 5% (mashed potato) to 42% (baked potato); ascorbic acid losses due to reheating ranged from 1% (baked potato) to 34% (peas), while losses after cooking raw vegetables ranged from 49% (cauliflower) to 74% (cabbage). The average ascorbic acid content of meals-on-wheels meals from the cook-freeze and conventional catering systems were similar, but variations in ascorbic acid content per meal was large for these 2 systems (2-29 mg/meal and 2-35 mg/meal, respectively).

In contrast, the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) research and development model for biopesticide research, that once initiated, utilizes multiple research steps with go and stop decision points that suggest which biopesticides should be developed and maintained in the development stream. The Biopesticide Innovation Chain was implemented to streamline the process and bring the potential biological control agent or biopesticide from the lab bench towards full commercialization and technology adaptation. The prospective biopesticide can be moved through initial in vitro and in vivo screening, field trials, fermentation and formulation development, regulatory consultations, large scale field trials, pilot scale production and commercialization. This model is being used for the development of a high efficacy biopesticide for the control of the fire blight pathogen. To demonstrate the successful use of the AAFC Biopesticide Innovation Chain, this paper summarizes the development of a Pantoea agglomerans-bacteriophage based carrier system, or phage-carrier system, for the control of E. amylovora in the orchard. 3aErwinia amylovora 3abiological control agents 3acommercialization 3afermentation 3afield experimentation 3amodels 3apathogens 3aresearch and development 3ascreening 3astreams 3aCanada1 aBoyetchko, S.

This plant, 2101-1, was a BC(2) derivative from a cross between a potato (+) tomato fusion hybrid backcrossed to potato. Cytological analysis of its somatic chromosomes through genomic in situ hybridisation (GISH) indicated the presence of four genomes of potato with two alien tomato chromosomes, of which one was much smaller than the other. Analysis of chromosome pairing at the pachytene and metaphase-I stages of microsporogenesis indicated that the large and small chromosomes were homologues. Thus, it was a disomic addition for chromosome-10 of tomato. The size difference was found to be due to a deletion. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) experiments, using the telomeric repeat pAtT4 from Arabidopsis thaliana and the sub-telomeric repeat TGRI, showed intact telomeres and sub-telomeres for both alien chromosomes. Thus, the deletion that the smaller of the homologues suffered was interstitial and most probably occurred in the centromeric heterochromatic region of the long arm. The pattern of distribution of large and small chromosomes to telophase-II nuclei during microsporogenesis indicated that the deletion did not affect the meiotic behaviour of the smaller chromosome. In contrast, the frequencies of transmission of the large and the small chromosomes through the female parent, estimated in 96 BC(3) progeny of plants by RFLP and GISH analyses, appeared to be very different, 69.2% and 3.8% respectively. This study also provides evidence that two different chromatids of a pair of homologues, rather than two chromatids of a single chromosome, are most likely to be involved in the origin of a disomic. The aberrant chromosome can be used for the physical mapping of chromosome-10. 3achiasmata 3acytogenetic analysis 3aSolanum tuberosum 3achromosome segregation 3anucleic acid hybridization 3abackcrossing 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3aintergeneric hybridization 3asomatic hybridization 3atelomeres 3achromosome pairing 3achromosome addition 3achromosome transmission 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3ameiosis 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3amicrosporogenesis 3achromosome morphology 3agenomics 3arepetitive sequences 0agenomic in situ hybridization 0ainterstitial deletions 0adeletions 0asubtelomeres 0achromosome disposition 0agametogenesis1 aHuigen, D.J.1 aJacobsen, E.1 aRamanna, M.S.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1999 June, v. 98, no. 8 p.1263-1271x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01760naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245007000132300001400202300002200216500001500238520093600253650002901189650001301218650001401231650002501245650002001270653001701290773007801307852000901385939003301394945000801427946001101435655001201446991561175560742620221118220708.0830513s1982    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI830017822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, B.J.10aWhole body elemental analysis of potassium in fibrocystic disease  ap. 58-59.  ap. 58-59. charts.  a2019-12-06  aA study of total body potassium (TBK) was undertaken in 5 children with fibrocystic disease to accomplish the following; 1) comparison of TBK level in cystic fibrosis (CF) children to healthy children; 2) observation of nutritional therapy effects of CF children and improvement of the disease's management; and 3) investigation of biochemical techniques which can assess nutritional status. Findings suggested that CF children have normal levels of K/kg fat free body mass; therefore, it is assumed their protein concentration/kg fat free body mass is normal. A significant increase (17%) in TBK was found in all subjects as a result of nutritional therapy.

To overcome sexual incompatibilites due to differences in ploidy and endosperm balance numbers, somatic hybrids were made that combine the S. tuberosum and S. commersonii genomes. The resulting somatic hybrid plants are vigorous, but their disease resistance level and their fertility was unknown. We therefore tested the S. commersonii and S. tuberosum source material cv Superior, potato cv Atlantic and six somatic hybrid lines for resistance to a virulent strain of R. solanacearum (race 3, biovar 2) at 28 degrees C. As expected, S. commersonii was significantly more wilt-resistant than the cultivated potatoes. In five of the six somatic hybrid lines, disease resistance levels were similar to that of the resistant S. commersonii parent. The resistance level of the sixth somatic hybrid was intermediate, significantly different from both S. commersonii and S. tuberosum. In controlled crosses, the somatic hybrids in this study proved both to be male- and female-fertile and were self-compatible. More importantly, the somatic hybrids can be crossed with S. tuberosum to produce viable seeds. 3aseed germination 3acultivars 3aplant breeding 3aSolanum commersonii 3asomatic hybridization 3achromosome number 3aSolanum tuberosum 3afemale fertility 3amale fertility 3adisease resistance 3aPseudomonadaceae 3aRalstonia solanacearum 3ainterspecific hybridization 3apollen 0awilts 0alines 0aploidy 0aself compatibility1 aHelgeson, J.P.1 aAllen, C.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1999 June, v. 98, no. 8 p.1272-1278x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01574naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245004500135300001000180300002100190520076800211650001300979650001800992650001601010650002601026650001401052650001501066651001101081653001901092773007601111852000901187939003301196945000801229946001101237655001201248991561175220742620221118220430.0830513s1982    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI830017762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHambreus, Leif.14aThe diet and exercise campaign in Sweden  ap. s.  ap.34-40. charts.  aA campaign to facilitate collaboration between interest groups interested in diet and exercise was launched. Establishment of a national food and nutrition policy is not an easy task but efforts were made involving the media, commercial section, and nutritionists to get the public and the politicians aware of how dietary intake affects public health. The major obstacles were confrontation between various interests in food production and food consumption. It was determined that scientific data is needed to establish well-balanced nutritional recommendations and introduce them to all sectors of society. Food habits can be changed but time and support are needed to accomplish the goal of adequate nutritional intake and appropriate energy expenditure.

The behaviors of RACs under working environments are very important, especially in the new environments such as ozone appeared with widening of the application fields. The effects of ozone degradation on pure epoxy cured with anhydride and the influence of carbonyl Fe on the degradation of epoxy are studied. The results indicate that if the peak at 1,510 cm⁻¹ was used as the inner standard, the intensity of absorption peaks at 1,738, 1,247 and 1,182 cm⁻¹ increases with exposure time for pure epoxy resin, while for the carbonyl iron/epoxy coatings, the three peaks changes insignificantly with the exposure time. The results indicates the oxidation process begins at the hydroxyl and methyl groups, and finally ozonide and carbonyl are formed on the surface for pure epoxy, and epoxy is eroded gradually in depth by ozone. Carbonyl iron could hinder the meeting of ozone with epoxy with dilution or hindrance effect and could protect epoxy resin from ozone and thus delay the deterioration of the coating performance. 3aabsorption 3acoatings 3aepoxides 3aexposure duration 3airon 3aoxidation 3aozone 3aradar1 aWang, Haifeng1 aWang, Haiyan1 aLiu, Qiuyun1 aHao, Wenguang0 tJournal of polymers and the environment.g2009 Sept., v. 17, no. 3 p.159-164dSpringer USx1566-25437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10924-009-0133-z3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02042naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245010500162300001600267500002400283520095000307650004401257650002501301650002301326650003801349650002601387650002401413650001201437650001801449650001601467700001601483773011101499852000901610856008501619655001201704IND4430458720221118220418.0091225s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443045872DNAL7 a10.1007/s10924-009-0132-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeleş, Elif10aSynthesis of Segmented Polyurethane Based on Polymeric Soybean Oil Polyol and Poly (Ethylene Glycol)  ap. 153-158.  aIncludes references  aPolyurethane (PUR) plastic sheets were prepared by reacting hydroxylated polymeric soybean oil (PSbOH) synthesized from autoxidized soybean oil with polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the presence of isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI).

The steady-state levels of mRNA-encoding ubiquitin, HSP70, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) increased and patatin transcript levels decreased within 45 minutes of impact injury. Nuclear runoff assays were used to demonstrate that the changes in steady-state transcript levels were due, at least in part, to changes in the rate of transcription for these genes. The observed changes in transcript levels were confined to the injured portion of the tuber. Treatment of tubers with exogenous ethylene elicited the same changes in the steady-state transcript levels as impact injury, indicating a potential role for this hormone in the injury-induced regulation of these genes. Two other forms of physical stress, heat shock and cutting injury, resulted in patterns of gene expression that are different from those induced by impact injury. The stress-induced regulation of these four gene families is complex, even though several characteristics of their expression are similar. 3aheat shock proteins 3aethylene 3amessenger RNA 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aheat stress 3agene expression 3atubers 3atranscription (genetics) 3apatatin 3aubiquitin 3amultigene family 0aheat shock protein 70 0atranscripts 0aabiotic stress 0aplant proteins1 aBelknap, W.R.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1991 June, v. 16, no. 6 p.1009-1018x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01193naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245011300143300001800256520027500274650001000549650001400559650001900573650001200592650001500604650001400619700001700633700002100650700001500671700001700686773009700703852000900800939003300809946001300842655001200855IND9104173320221118220657.0911021e199105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910417332DNAL7 a163484952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRao, J.R.10aBiotransformation of the pentahydroxy flavone quercetin by Rhizobium loti and Bradyrhizobium strains (Lotus)  ap. 1563-1565.  aLotus rhizobia catabolized quercetin in an arabinose-based medium via a novel form of C-ring cleavage, yielding phloroglucinol and protocatechuic acid.

In three trials, raw salmon fillets were surface inoculated with L. monocytogenes, marinated, smoked at 26 to 30 degrees C, and stored at 4 or 10 degrees C for up to 30 days. At different times during the fabrication and storage, samples were taken and, by means of the three-tube most probable number (MPN) method, quantitatively analyzed for the concentration of L. monocytogenes. The initial Listeria levels in the raw fillets were 10(4) MPN/g in trial 1, 10(1) MPN/g in trial 2, and 10(2) MPN/g in trial 3. During the fabrication, neither an increase nor a decrease of the inoculated quantities was observed. During the storage, however, a significant growth was measured in two of three trials; in trial 1, a 2.5 log10 MPN/g increase and in trial 3, an increase of even 4.5 log10 MPN/g. In the second trial, the Listeria level remained about the same. The results indicate the importance of preventing pre- and postprocessing contamination of L. monocytogenes in raw and smoked salmon. Because a significant increase of L. monocytogenes was measured during storage,there might be an increasing risk of infection for the consumer by storing such fish for a long time. 3aListeria monocytogenes 3asmoked fish 3asalmon 3atemperature 2aAnimals 2aChemistry, Physical 2aDrug Resistance, Microbial 2aFood Contamination 2aFood Microbiology 2aFood Preservation 2aFreezing 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aListeria monocytogenesxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aListeriosisxprevention & control 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aSalmonxmicrobiology 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 2aTemperature 0asmoking1 aJemmi, T.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1991 May, v. 57, no. 5 p.1523-1527x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01705naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245009200131300001600223520067400239650001100913650002600924650001200950650002400962650001600986650002001002650001501022650001101037653001901048653001201067653003801079700001801117700001901135773013401154852000901288939003301297946001301330655001201343IND9102185920221120150138.0910514e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910218592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaczperski, M.P.10aGrowth and development of Petunia X hybrida as a function of temperature and irradiance  ap. 232-237.  aPetunia X hybrida 'Snow Cloud' plants were grown under 25 temperature combinations ranging from 10 to 30C and at photosynthetic photon flux levels of 100 or 200 micromole.s-1.m-2 (6.5 and 13 mol.day-1.m-2, respectively).

Selected empirical results from experiments on student subjects from three universities are reported. Three issues are considered. First, the reasons for choice and the understanding of a choice problem are examined. Second, attitudes towards different levels of uncertainty are measured. Third, the possibility that apparently non-normative psychological factors influence choice is explored. The paper serves to illustrate and support a number of methodological points. The major points are that a risk-uncertainty distinction is useful (contrary to the aging conventional wisdom of economic theory), that laboratory experiments can potentially provide data of use to agricultural economists, and that predictive models of choice under uncertainty may be more accurate if they take account of psychological variables which influence the decision-making processes of human subjects. 3arisk 3aattitudes and opinions 3auncertainty 3afarm management 3aeconomic theory 3aprobability analysis 3awillingness to pay 3aprobabilistic models 3adecision making 0aagricultural economics 0aexperiments 0aliterature reviews 0aincentives 0aweighting 0asubject expected utility theory0 tAgricultural economics.g1990 June, v. 4, no. 2 p.145-163x0169-51507nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02493naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245011100131300001600242520151600258650002201774650001101796650002201807650001901829650002301848650002001871650001201891650002301903650001401926653001401940653001601954700001901970773010101989852000902090939003302099946001102132655001202143IND9102162420221120134006.0910513e199012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910216242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoutherton, S.G.10aChanges in phenolic acid levels in wheat leaves expressing resistance to Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici  ap. 437-450.  aLevels of individual phenolic acids were examined in primary leaves of wheat (Triticum aestivum) after inoculation with avirulent and virulent strains of the leaf rust fungus (Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici) at stages when previous work had shown fungal and host cells to be affected by expression of the Lr20 or Lr28 alleles for resistance. The predominant phenolic acid, ferulic acid, as well as p-coumaric and syringic acids were detected in primary leaves in both unbound and bound forms. They were not detected in germinating urediniospores of either rust strain. Levels of unbound phenolic acids changed little in response to infection. In Lr28-bearing leaves inoculated with an avirulent strain, increased concentrations of bound phenolic acids and three other unidentified compounds were observed about 4 h after many single or small groups of cells had undergone hypersensitive collapse. In an Lr20-bearing cultivar, levels of bound phenolic acids fell in leaves inoculated with either a virulent or avirulent rust strain. Coniferyl aldehyde and coniferyl alcohol were not detected in healthy or inoculated leaves of either wheat cultivar. Attempts to affect expression of resistance by application of inhibitors of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase were not successful and both wheat cultivars remained resistant to avirulent rust strains. The bound phenolic acids which accumulate in cells undergoing a hypersensitive response may play a role in resistance of Lr28-bearing wheat to the leaf rust fungus. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aleaves 3achemical analysis 3aphenolic acids 3aPuccinia recondita 3agene expression 3aalleles 3adisease resistance 3ainfection 0aresponses 0ainoculation1 aDeverall, B.J.0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g1990 Dec., v. 37, no. 6 p.437-450x0885-57657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02491naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245007200143300001400215500015200229520092300381650002301304650001301327650001201340650001401352650001801366650001801384650003001402650001501432650001501447650003101462650006501493650004701558650003201605650001501637650002201652650003101674650003001705650001501735650002401750650003801774653001601812700001801828773009801846852000901944939003301953946001101986655001201997IND9102089420221120133947.0910507e199101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910208942DNAL7 a20187072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, W.E.10aIdentification of foodborne pathogens by nucleic acid hybridization  ap. 67-76.  aPaper presented at the "JUMS-ICFMH 14th International Symposium on Gram-Negative Pathogens in Food," August 14-19, 1990, Bolkesjo, Telemark/Norway.  aNucleic acid hybridization methods have been developed and used to identify microorganisms in foods. Tests performed on mixed cultures save the time required to establish pure cultures. Enterotoxigenic or invasive strains of foodborne bacterial pathogens are detected with probes that identify genes responsible for virulence. Hybridization tests signal the presence or absence of a particular strain or an entire genus and are especially well suited for screening foods for specific pathogens. With the colony hybridization assay format, foodborne bacteria harboring a specific gene can be enumerated. However, hybridization tests require the presence of 10(5) to 10(6) cells to yield a positive result, thereby limiting sensitivity and necessitating a time-consuming growth step. In vitro DNA amplification techniques increase the amount of DNA segments 10(5)-10(6) fold in 2 to 3 h, thus enhancing test sensitivity. 3afood contamination 3abacteria 3aviruses 3apathogens 3afood analysis 3arapid methods 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aDNA probes 3aRNA probes 3anucleic acid hybridization 2aBacteriaxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aBacterial Infectionsxprevention & control 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aDNA Probes 2aFood Microbiology 2aNucleic Acid Hybridization 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA Probes 2aVirulencexgenetics 2aVirusesxisolation & purification 0agene probes1 aKeasler, S.P.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g1991 Jan., v. 12, no. 1 p.67-76x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01623naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245013100130300001600261520065900277650002600936650002300962650001300985650001200998650001801010650001801028650002201046651001601068700001701084700002001101700001801121773009101139852000901230939003301239946001301272655001201285IND9102092420221120134135.0910508e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910209242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllardyce, R.A.10aSerological identification of Serratia entomophila, a bacterial pathogen of the New Zealand grass grub (Costelytra zealandica)  ap. 250-254.  aA competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to examine the antigenic relationships between strains of the bacterium Serratia entomophila and other members of the genus.

No circasemilunar synchronization occurred during moulting to thelast larval instar and early imaginal disc development (stages 1 and 2). Circasemilunar cohorts of larvae with increasing imaginal discsand reinforced larval growth started from stage 3 of the 4th instar (at 19 degrees C) every 15days (morphologically observable circasemilunar switching point). They mainly passed stage 4 ondays 9-13 of the semimonthly zeitgeber cycle. They reached the prepupal stage after about 11days and emerged a few days later on days 10-12 of the following semimonthly cycle, i.e.about two weeks from stage 4 onwards. Between stages 1-9 a 260% increase in the body weight occurred at19 degrees C and even 420% occurred at 11 degrees C. Within this temperature range, both the developmental time and the rate of imaginal disc development were temperature-compensated betweenthe circasemilunar switching point and pupation. The ecdysteroid contents of stages 1-7 of the last larval instarwere generally low (140-250 ng ecd. equiv. g-1 dry wt). They increased to about 640ng during the prepupa, and to 1330 ng during the early pupal stage. In advance of the switching point, a pronounced small rise in the ecdysteroid contents of the whole larva was observed in only some samples of stage 2, butthis was always in an appropriate temporal correlation with the switching point on days2-5 of the semimonthly zeitgeber cycle. The results are discussed with regard to the temporal programmingof metamorphosis by a developmental modulator factor which in the case of Clunio isunder the control of the circasemilunar clock mechanism. 3aChironomidae 3aaquatic insects 3abiological development 3abiological rhythms 3abody weight 3alaboratory techniques 3ametamorphosis 3aecdysteroids 3atemperature1 aSpindler, K.D.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1991, v. 37, no. 2 p.101-109x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02055naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002600115245007300141300001400214520107700228650002401305650002301329650002101352650001601373650001801389650001401407651001001421653003001431653002101461653002201482700002201504700001801526773008601544852000901630939003301639945000801672946001301680655001201693991597526880742620221120124437.0811027e198106  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810019112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNewman, Jacqueline M.10aPerspectives on food and nutrition in the People's Republic of China  ap. 43-45.  aChina's food distribution, nutrition education, community nutrition, and nutrition research were investigated in 1980 by a group of American nutritionists and food writers in an exchange of information and ideas. Observations of note included an increase in the variety of foods available at local markets (since 1978), a concomitant interest in nutrition education programs, and a desire of Chinese nutrition professionals to learn from the research efforts of others. It was estimated that the average Chinese diet consists of 65% beans and cereals, 27% fruits and vegetables, 4% meat, and small amounts (1%) of fats, eggs, milk, and other foods. "Sharing" is the term applied to those items which are rationed--mostly grains. Research activities are being pursued in many areas: the development of nutritionally fortified weaning foods, Keshan's disease, food oil extraction from wild plants, pesticide use, and cancer treatment. Incidences of infectious and deficiency diseases have dropped dramatically but those of cardiovascular diseases and cancer have risen.

The objective of this research was to develop adapted dwarf bean populations having a commercial seed quality and yield suitable for the production in the South of Europe. The original base populations were produced from crosses between genotypes within each Mesoamerica, Nueva Granada and Peru races, and between Peru and Nueva Granada, and Mesoamerica and Nueva Granada races. Visual mass selection for plant performance was practised in the F₂ and F₃ generations. In the F₄ and F₅, single plants were harvested under two cropping systems (sole cropping and intercropping with maize). From F₄, selection was based on precocity, combined with seed yield and seed commercial type. The F₄:₇ selected lines from each original population were compared with their parents and five checks at four environments and two cropping systems. Differences among environments, populations, parents and checks were observed for all traits. Under intercropping with maize, there was a 50% reduction in seed yield. Yield of parents and checks belonging to Andean South American races, intraracial (Nueva Granada × Nueva Granada) and interracial (Nueva Granada × Peru) populations, was higher than that of those of Middle American origin. Intraracial crosses within large-seeded Andean South American (Peru race) and Middle American gene pools (Mesoamerica race) did not produce lines yielding more than the highest yielding parent. Only two large-seeded lines selected from crosses between small- and large-seeded gene pools out-yielded the best parent and check cultivar.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultivars 3aplant breeding 3abeans 3aZea mays 3agenetic improvement 3acorn 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3ayield components 3aintercropping 3asustainable agriculture 3aartificial selection 3aSpain 0aseed weight 0acrop yield1 aLema, M.1 aRodiño, A.

R785-R791.  aFormerly or reduced-obese (RO) subjects exhibit diminished systemic energy requirements for weight maintenance. Based on studies in animals and humans, there is reason to believe that the autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays an important role in coordinate regulation of energy metabolism and may be altered in the RO state. We have, therefore, investigated aspects of autonomic physiology in obese (OB), RO, and never obese (NO) subjects subjected to insulin-mediated hypoglycemia and incremental intravenous infusions of epinephrine. Total catecholamine secretion during insulin-induced hypoglycemia was significantly lower in the RO. The RO showed increased sensitivity to in vivo lipolytic and cardiovascular effects of endogenous and infused catecholamines. In these studies, OB subjects responded more like the NO subjects than did the RO. The RO display characteristic changes in autonomic status that may play a role in their enhanced energy efficiency. 3aobesity 3acatecholamines 3ahypoglycemia 3aenergy expenditure 3aenergy metabolism 3alipolysis 3ahemodynamics 3asympathetic nervous system1 aBerry, E.M.1 aHirsch, J.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g1991 Apr., v. 260, no. 4:pt.2 p.R785-R791x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02535naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245016800126300001600294520160600310650001201916650001901928650001701947650000901964653002301973653003101996700001802027700001502045700002002060773008802080852000902168939003302177946001102210655001202221IND9102216720221120072043.0910516e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910221672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruce, M.E.14aThe disease characteristics of different strains of scrapie in Sinc congenic mouse lines: implications for the nature of the agent and host control of pathogenesis  ap. 595-603.  aMouse lines which are congenic for Sinc, the major gene controlling scrapie incubation period, have been produced by selective breeding from the inbred C57BL(Sincs7) and VM(Sincp7) strains; the s7 allele of Sinc has been introduced into a VM background by 18 serial backcrosses, at each generation selecting on the basis of the incubation period with the ME7 scrapie strain. The characteristics of the disease produced by seven scrapie strains have been compared in Sincs7 and Sincp7 congenic mice and in the F1 cross between them. As previously found in non-congenic mice, each scrapie strain has a characteristic, precisely reproducible incubation period pattern in the three Sinc genotypes. The Sinc gene controls the incubation period for all scrapie strains tested but the direction of allelic action and the apparent dominance pattern differs between scrapie strains. Comparison with non-congenic mice shows that other genes also have a minor effect on incubation period. The distribution of vacuolar degeneration in the brain depends mainly on the scrapie strain but is also influenced by Sinc and other unspecified mouse genes. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis has already shown that the close linkage between Sinc and the gene encoding PrP has been maintained in the Sinc congenic lines, strengthening the possibility that PrP is the Sinc gene product. The present study confirms that scrapie strains carry information which is independent of the host but nevertheless suggests that host PrP protein interacts with this information to regulate the progression of the disease. 3ascrapie 3aPrPSc proteins 3apathogenesis 3amice 0agenetic regulation 0adisease incubation periods1 aMcConnell, I.1 aFraser, H.1 aDickinson, A.G.0 tJournal of general virology.g1991 Mar., v. 72, no. pt.3 p.595-603x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01835naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245006300131300001600194520097300210650001701183650001401200650001201214650001901226650002101245650001101266650001301277651002101290653001101311653001201322653003901334773006901373852000901442939003301451946001301484655001201497IND9102197820221120063804.0910515e199104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910219782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBallantyne, D.J.10aShoot growth and gross photosynthesis of evergreen azaleas  ap. 377-380.  aThe influence of photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and gibberellic acid (GA3) sprays on shoot elongation was determined for 'Coral Bells' (Kurume or R. obstusum hybrid), 'Fashion' (Glen Dale or R. indicum X Kurume hybrid), 'Hexe' (R. obtusum X R. simsii hybrid), 'Hinocrimson' (Kurume or R. obtusum hybrid), 'Hinodegiri' (Kurume or R. obtusum hybrid), and 'Red Wing' (Brooks hybrid) azalea.

Significantly more N was absorbed by plants with low root elongation rate compared with plants with high root elongation rate. About 70% of the N absorbed by plants with low root elongation rate was allocated to the mature leaves compared to 35% on plants with high root elongation rate. It was evident that root growth activity influenced N absorption and allocation. Although only a small amount of the N absorbed by plants with low root elongation rates was allocated to the immature leaves, significantly more N was allocated to the immature leaves by plants with high root elongation rates. It is possible that the N necessary to support immature leaf growth, when root elongation rate is low, is provided by mobilization from other parts, possibly mature leaves. 3anutrient transport 3aViburnum odoratissimum 3anursery crops 3aplant nutrition 3anitrogen 3anutrient uptake 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3anutrient partitioning 3aseasonal variation 3aroot growth 3aornamental woody plants 3aammonium nitrate 3aleaves 0atemporal variation1 aYeager, T.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2007, v. 30, no. 1-3 p.487-496dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070919b20071002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/09/05  aOther US 7aarticle03391naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100002200137245010500159300001600264500002400280500001500304520180800319650002402127650002402151650001902175650000902194650001702203650001902220650001502239650002302254650001302277650002202290650001702312650002302329650001102352650000902363650002102372650002502393650002002418650002202438650001302460651000902473653002302482700001502505700001502520700001602535773008902551852000902640856009302649930003302742945002502775946001302800655001202813IND4390643320221122173714.0070424s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439064332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF110 0aP210 0aJ5001 aDehghanisanij, H.10aEffects of Deficit Irrigation and Fertilizer Use on Vegetative Growth of Drip Irrigated Cherry Trees  ap. 411-425.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effects of deficit irrigation and fertilizer use under drip irrigation (DI), on vegetative growth of mature cherry trees were studied in two field experiments. Treatments for the assessment of deficit irrigation consisted of two drip line arrays: double drip lines (T1) and loop (T2) as main treatments. Three irrigation levels: irrigation at 100% of crop evapotranspiration (ETc or I1), 75% ETc or I2, and 50% ETc or I3, constituted the sub-treatments. To assess soil fertility practices, the main treatments consisted of T1 and single drip line (T3) arrays; sub-treatments were two fertilizer regimes: basic fertilizer recommendation plus 0.5 m3 sheep manure per tree (F1) and basic fertilizer recommendation plus 1300 g potassium sulfate, 350 g of zinc (Zn), 140 g of iron (Fe), and 600 g ammonium phosphate (F2). Total irrigation amount, which was applied routinely in control treatment (7466.7 m3ha(-1)), was less than the crop water requirement (8764.5 m3 ha(-1)). A significant correlation between both the length of young branches and canopy volume with annual applied irrigation water was observed. Mean canopy volume under T1 was 26.0 m3 tree(-1), which was significantly less than 28.6 m3 tree(-1) under T2. Water use efficiency (kg m(-3)) was increased by water stress, but there was no significant yield reduction from I1 to I2. Concentration of Fe, phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and magnesium (Mg) in leaf samples increased with the use of double drip lines array compared to use of single drip line array and it was higher under F2 fertilizer level. The concentration of calcium (Ca) in leaf samples was higher than critical level in all treatments. We conclude that I2 irrigation level and F2 fertilizer management was the most efficient practice for cherry trees in the study area. 3aammonium phosphates 3amineral fertilizers 3aanimal manures 3airon 3awater stress 3asoil fertility 3atree crown 3adeficit irrigation 3abranches 3avegetative growth 3aPrunus avium 3aevapotranspiration 3avolume 3azinc 3afertilizer rates 3awater use efficiency 3amicroirrigation 3apotassium sulfate 3acherries 3aIran 0airrigation systems1 aNaseri, A.1 aAnyoji, H.1 aEneji, A.E.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2007, v. 30, no. 1-3 p.411-425dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070920b20071002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/09/05  aOther US 7aarticle02671naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001900161245009100180300001600271500002400287520106600311650002601377650001401403650001601417650001301433650001401446650002601460650001001486650000801496650003601504650001801540650001401558650001201572650001701584650001301601650001601614650002201630650001901652650002101671650002101692650002201713650002701735650003501762650000701797650002101804773010701825852000901932856009301941930003302034945002502067946001302092655001202105IND4390640520221122135144.0070424s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439064052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The plants were hydroponically grown in a greenhouse and subjected to three levels of N (0.1, 1.0, and 10 mM N) and three levels of K (0.02, 0.2, and 2 mM K). Nitrogen and K stress altered the xylem sap composition. Nitrogen stress significantly reduced nitrate (NO3(-)), ammonium (NH4(+)), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and amino acid content and increased the pH, phosphorus (P), and K content. Whereas, K stress significantly decreased pH, K, NH4(+), and amino acid content but increased Ca, Mg, and P content. Nitrogen and K stress had opposing effects on xylem sap pH and osmolality. Results indicated that sugarcane plants recycle compounds between the phloem and xylem. The results also suggested that the NO3(-) and K concentration of xylem sap could be effectively used to estimate the N and K status of the soil solution. 3aSaccharum officinarum 3asugarcane 3asugar crops 3anitrogen 3apotassium 3anutrient availability 3axylem 3asap 3achemical constituents of plants 3aroot exudates 3acultivars 3adrought 3awater stress 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3adrought tolerance 3asalt tolerance 3aapplication rate 3anitrate nitrogen 3aammonium nitrogen 3aamino acid composition 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3apH 3aosmotic pressure0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2007, v. 30, no. 1-3 p.187-201dDekkerwJournal:jnl43215x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070919b20071002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/09/05  aOther US 7aarticle03195naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001500161245006100176300001600237500002400253500001500277520172300292650002002015650001402035650000902049650001202058650001702070650001402087650002102101650001602122650002602138650002602164650002302190650002502213650002202238650002802260650001002288650001102298653002802309700001602337700001402353700001802367773010702385852000902492856009302501930003302594945002502627946001302652655001202665IND4390640220221122135131.0070424s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439064022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A hydroponic study was conducted to compare Si requirements of three high yielding, nitrogen (N) responsive, coarse varieties of rice (KSK-133, PK-3717-12, and IRRI-6) with four low yielding, lodging susceptible, fine varieties of rice (BAS-191, BAS-385, BAS-370, and PK-3300). Two-week-old uniform seedlings were grown in half strength Johnson's nutrient solution containing 0, 25, 75, and 150 mg Si kg(-1) as sodium silicate. The plants were allowed to grow for 45 days after transplanting. Silicon application significantly (P less than or equal to 0.01) increased root and shoot dry matter production in all the rice varieties. The maximum shoot dry matter production occurred at 75 mg Si kg(-1) and decreased uniformly in all the rice varieties at 150 mg Si kg(-1). However, growth response to Si application varied significantly (P less than or equal to 0.01) among various rice varieties. Root: shoot growth ratio, varying from 0.11 to 0.15, did not follow any trend. Different rice varieties and Si addition had a significant (P less than or equal to 0.01) main and interactive effect on concentration and total uptake of Si in rice root and shoot. Relative increases in Si content, both in shoot and root, were gradual and several fold with increasing rates of Si application. The effect was more pronounced in Basmati varieties (BAS-198, BAS-385, and BAS-370) than other varieties. A 0.91 mg Si g(-1) plant tissue was optimum for growth of KSK-133 (coarse), which was significantly higher than the optimum level, 0.62 mg Si g(-1) plant tissue, for Bas-370 (fine). However, further verification of the results is warranted under field situation. 3asodium silicate 3acultivars 3arice 3asilicon 3aOryza sativa 3aseedlings 3afertilizer rates 3ahydroponics 3anutrient partitioning 3anutrient requirements 3anutrient solutions 3aplant micronutrients 3agenetic variation 3adry matter partitioning 3aroots 3ashoots 0adry matter accumulation1 aRahmatullah1 aIrfan, M.1 aMaqsood, M.A.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2007, v. 30, no. 1-3 p.163-170dDekkerwJournal:jnl43215x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070920b20071002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/09/05  aOther US 7aarticle04194naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004600111040001800157072000900175072000900184100002500193245009700218300001800315500002400333520219100357650001502548650001502563650001902578650002102597650001602618650001302634650000902647650001602656650002802672650002102700650002302721650001502744650001202759650002302771650001202794650001102806650002602817650003002843650001302873650005102886650002002937650001402957650000902971650001602980651001002996651001003006653003703016653002403053700002203077700001903099700001903118700001703137700001703154700001803171700002203189773009603211852000903307856009703316930003303413945002503446946001303471655001203484IND4390669120140723000000.0070426e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439066912DNAL7 a174124092pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2007.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL3001 aGarcía-Ispierto, I.10aClimate factors affecting conception rate of high producing dairy cows in northeastern Spain  ap. 1379-1385.  aIncludes references  aSummer heat stress is a main factor related to low conception rate in high producing dairy herds in warm areas worldwide. We assessed the impact of several climate variables on conception rate in high producing dairy cows in northeastern Spain by examining 10,964 inseminations. The temperature-humidity index (THI) was compared with maximum temperature in terms of its efficiency at predicting conception rate. The following data were recorded for each animal: herd, lactation number, insemination number, insemination date, inseminating bull, and AI technician along with climate variables such as mean and maximum temperatures, rainfall, mean and maximum THI for individual time points Days 7 to 1 before insemination, the day of insemination and 1, 2 and 3 days after insemination. Averages were also established for the following periods: from 7 days before insemination to the insemination day, from 3 days before insemination to the insemination day and from the insemination day to 3 days postinsemination. Based on the odds ratios, the likelihood of conception rate increased significantly by factors of 1.48, 1.47, 1.5, and 1.1 for the respective maximum THI classes <70, 71-75, 76-80, and 81-85 only on Day 3 before AI, while on the insemination day, it increased by factors of 1.73, 1.53, 1.11, and 1.3 for the respective maximum THI classes <70, 71-75, 76-80, and 81-85. In a subsequent logistic regression excluding mean and maximum THI, the effectiveness of temperature at predicting conception rate was evaluated. Although high, the fit of the second logistic regression model was slightly lower than that of the full model (P = 0.88 versus P = 0.98, respectively) and the information provided by the THI model. The likelihood of conception rate increased significantly by factors of 1.5, 1.2, 1.0, 1.0 for the respective maximum temperature classes <20, 21-25, 26-30, 31-35 °C on Day 1 after AI. The choice of the THI or temperature to monitor the farm environment would have to depend on the particular farm and situation. In our study conditions, the use of maximum temperature alone gives a new point of view regarding the information provided by the THI variables. 3adairy cows 3aconception 3apregnancy rate 3aclimatic factors 3atemperature 3ahumidity 3arain 3aheat stress 3aartificial insemination 3afemale fertility 3astatistical models 3aprediction 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aClimate 2aFemale 2aFertilityxphysiology 2aFertilizationxphysiology 2aHumidity 2aInsemination, Artificialxmethodsxveterinary. 2aLogistic Models 2aPregnancy 2aRain 2aTemperature 3aSpain 0aSpain 0atemperature-humidity index (THI) 0amaximum temperature1 aLópez-Gatius, F.1 aBech-Sabat, G.1 aSantolaria, P.1 aYániz, J.L.1 aNogareda, C.1 aDe Rensis, F.1 aLópez-Béjar, M.0 tTheriogenology.g2007 May, v. 67, no. 8 p.1379-1385dButterworth-Heinemannx0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2007.02.0093Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070502b20070602c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/05/02  aOther US 7aarticle02886naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100002100166245008400187300001400271500002400285500001500309520146400324650002101788650001801809650001601827650001801843650003201861650002101893650001401914650002301928650002601951650002001977650002001997653001002017700001302027700002202040700001402062700002002076700001802096773011202114852000902226856008802235930003302323945002502356946001102381655001202392IND4390663820221122060346.0070426e20070515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439066382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2007.01.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL8231 aSwinkels, W.J.C.10aImmune responses to an Eimeria acervulina infection in different broilers lines  ap. 26-34.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe (T-cell) immune responses of two different broiler lines to a primary Eimeria acervulina infection were investigated. The lines used were a commercial fast-growing broiler line and a slow-growing type of broiler as used in organic farming. Seven-day-old broilers of both lines were infected with 5 10⁴ oocysts of E. acervulina. The animals were weighed and a species-specific real-time PCR was used to quantify the total amount of parasites in the duodenum. In the fast-growing line, a lower parasite load was seen from day 4 onwards compared to the slow-growing line. In both lines the intestinal peak of Eimeria DNA was observed at day 5 post infection (p.i.). In the duodenum no increase in CD4+ T-cells was found in both infected lines, but a fast increase in CD8+ T-cells was observed in the fast-growing line. At day 3 p.i. in the slow-growing broilers an IL-18 mRNA response was observed. At day 4 p.i. strong IFN-γ and IL-8 mRNA responses were found in both lines. No IL-4 mRNA responses were found in the duodenum. In conclusion, both lines have different growth rates and control and infected conditions. Based on the kinetics of observed phenomena a primary infection with E. acervulina in 7-day-old broilers seems to generate an early CD8α+ response in fast-growing broilers compared to the slow-growing broilers. This difference in immune reaction after an E. acervulina infection could result in a different Eimeria load in the duodenum. 3abroiler chickens 3aanimal growth 3acoccidiosis 3aT-lymphocytes 3ahost-parasite relationships 3apoultry diseases 3acytokines 3aEimeria acervulina 3aresistance mechanisms 3aimmune response 3aanimal genetics 0alines1 aPost, J.1 aCornelissen, J.B.1 aEngel, B.1 aBoersma, W.J.A.1 aRebel, J.M.J.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2007 May 15, v. 117, no. 1-2 p.26-34dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2007.01.0203Available from publisher's Web site  a20071205b20080102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/11/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02226naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171100001200180245010300192300001600295500002400311520088400335650001301219650002501232650002701257650001301284650001801297650002101315650002501336650002001361650002601381650002901407650002201436700001301458700001301471700001101484773010201495852000901597856009301606930003301699945002501732946001101757655001201768IND4390661720221122060157.0070426e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439066172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2006.12.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ205 0aQ105 0aQ5051 aLiu, J.10aEffects of chitosan on control of postharvest diseases and physiological responses of tomato fruit  ap. 300-306.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of chitosan on gray mould and blue mould caused by Botrytis cinerea and Penicillium expansum in tomato fruit stored at 25 and 2 °C, respectively, were investigated. Chitosan provided an effective control of both diseases of tomato fruit stored at 25 and 2 °C. Chitosan strongly inhibited spore germination, germ tube elongation, and mycelial growth of B. cinerea and P. expansum in vitro, and damaged the plasma membranes of spores of both pathogens. Chitosan treatment induced a significant increase in the activities of polyphenoloxidase (PPO), peroxidase (POD), and enhanced the content of phenolic compounds in tomato fruit. These findings suggest that the effects of chitosan on gray mould and blue mould in tomato fruit may be associated with the direct fungitoxic property against the pathogens, and the elicitation of biochemical defense responses in fruit. 3achitosan 3apostharvest diseases 3apostharvest physiology 3atomatoes 3afood spoilage 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aPenicillium expansum 3aenzyme activity 3apostharvest treatment 3aantimicrobial properties 3afood microbiology1 aTian, S.1 aMeng, X.1 aXu, Y.0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2007 June, v. 44, no. 3 p.300-306dElsevierx0925-52147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2006.12.0193Available from publisher's Web site  a20071015b20071102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/09/21  aNon-US 7aarticle03067naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162100001700171245014900188300001600337500002400353500001500377520161900392650001302011650002602024650002602050650002402076650002102100650002202121650002902143650001202172650002702184650001902211653002502230653002102255700001602276700001502292700001702307773010202324852000902426856009302435930003302528945002502561946001102586655001202597IND4390661620221122060235.0070426e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439066162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2006.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS2001 aRapaka, V.K.10aDiurnal carbohydrate dynamics affect postharvest ethylene responsiveness in portulaca (Portulaca grandiflora 'Yubi Deep Rose') unrooted cuttings  ap. 293-299.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPortulaca (Portulaca grandiflora) is an herbaceous ornamental annual plant that is commonly propagated by shoot-tip cuttings and shipped long distances before they are rooted in greenhouses. During transit and rooting, a significant number of leaves usually abscise, which delays or prevents subsequent rooting. We investigated the effect of preharvest diurnal carbohydrate dynamics on postharvest performance of unrooted shoot-tip cuttings of portulaca 'Yubi Deep Rose'. The production of ethylene was quantified, as well as the efficacy of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) to improve the postharvest performance. The initial carbohydrate concentrations in cuttings increased with later harvest during the day (8 a.m., 12 p.m., and 4 p.m.). When cuttings were placed into a dark postharvest environment at 20 ± 1 °C for 48 h, cuttings harvested at 8 a.m. had complete leaf abscission, whereas only partial leaf abscission was observed in cuttings harvested at 12 p.m. and 4 p.m. Leaf abscission was negatively correlated with preharvest leaf carbohydrate and stem starch concentrations, but not significantly correlated with postharvest ethylene production during storage. Application of 1-MCP improved the storage quality of cuttings, irrespective of the time of cutting harvest, and did not inhibit the rooting response during subsequent propagation. Collectively, these results indicate that with the increase in preharvest endogenous carbohydrate levels of portulaca cuttings, as the photoperiod progresses, subsequent postharvest ethylene responsiveness decreases, but there is no effect on ethylene synthesis. 3aethylene 3apostharvest treatment 3aPortulaca grandiflora 3aethylene production 3adiurnal activity 3aenzyme inhibitors 3acarbohydrate composition 3arooting 3apostharvest physiology 3aplant cuttings 0a1-methylcyclopropene 0aplant physiology1 aFaust, J.E.1 aDole, J.M.1 aRunkle, E.S.0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2007 June, v. 44, no. 3 p.293-299dElsevierx0925-52147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2006.12.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20071015b20071102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/09/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02562naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171100001900180245009600199300001600295500002400311500001500335520113300350650001801483650001401501650001501515650003401530650002301564650001701587650002101604650001801625650001301643650002101656650002501677650001601702650002301718653002501741700001401766700001501780773010201795852000901897856009301906930003301999945002502032946001102057655001202068IND4390661420221122060319.0070426e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439066142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2006.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aQ115 0aQ5051 aSchotsmans, W.10aControlled atmosphere storage of rabbiteye blueberries enhances postharvest quality aspects  ap. 277-285.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBlueberries are highly perishable and therefore it is necessary to develop strategies to increase their storage life.

Measurements of firmness, soluble solids content, titratable acidity, weight loss, shrivel and blemishes were combined with determinations of antioxidant activities and total phenolic content. Weight loss and shrivel were not affected by storage atmosphere or storage duration. After 28 days, controlled atmosphere storage resulted in only half as much blemished fruit compared with storage in regular air. Additionally, fungal development in 'Maru' fruit was minimised by controlled atmosphere storage. Water-soluble extracts from 'Centurion' fruit had higher antioxidant activities and total phenolic content than those from 'Maru' fruit at harvest and after storage in regular air and controlled atmosphere. The highest increases in antioxidant activity and total phenolic content occurred during the additional 6 days of shelf-life at 20 °C. 3afood spoilage 3acultivars 3ashelf life 3acontrolled atmosphere storage 3aVaccinium virgatum 3afood storage 3abruising (plant) 3afruit quality 3afirmness 3afood composition 3aantioxidant activity 3ablueberries 3aphenolic compounds 0apostharvest injuries1 aMolan, A.1 aMacKay, B.0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2007 June, v. 44, no. 3 p.277-285dElsevierx0925-52147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2006.12.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20071015b20071102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/09/21  aNon-US 7aarticle03338naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153100001500162245014500177300001600322500002400338500001500362520202600377650001202403650001002415650002102425650001802446650001302464650001302477650002502490650001502515650002702530653001202557653002502569700001902594700001802613773010202631852000902733856009302742930003302835945002502868946001102893655001202904IND4390660820221122060416.0070426e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439066082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2006.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aValero, C.10aRelationship between nondestructive firmness measurements and commercially important ripening fruit stages for peaches, nectarines and plums  ap. 248-253.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFruit firmness measurement is a good way to monitor fruit softening and to predict bruising damage during harvest and postharvest handling. Ripening protocols traditionally utilize a destructive penetrometer-type fruit firmness measure to monitor ripening. Until recently, methods of assessing fruit texture properties nondestructively were not commercially available. The nondestructive Sinclair iQ firmness tester was investigated to monitor ripening and predict bruising susceptibility in stone fruit. This work was carried out on four peach, three plum, and five nectarine cultivars over two seasons. The correlations between destructive and nondestructive firmness measurements were significant (p-value = 0.0001), although too low for commercial applications as they varied from r2 = 0.60-0.71 according to fruit type. Using a different approach, the relationship between destructive and nondestructive firmness measures was characterized in terms of segregating these fruit according to their stages of ripening. This was done by using discriminant analysis (66-90% agreement in ripeness stage classification was observed in validation tests). Discriminant analysis consistently segregated nondestructive firmness measured fruit into commercially important classes (“ready to eat”, “ready to buy”, “mature and immature”). These represented key ripening stages with different bruising potentials and consumer acceptance. This work points out the importance to relate nondestructive measurements directly to important commercial physiological stages rather than to correlate them with the current standard penetrometer values. Thus, destructive and nondestructive firmness measurements can be directly used to identify the stage of ripeness and potential susceptibility to bruising during postharvest changes. Further work is recommended to evaluate the performance of this nondestructive sensor in segregating fruit according to their stage of ripeness under packinghouse or processing plant conditions. 3apeaches 3aplums 3abruising (plant) 3afruit quality 3afirmness 3aripening 3aqualitative analysis 3anectarines 3anondestructive methods 0asensors 0apostharvest injuries1 aCrisosto, C.H.1 aSlaughter, D.0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2007 June, v. 44, no. 3 p.248-253dElsevierx0925-52147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2006.12.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20071015b20071102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/09/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02991naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180100001600189245014500205300001600350500002400366500001500390520150100405650001401906650001501920650002501935650001401960650003401974650002402008650001702032650001102049650001002060650002102070650002702091650001802118653002402136653002002160700001602180700001602196773010202212852000902314856009302323930003302416945002502449946001102474655001202485IND4390660620221122060241.0070426e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439066062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2006.12.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aQ115 0aF200 0aQ5051 aChope, G.A.14aThe effect of the transition between controlled atmosphere and regular atmosphere storage on bulbs of onion cultivars SS1, Carlos and Renate  ap. 228-239.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aControlled atmosphere storage (CA) is used to increase the storage life of onions; however detrimental effects on the shelf-life have been reported. The effect of the transition between CA (5 kPa CO2, 3 kPa O2) and air (and vice versa) on onion cvs. Renate, Carlos and SS1 in terms of the respiration rate, sprout growth, dry weight, firmness, pungency, total soluble solids, abscisic acid concentration and non-structural carbohydrate composition was assessed. Removal of bulbs from CA storage resulted in an immediate increase in the respiration rate (measured in air), which then reverted to a lower rate following subsequent storage under air conditions for 21 days. In some cultivars, this could be sufficient to trigger the onset of sprouting and thus account for the detrimental effect of CA storage on shelf-life. Delaying the start of CA storage of onions cv. SS1 for 21 days was as effective in suppressing sprout growth as CA storage for 42 days. Further investigation into the use of CA storage in this manner with relation to the optimum time to begin CA conditions could decrease the cost of CA storage without compromising storage life. Abscisic acid concentration has been associated with storage life of onions. There was a significant decrease in the bulb ABA concentration between the time of harvest and the beginning of storage. This is likely to be due to the effects of curing and suggests that current curing practices are having a detrimental effect on storage potential. 3acultivars 3ashelf life 3atemperature profiles 3asprouting 3acontrolled atmosphere storage 3aambient temperature 3afood storage 3aonions 3abulbs 3afood composition 3apostharvest physiology 3aabscisic acid 0aphysical properties 0astorage quality1 aTerry, L.A.1 aWhite, P.J.0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2007 June, v. 44, no. 3 p.228-239dElsevierx0925-52147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2006.12.0183Available from publisher's Web site  a20071015b20071102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/09/21  aNon-US 7aarticle03509naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162100001500171245011300186300001600299500002400315520202700339650001002366650002002376650001802396650001302414650002402427650002702451650001002478650001002488650001402498650001402512650001302526653002502539653002502564700001202589700001402601700001702615700001502632700001702647700001502664700001302679700001402692773010202706852000902808856009302817930003302910945002502943946001102968655001202979IND4390660520221122060146.0070426e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439066052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2006.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aQ5051 aYamane, M.10aDifferential expression of ethylene biosynthetic genes in climacteric and non-climacteric Chinese pear fruit  ap. 220-227.  aIncludes references  aWe investigated the differences in capability to produce ripening-associated ethylene between climacteric ('Yali', 'Xinqingli', and 'Zhuzuili') and non-climacteric ('Hongli', 'Yuanbali', and 'Hongxiaoli') Chinese pear (Pyrus bretschneideri Rehder) fruit varieties. Three ACS (PbACS1, PbACS2, and PbACS3), two ACO (PbACO1 and PbACO2), and three MADS-box (PbMADS1, PbMADS2, and PbMADS3) genes were cloned from ripening fruit. Fruit were harvested at the mature stage and treated with 5000 μL L-1 propylene for 4 days. Ethylene production was induced by propylene in the climacteric but not in non-climacteric type fruit. In the ripening climacteric fruit, PbACS1 and PbACO1 transcript accumulation accompanied ethylene production but the accumulation of other ACS and ACO mRNAs was not detected. In 'Yali' fruit, 1-MCP exposure prior to propylene treatment completely inhibited the expression of these genes, while exposure after the commencement of ethylene production weakened their expression. Transcripts of PbACO1 accumulated in response to propylene treatment even in non-climacteric fruit but this accumulation was eliminated after the termination of propylene treatment. In response to wounding, transcripts of PbACS2, PbACS3, and PbACO2 genes accumulated in both climacteric and non-climacteric fruit, but accumulation of PbACS1 and PbACO1 mRNAs was not detected. In the Southern analysis of PbACS1, HindIII digests of genomic DNA showed 8.3, 3.5 and 2.9 kb bands. The 2.9 kb band was detected only in climacteric varieties while the 3.5 kb band was detected in both climacteric and non-climacteric varieties except in 'Yali'. These results suggest that Chinese pears may have two copies of the ACS1 gene, in which PbACS1A could be linked to the varietal differences in the capability to produce ripening-associated ethylene. There was no correlation between the expression patterns of the three MADS-box genes cloned and the differences in ripening-associated ethylene production among the Chinese pear varieties. 3agenes 3agene expression 3afruit quality 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3apostharvest physiology 3apears 3aPyrus 3acultivars 3apropylene 3aripening 0aPyrus bretschneideri 0a1-methylcyclopropene1 aAbe, D.1 aYasui, S.1 aYokotani, N.1 aKimata, W.1 aUshijima, K.1 aNakano, R.1 aKubo, Y.1 aInaba, A.0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2007 June, v. 44, no. 3 p.220-227dElsevierx0925-52147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2006.12.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20071015b20071102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/09/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02009naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100002600163245012100189300001600310500002400326500001500350520069300365650003101058650003101089650002201120650001401142650001701156653003501173653003601208653003101244653002301275700002101298773011401319852000901433856008601442930003301528945002501561946001301586655001201599IND4390997320221122051134.0070506e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439099732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10460-006-9049-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX300 0aF2001 aKleinman, Daniel Lee 10aAgainst the neoliberal steamroller?

This case is especially important at a time when the spread of neoliberalism is increasingly associated with deregulation, because it sheds light on the conditions under which circumvention of the market is deemed legitimate and socio-economic regulation of agricultural technology is possible. 3aagricultural biotechnology 3agenetically modified foods 3atransgenic plants 3abiosafety 3abiodiversity 0agenetically modified organisms 0aCartagena Protocol on Biosafety 0aConvention on Biodiversity 0abiosafety protocol1 aKinchy, Abby J. 0 tAgriculture and human values.g2007 June, v. 24, no. 2 p.195-206dKluwer Academic Publishersx0889-048X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10460-006-9049-63Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070604b20070702c00000000  aINDdRLGe2007/06/04  aOther US 7aarticle03374naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100001500189245012800204300001600332500002400348520125600372650000901628650001701637650001501654650001401669650001301683650001901696650001101715650002901726650001101755650001701766650002401783650002001807650001101827650001701838650001901855650002101874650002601895650001201921650006501933650005701998650000902055650005402064650004602118650001102164650006002175650004102235650000902276650001902285650003002304650002202334653002602356700001602382700001302398773010602411852000902517856009302526930003302619945002502652946001102677655001202688IND4390984820221122040856.0070506e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439098482DNAL7 a174702322pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3164.2007.00588.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL831 0aL8101 aÅhman, S.10aTreatment of Malassezia pachydermatis-associated seborrhoeic dermatitis in Devon Rex cats with itraconazole - a pilot study  ap. 171-174.  aIncludes references  aTreatment of Malassezia pachydermatis-associated seborrhoeic dermatitis with oral itraconazole was investigated in six Devon Rex cats (DRC). The cutaneous populations of Malassezia were determined using contact plates and a swab-wash method before and after 21 days of pulse treatment with itraconazole (5 mg kg⁻¹ once daily, 7 days on, 7 days off, 7 days on). Before treatment, all cats had greasy seborrhoeic dermatitis involving the axillae, groin, claw folds and palmar and plantar interdigital skin, and two had similar lesions on the ventral neck. After treatment, there was a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in overall clinical scores and in scores at all individual sites assessed, except for the interdigital skin (P = 0.068). Population sizes of M. pachydermatis in the left and right axillae, left and right groin and palmar interdigital skin were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced, whereas the reduction in claw fold counts did not reach significance (P = 0.068). The dramatic reduction in yeast counts and an associated marked clinical improvement of the seborrhoeic dermatitis provide important pilot data on the potential value of oral itraconazole in the management of seborrhoeic dermatitis associated with M. pachydermatis in DRC. 3acats 3acat diseases 3adermatitis 3aseborrhea 3aetiology 3adermatomycoses 3ayeasts 3aMalassezia pachydermatis 3abreeds 3aitraconazole 3aoral administration 3adrug evaluation 3adosage 3askin lesions 3adisease course 3amicrobial growth 3aantifungal properties 2aAnimals 2aAntifungal Agentsxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aCat Diseasesxdrug therapyxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aCats 2aDermatitis, Seborrheicxdrug therapyxveterinary. 2aDermatomycosesxdrug therapyxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aItraconazolexadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aMalasseziaxisolation & purification 2aMale 2aPilot Projects 2aSeverity of Illness Index 2aTreatment Outcome 0aDevon Rex (cat breed)1 aPerrins, N.1 aBond, R.0 tVeterinary dermatology.g2007 June, v. 18, no. 3 p.171-174dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0959-44937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3164.2007.00588.x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20071029b20071102c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/10/12  aNon-US 7aarticle03732naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182100001800191245005900209300001600268500012300284500002400407500001500431520210100446650002802547650002302575650001302598650002202611650002102633650001102654650001302665650001502678650002302693650001102716653002202727653002402749653001302773653002602786653002102812653001902833700001502852700001602867700001702883773011402900852000903014856008603023930003303109945002503142946001103167655001203178IND4390818720140723000000.0070504e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439081872DNAL7 a180890772pmid7 a10.1016/j.asd.2006.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL400 0aL001 0aL6001 aWarrant, E.J.10aOcellar optics in nocturnal and diurnal bees and wasps  ap. 293-305.  aIn the special issue: Origin and Evolution of Arthropod Visual Systems, Part I / edited by R.R. Melzer and S. Harzsch.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aNocturnal bees, wasps and ants have considerably larger ocelli than their diurnal relatives, suggesting an active role in vision at night. In a first step to understanding what this role might be, the morphology and physiological optics of ocelli were investigated in three tropical rainforest species - the nocturnal sweat bee Megalopta genalis, the nocturnal paper wasp Apoica pallens and the diurnal paper wasp Polistes occidentalis - using hanging-drop techniques and standard histological methods. Ocellar image quality, in addition to lens focal length and back focal distance, was determined in all three species. During flight, the ocellar receptive fields of both nocturnal species are centred very dorsally, possibly in order to maximise sensitivity to the narrow dorsal field of light that enters through gaps in the rainforest canopy. Since all ocelli investigated had a slightly oval shape, images were found to be astigmatic: images formed by the major axis of the ocellus were located further from the proximal surface of the lens than images formed by the minor axis. Despite being astigmatic, images formed at either focal plane were reasonably sharp in all ocelli investigated. When compared to the position of the retina below the lens, measurements of back focal distance reveal that the ocelli of Megalopta are highly underfocused and unable to resolve spatial detail. This together with their very large and tightly packed rhabdoms suggests a role in making sensitive measurements of ambient light intensity. In contrast, the ocelli of the two wasps form images near the proximal boundary of the retina, suggesting the potential for modest resolving power. In light of these results, possible roles for ocelli in nocturnal bees and wasps are discussed, including the hypothesis that they might be involved in nocturnal homing and navigation, using two main cues: the spatial pattern of bright patches of daylight visible through the rainforest canopy, and compass information obtained from polarised skylight (from the setting sun or the moon) that penetrates these patches. 3ainterspecific variation 3anocturnal activity 3aPolistes 3aanimal morphology 3adiurnal activity 3aocelli 3aeye lens 3aHalictidae 3aoptical properties 3avision 0aMegalopta genalis 0aspecies differences 0aVespidae 0aPolistes occidentalis 0anocturnal vision 0aApoica pallens1 aKelber, A.1 aWallén, R.1 aWcislo, W.T.0 tArthropod structure & development.g2006 Dec., v. 35, no. 4 p.293-305dElsevier Science Ltd.x1467-80397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.asd.2006.08.0123Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070508b20070602c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/05/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02782naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168100002000177245007100197300001600268500002400284500001500308520086100323650003301184650002501217650001601242650001801258650002401276650002501300650001401325650001001339650002201349650001201371650002101383650002201404650002101426650004001447650002501487650003401512650000901546650003501555650004801590650000901638650001701647650004901664653002301713653001601736653001301752700001601765700001701781700001501798700001401813700001501827700001401842773009401856852000901950856009001959930003302049945002502082946001302107655001202120IND4390800920140723000000.0070503e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439080092DNAL7 a173007812pmid7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2006.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8221 aQuintanar, J.L.10aProlactin-like hormone in the nematode Trichinella spiralis larvae  ap. 137-141.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aExpression of prolactin (PRL) or prolactin-like hormone has been reported in invertebrates. We investigated the larval phase of Trichinella spiralis: (a) to express 23 kDa PRL, (b) to define its localization and (c) to test its possible biological activity. Immunostaining in isolated larvae demonstrated positive material to 23 kDa PRL by all along the stichosome, specifically in the stichocytes. Homogenized immunoblot larvae showed a 23 kDa protein band. To assess PRL release and its biological activity, larvae were incubated in culture medium and the excretory/secretory products were analyzed by the Nb2 cells bioassay. A cellular growth equivalent until 10 nM PRL and using antibody against 23 kDa PRL, the growth was blocked. In conclusion our result provides evidence that PRL-like hormone is expressed and secreted by the larvae of T. spiralis. 3aexcretory-secretory products 3abioactive properties 3acell growth 3amuscle larvae 3atissue distribution 3aTrichinella spiralis 3aprolactin 3acells 3aprotein secretion 2aAnimals 2aBiological Assay 2aBlotting, Western 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aLarvaxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMuscle, Skeletalxparasitology 2aProlactinxanalysisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aTrichinella spiralisxchemistryxmetabolism. 0aimmunolocalization 0astichocytes 0ahormones1 aSalinas, E.1 aGuerrero, R.1 aGómez, R.1 aVidal, S.1 aAranda, J.1 aClapp, C.0 tExperimental parasitology.g2007 June, v. 116, no. 2 p.137-141dElsevierx0014-48947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2006.12.0123Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070504b20070602c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/05/04  aOther US 7aarticle03255naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177100002100186245013400207300001600341500002400357520105300381650002201434650001901456650002201475650001401497650001101511650001801522650002301540650001801563650001801581650003201599650002601631650001201657650003001669650004801699650003701747650004001784650001101824650002501835650003301860650002501893650002201918650004201940650001201982650002701994650004802021650006002069700001902129700001602148700001702164700001702181700001702198700001702215700001802232700001702250700001402267773009402281852000902375856009002384930003302474945002502507946001302532655001202545IND4390800120221122004750.0070503e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439080012DNAL7 a173062562pmid7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2006.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL823 0aL8211 aNogueira, N.F.S.10aTrypanosoma cruzi: Involvement of glycoinositolphospholipids in the attachment to the luminal midgut surface of Rhodnius prolixus  ap. 120-128.  aIncludes references  aTrypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes adhere in vivo to the luminal surface of their triatomid vector digestive tract by molecular mechanisms, as yet, unknown. Here, we show that the administration of 0.5 μM epimastigote major surface glycoinositolphospholipids (GIPLs) to the infected bloodmeal inhibits up to 90% parasite infection in Rhodnius prolixus. The parasite behavior was investigated in vitro using fragments of the insect midgut. The addition of GIPLs in concentration as low as 50-100 nM impaired 95% the attachment of epimastigotes. Previous treatment of GIPLs with trifluoroacetic acid to remove the terminal β-galactofuranosyl residues reversed 50% the epimastigote in vitro attachment. The binding sites of purified GIPLs on the luminal surface of the posterior midgut were exposed by immunofluorescence microscopy. These observations indicate that GIPLs are one of the components involved in the adhesion of T. cruzi to the luminal insect midgut surface and possibly one of the determinants of parasite infection in the insect vector. 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3ainsect vectors 3aRhodnius prolixus 3ainfection 3amidgut 3aepimastigotes 3aglycophospholipids 3abinding sites 3acell adhesion 3ahost-parasite relationships 3ahematophagous insects 2aAnimals 2aCell Adhesionxphysiology 2aChagas Diseasexparasitologyxtransmission. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aGlycolipidsxchemistryxphysiology. 2aHumans 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aInsect Vectorsxparasitology 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aMicroscopy, Video 2aPhospholipidsxchemistryxphysiology. 2aRabbits 2aRhodniusxparasitology 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization 2aTrypanosoma cruzixchemistryxdrug effectsxphysiology.1 aGonzalez, M.S.1 aGomes, J.E.1 aSouza, W. de1 aGarcia, E.S.1 aAzambuja, P.1 aNohara, L.L.1 aAlmeida, I.C.1 aZingales, B.1 aColli, W.0 tExperimental parasitology.g2007 June, v. 116, no. 2 p.120-128dElsevierx0014-48947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2006.12.0143Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070504b20070602c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/05/04  aOther US 7aarticle02721naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146072000900155072000900164072000900173100001500182245010000197300001600297500002400313500001500337520103000352650002701382650001501409650001201424650001301436650002301449650001201472650001901484650002201503650002001525650002001545650001801565650002601583650002301609650001901632650001601651650002501667650002001692651001101712651001001723653001701733653002701750653002501777653002301802700001601825700001701841773007901858852000901937856007801946930003302024945002502057946001302082655001202095IND4390795120221122004704.0070503e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439079512DNAL7 a10.1002/agr.201182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aE130 0aE200 0aE400 0aE700 0aX1001 aBielza, M.10aFeasibility of a cash forward contract: An application to the French and Spanish potato sectors  ap. 245-261.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study examines a cash forward contract (CFC) that a growers' cooperative or association may offer producers to lock in a fixed price for their output. To cover the forward contract's risks, the cooperative would set up a stabilization fund, and as an option, may hedge with futures contracts. The authors evaluate both strategies' costs, which would be charged to the growers signing in the CFC in the form of a fee. By comparing this fee with farmers' willingness to pay, it is determined whether growers' would be interested in the forward contract. The scheme is tested on a selection of Spanish and French potato varieties, with reference to the April futures contracts traded on the Amsterdam exchange. The authors conclude that hedging with futures may help to reduce the cooperative's exposure to financial risk, but, on average, the stabilization fund alone is more effective without hedging. Risk-averse growers may be interested in CFCs to reduce their revenue instability.

On SDS-PAGE, both fractions gave two major and some minor bands, but there was a difference in the minor band compositions between the two fractions. Thermal stability, solubility, surface hydrophobicity, and emulsifying ability of these three samples were analyzed. Although there was no difference in solubility and emulsifying ability among the samples, thermal stability and surface hydrophobicity were different. These differences might be due to the differences in subunit compositions. cDNAs were cloned by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using primers designed on the basis of the determined N-terminal sequences of the major bands. We obtained three isoforms of cDNAs, which had highest homology with the mung bean 8Sα globulin (7S globulin), and then soybean β-conglycinin (7S globulin) β subunit among legume plants. Adzuki bean 7S globulin soforms contain more methionine and tryptophan than mung bean 8Sα globulin and soybean β-conglycinin β subunit. In addition, high mannose types of glycans were attached to two or one N-glycosylation sites of adzuki bean 7S globulins. 3athermal stability 3awater solubility 3abeans 3avicilin 3acomplementary DNA 3aVigna angularis 3aamino acid sequences 3ahydrophobicity 3amolecular cloning 3aemulsifying properties 3anucleotide sequences 3aglobulins 0aphysicochemical properties 0asurface hydrophobicity 0amolecular sequence data1 aPrak, K.1 aFujioka, M.1 aMaruyama, N.1 aUtsumi, S.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 May 2, v. 55, no. 9 p.3667-3674dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf063205l3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070803b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/08/03  aOther US 7aarticle02301naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155072000900164100002400173245008800197300001600285500002400301500001500325520096400340650000901304650001501313650002301328650000901351650002301360650001701383650001101400650003101411650002101442650002001463653002201483653002001505653001801525700001701543773010601560852000901666856008701675930003301762945002501795946001101820655001201831IND4390793320221121233902.0070503s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439079332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2006.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ104 0aQ114 0aQ5041 aSirisoontaralak, P.10aChanges in physicochemical and sensory-properties of irradiated rice during storage  ap. 282-289.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMilled aromatic rice (KDML-105) was γ-irradiated at doses of 0, 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 kGy. Changes in physicochemical and sensory properties were recorded during subsequent storage in polyethylene bags at ambient temperature for 1 year. Similar trends were observed in both irradiated and non-irradiated samples. Insignificant changes in yellowness and total solids in cooking water were observed during storage of irradiated rice compared with those of naturally-aged rice. Irradiated rice showed less increase in Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA) setback, greater reduction of RVA breakdown, and softer texture than non-irradiated rice. It also had a softer but slimy texture, off odour and inferior taste compared with the non-irradiated sample. Based on overall acceptability to panelists preferring fresh rice, non-irradiated rice could be stored for more than 1 year while rice irradiated at 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 kGy had shelf lives of 9, 7 and 2 months, respectively. 3arice 3ashelf life 3asensory evaluation 3abags 3asensory properties 3afood storage 3adosage 3aphysicochemical properties 3afood irradiation 3agamma radiation 0apolyethylene bags 0astorage quality 0aaromatic rice1 aNoomhorm, A.0 tJournal of stored products research.g2007, v. 43, no. 3 p.282-289dElsevier Sciencex0022-474X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2006.06.0083Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070508b20070602c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/05/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02473naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001300146245006900159300001800228500002400246500001500270520096200285650001701247650002301264650002001287650002101307650002301328650001601351650001501367650001601382650001901398650002101417650002101438650002701459653001501486653001801501653001901519653002101538653003201559700001401591700001801605700001401623773016001637852000901797856007801806930003301884945002501917946001301942655001201955IND4390792320221121234020.0070503e20070502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439079232DNAL7 a10.1021/jf063517o2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5011 aKuhn, J.10aBinding of 2-Nonanone and Milk Proteins in Aqueous Model Systems  ap. 3599-3604.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aInteractions of the model flavor compound 2-nonanone with individual milk proteins, whey protein isolate (WPI), and sodium caseinate in aqueous solutions were investigated. A method to quantify the free 2-nonanone was developed using headspace solid-phase microextraction followed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. Binding constants (K) and numbers of binding sites (n) for 2-nonanone on the individual proteins were calculated. The 2-nonanone binding capacities decreased in the order bovine serum albumin > β-lactoglobulin > α-lactalbumin > αs1-casein > β-casein, and the binding to WPI was stronger than the binding to sodium caseinate. All proteins appeared to have one binding site for 2-nonanone per molecule of protein at the flavor concentrations investigated, except for bovine serum albumin, which possessed two classes of binding sites. The binding mechanism is believed to involve predominantly hydrophobic interactions. 3awhey protein 3amodel food systems 3amicroextraction 3aprotein isolates 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3alactalbumin 3acaseinates 3abeta-casein 3aalphaS1-casein 3aflavor compounds 3abinding capacity 3asolid phase extraction 0a2-nonanone 0amilk proteins 0alactoglobulins 0asodium caseinate 0asolid phase microextraction1 aZhu, X.Q.1 aConsidine, T.1 aSingh, H.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 May 2, v. 55, no. 9 p.3599-3604dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf063517o3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070803b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/08/03  aOther US 7aarticle03199naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155072000900164072000900173100002200182245018200204300001600386500002400402500001500426520154100441650002501982650002202007650001502029650001202044650003002056650000902086650002002095650001302115650001002128650001102138650002702149650003202176650001102208653001802219653002202237653001802259653002102277653001502298700001702313700001702330700001502347773010602362852000902468856008702477930003302564945002502597946001102622655001202633IND4390792420221121234034.0070503s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439079242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2006.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF851 0aL600 0aL001 0aL3001 aStewart-Jones, A.10aPrey-specific contact kairomones exploited by adult and larval Teretrius nigrescens: A behavioural comparison across different stored-product pests and different pest substrates  ap. 265-275.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aProstephanus truncatus is a serious exotic beetle pest of stored maize and cassava in Africa. Teretrius nigrescens is a classical biological control predator of this pest that was released into Africa in 1991. In previous work it was shown that adult T. nigrescens are arrested in the presence of dust and frass produced by P. truncatus feeding on maize, and both adult and larval T. nigrescens are arrested by solvent extracts of this dust/frass when presented on filter paper. The current study used these two complementary bioassay approaches to test crude dust/frass and then solvent extracts of the same materials. Results demonstrate that T. nigrescens adults are arrested more strongly by the dust/frass of P. truncatus than the dust/frass of six other beetle pests of stored grain. Similar behaviours are observed for responses of both adults and larvae to solvent extracts. However, extract of dust/frass from Sitophilus zeamais is repellent to adults and larvae of T. nigrescens. Collections of dust/frass from P. truncatus cultured on maize, cassava and an artificial maize substrate previously stripped of all hexane extractable compounds, are all shown to arrest adult T. nigrescens when presented in their crude form and to arrest both adults and larvae when presented as solvent extracts. These experiments demonstrate that P. truncatus produces a species-specific kairomone that is independent of the food or tunnelling substrate. Findings are discussed in the context of prey location, particularly in natural habitats. 3aTeretrius nigrescens 3apredatory insects 3akairomones 3acassava 3abiological control agents 3acorn 3astorage insects 3aforaging 3afrass 3aimagos 3aProstephanus truncatus 3apredator-prey relationships 3alarvae 0aprey location 0ainsect arrestants 0aadult insects 0aprey specificity 0adust/frass1 aHodges, R.J.1 aFarman, D.I.1 aHall, D.R.0 tJournal of stored products research.g2007, v. 43, no. 3 p.265-275dElsevier Sciencex0022-474X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2006.06.0093Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070508b20070602c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/05/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02555naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100002200155245011800177300001800295500002400313500001500337520102000352650002301372650001601395650001901411650001601430650001401446650001101460650001901471650002101490650002701511653002401538653003401562653003501596653002001631700001401651700001601665700001701681700001601698700001701714773016001731852000901891856007801900930003301978945002502011946001302036655001202049IND4390791920221121233840.0070503e20070502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439079192DNAL7 a10.1021/jf06264152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ500 0aX1001 aJuteau-Vigier, A.10aEthyl Hexanoate Transfer Modeling in Carrageenan Matrices for Determination of Diffusion and Partition Properties  ap. 3577-3584.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAroma compound properties in food matrices, such as volatility and diffusivity, have to be determined to understand the effect of composition and structure on aroma release and perception. This work illustrates the use of mass transfer modeling to identify diffusion and partition properties of ethyl hexanoate in water and in carrageenan matrices with various degrees of structure. The comparison of results obtained with a diffusive model to those obtained with a convective model highlights the importance of considering the appropriate transfer mechanism. Modeling of the preliminary experimental steps ensures correct estimation of the conditions for the main aroma release step. The obtained values of partition and diffusion coefficients are in agreement with those found in the literature (either experimentally determined or predicted by theoretical equations) and demonstrate that the structure level of carrageenan matrices has little influence on diffusion properties of ethyl hexanoate (less than 20%). 3amodel food systems 3adiffusivity 3avolatilization 3afood matrix 3adiffusion 3aesters 3aodor compounds 3acarrageenan gels 3apartition coefficients 0amathematical models 0adiffusive mass transfer model 0aconvective mass transfer model 0aethyl hexanoate1 aAtlan, S.1 aDeleris, I.1 aGuichard, E.1 aSouchon, I.1 aTrelea, I.C.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 May 2, v. 55, no. 9 p.3577-3584dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf06264153Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070803b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/08/03  aOther US 7aarticle02503naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100001500177245009800192300001600290500002400306520120600330650002501536650001501561650001601576650001501592650001701607650002201624650002801646650001901674650001601693650002301709653002601732700001601758700001801774773009601792852000901888856009101897930003301988945002502021946001102046655001202057IND4390833720140723000000.0070504s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439083372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.11.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ105 0aQ125 0aQ5051 aMoreno, J.10aAntioxidant activity of musts from Pedro Ximénez grapes subjected to off-vine drying process  ap. 224-228.  aIncludes references  aFree radical-scavenging activity of Pedro Ximénez must obtained in different stages of the off-vine grape drying process have been evaluated by using 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazolinesulfonic acid) radical cation (ABTS+). Significant increases in the total antioxidant activity (TAA) of must obtained during the drying process were obtained, highlighting TAA at 12 days (11.2 mM trolox). High correlation coefficients between TAA-sugar concentrations (r = 0.970), TAA-absorbance at 420 nm (r = 0.915) and TAA-absorbance at 520 nm (r = 0.932) were also obtained. Similar results were obtained with synthetic samples, subjected to heat treatment, containing an amino acid extract and increasing concentrations of sugars. Increases obtained in the absorbances and in the TAA, in the synthetic samples, can be explained by the formation of Maillard reaction products. Therefore, it is possible that the Maillard reaction contributes in a significant way to the formation of brown pigments, as well as to the increase in the TAA of the musts from sun-dried grapes. This could enhance the beneficial effects, for human health, of a moderate intake of sweet wines obtained from off-vine sun-dried grapes. 3aantioxidant activity 3agrape must 3awine grapes 3awinemaking 3asolar drying 3aMaillard reaction 3afree radical scavengers 3aplant pigments 3awhite wines 3aphenolic compounds 0aoff-vine grape drying1 aPeinado, J.1 aPeinado, R.A.0 tFood chemistry.g2007, v. 104, no. 1 p.224-228dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.11.0283Available from publisher's Web site.  a20071010b20071102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/09/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02643naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100001100159245008600170300001600256500002400272520134400296650002301640650001001663650002401673650001601697650002201713650002501735650001901760650001301779650001801792650002801810653004101838700001301879700001301892700001301905700001401918773009601932852000902028856009102037930003302128945002502161946001102186655001202197IND4390831720221121192840.0070504s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439083172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.11.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aYu, L.10aPhenolics from hull of Garcinia mangostana fruit and their antioxidant activities  ap. 176-181.  aIncludes references  aThe air-dried fruit hulls of Garcinia mangostana Linn. were extracted with 70% MeOH, and then partitioned into the n-BuOH fractions. Furthermore, three major phenolic components related to their antioxidant activities were purified by silica gel column chromatography and Sephadex LH-20 and then identified as P1 (1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxy-2,8-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)), P2 [1,3,6-trihydroxy-7-methoxy-2,8-(3-methyl-2-butenyl) xanthone] and P3 (epicatechin) using UV-visible spectrophotometry, IR spectrophotometry and NMR spectroscopy, respectively. The antioxidant activities of three major phenolics were evaluated using different tests, including the free radical scavenging capability and total antioxidant activity in a linoleic acid peroxidation. These three phenolic compounds exhibited different antioxidant activities in these antioxidant tests. The hydroxyl radical and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging capabilities and the activity against linoleic acid peroxidation of P1 were greater than those of P2 and P3, while the superoxide anion radical scavenging activity of P3 was greater than that of P1, but was close to that of P2 or α-tocopherol. An activity-guided isolation and purification process was used to identify the components showing the strong DPPH radical scavenging activity from G. mangostana Linn. 3aphenolic compounds 3ahulls 3aGarcinia mangostana 3amangosteens 3afruit composition 3aantioxidant activity 3afruit extracts 3apericarp 3afree radicals 3afree radical scavengers 0a1,1-diphenyl-2-picryldydrazyl (DPPH)1 aZhao, M.1 aYang, B.1 aZhao, Q.1 aJiang, Y.0 tFood chemistry.g2007, v. 104, no. 1 p.176-181dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.11.0183Available from publisher's Web site.  a20071010b20071102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/09/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02132naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100001100159245011100170300001400281500002400295500001500319520080900334650002001143650001001163650002801173650001701201650002301218650002401241650002401265650001301289650002001302653002401322653001501346653001101361653001201372700001401384700001301398773009401411852000901505856009101514930003301605945002501638946001101663655001201674IND4390828220221121154608.0070504s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439082822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.10.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ2061 aOz, F.10aEffects of cooking methods on the formation of heterocyclic aromatic amines of two different species trout  ap. 67-72.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aHeterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) are sometimes formed in meats and fish cooked at high temperatures.

The moisture content decreased after 2 days of storage and during the following days the crumb moisture content remained practically unchanged. Firmness was developed mainly during the first day of storage, remained at a similar level from day 2 to 3 and increased slightly after the third day of storage. A decrease in sensory quality and acceptability of the MiGao was observed during storage. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to follow changes of starch retrogradation in MiGao crumb.

This has two principal weaknesses. Firstly many of the issues of importance to villagers are not covered by the economic and social scope of the HDI. Secondly the HDI, along with international sustainable development indicator sets, fails to identify problems which are of importance in specific national or sub-national contexts. We have therefore worked from a simplified but holistic model of the socio-economic-environmental system of a rural Egyptian village, informed by the outputs of a participatory planning process. An indicator set based on a one-to-one correspondence between system components and indicators was created. This comprehensive set is detailed but consequently rather unwieldy, and a core set is selected and compared with the HDI indicators for a sample of villages to demonstrate the impact of considering environmental and institutional factors on establishing priority areas for government intervention. We conclude that a combination of a locally relevant index and an easily comprehended diagrammatic approach to presenting a small indicator set offers advantages to decision makers in comparison to local application of the HDI. 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aplanning 3arural development 3asustainable development 3avillages 3aEgypt1 aConnelly, Stephen0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2009 Dec., v. 11, no. 6 p.1175-1196dSpringer Netherlandsx1387-585X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-008-9173-0 7aarticle02786naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001200129245009500141300001800236520169800254650002701952650001501979650001301994650001902007650001602026650001902042650001902061650001102080650001702091650001702108650000902125650001602134650002502150700001902175700001702194773009702211852000902308930003302317945001302350946001302363655001202376IND2058773220221120230231.0970802e199705  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205877322DNAL7 a165356012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, G.10aInfluence of a rhamnolipid biosurfactant on the transport of bacteria through a sandy soil  ap. 1866-1873.  aThe objective of this study was to investigate the influence an anionic rhamnolipid biosurfactant on the transport of bacterial cells through soil under saturated conditions. Three cell types with various hydrophobicities. i.e., Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, ATCC 27853, and ATCC 15442, were used in this study. In a series of experiments, columns packed with sterile sand were saturated with sterile artificial groundwater for 15 h, and then 3 pore volumes of 3H-labeled bacterial suspensions with various rhamnolipid concentrations was pumped through the column. This was followed by 4 pore volumes of the rhamnolipid solution alone. The measured bacterial cell breakthrough curves were optimized by using an advection-dispersion transport model incorporating two-domain reversible sorption (instantaneous and rate limited) and with two first-order sink terms for irreversible adsorption. The influence of the rhamnolipid on the surface charge densities of the bacteria and the porous medium was also investigated. The results show that the rhamnolipid enhanced the transport of all cell types tested. For example, the rhamnolipid increased the recovery of the most hydrophilic strain, ATCC 9027, from 22.5 to 56.3%. Similarly, the recovery of ATCC 27853 increased from 36.8 to 49.4%, and the recovery of ATCC 15442, the most hydrophobic strain, increased from 17.7 to 40.5% in the presence of the rhamnolipid. The negative surface charge density of the porous medium was increased, while the surface charge density of the bacteria was not changed in the presence of the rhamnolipid.

The results show that significant El Niño events are generally associated with increased representation of Dipterocarpaceae pollen, probably reflecting the mass-flowering of this taxon during El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) droughts, and elevated charcoal levels, reflecting a greater incidence of fires during these extremely dry periods, while humid phases show increased fern numbers. Our findings demonstrate that pollen records 'ecological' in scale can provide useful additional proxy records of ENSO events. 3aDipterocarpaceae 3aEl Nino 3acharcoal 3adrought 3aferns and fern allies 3afires 3apalynology 3apollen 3arain 3asurface temperature 3avegetation 3aIndonesia 3aPacific Ocean 0aclimate variability 0aEl Niño-Southern Oscillation 0aHalmahera 0aKau Bay 0aMaluku Rainfall Index 0amass-flowering1 aTapper, N.

Tests on fecal suspensions inoculated with each of 12 different strains of E. coli O157 showed that both the EIA and IMS methods were 10- to 100-fold more sensitive than direct culture or enrichment subculture methods for detection of the organism. EIA and IMS were then compared for detection of E. coli O157 in bovine rectal swabs. For confirmation of positive EIA tests, a commercial system (Immunocapture System [ICS]; Tecra Diagnostics) was compared with IMS; both were performed on mECn enrichment cultures. Of 200 rectal swabs examined, 17 gave positive results in the EIA which were confirmed by both confirmation systems, 2 gave positive results in the EIA which were confirmed by IMS but not by ICS, and 1 gave a positive result in the EIA which was confirmed by ICS but not by IMS. Of these 20, 15 were also positive by the BPW-VCC-IMS culture system; a further 3 samples were positive by this culture system but gave a negative result in the EIA. Eight samples were negative by the BPW-VCC-IMS culture system but gave a positive result in the EIA which could not be confirmed by either confirmation system. Further examination of the eight unconfirmed EIA-positive samples yielded sorbitol-fermenting E. coli O157 from three samples. Of the remaining five cultures, four were positive in an EIA for verocytotoxins (VT) and two were positive in a cell culture assay for VT1. The remaining 170 samples were negative by both EIA and BPW-VCC-IMS. The Tecra EIA and IMS are both technically simple and sensitive methods for detecting E. coli O157 in bovine fecal samples. There was no statistically significant difference between the numbers of positives detected by the different assays (P = 0.29). 3aEscherichia coli O157 3acattle 3acell culture 3adiagnostic techniques 3aenzyme immunoassays 3afeces 3aimmunomagnetic separation 3apeptones 3averotoxins 2aAnimals 2aBacteriological Techniques 2aCattle 2aCulture Mediaxmetabolism 2aEscherichia coli Infectionsxdiagnosis 2aEscherichia coli O157xgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aImmunoenzyme Techniques 2aImmunomagnetic Separationxmethods 2aSensitivity and Specificity1 aMalo, A.T.C.1 aSiddons, C.A.1 aHarkin, M.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1997 July, v. 63, no. 7 p.2549-2553x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle04044naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245017700170300001800347520202600365650001102391650002502402650002002427650001102447650001902458650003002477650002102507650002402528650001702552650001502569650001202584650002302596650001202619650001102631650001102642650001602653650002202669650001402691650002202705650002502727650001602752650001002768650001102778650000902789650001402798650002702812650001502839651001102854653002702865653002302892653001902915653003302934653002102967653001402988700002403002700002303026700002203049700002203071773012003093852000903213856009203222930003303314946001103347655001203358IND4436624120221120230229.0100507e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443662412DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.02079.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOLSRUD, MARIA10aResponses of fungal root colonization, plant cover and leaf nutrients to long-term exposure to elevated atmospheric CO₂ and warming in a subarctic birch forest understory  ap. 1820-1829.  aResponses of the mycorrhizal fungal community in terrestrial ecosystems to global change factors are not well understood. However, virtually all land plants form symbiotic associations with mycorrhizal fungi, with approximately 20% of the plants' net primary production transported down to the fungal symbionts. In this study, we investigated how ericoid mycorrhiza (ErM), fine endophytes (FE) and dark septate endophytes (DSE) in roots responded to elevated atmospheric CO₂ concentrations and warming in the dwarf shrub understory of a birch forest in the subarctic region of northern Sweden. To place the belowground results into an ecosystem context we also investigated how plant cover and nutrient concentrations in leaves responded to elevated atmospheric CO₂ concentrations and warming. The ErM colonization in ericaceous dwarf shrubs increased under elevated atmospheric CO₂ concentrations, but did not respond to warming following 6 years of treatment. This suggests that the higher ErM colonization under elevated CO₂ might be due to increased transport of carbon belowground to acquire limiting resources such as N, which was diluted in leaves of ericaceous plants under enhanced CO₂. The elevated CO₂ did not affect total plant cover but the plant cover was increased under warming, which might be due to increased N availability in soil. FE colonization in grass roots decreased under enhanced CO₂ and under warming, which might be due to increased root growth, to which the FE fungi could not keep up, resulting in proportionally lower colonization. However, no responses in aboveground cover of Deschampsia flexuosa were seen. DSE hyphal colonization in grass roots significantly increased under warmer conditions, but did not respond to elevated CO₂. This complex set of responses by mycorrhizal and other root-associated fungi to global change factors of all the fungal types studied could have broad implications for plant community structure and biogeochemistry of subarctic ecosystems. 3aBetula 3aDeschampsia flexuosa 3abiogeochemistry 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3achronic exposure 3acommunity structure 3aembryophytes 3aendophytes 3aforests 3afungal communities 3agrasses 3ahyphae 3aleaves 3amycorrhizae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anutrients 3aplant communities 3aprimary productivity 3aroot growth 3aroots 3ashrubs 3asoil 3asymbionts 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3aunderstory 3aSweden 0aDark septate endophyte 0aericoid mycorrhiza 0afine endophyte 0aleaf nitrogen and phosphorus 0aopen top chamber 0asubarctic1 aCARLSSON, BENGT Å.1 aSVENSSON, BRITA M.1 aMICHELSEN, ANDERS1 aMelillo, Jerry M.0 tGlobal change biology.g2010 June, v. 16, no. 6 p.1820-1829dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1354-10137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.02079.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100508b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03664naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245015300188300001800341500001500359520144400374650004401818650002501862650001701887650002301904650001701927650002601944650001601970650001701986650002802003650002502031650002002056650002402076650001402100650001102114650001802125650001102143650002102154650001302175650002502188650002502213650005902238650002902297650004402326650001702370650002602387650006102413650002302474650002302497650003802520650003602558653002402594653002002618700001702638700001602655700001602671700001502687773013102702852000902833856009202842930003302934946001102967655001202978IND4436625820221120230216.0100507e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443662582DNAL7 a199124302pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04591.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNamihira, T.10aInfluence of nitrogen fertilization on tropical-grass silage assessed by ensiling process monitoring using chemical and microbial community analyses  ap. 1954-1965.  a2019-12-04  aUtilization of silage in livestock farming is expected to increase in developing countries in the tropical and subtropical parts of the world. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of nitrogen fertilization on the chemical composition of herbage, ensiling process and silage quality, and to contribute to the improvement of tropical-grass silage preparation. Guinea grass grown under two different nitrogen-fertilizer application conditions [1·5 kg N a⁻¹ (high-N) and 0·5 kg N a⁻¹ (low-N)] was packed in plastic bags, and its ensiling process was investigated by chemical and microbial-community analyses. Relatively well-preserved silage was obtained from high-N herbage, which accumulated a high nitrate concentration. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that Lactobacillus plantarum dominated throughout the ensiling of high-N herbage and in the early phase of that of low-N herbage. In low-N silages prepared from ammonium sulfate- and urea-fertilized herbage, Lact. plantarum was replaced by clostridia after 40 and 15 days of ensiling, respectively. Nitrate content of herbage is an important factor that influences silage quality, and careful fertilization management can facilitate stable and successful fermentation of tropical-grass silage without any pretreatment. The positive effect of nitrate on the ensiling process of tropical-grass was proved by microbial-community analysis. 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3achemical composition 3afermentation 3aprocess monitoring 3afeed quality 3amicrobial communities 3aClostridium 3aplastic bags 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3adeveloping countries 3afarming systems 3aMegathyrsus maximus 3alivestock 3aforage 3asilage making 3asilage 3aammonium sulfate 3anitrates 3anitrogen fertilizers 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aClostridiumxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysis 2aDenaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis 2aFermentation 2aFertilizersxanalysis 2aLactobacillusxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aNitratesxanalysis 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aPanicumxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aSilagexanalysisxmicrobiology. 0abacterial community 0aPanicum maximum1 aShinzato, N.1 aAkamine, H.1 aMaekawa, H.1 aMatsui, T.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2010 June, v. 108, no. 6 p.1954-1965dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04591.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100508b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03544naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001200152245019600164300001600360520171900376650002802095650002502123650002102148650001602169650001802185650002502203650001602228650001102244650002002255650002002275650000902295650001602304650002302320650002402343650001502367650001002382650002902392650002002421650002402441650002502465650002102490650001602511653003102527653001102558700001502569700001602584700001502600700001702615700001602632700001602648700001502664773011802679852000902797856009202806930003302898946001102931655001202942IND4436622620221120230139.0100507e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443662262DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2095.2009.00668.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGAO, W.10aEffect of dietary carbohydrate-to-lipid ratios on growth performance, body composition, nutrient utilization and hepatic enzymes activities of herbivorous grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella)  ap. 327-333.  aSix isonitrogenous (390 g kg⁻¹) and isoenergetic (16.2 kJ g⁻¹) diets with varying carbohydrate : lipid (CHO : L) ratios (202.5-1.74), were fed to triplicate groups of 25 fish in indoor recirculation system. Over 8-week-growth trial, best weight gain (WG), specific growth rate, feed conversion ratio, protein efficiency ratio and protein production value (P < 0.05) were observed in fish-fed diets with CHO : L ratio of 7.5. Fish fed either the lowest (1.7) or highest (202.5) CHO : L ratio tended to produce lower (P < 0.05) growth and feed conversion efficiencies. The values of viscerosomatic index, hepatosomatic index and intraperitoneal fat ratio increased as dietary CHO : L ratios decreased. There were no significant differences in whole body and liver crude protein among dietary treatments. Whole body and liver lipid increased as CHO : L ratios decreased. Plasma cholesterol and triacylglyceride levels increased linearly as dietary CHO : L ratios decreased. Activities of glucokinase and pyruvate kinase were stimulated by elevated levels of dietary carbohydrate; however, activities of lipase (LPS) and alkaline phosphatase were stimulated by elevated levels of dietary lipid. Based on a second-order polynomial regression analysis of WG against dietary carbohydrate and lipid levels, 275 g kg⁻¹ of carbohydrate and 59 g kg⁻¹ of lipid, corresponding to a CHO : L ratio of 4.7, in a diet holding 390 g kg⁻¹ of crude protein and 16.3 kJ g⁻¹ of gross energy, proved to be optimal for grass carp. These results indicated that utilization of dietary lipid and carbohydrate was moderate in grass carp, but the fish were a little more capable of utilizing lipid compared with carbohydrate. 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abody composition 3acholesterol 3acrude protein 3adietary carbohydrate 3adietary fat 3aenergy 3aenzyme activity 3afeed conversion 3afish 3aglucokinase 3agrowth performance 3ahepatosomatic index 3aherbivores 3aliver 3aprotein efficiency ratio 3apyruvate kinase 3aregression analysis 3aspecific growth rate 3atriacylglycerols 3aweight gain 0acarbohydrate : lipid ratio 0agrowth1 aLiu, Y.

Based on seven AMS ¹⁴C ages, the record represents at least the last 10 450 ¹⁴C yr bp (12 380 cal years bp), The uppermost region was naturally covered by campos de altitude throughout the recorded period. Diverse montane Atlantic rain forest (ARF) occurred close to the studied peat bog at the end of the Late-glacial period. There is evidence of small Araucaria angustifolia populations in the study area as late as the early Holocene, after which point the species apparently became locally extinct. Between 10 380 and 10 170 ¹⁴C yr bp (12 310-11 810 cal yr bp), the extent of campos de altitude was markedly reduced as montane ARF shifted rapidly upward to higher elevations, reflecting a very wet and warm period (temperatures similar to or warmer than present day) at the end of the Younger Dryas (YD) chronozone. This is in opposition to the broadly documented YD cooling in the northern Hemisphere. Reduced cross-equatorial heat transport and movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone over northeastern Brazil may explain the YD warming. Markedly extended campos de altitude vegetation indicates dry climatic conditions until about 4910 ¹⁴C yr bp (5640 cal yr bp). Later, wetter conditions are indicated by reduced high elevation grassland and the extension of ARF into higher elevation. Fire frequency was high during the early Holocene but decreased markedly after about 7020 ¹⁴C yr bp (7850 cal yr bp). 3aAraucaria angustifolia 3aaltitude 3acarbon 3acharcoal 3aclimatic factors 3acooling 3agrasslands 3aheat 3apeatlands 3apollen 3aradiocarbon dating 3aradionuclides 3arain forests 3asediments 3ashrublands 3atemperature 3aBrazil 0acampos de altitude 0afire history 0alate Quaternary 0amontane Atlantic rain forest 0apalaeoclimate 0atropical mountain 0aYounger Dryas chronozone1 aSAFFORD, HUGH DEFOREST0 tGlobal change biology.g2010 June, v. 16, no. 6 p.1661-1671dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1354-10137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.02029.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100508b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01945naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245014000143300001800283520098400301650002301285650001901308650001601327650001901343650001101362650001601373650002201389700001501411700001501426773009801441852000901539930003301548945001301581946001301594655001201607IND2060218320221120215559.0971022e199706  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206021832DNAL7 a165356252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalop, A.10aOccurrence of a highly heat-sensitive spore subpopulation of Bacillus coagulans STCC 4522 and its conversion to a more heat-stable form  ap. 2246-2251.  aThe profile of the survival curves, at different heating temperatures, of B. coagulans STCC 4522 sporulated at 52 degrees C has been studied, focusing on the early moments of treatment. A highly heat-sensitive spore subpopulation that includes more than 90% of the total spore population has been found. This heat-sensitive spore fraction was inactivated after 2 s of treatment at 111 degrees C. Its heat resistance was as much as 200-fold lower than that of the heat-resistant spore fraction (D111 degrees C of 0.01 min for the heat-sensitive spore fraction compared with D111 degrees C of 2 min for the heat-resistant fraction). The shape of the survival curve at 108.5 degrees C was modified after a sublethal heat shock at 80 degrees C for 3.5 h, resulting in a straight-line survival curve. The temperature of treatment also influenced the shape of the survival curves. The conversion of the highly heat-sensitive spore subpopulation to a more heat-stable form is discussed. 3aBacillus coagulans 3aheat stability 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3aspores 3atemperature 3athermosensitivity1 aSala, F.J.1 aCondon, S.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1997 June, v. 63, no. 6 p.2246-2251x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle03376naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002000149245009700169300001800266520173300284650002702017650002602044650001202070650001302082650001202095650002802107650001502135650001302150650002402163650001302187650001302200650000902213650000902222650001502231650002402246650003502270650002802305650001802333650003102351650002002382650002502402650006202427650002402489700001502513700001802528700001702546700002202563700001702585700001802602773009802620852000902718930003302727945001302760946001302773655001202786IND2060218620221120215654.0971022e199706  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206021862DNAL7 a91723482pmid7 aPMC1685212pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBatchelor, S.E.10aCell density-regulated recovery of starved biofilm populations of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria  ap. 2281-2286.  aThe speed of recovery of cell suspensions and biofilm populations of the ammonia oxidizer Nitrosomonas europaea, following starvation was determined. Stationary-phase cells, washed and resuspended in ammonium-free inorganic medium, were starved for periods of up to 42 days, after which the medium was supplemented with ammonium and subsequent growth was monitored by measuring nitrite concentration changes. Cultures exhibited a lag phase prior to exponential nitrite production, which increased from 8.72 h (no starvation) to 153 h after starvation for 42 days. Biofilm populations of N. europaea colonizing sand or soil particles in continuous-flow, fixed column reactors were starved by continuous supply of ammonium-free medium. Following resupply of ammonium, starved biofilms exhibited no lag phase prior to nitrite production, even after starvation for 43.2 days, although there was evidence of cell loss during starvation. Biofilm formation will therefore provide a significant ecological advantage for ammonia oxidizers in natural environments in which the substrate supply is intermittent. Cell density-dependent phenomena in a number of gram-negative bacteria are mediated by N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHL), including N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OHHL). Addition of both ammonium and OHHL to cell suspensions starved for 28 days decreased the lag phase in a concentration-dependent manner from 53.4 h to a minimum of 10.8 h. AHL production by N. europaea was detected by using a luxR-luxAB AHL reporter system. The results suggest that rapid recovery of high-density biofilm populations may be due to production and accumulation of OHHL to levels not possible in relatively low-density cell suspensions. 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aNitrosomonas europaea 3aammonia 3aammonium 3abiofilm 3acell suspension culture 3ahomoserine 3alactones 3anitrifying bacteria 3anitrites 3aoxidants 3asand 3asoil 3astarvation 2aAmmoniaxmetabolism 2aBiofilmsxgrowth & development 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aCulture Media 2aEnvironmental Microbiology 2aGenes, Reporter 2aNitritesxmetabolism 2aNitrosomonasxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aOxidation-Reduction1 aCooper, M.1 aChhabra, S.R.1 aGlover, L.A.1 aStewart, G.S.A.B.1 aWilliams, P.1 aProsser, J.I.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1997 June, v. 63, no. 6 p.2281-2286x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02835naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001800149245010000167300001800267520157500285650002101860650001801881650001601899650002401915650000701939650002101946650001601967650001901983650003202002650006802034650003102102650003002133650002302163650001602186700002002202700001302222773009802235852000902333930003302342945001302375946001302388655001202401IND2060219820221120215749.0971022e199706  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206021982DNAL7 a91723552pmid7 aPMC1685282pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPresser, K.A.10aModelling the growth rate of Escherichia coli as a function of pH and lactic acid concentration  ap. 2355-2360.  aThe growth rate responses of Escherichia coli M23 (a nonpathogenic strain) to suboptimal pH and lactic acid concentration were determined. Growth rates were measured turbidimetrically at 20 degrees C in the range of pH 2.71 to 8.45. The total concentration of lactic acid was fixed at specific values, and the pH was varied by the addition of a strong acid (hydrochloric) or base (sodium hydroxide) to enable the determination of undissociated and dissociated lactic acid concentrations under each condition. In the absence of lactic acid, E. coli grew at pH 4.0 but not at pH 3.7 and was unable to grow in the presence of greater than or equal to 8.32 mM undissociated lactic acid. Growth rate was linearly related to hydrogen ion concentration in the absence of lactic acid. In the range 0 to 100 mM lactic acid, growth rate was also linearly related to undissociated lactic acid concentration. A mathematical model to describe these observations was developed based on a Belehradek-like model for the effects of water activity and temperature. This model was expanded to describe the effects of pH and lactic acid by the inclusion of novel terms for the inhibition due to the presence of hydrogen ions, undissociated lactic acid, and dissociated lactic acid species. Preliminary data obtained for 200 and 500 mM total lactic acid concentrations show that the response to very high lactic acid concentrations was less well described by the model. However, for 0 to 100 mM lactic acid, the model described well the qualitative and quantitative features of the response. 3aEscherichia coli 3ahydrogen ions 3alactic acid 3amathematical models 3apH 3asodium hydroxide 3atemperature 3awater activity 2aCell Divisionxdrug effects 2aEscherichia colixcytologyxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLactic Acidxpharmacology 2aModels, Biological 2aTemperature1 aRatkowsky, D.A.1 aRoss, T.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1997 June, v. 63, no. 6 p.2355-2360x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle03143naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001900139245009800158300001700256520180700273650002202080650001102102650002602113650001302139650001602152650001402168650001302182650003202195650002202227650001202249650001402261650001802275650000902293650001202302650001202314650001802326650001902344650001002363651001402373700002002387700002202407700002102429773006502450852000902515856007902524939003302603946001302636655001202649IND4436557420221120210727.0100507e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443655742DNAL7 a10.1038/oby.2008.202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Mei-Wei10aSelf-efficacy and Dietary Fat Reduction Behaviors in Obese African-American and White Mothers  ap. 992-1001.  aThis study examined the influence of weight management and education on five types of fat reduction behaviors mediated through three task-specific domains of self-efficacy among young, low-income obese African-American and white mothers. It also investigated interaction of race with the relationships between weight management, education, self-efficacy, and fat reduction behaviors. A sample of obese African-American and white mothers was recruited from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) in Wisconsin. Participants reported their weight management status, education, self-efficacy for eating low-fat food, and fat reduction behaviors. For both racial groups, weight management status predicted low-fat food substitution and meat modification behaviors; education predicted meat modification behavior. Three task-specific domains of self-efficacy (negative mood, positive mood, and food availability) predicted different types of fat reduction behaviors and differed by race. Weight management influenced behaviors of low-fat food substitution, meat modification, and fried-food avoidance, mediated partially through self-efficacies of negative mood (African Americans), positive mood (African Americans, whites), and food availability (African Americans). Race affected the relationships between weight management, education, three task-specific domains of self-efficacy, and five types of fat reduction behaviors. Self-efficacies operated differentially for African Americans and whites. Thus, strategies to address specific fat reduction behaviors have the potential to be more effective when tailored to specific individual characteristics such as racial background, history of weightmanagement strategies and task-specific domains of self-efficacy. 3aAfrican Americans 3aWhites 3abehavior modification 3achildren 3adietary fat 3aeducation 3aemotions 3afood and nutrition programs 3afood availability 3ainfants 3aingestion 3alow fat foods 3ameat 3amothers 3aobesity 3aself-efficacy 3aweight control 3awomen 3aWisconsin1 aBrown, Roger L.1 aBaumann, Linda J.1 aNitzke, Susan A.0 tObesity.g2008 May, v. 16, no. 5 p.992-1001x1930-73817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/oby.2008.203Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120517  aOther US 7aarticle02659naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245015100175300001600326520151100342653003001853653003501883653001901918653003501937700002201972700002301994700002302017700001702040773013102057852000902188856009202197930003302289946001102322655001202333IND4436588120221120185941.0100507e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443658812DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2605.2009.00967.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMouritsen, Annette10aTesticular adrenal rest tumours in boys, adolescents and adult men with congenital adrenal hyperplasia may be associated with the CYP21A2 mutation  ap. 521-527.  aCongenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an autosomal recessive disorder with impaired function of the adrenal cortex caused by mutations in the CYP21A2 gene. Deficiency of steroid 21-hydroxylase accounts for 80-95% of CAH cases. Testicular adrenal rest tumours (TART) may be prevalent in up to 95% of CAH adults and may already appear during childhood. Whether genotype sub-types can account for the development of TART has not been investigated previously. We therefore investigated this by coupling clinical information of CAH patients with information of their genetic mutation. In 49 male patients (age 2.6-40.3 years) with 21-hydroxylase deficiency, testicular ultrasound examinations were performed and CYP21A2 genotypes determined. These were grouped according to the residual 21-hydroxylase activity: group Null (complete enzyme impairment), group A (almost complete enzyme impairment), group B (severe enzyme impairment) and group C (partial impairment). TART were observed in 27 of 49 patients (55%). For the 23 patients younger than 18 years, TART were present in 11 (48%), the youngest patient being 7.5 years old. The presence of TART was dependent on the CYP21A2 genotype: 27 of 37 patients (73%) with the most severe mutations (groups Null and A) had TART, whereas none of 12 patients with the milder mutations (groups B and C) had TART. We conclude that TART were most frequently detected in patients with severe CYP21A2 mutations, and may occur already in early childhood in such patients. 0a21-hydroxylase deficiency 0acongenital adrenal hyperplasia 0aCYP21 genotype 0atesticular adrenal rest tumour1 aJørgensen, Niels1 aMain, Katharina M.1 aSchwartz, Marianne1 aJuul, Anders0 tInternational journal of andrology.g2010 June, v. 33, no. 3 p.521-527dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-62637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2605.2009.00967.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100508b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02792naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002500163245012500188300001400313520116300327650002301490650001301513650002001526650003501546650002201581650000901603650002801612650001601640650004601656650002601702650008401728650003301812650004801845650001101893650008501904650005201989700002602041700001902067700003002086700002102116773008102137852000902218930003302227945002502260946001302285655001202298IND4436526220221120124432.0100506e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443652622DNAL7 a203341632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aChouhan, Raghuraj S.10aTrace-Level Detection of Atrazine Using Immuno-Chemiluminescence: Dipstick and Automated Flow Injection Analyses Formats  ap. 28-35.  aA sensitive chemiluminescence (CL)-based immunoassay technique based on both dipstick and flow injection analytical formats is reported for the detection of atrazine. In the dipstick-based immunoassay technique, antibody (anti-atrazine) was first immobilized on the nitrocellulose membranes. The dipstick was then treated with atrazine and atrazine-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (atra-HRP) to facilitate the competitive binding. The dipstick was further treated with urea-hydrogen peroxide (U-H2O2) and luminol to generate photons. The number of photons generated was inversely proportional to the atrazine concentration. In the flow injection analysis (FIA) format, the antibody was immobilized on protein-A sepharose matrix and packed in a glass capillary column, which functioned as an immunoreactor. Competitive binding of antigen and antibody occurred. The CL signals generated during the biochemical reactions were correlated with atrazine concentrations in the analytical samples. By using dipstick technique, it was possible to detect atrazine concentration down to 0.1 ng/mL; with the FIA format, the detection of atrazine was down to 0.01 ng/mL. 3aherbicide residues 3aatrazine 3aimmunochemistry 3achemiluminescence immunoassays 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aurea 3aflow injection analysis 3afood grains 2aAtrazinexanalysisximmunologyxtoxicity. 2aBiosensing Techniques 2aFlow Injection Analysisxinstrumentationxmethodsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aHerbicidesxanalysisximmunologyxtoxicity. 2aHumans 2aLuminescent Measurementsxinstrumentationxmethodsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxtoxicity.1 aRana, Kumar Vikash S.1 aSuri, C.

  1 aWiebe, Julia C.13aAn Expression System for the E. coli Fermentation of Recombinant Antibody F(ab) Fragments from Mice and Rabbits  ap. 80-88.  aA mutually compatible vector system was developed for the bench-top fermenter production of mouse and rabbit F(ab) fragments comprising pASK85-pro-K411B and pASK85Rab-pro-WR13. These vectors provide a mouse- and rabbit-specific cloning site, respectively, the tetA promoter/operator and the proBA operon that complements the Pro biosynthetic deficiency of the Escherichia coli strain JM83 and can serve as an additional selection marker. Fermentation at elevated cell density (OD600 = 20–40) of the atrazine-specific mouse F(ab) fragment K411B using JM83 harboring pASK85-pro-K411B in a 2 L bench-top vessel resulted in a yield of 240 μg/L • OD600 affinity-purified protein (13.8 mg). In contrast, expression of leporid F(ab) fragments using pASK85Rab-pro-WR13 was unsuccessful due to the aggregation of rabbit light chains, which probably relates to a general problem of this specific class of immunoglobulins with their additional Cys residues. Coexpression of rabbit F(ab) fragments together with four periplasmic folding-helper proteins encoded on pTUM4 led to a significantly improved folding efficiency, resulting in a yield of 50 μg/L • OD600 affinity-purified rabbit F(ab) fragment (3.3 mg) from the 2 L bench-top fermenter. 3acrop production 3anoxious weeds 3aweed control 3aatrazine 3aenvironmental exposure 3aenvironmental fate 3aherbicide residues 3afermentation 3aEscherichia coli 3afermenters 3arecombinant antibodies 3agroundwater contamination 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aclones 3amice 3arabbits 3aanimal models 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFermentation 2aGene Expression 2aGenetic Vectors 2aImmunoglobulin Fab Fragmentsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMice 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aRabbits 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aSchuller, Carolin1 aReiche, Jana A.1 aKrämer, Karl H.1 aSkerra, Arne1 aHock, Bertold0 tJournal of AOAC International.g2010 , v. 93, no. 1 p.80-88x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a20100602b20100703c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/06/02  aOther US 7aarticle02667naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245006300158300002100221500001500242520138700257650001501644650001501659650001101674650002201685650001901707650002301726650001401749650002501763650001901788650001501807650001501822650001401837650002001851650001801871650001601889650002201905653001801927700001601945700001601961700001601977773010001993852000902093930003302102945002502135946001302160655001202173IND4436533620221120113436.0100506e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443653362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBoano, F.10aBiogeochemical zonation due to intrameander hyporheic flow  ap. W02511 (13 p.  a2019-12-04  aThe dynamics of chemicals within a catchment are strongly affected by the exchange between surface water and groundwater. The activity of hyporheic microorganisms plays a key role in these processes, as they are able to oxidize and reduce organic matter and nutrients. The interplay between the residence times in the hyporheic zone and the temporal scales of the microbial reactions must thus be understood in order to improve our understanding of the role of fluvial environments in nutrient cycling. In this paper we focus on the intrameander hyporheic region and investigate the links between river morphology, hyporheic flow field, and biogeochemical processes. We adopt a modeling framework that considers the planimetric evolution of a meandering river, the hyporheic flow field induced by the river sinuosity, and the main biogeochemical reactions of organic carbon degradation. The chemical zonation of the intrameander hyporheic zone clearly emerges as a result of the coupling between hyporheic flow and biochemical activity. The resulting patterns of nutrient concentrations are strongly influenced by the river morphology. We also show how to estimate the characteristic timescales of the redox reactions and that their interplay with the kinematic timescales of the hyporheic flow controls both the biochemical zonation and the overall rate of nutrient transformation. 3aestimation 3atopography 3arivers 3aaquatic organisms 3aorganic matter 3amicrobial activity 3anutrients 3aspatial distribution 3amicroorganisms 3awatersheds 3awater flow 3aoxidation 3abiogeochemistry 3asurface water 3agroundwater 3ahydrologic models 0ageomorphology1 aDemaria, A.1 aRevelli, R.1 aRidolfi, L.0 tWater resources research.g2010 Feb., v. 46, no. 2 p.W02511 (13 p-W02511 (13 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20100601b20100605c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/06/01  aOther US 7aarticle01849naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245011400166300001800280520039000298650002600688650002700714650001900741650001000760650003000770650001300800650002300813650002300836650002500859650003100884650002000915650004800935650004100983650001301024650004001037650002701077650002401104650003501128700002001163700001801183773009801201852000901299930003301308945001301341946001301354655001201367IND2062282320221120072533.0980306e199708  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206228232DNAL7 a92512272pmid7 aPMC1686382pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeng, N.C.K.10aCloning and expression of an endo-1,3-1,4-beta-glucanase gene from Bacillus macerans in Lactobacillus reuteri  ap. 3336-3340.  aStrains of the gastrointestinal species Lactobacillus reuteri were electrotransformed with plasmid constructs containing the endo-1,3,1,4-beta-glucanase gene (bglM) of Bacillus macerans.

Unlike results with most other prokaryotes, but similar to results with other members of the family Bacteroidaceae, NADPH-utilizing specific activity was greatest in all species following ammonia-limited growth. Similar also to previous findings with P. bryantii, the NAD(P)H-utilizing GDH activity of P. ruminicola can be attributed to a single protein.

These results conclusively demonstrate that all type strains of the ruminal Prevotella sp. grouping possess GDH activity. 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aPrevotella brevis 3aPrevotella bryantii 3aPrevotella ruminicola 3aenzyme activity 3aglutamate dehydrogenase 3apeptides 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprokaryotic cells 3aproteins 2aAmmoniaxmetabolism 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aGlutamate Dehydrogenasexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPeptidesxmetabolism 2aPrevotellaxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism.1 aMorrison, M.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1997 Aug., v. 63, no. 8 p.3314-3317x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19980401b19980408c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle01565naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245007400166300001800240520031000258650001600568650001300584650002200597650001400619650001300633650001300646650002000659650001800679650003000697650004800727650003200775650003000807650002500837650002800862650003000890700001700920700001600937773009800953852000901051930003301060945001301093946001301106655001201119IND2062280920221120072618.0980306e199708  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206228092DNAL7 a92512202pmid7 aPMC1686312pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHave, R. ten10aInterference of peptone and tyrosine with the lignin peroxidase assay  ap. 3301-3303.  aThe N-unregulated white rot fungus Bjerkandera sp. strain BOS55 was cultured in 1 liter of peptone-yeast extract medium to produce lignin peroxidase (LiP).

The intestinal bacteria Clostridium saccharogumia, Eggerthella lenta, Blautia producta and Lactonifactor longoviformis convert the plant lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside via secoisolariciresinol (SECO) into the bioactive enterolignans enterodiol (ED) and enterolactone (EL). While the in vitro conversion of lignans by these bacteria has already been demonstrated, it is unclear whether this defined community is also capable of catalysing lignan transformation in vivo. We therefore associated germ-free rats with these four species. Germ-free rats served as a control. All animals were fed a diet containing 5% ground flaxseed. The caecal contents of rats associated with the four lignan-activating bacteria (ALB rats) contained SECO, ED and EL. The maximal EL formation rate from lignans in the pooled caecal contents of ALB rats was 7.52 nmol min⁻¹ g⁻¹ dry matter. The ALB rats excreted EL, but no SECO and ED, in their urine. The caecal contents of germ-free rats contained SECO, but no ED and EL. Their urine was devoid of lignans. Hence, the presence of enterolignans in the ALB rats, but not in the germ-free rats, demonstrates that this defined microbial community is capable of transforming plant lignans into EL in vivo. 3aClostridium 3aEggerthella lenta 3abacteria 3abioactive properties 3acecum 3adiet 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alignans 3amicrobial communities 3arats 3aurine 2a4-Butyrolactonexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aBiotransformation 2aButylene Glycolsxmetabolism 2aCecumxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aDiet 2aFecesxchemistry 2aFlax 2aGerm-Free Life 2aGram-Positive Bacteriaxmetabolism 2aLignansxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 0alignan 0aClostridium saccharogumia 0aBlautia producta 0aLactonifactor longoviformis1 aClavel, Thomas1 aLoh, Gunnar1 aBlaut, Michael0 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2010 June, v. 72, no. 3 p.507-514dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0168-64967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2010.00863.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100508b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04168naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002500171245010300196300001600299520184600315650001302161650004102174650001202215650003702227650003802264650002802302650005802330650006102388650005602449650000902505650006602514650006902580650005102649650003702700650003502737650005402772650000902826650001702835650004402852650008102896650007902977650006403056653001403120653001603134653003003150653001303180700002203193700002403215700002503239700002603264773013103290852000903421856009203430930003303522946001103555655001203566IND4436587720221123040642.0100507e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443658772DNAL7 a194901852pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2605.2009.00963.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJustulin Jr, Luis A.10aCombined effect of the finasteride and doxazosin on rat ventral prostate morphology and physiology  ap. 489-499.  aFinasteride (Fin) and Doxazosin (Dox), alone or in combination, have been widely used in treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) symptoms and recently have been suggested as potential drugs for prostate cancer (PCa)prevention and treatment. However, little is known about the effects of the combination therapy on prostate tissue morphology, physiology and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activity, a special set of enzymes closely related to PCa progression and metastasis. In this study, adult Wistar rats were treated with Fin + Dox (25 mg/kg per day) and the ventral prostate (VP) was excised at days 3 and 30 of treatment to evaluate morphology, cell proliferation, death, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) protein expression, MMP-2, MMP-9 activities and MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 mRNA expression. Fin + Dox treatment induced a transient increase in testosterone (T) plasma concentration and a permanent reduction in dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The VP and epithelial cell proliferation were reduced and the stromal collagen fibre volume fraction and apoptosis of the epithelial cell were increased. Fin + Dox treatment also increased the TGF-β1 immunoreaction in the epithelium and in the stroma. The mRNAs for MMP-2, TIMPs-1 and -2 expressions after 30 days of treatment were decreased. The mRNA for MMP-9 was not detected in any of the groups analysed. Fin + Dox treatment for 30 days promoted a decrease in gelatinolytic activity of MMP-2 and an increase in MMP-9. In conclusion, combined treatment with Fin and Dox interferes in the epithelial cell behaviour and in the MMPs activity, potentially via TGF-β1-mediated and androgen pathways. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the clinical data and also of the molecular mechanisms behind isolated or combined Fin and Dox long-term treatment. 3acollagen 2aAndrogensxpharmacologyxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aDihydrotestosteronexpharmacology 2aDoxazosinxpharmacology 2aEpithelial Cellsxcytologyxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aExtracellular Matrixxchemistryxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aFinasteridexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aMale 2aMatrix Metalloproteinase 9xgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aMatrix Metalloproteinasesxmetabolismxpharmacologyxphysiology. 2aProstatexdrug effectsxpathologyxphysiology. 2aProstatic Hyperplasiaxpathology 2aProstatic Neoplasmsxpathology 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysisxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aTestosteronexpharmacologyxphysiology. 2aTissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1xgeneticsxpharmacologyxphysiology. 2aTissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2xgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aTransforming Growth Factor beta1xpharmacologyxphysiology. 0aDoxazosin 0aFinasteride 0amatrix metalloproteinases 0aprostate1 aAcquaro, Carolina1 aCarvalho, Robson F.1 aSilva, Maeli Dal Pai1 aFelisbino, Sérgio L.0 tInternational journal of andrology.g2010 June, v. 33, no. 3 p.489-499dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-62637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2605.2009.00963.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100508b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02753naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245012700175300001600302520134100318650001401659650001601673650001601689650001501705650001601720650001501736650001701751650001901768650002401787650002301811650001301834650001301847650002201860650001501882651001701897651001301914653001201927653001001939653001501949653001201964700002701976773012302003852000902126856009202135930003302227946001102260655001202271IND4436591520221123040615.0100507e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443659152DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2028.2009.01128.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaddad, Charles R.10aSpider family composition and species richness patterns in two savannah habitats along the eastern coastal plain of Africa  ap. 418-427.  aThe spider faunas of two savannah reserves along the eastern coastal plain of Africa are compared. Species richness was higher in the tropical area, with 493 species (54 families) from Mkomazi Game Reserve, Tanzania. Species richness was also high in the subtropics, with a total of 431 species (46 families) recorded from Ndumo Game Reserve, South Africa. Spider community structure was remarkably similar in the two reserves, with Salticidae, Gnaphosidae, Thomisidae, Theridiidae and Araneidae the most species-rich families in both reserves. Eleven of the fourteen most species rich families were the same. A similar proportion of families were represented by singleton and doubleton species. A genus- and species-level comparison of ten spider families indicates that while there is considerable overlap in the generic composition of the reserves (Sorensen's Quotient of similarity: all >0.650 except Linyphiidae, 0.166; Corinnidae, 0.500) there is little overlap between the species occurring in the two sites (0.000-0.571), which was particularly evident in the more species-rich families. A comparison of diversity of 57 families in each reserve with the spider biodiversity in the two sub-regions suggests that local biodiversity is largely determined by regional biogeographical influences rather than local ecological factors. 3aAraneidae 3aGnaphosidae 3aLinyphiidae 3aSalticidae 3aTheridiidae 3aThomisidae 3abiogeography 3acoastal plains 3acommunity structure 3aconservation areas 3ahabitats 3asavannas 3aspecies diversity 3asubtropics 3aSouth Africa 3aTanzania 0aMkomazi 0aNdumo 0asimilarity 0aspecies1 aRussell-Smith, Anthony0 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2010 June, v. 48, no. 2 p.418-427dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0141-67077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2028.2009.01128.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100508b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02620naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001300129245023000142300001600372520131200388650002801700650001501728650001701743650002301760650001201783650002001795650002301815650000901838650002301847650002101870650001301891650000701904650003901911650002101950700001901971700001501990700001702005773009602022852000902118930003302127945001302160946001302173655001202186IND2123695220221123023040.0980627e199801  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212369522DNAL7 a163494762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYabe, K.10aPurification and characterization of O-methyltransferase I involved in conversion of demethylsterigmatocystin to sterigmatocystin and of dihydrodemethylsterigmatocystin to dihydrosterigmatocystin during aflatoxin biosynthesis  ap. 166-171.  aO-Methyltransferase I, which catalyzes conversions both of demethylsterigmatocystin (DMST) to sterigmatocystin (ST) and of dihydrodemethylsterigmatocystin (DHDMST) to dihydrosterigmatocystin (DHST) during aflatoxin biosynthesis, was purified to apparent homogeneity from the cytosol fraction of the mycelia of Aspergillus parasiticus NIAH-26 through the following chromatography series: phenyl-Sepharose, DEAE-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, Sephacryl S-300, and Matrex gel Green A. The apparent molecular mass was estimated at 150 kDa based on Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration chromatography and the denaturing molecular mass was 43 kDa based on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The pI of the enzyme was 4.4, and the optimal pH for activity was broad, from 6.5 to 9.0. In competition experiments using the purified enzyme, the formation of ST from DMST was suppressed when DHDMST was added to the reaction mixture and DHST was newly formed. These results indicate that DMST and DHDMST commonly serve as substrates for the enzyme. The Km of the enzyme for DMST was 0.94 micromolar, and that for DHDMST was 2.5 micromolar. Interestingly, MT-I kinetics deviated substantially from standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics, demonstrating substrate inhibition at a higher substrate concentration. 3aAspergillus parasiticus 3aaflatoxins 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3acytosol 3aenzyme kinetics 3agel chromatography 3agels 3amethyltransferases 3amolecular weight 3amycelium 3apH 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asterigmatocystin1 aMatsushima, K.1 aKoyama, T.1 aHamasaki, T.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1998 Jan., v. 64, no. 1 p.166-171x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle03054naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001900149245008200168300001600250520124700266650002701513650001701540650001201557650001901569650001501588650002101603650001601624650001101640650001001651650001401661650003001675650001601705650004001721650003101761650002901792650002401821650005701845650005301902650002001955650003101975650005402006650003202060650002502092650002902117650002402146650003002170650004202200650003802242700002002280773009602300852000902396930003302405945001302438946001302451655001202464IND2123696520221123023020.0980627e199801  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212369652DNAL7 a94350792pmid7 aPMC1246992pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrandall, A.D.10aNisin resistance in Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 700302 is a complex phenotype  ap. 231-237.  aNisin resistance in Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 700302 is a complex phenotype involving alterations in both the cytoplasmic membrane and the cell wall and a requirement for divalent cations. In addition to a lower ratio of C15 to C17 fatty acids than in the wild-type strain (A. S. Mazzotta and T. J. Montville, J. Appl. Microbiol. 82: 32-38, 1997), this nisin-resistant (Nis(r)) strain contained significantly more zwitterionic phosphatidylethanolamine and less anionic phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. The extraction of cardiolipin was enhanced by a penicillin-lysozyme step to disrupt the cell wall. This study is the first to quantify the phosphatidylethanolamine component of the L. monocytogenes cytoplasmic membrane. While these cytoplasmic membrane changes were induced by nisin, the Nis(r) strain also showed altered sensitivities to cell wall-acting compounds, even when grown in the absence of nisin, suggesting a constitutive alteration in the strain's cell wall. A model which integrates the roles of the cell membrane, cell wall, and divalent cations is presented. Finally, nisin resistance in L. monocytogenes ATCC 700302 conferred cross resistance to the class IIa bacteriocin pediocin PA-1 and the class IV leuconocin S. 3aListeria monocytogenes 3acardiolipins 3acations 3acell membranes 3acell walls 3across resistance 3afatty acids 3amodels 3anisin 3aphenotype 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3azwitterions 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aBacteriocinsxpharmacology 2aCardiolipinsxmetabolism 2aCationsxmetabolism 2aCell Membranexdrug effectsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCell Wallxdrug effectsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCross Reactions 2aDrug Resistance, Microbial 2aListeria monocytogenesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMuramidasexpharmacology 2aNisinxpharmacology 2aPenicillinsxpharmacology 2aPhosphatidylethanolaminesxmetabolism 2aPhosphatidylglycerolsxmetabolism1 aMontville, T.J.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1998 Jan., v. 64, no. 1 p.231-237x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02810naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165072000900174100001600183245013600199300002000335500002400355520106700379650001701446650001601463650002401479650001601503650002501519650001501544650001501559650001401574650002001588650002301608650003501631650004101666650001701707650001501724650004501739650002301784653003501807700001501842700001901857700002001876700002701896773017601923852000902099856007702108930003302185945002502218946001302243655001202256IND4434051120221122235013.0100316e20100210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443405112DNAL7 a200554092pmid7 a10.1021/jf902131r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ124 0aQ504 0aQ1041 aZhu, Huiyan10aRheofermentometer Fermentation and Breadmaking Characteristics of Dough Containing xylo-Oligosaccharide Hydrolyzate from Wheat Bran  ap. 1878–1883.  aIncludes references  aThe sugar composition of a xylo-oligosaccharide enzymolysis solution (XES) hydrolyzed from wheat bran and bread containing XES were studied.

XOS remained in the XES-containing bread after breadmaking processes (xylotriose, xylotetraose, and xylopentaose, 21.1%), with xylopentaose accounting for 14.4%. Maximum dough height (Hm) was significantly increased by XES, while the maximum gaseous release height (Hm′) was not affected. XES increased the brownness index of the crumb and crust of bread when compared to the that of control bread.

Long-term cropping system trials can guide crop and soil management options that are biophysically and economically sustainable. Thus, an extensive cereal-based rotation trial (1983–98) was established in northern Syria, to assess various two-course rotations with durum wheat (Triticum turgidum Desf.). The alternative rotations were: continuous wheat, fallow, chickpea (Cicer arietinum), lentil (Lens culinaris), medic (Medicago spp.), vetch (Vicia sativa) and watermelon (Citrullus vulgaris) as a summer crop. Ancillary treatments were: nitrogen (N) fertilizer application to the cereal phase (0, 30, 60 and 90 kg N/ha) and variable stubble grazing management (zero or stubble retention, moderate and heavy grazing). Both phases of the rotation trial occurred each year. The soil is a fine clay, thermic Calcixerollic Xerochrept. Seasonal rainfall was the dominant factor in influencing overall yields. Rotations significantly influenced yields, being highest for fallow (2·43 t/ha), followed by watermelon (similar to fallow), vetch, lentil, medic and chickpea, and least for continuous wheat (1·08 t/ha). Overall, yields increased consistently with added N, but responses varied with the rotation. The various stubble grazing regimes had little or no effect on either grain or straw yields. While the trial confirmed the value of fallow and the drawbacks of continuous cereal cropping, it also showed that replacing either practice with chickpea or lentil, or vetch for animal feed, was potentially a viable option. Given favourable economics, legume-based rotations for food and forage could contribute to sustainable cropping throughout the Mediterranean region. 3acrop residue management 3agrazing 3adurum wheat 3asustainable agriculture 3aFabaceae 3agrain yield 3alegumes 3acontinuous cropping 3afallow 3awheat straw 3aforage legumes 3adryland farming 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3acrop rotation 3anitrogen fertilizers 3afertilizer rates 3astubble 3afruit crops 3acropping sequence 3aSyria 0afield crops 0asoil management 0acrop management1 aSingh, M.1 aPala, M.1 aMakhboul, R.1 aMasri, S.1 aHarris, H.C.1 aSommer, R.0 tJournal of agricultural science.g2010 Apr., v. 148, no. 2 p.205-216dCambridge University Pressx0021-85967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00218596099905663Available from publisher's Web site  a20100513b20100605c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03196naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100001400154245010600168300001600274500002400290520160200314650001801916650001201934650002001946650001401966650002801980650002202008650002602030650001902056650002702075650004702102650002502149650000902174650001302183650002102196650002102217650002802238653001302266653003402279653002802313700001302341700001402354700001702368773011802385852000902503856008502512930003302597945002502630946001102655655001202666IND4434046220221122223735.0100316e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443404622DNAL7 a10.1017/S00218596099905912doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aJhang, T.10aEfficiency of different marker systems for molecular characterization of subtropical carrot germplasm  ap. 171-181.  aIncludes references  aGenetic variability in carrots is a consequence of allogamy, which leads to a high level of inbreeding depression, affecting the development of new varieties. To understand the extent of genetic variability in 40 elite indigenous breeding lines of subtropical carrots, 48 DNA markers consisting of 16 inter simple sequence repeats (ISSRs), 10 universal rice primers (URPs), 16 random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and six simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used. These 48 markers amplified a total of 591 bands, of which 569 were polymorphic (0·96). Amplicon size ranged from 200 to 3500 base pairs (bp) in ISSR, RAPD and URPs markers and from 100 to 300 bp in SSR markers. The ISSR marker system was found to be most efficient with (GT)(n) motifs as the most abundant SSR loci in the carrot genome. The unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) analysis of the combined data set of all the DNA markers obtained by four marker systems classified 40 genotypes in two groups with 0·45 genetic similarity with high Mantel matrix correlation (r=0·92). The principal component analysis (PCA) of marker data also explained 0·55 of the variation by first three components. Molecular diversity was very high and non-structured in these open-pollinated genotypes. The study demonstrated for the first time that URPs can be used successfully in genetic diversity analysis of tropical carrots. In addition, an entirely a new set of microsatellite markers, derived from the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) sequences of carrots, has been developed and utilized successfully. 3aDaucus carota 3acarrots 3agenetic markers 3agermplasm 3aplant genetic resources 3agenetic variation 3ainbreeding depression 3abreeding lines 3amicrosatellite repeats 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3agenetic polymorphism 3aloci 3agenotype 3agenetic distance 3aopen pollination 3aexpressed sequence tags 0aallogamy 0auniversal rice primer markers 0amolecular sequence data1 aKaur, M.1 aKalia, P.1 aSharma, T.R.0 tJournal of agricultural science.g2010 Apr., v. 148, no. 2 p.171-181dCambridge University Pressx0021-85967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00218596099905913Available from publisher's Web site  a20100513b20100605c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02923naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001800163245013600181300001600317500002400333500001500357520114500372650001901517650001501536650001101551650002101562650003001583650003901613650001401652650002001666650002101686650001001707650001801717650001801735650001001753650003001763650002001793650001601813650002201829650002201851650001101873650002501884650001201909653001601921653002601937700001601963700001601979700001701995700001602012773011802028852000902146856008502155930003302240945002502273946001102298655001202309IND4434046820221122223726.0100316e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443404682DNAL7 a10.1017/S00218596100000552doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL5001 aPetersson, A.10aComparison of three methods to enumerate gut microbiota of weanling piglets fed insoluble dietary fibre differing in lignin content  ap. 225-232.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of the current study was to compare three methods for determining the influence of different feeding strategies on the gut microbiota of piglets. Forty-eight weanling piglets were fed four different diets enriched with insoluble dietary fibre (wheat bran and pollen from Pinus massoniana). Starting from ileal and colonic samples, the total microbial DNA was isolated and bacterial parameters (lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, Bacteroides vulgatus and total bacterial counts) were quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The results for lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and total bacterial counts were compared with those obtained by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and cultivation method. No significant differences could be observed between dietary treatments with real-time PCR and FISH for all investigated parameters. Comparing the applied three methods no consistent results were achieved, whereas FISH usually showed lower values. It was shown that real-time PCR can be regarded as an alternative to conventional techniques and also as a complement to results obtained from conventional culture method. 3apiglet feeding 3awheat bran 3apollen 3aPinus massoniana 3aintestinal microorganisms 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3aweanlings 3aBifidobacterium 3afeed supplements 3acolon 3adietary fiber 3aLactobacillus 3aileum 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ainsoluble fiber 3aplate count 3amicrobial ecology 3aspecies diversity 3alignin 3aBacteroides vulgatus 3apiglets 0amethodology 0alaboratory techniques1 aDomig, K.J.1 aSchedle, K.1 aWindisch, W.1 aKneifel, W.0 tJournal of agricultural science.g2010 Apr., v. 148, no. 2 p.225-232dCambridge University Pressx0021-85967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00218596100000553Available from publisher's Web site  a20100513b20100605c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/22  aNon-US 7aarticle04135naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100001300182245007300195300001400268500002400282500001500306520223700321650001702558650001102575650001502586650002602601650001602627650002402643650002302667650000702690650001602697650002202713650002202735650001102757650002102768650002102789650003402810650001602844650002802860650002902888650003802917650003302955650002302988650001703011650002403028650002103052650001003073650004103083650002203124653001703146700001403163700001703177773011403194852000903308856008503317930003303402945002503435946001303460655001203473IND4433950120221122211414.0100313e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443395012DNAL7 a200990472pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-009-8893-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP120 0aK5301 aKang, Li10aBioconversion of Kraft Paper Mill Sludges to Ethanol by SSF and SSCF  ap. 53-66.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPaper mill sludge is a solid waste material composed of pulp residues and ash generated from pulping and paper making processes. The carbohydrate portion of the sludge has chemical and physical characteristics similar to pulp. Because of its high carbohydrate content and well-dispersed structure, the sludges can be biologically converted to value-added products without pretreatment. In this study, two different types of paper mill sludges, primary sludge and recycle sludge, were evaluated as a feedstock for bioconversion to ethanol. The sludges were first subjected to enzymatic conversion to sugars by commercial cellulase enzymes. The enzymatic conversion was inefficient because of interference by ash in the sludges with the enzymatic reaction. The main cause was that the pH level is dictated by CaCO₃ in ash, which is two units higher than the pH optimum of cellulase. To alleviate this problem, simultaneous saccharification and cofermentation (SSCF) using cellulase (Spezyme CP) and recombinant Escherichia coli (ATCC-55124), and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) using cellulase and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ATCC-200062) were applied to the sludges without any pretreatment. Ethanol yields of 75-81% of the theoretical maximum were obtained from the SSCF on the basis of total carbohydrates. The yield from the SSF was also found to be in the range of 74-80% on the basis of glucan. The SSCF and SSF proceeded under stable condition with the pH staying near 5.0, close to the optimum for cellulase. Decrease of pH occurred due to carbonic acid and other organic acids formed during fermentation. The ash was partially neutralized by the acids produced from the SSCF and SSF and acted as a buffer to stabilize the pH during fermentation. When the SSF and SSCF were operated in fed-batch mode, the ethanol concentration in the broth increased from 25.5 and 32.6 g/L (single feed) to 45 and 42 g/L, respectively. The ethanol concentration was limited by the tolerance of the microorganism in the case of SSCF. The ethanol yield in fed-batch operation decreased to 68% for SSCF and 70% for SSF. The high-solids condition in the bioreactor appears to create adverse effects on the cellulase reaction. 3afermentation 3asugars 3acellulases 3apulp and paper sludge 3abioreactors 3aenzymatic treatment 3aethanol production 3apH 3akraft paper 3acalcium carbonate 3abiotransformation 3ayields 3asaccharification 3aEscherichia coli 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBioreactors 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aCarbohydratesxchemistry 2aCellulasexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aEscherichia colixmetabolism 2aEthanolxchemistry 2aFermentation 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aIndustrial Waste 2aPaper 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexmetabolism 2aSewagexchemistry 0aoptimization1 aWang, Wei1 aLee, Yoon Y.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2010 May, v. 161, no. 1-8 p.53-66dHumana Press Incx0273-22897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-009-8893-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20100427b20100501c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/04/27  aOther US 7aarticle02608naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100003700182245013400219300001500353500002400368500001500392520071500407650001701122650001101139650002701150650002201177650002301199650001301222650001101235650002101246650002201267650001201289650001601301650002701317650002701344650002501371650003201396650002401428650001701452650003601469650003101505650002501536650002601561653001701587700002601604700003601630700002701666700002101693773011501714852000901829856008501838930003301923945002501956946001301981655001201994IND4433950520221122211502.0100313e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443395052DNAL7 a198766072pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-009-8810-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP120 0aQ1041 ada Silveira dos Santos, Danielle10aEthanol Production from Sugarcane Bagasse by Zymomonas mobilis Using Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF) Process  ap. 93-105.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aConsiderable efforts have been made to utilize agricultural and forest residues as biomass feedstock for the production of second-generation bioethanol as an alternative fuel.

Statistical experimental design was used to optimize the conditions of SSF, evaluating solid content, enzymatic load, and cell concentration. The optimum conditions were found to be solid content (30%), enzymatic load (25 filter paper units/g), and cell concentration (4 g/L), resulting in a maximum ethanol concentration of 60 g/L and a volumetric productivity of 1.5 g L⁻¹ h⁻¹. 3afermentation 3asolids 3afood processing wastes 3asugarcane bagasse 3aethanol production 3abiofuels 3ayields 3asaccharification 3aZymomonas mobilis 2aBiomass 2aBioreactors 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aCellobiosexmetabolism 2aCellulosexchemistry 2aEnergy-Generating Resources 2aEthanolxmetabolism 2aFermentation 2aGlucosexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSaccharumxchemistry 2aZymomonasxmetabolism 0aoptimization1 aCamelo, Anna Carolina1 aRodrigues, Kelly Cristina Pedro1 aCarlos, Luís Cláudio1 aPereira, Nei Jr.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2010 May, v. 161, no. 1-8 p.93-105dHumana Press Incx0273-22897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-009-8810-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100427b20100501c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/04/27  aOther US 7aarticle03457naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165072000900174100001500183245013900198300001600337500002400353500001500377520113600392650002201528650001101550650001801561650001801579650001601597650001301613650001901626650002201645650001501667650002001682650001101702650002101713650002001734650001901754650002401773650007001797650002701867650008501894650002101979650003302000650002902033650001802062650002402080650002302104650002702127650002602154650002902180650001902209650002302228650001602251650002502267650002702292653001502319653002402334700002002358700001902378700001502397773013202412852000902544856007702553930003302630945002502663946001102688655001202699IND4434021620221122211450.0100313e20100415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443402162DNAL7 a203551052pmid7 a10.1002/jsfa.38742doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ405 0aQ505 0aQ1051 aLong, Zhen10aStability of hydroperoxide lyase activity from Amaranthus tricolor (Amaranthus mangostanus L.) leaves: influence of selected additives  ap. 729-734.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: Hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) has potential value for the flavour additive industry. Currently, the production and application of HPL suffer from stability problems. The objective of this study was to investigate the stabilisation of HPL preparation from Amaranthus tricolor leaves by the addition of selected chemical additives.RESULTS: Amaranthus tricolor leaves were identified as a particularly rich source of 13-HPL activity. The addition of 100 g L⁻¹ sucrose and trehalose to microsomal HPL prior to lyophilisation could retain nearly 100% enzymatic activity, compared to only 20% for the lyophilised control. The lyophilised microsomal HPL containing sucrose maintained full activity for even 40 days storage at - 20 °C. For HPL solution, glycerol was effective for long-term stability at - 20 °C. Moreover, poyols (sucrose and trehalose) and amino acid (glycine) enhanced the thermostability of HPL, while KCl and polyol mannitol decreased the thermostability of HPL.CONCLUSION: The flavour-producing enzyme HPL, found in the leaves of Amaranthus tricolor, was stabilised by the addition of chemical additives. 3athermal stability 3alyases 3afood analysis 3afreeze drying 3anovel foods 3aglycerol 3aplant extracts 3anatural additives 3aflavorings 3afood processing 3aleaves 3afood composition 3aenzyme activity 3ahydroperoxides 3aAmaranthus tricolor 2aAldehyde-Lyasesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aAmaranthusxenzymology 2aCytochrome P-450 Enzyme Systemxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aEnzyme Stability 2aFlavoring Agentsxmetabolism 2aFood Technologyxmethods 2aFreeze Drying 2aGlycerolxchemistry 2aGlycinexchemistry 2aMicrosomesxenzymology 2aOsmolar Concentration 2aPlant Leavesxenzymology 2aPlant Proteins 2aSucrosexchemistry 2aTemperature 2aTrehalosexchemistry 2aVegetablesxenzymology 0aAmaranthus 0ahydroperoxide lyase1 aKong, Xiangzhen1 aZhang, Caimeng1 aHua, Yufei0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2010 Apr. 15, v. 90, no. 5 p.729-734dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.38743Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03202naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165100002000174245010300194300001600297500002400313500001500337520121900352650001801571650002001589650002701609650003101636650001101667650001801678650001201696650002601708650002601734650002501760650003501785650002801820650002501848650002701873650002901900650003101929650003501960650002001995650001802015650002402033650002502057650002702082650002802109650001502137650001702152650002002169653001802189653001002207700001702217700001902234773013202253852000902385856007702394930003302471945002502504946001102529655001202540IND4434022020221122211453.0100313e20100415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443402202DNAL7 a203551092pmid7 a10.1002/jsfa.38792doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ105 0aQ5051 aHuang, Jianjun.10aEffects of micronization on the physico-chemical properties of peels of three root and tuber crops  ap. 759-763.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of micronization on the physicochemical properties of the peels of root and tuber crops, including yam (Dioscorea alata L.), taro (Colocasia esculenta L.) and sweet potato (Ipomea batatas L.). Two continuous milling sections, including hammer milling and ball milling, were applied to three samples to obtain micro-sized particles of root and tuber peels. The micronization by ball-milling treatment for 10 h was carried out to investigate the distribution of particle sizes and the changes in physiochemical properties.RESULTS: The results indicate that the peels of three crops appeared to be significantly decreased in particle size after 10 h of ball-milling treatment. Moreover, the ball-milling treatments resulted in the redistribution of fiber components from insoluble fiber to soluble fiber. The micronization treatments decreased the bulk density but increased the solubility and water-holding capacities of the micronized peels.CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that micronization treatments can improve functional properties of the fiber components of micronized peels, which provide a good source of dietary fiber in food applications. 3adietary fiber 3aroot vegetables 3afood processing wastes 3aphysicochemical properties 3atubers 3aparticle size 3amilling 3aproximate composition 3afunctional properties 2aColocasiaxchemistry 2aCrops, Agriculturalxchemistry 2aDietary Fiberxanalysis 2aDioscoreaxchemistry 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Technologyxmethods 2aIpomoea batatasxchemistry 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aNutritive Value 2aParticle Size 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aPlant Oilsxanalysis 2aPlant Rootsxchemistry 2aPlant Tubersxchemistry 2aSolubility 2aTime Factors 2aWaterxanalysis 0amicronization 0apeels1 aChen, Yi-Fen1 aWang, Chiun-CR0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2010 Apr. 15, v. 90, no. 5 p.759-763dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.38793Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03709naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100001900182245012100201300001600322500002400338500001500362520170700377650002302084650001702107650001402124650001102138650001102149650002102160650002602181650001002207650001502217650001202232650002302244650001602267650003002283650001302313650001402326650002502340650000702365650002802372650002802400650002902428650003202457650002402489650001702513650003202530650001502562650003302577650003502610651003102645653001802676653001102694653001202705700002502717773011602742852000902858856008502867930003302952945002502985946001303010655001203023IND4433949220221122211443.0100313e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443394922DNAL7 a200844712pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-009-8887-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK590 0aX3401 aUm, Byung-Hwan10aEvaluation of Enzyme Mixtures in Releasing Fermentable Sugars from Pre-pulping Extracts of Mixed Northeast Hardwoods  ap. 432-447.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aOne near-term option to developing a forest product biorefinery is to derive pre-pulping extract from incoming wood chips before the main pulping step. The release of monomer sugars from a xylan-rich extract, creating a fermentable substrate is a prerequisite for utilization of pre-pulping extract for production of ethanol or other value-added products. This study examined the individual and mixture efficiencies of two hemicellulolytic microbial enzymes and two xylanase preparations in catalyzing degradation of green liquor (GL) and hot water (HW) pre-pulping extracts. The effects of four commercial enzyme preparations were determined by assessing yields of xylose + galactose + mannose (xmg) obtained under different reaction conditions. Of the individual enzyme preparations tested, a sample NS 50012 was superior to the other enzyme preparations in releasing xmg under conditions optimized for separate hydrolysis and fermentation and for simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. In comparison to pre-pulping extracts treated with HW, extract treated with GL was found to inhibit the action of all tested enzymes. This inhibition may be related to higher salt and lignin phenol in the GL extract. On both types of extracts, the mixture constituted by NS 50012 and NS 50030 provided the highest yield of hemicellulose conversion at 55 °C and pH 5.5. The generated digestibility thus signified that the synergistic effectiveness in xylan + galactan + mannan (XMG) hydrolysis between NS 50012 (from Aspergillus aculeatus) and NS 50030 (from Aspergillus oryzae) is the result of an interaction mechanism involving different XMG-degrading enzyme activities in the two enzyme preparations. 3aAspergillus oryzae 3afermentation 3axylanases 3axylose 3ayields 3asaccharification 3aAspergillus aculeatus 3axylan 3awood chips 3amannose 3aethanol production 3atemperature 3apulp and paper technology 3ahardwood 3agalactose 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3apH 2aAspergillusxenzymology 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aCarbohydratesxchemistry 2aEnergy-Generating Resources 2aEnzymesxmetabolism 2aFermentation 2aFungal Proteinsxmetabolism 2aHydrolysis 2aWoodxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aXylansxchemistryxmetabolism. 3aNortheastern United States 0ahemicellulose 0asugars 0aenzymes1 avan Walsum, G.

Immobilization and stabilization of enzymes may allow their reuse in many cycles of the reaction, decreasing the process costs. This work proposes the use of a rational approach to obtain immobilized commercial xylanase biocatalysts with optimized features. Xylanase NS50014 from Novozymes was characterized and immobilized on glyoxyl-agarose, agarose-glutaraldehyde, and agarose-amino-epoxy support and on differently activated chitosan supports: glutaraldehyde-chitosan, glyoxyl-chitosan, and epoxy-chitosan. Two different chitosan matrices were tested. The best chitosan derivative was epoxy-chitosan-xylanase, which presented 100% of immobilization yield and 64% of recovered activity. No significant increase on the thermal stability was observed for all the chitosan-enzyme derivatives. Immobilization on glyoxyl-agarose showed low yield immobilization and stabilization degrees of the obtained derivative. The low concentration of lysine groups in the enzyme molecule could explain these poor results. The protein was then chemically modified with ethylenediamine and immobilized on glyoxyl-agarose. The new enzyme derivatives were 40-fold more stable than the soluble, aminated, and dialyzed enzyme (70 °C, pH 7), with 100% of immobilization yield. Therefore, the increase of the number of amine groups in the enzyme surface was confirmed to be a good strategy to improve the properties of immobilized xylanase. 3axylanases 3achitosan 3aagarose 3aimmobilized enzymes 2aAnimals 2aChitosanxchemistry 2aEndo-1,4-beta Xylanasesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aEnzyme Stability 2aEnzymes, Immobilizedxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aGelsxchemistry 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aSepharosexchemistry 2aTemperature1 aKomesu, Andrea1 aAdriano, Wellington Sabino1 aTardioli, Paulo Waldir1 aGiordano, Raquel Lima Camargo0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2010 May, v. 161, no. 1-8 p.455-467dHumana Press Incx0273-22897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-009-8897-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/04/28  aOther US 7aarticle03155naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100002500182245015100207300001600358500002400374520132100398650002301719650001401742650001301756650001201769650001401781650001801795650002201813650002301835650002201858650001101880650002701891650001301918650001201931650001601943650003701959650003501996650002802031650004102059650002102100650003402121650001302155700002202168700002002190700001802210700002102228700002302249773011602272852000902388856008502397930003302482945002502515946001302540655001202553IND4433949620221122211405.0100313e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443394962DNAL7 a197564122pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-009-8766-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP120 0aM0011 aMatsumoto, Mitsufumi10aMarine Diatom, Navicula sp.

These strains were tentatively identified as Navicula sp. and Chlorella sp., respectively, by 18S rDNA analysis. Growth and lipid accumulation conditions of both strains were analyzed by changing nutrient concentrations in growth media and initial illuminance intensity. The highest productivity of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) reached to 154 mg/L/week for NKG400014 and 185 mg/L/week for JPCC DA0580. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis indicates that FAME fraction from NKG400014 mainly contained 9-12-15-octadecatrienoate (C18:3) and that from JPCC DA0580 mainly contained methyl palmitate (C16:0) and methyl palmitoleate (C16:1). Furthermore, calorimetric analysis revealed that the energy content of strain was 4,233 ± 55 kcal/kg (i.e., 15.9 ± 0.2 MJ/kg) for NKG400014 and 6,423 ± 139 kcal/mg (i.e., 26.9 ± 0.6 MJ/kg) for JPCC DA0580, respectively. The value from JPCC DA0580 was equivalent to that of coal. The strains NKG400014 and JPCC DA0580 will become a promising resource that can grow as dominant species in the open ocean toward production of both liquid and solid biofuels. 3amarine environment 3abiodiesel 3aNavicula 3astrains 3aChlorella 3aribosomal DNA 3afatty acid esters 3agas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3alipids 3afatty acid composition 2aBiofuels 2aBiomass 2aCalorimetry 2aChlorellaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDiatomsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFatty Acidsxmetabolism 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aLipid Metabolism 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 18Sxanalysis 2aSeawater1 aSugiyama, Hiroshi1 aMaeda, Yoshiaki1 aSatō, Reiko.1 aTanaka, Tsuyoshi1 aMatsunaga, Tadashi0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2010 May, v. 161, no. 1-8 p.483-490dHumana Press Incx0273-22897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-009-8766-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/04/28  aOther US 7aarticle03291naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182100002100191245008800212300001600300500002400316520136500340650002001705650002801725650003401753650001401787650001601801650002201817650002001839650001401859650001401873650001401887650002501901650001501926650003401941650003101975650003402006650003202040650002402072650002802096650002102124650002802145650003202173650003102205653002602236653002002262700001902282700002302301700002202324700002602346773011602372852000902488856008502497930003302582945002502615946001302640655001202653IND4433947520221122174052.0100313e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443394752DNAL7 a197638952pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-009-8769-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX340 0aK530 0aW0001 aCassland, Pierre10aEvaluation of Oxalate Decarboxylase and Oxalate Oxidase for Industrial Applications  ap. 255-263.  aIncludes references  aIncreased recirculation of process water has given rise to problems with formation of calcium oxalate incrusts (scaling) in the pulp and paper industry and in forest biorefineries. The potential in using oxalate decarboxylase from Aspergillus niger for oxalic acid removal in industrial bleaching plant filtrates containing oxalic acid was examined and compared with barley oxalate oxidase. Ten different filtrates from chemical pulping were selected for the evaluation. Oxalate decarboxylase degraded oxalic acid faster than oxalate oxidase in eight of the filtrates, while oxalate oxidase performed better in one filtrate. One of the filtrates inhibited both enzymes. The potential inhibitory effect of selected compounds on the enzymatic activity was tested. Oxalate decarboxylase was more sensitive than oxalate oxidase to hydrogen peroxide. Oxalate decarboxylase was not as sensitive to chlorate and chlorite as oxalate oxidase. Up to 4 mM chlorate ions, the highest concentration tested, had no inhibitory effect on oxalate decarboxylase. Analysis of the filtrates suggests that high concentrations of chlorate present in some of the filtrates were responsible for the higher sensitivity of oxalate oxidase in these filtrates. Oxalate decarboxylase was thus a better choice than oxalate oxidase for treatment of filtrates from chlorine dioxide bleaching. 3acalcium oxalate 3apulp and paper industry 3apulp and paper mill effluents 3ableaching 3aoxalic acid 3aAspergillus niger 3aenzyme activity 3achlorates 3achlorites 3afiltrates 3awastewater treatment 3akraft pulp 2aAspergillus nigerxenzymology 2aCarboxy-Lyasesxmetabolism 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxmetabolism 2aFungal Proteinsxmetabolism 2aHordeumxenzymology 2aIndustrial Microbiology 2aIndustrial Waste 2aOxalic Acidxmetabolism 2aOxidoreductasesxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 0aoxalate decarboxylase 0aoxalate oxidase1 aSjöde, Anders1 aWinestrand, Sandra1 aJönsson, Leif J.1 aNilvebrant, Nils-Olof0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2010 May, v. 161, no. 1-8 p.255-263dHumana Press Incx0273-22897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-009-8769-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/04/28  aOther US 7aarticle02570naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001800141245009600159300001600255520163900271650001701910650001301927650001401940650001801954650002001972650001401992650001402006700002002020773007002040852000902110856008102119930003302200946001102233655001202244IND4432414420221122135257.0100205e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443241442DNAL7 a10.1093/glycob/cwp1862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDam, Tarun K.10aLectins as pattern recognition molecules: The effects of epitope density in innate immunity  ap. 270-279.  aThe innate immune response of multicellular organisms is initiated by the binding of soluble and membrane-bound host molecules including lectins to the surface of pathogenic organisms. Until recently, it was believed that the epitopes recognized by host molecules were uniquely associated with the pathogenic organisms. Hence, the term pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) was used to describe their binding specificities. However, with an expanding number of lectin classes including C-type lectins, siglecs, and galectins recognized as PRRs, it is apparent that many of the glycan epitopes recognized on foreign pathogens are present in the host and involved in cellular functions. Hence, the molecular basis for pattern recognition by lectins of carbohydrate epitopes on pathogens is in question. A number of studies indicate that the density and number of glycan epitopes in multivalent carbohydrates and glycoprotein receptors determine the affinity of lectins and their effector functions. This paper reviews lectins that are involved in innate immunity, mechanisms of enhanced affinity and cross-linking of lectins with density-dependent glycan epitopes, density-dependent recognition of glycan receptors by lectins in host systems and lectin-glycan interactions in foreign pathogens. Evidence indicates that lectin pattern recognition in innate immunity is part of a general mechanism of density-dependent glycan recognition. This leads to a new definition of lectin receptor in biological systems, which considers the density and number of glycan epitopes on the surface of cells and not just the affinity of single epitopes. 3acrosslinking 3aepitopes 3agalectins 3aglycoproteins 3ainnate immunity 3apathogens 3areceptors1 aBrewer, C.

We have gained insights into the evolution and transmission dynamics of ARV resistance by designing a biologically complex multistrain network model. With this model, we traced the evolutionary history of ARV resistance in San Francisco and predict its future dynamics. By using classification and regression trees, we identified the key immunologic, virologic, and treatment factors that increase ARV resistance. Our modeling shows that 60% of the currently circulating ARV-resistant strains in San Francisco are capable of causing self-sustaining epidemics, because each individual infected with one of these strains can cause, on average, more than one new resistant infection. It is possible that a new wave of ARV-resistant strains that pose a substantial threat to global public health is emerging. 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aantiretroviral agents 3adisease outbreaks 3adrug resistance 3aevolution 3amodels 3apublic health1 aOkano, Justin T.1 aKahn, James S.1 aBodine, Erin N.1 aBlower, Sally0 tScience.g2010 Feb. 5, v. 327, no. 5966 p.697-701dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11805563Available from publisher's Web site  a20100218b20100305c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02921naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002100141245014300162300001600305520153700321650000801858650001401866650001501880650001501895650001301910650002201923650002601945650001201971650001101983650001401994650001902008650002802027650001602055700002002071700002202091700001902113700001802132700002302150700001802173700002002191700002402211773007002235852000902305856008102314930003302395946001102428655001202439IND4432415620221122135306.0100205e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443241562DNAL7 a10.1093/glycob/cwp1952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitsuki, Motoaki10aSiglec-7 mediates nonapoptotic cell death independently of its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs in monocytic cell line U937  ap. 395-402.  aSiglec-7, a sialic acid binding immunoglobulin-like lectin, predominantly transduces inhibitory signals through cytosolic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs). Here, we report that clustering of Siglec-7 with a specific F(ab')₂ elicited cell death. Interestingly, a truncated Siglec-7 lacking the cytosolic ITIM domain still induced the cell death, suggesting that the ITIMs are not essential for the death signaling. Further analyses of the death signaling revealed that an oxygen radical scavenger, N-acetyl cysteine, completely inhibited the cell death, whereas a pancaspase inhibitor did not. In addition, caspase-3 activation, DNA ladder formation, and nuclear condensation were not detected during the death process, suggesting that the cell death is nonapoptotic. To identify the critical region for the death signaling, we prepared a series of shuffling chimeras between Siglec-7 and Siglec-9, the latter of which did not transduce a death signal. The critical region was mapped to the middle of the membrane-proximal C2-set domain, which contained only six amino acid differences between Siglec-7 and Siglec-9. Point mutation analyses of each of these six amino acids revealed that four of the six amino acids were critical for the death signal. A computer-assisted 3D modeling revealed that these four amino acids were proximally located on the surface of the C2-set domain. In conclusion, Siglec-7 induces nonapoptotic cell death, the signal for which is transduced by an extracellular C2-set domain. 3aDNA 3acaspase-3 3acell death 3acell lines 3acysteine 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aimmunologic receptors 3alectins 3amodels 3amonocytes 3apoint mutation 3areactive oxygen species 3asialic acid1 aNara, Kiyomitsu1 aYamaji, Toshiyuki1 aEnomoto, Ayako1 aKanno, Mayumi1 aYamaguchi, Yoshiki1 aYamada, Akane1 aWaguri, Satoshi1 aHashimoto, Yasuhiro0 tGlycobiology.g2010 Mar., v. 20, no. 3 p.395-402x0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwp1953Available from publisher's Web site  a20100205b20100305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02001naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002200143245009500165300001600260520083000276650001301106650001901119650001101138650001301149650001201162650002001174650001001194650000901204700002301213700002101236700002101257700001901278700002601297700001801323773012401341852000901465856008301474930003301557946001301590655001201603IND4432407620221122135221.0100205e20100205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443240762DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11829902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChapman, Jason W.10aFlight Orientation Behaviors Promote Optimal Migration Trajectories in High-Flying Insects  ap. 682-685.  aMany insects undertake long-range seasonal migrations to exploit temporary breeding sites hundreds or thousands of kilometers apart, but the behavioral adaptations that facilitate these movements remain largely unknown. Using entomological radar, we showed that the ability to select seasonally favorable, high-altitude winds is widespread in large day- and night-flying migrants and that insects adopt optimal flight headings that partially correct for crosswind drift, thus maximizing distances traveled. Trajectory analyses show that these behaviors increase migration distances by 40% and decrease the degree of drift from seasonally optimal directions. These flight behaviors match the sophistication of those seen in migrant birds and help explain how high-flying insects migrate successfully between seasonal habitats. 3aaltitude 3abreeding sites 3aflight 3ahabitats 3ainsects 3amigratory birds 3aradar 3awind1 aNesbit, Rebecca L.1 aBurgin, Laura E.1 aReynolds, Don R.1 aSmith, Alan D.1 aMiddleton, Douglas R.1 aHill, Jane K.0 tScience.g2010 Feb. 5, v. 327, no. 5966 p.682-685dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11829903Available from publisher's Web site  a20100205b20100305c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02641naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002300141245012300164300001600287520160000303650001201903650002001915650002601935650001101961650001201972650002101984650002902005700001202034700002102046700002002067773007002087852000902157856008102166930003302247946001102280655001202291IND4432415120221122135303.0100205e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443241512DNAL7 a10.1093/glycob/cwp1822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamaguchi, Daisuke10aHuman XTP3-B binds to α1-antitrypsin variant nullHong Kong via the C-terminal MRH domain in a glycan-dependent manner  ap. 348-355.  aXTP3-B is a soluble endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein containing two mannose-6-phosphate receptor homology (MRH) domains in its sequence. XTP3-B interacts with a membrane-associated ubiquitin ligase complex, and, therefore, is thought to participate in ER-associated degradation (ERAD). In this study, the recombinant human XTP3-B fused with IgG-Fc (XTP3-B-Fc), XTP3-B without an N-terminal MRH domain fused with IgG-Fc (XTP3-BΔ1-Fc), or XTP3-B without a C-terminal MRH domain fused with IgG-Fc (XTP3-BΔ2-Fc) were prepared. XTP3-B-Fc and XTP3-BΔ1-Fc bound to Lec1 cells but not to CHO, Lec2, or Lec8 cells, while XTP3-BΔ2-Fc did not bind to any of these cells. The binding of XTP3-B-Fc and XTP3-BΔ1-Fc to Lec1 cells was abrogated by treatment of the cells with endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, Manα1,6Man or Manα1,6(Manα1,3)Manα1,6(Manα1,3)Man, or by substitution of Arg428 or Tyr457 in the C-terminal MRH domain with alanine. Arg428 and Tyr457 are homologous to amino acids that mediate glycan binding by the cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor. An immunoprecipitation experiment using lysates of cells co-expressing wild-type α1-antitrypsin (AT), α1-antitrypsin variant nullHong Kong (ATNHK), and FLAG-tagged XTP3-B, or its mutants, demonstrated that ATNHK, but not AT, specifically co-precipitated with XTP3-B and XTP3-BΔ1. The glycan-binding-deficient XTP3-BΔ2 did not bind either AT or ATNHK. These results suggest that XTP3-B specifically binds to ATNHK, which is a well-known substrate of ERAD, via a C-terminal MRH domain in a glycan-dependent manner. 3aalanine 3acoprecipitation 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3ahumans 3amutants 3aprecipitin tests 3aubiquitin-protein ligase1 aHu, Dan1 aMatsumoto, Naoki1 aYamamoto, Kazuo0 tGlycobiology.g2010 Mar., v. 20, no. 3 p.348-355x0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwp1823Available from publisher's Web site  a20100205b20100305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02155naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001300184245006600197300001600263506007600279520085600355506003701211650000801248650001801256650002901274650001101303650001601314650001701330650001901347650001101366700001401377700001701391700001901408700001401427700001801441773012401459852000901583856008301592930003301675946001301708655001201721IND4432407820221207085537.0100205e20100205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443240782DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11817662doi7 aPMC28927002pmcid7 a201335722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGe, Peng10aCryo-EM Model of the Bullet-Shaped Vesicular Stomatitis Virus  ap. 689-693.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a bullet-shaped rhabdovirus and a model system of negative-strand RNA viruses. Through direct visualization by means of cryo-electron microscopy, we show that each virion contains two nested, left-handed helices: an outer helix of matrix protein M and an inner helix of nucleoprotein N and RNA. M has a hub domain with four contact sites that link to neighboring M and N subunits, providing rigidity by clamping adjacent turns of the nucleocapsid. Side-by-side interactions between neighboring N subunits are critical for the nucleocapsid to form a bullet shape, and structure-based mutagenesis results support this description. Together, our data suggest a mechanism of VSV assembly in which the nucleocapsid spirals from the tip to become the helical trunk, both subsequently framed and rigidified by the M layer.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3aVesiculovirus 3acryo-electron microscopy 3amodels 3amutagenesis 3anucleocapsid 3anucleoproteins 3avirion1 aTsao, Jun1 aSchein, Stan1 aGreen, Todd J.1 aLuo, Ming1 aZhou, Z.

We used scanning tunneling microscopy to visualize electronic states in Ga₁₋xMnxAs samples close to this transition. Our measurements show that doping-induced disorder produces strong spatial variations in the local tunneling conductance across a wide range of energies. Near the Fermi energy, where spectroscopic signatures of electron-electron interaction are the most prominent, the electronic states exhibit a diverging spatial correlation length. Power-law decay of the spatial correlations is accompanied by log-normal distributions of the local density of states and multifractal spatial characteristics. 3aenergy 3alognormal distribution 3aphase transition 3ascanning tunneling microscopy 3aspectroscopy1 aRoushan, Pedram1 aMack, Shawn1 aZhou, Brian1 aHuse, David A.1 aAwschalom, D.q(David)1 aYazdani, Ali0 tScience.g2010 Feb. 5, v. 327, no. 5966 p.665-669dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11836403Available from publisher's Web site  a20100205b20100305c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01817naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011000128300001600238520100800254650001701262650001401279650001001293650002301303650001301326650001901339700001701358773009901375852000901474939003301483946001101516655001201527IND9001230820221122045620.0900327s1990    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900123082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDouillard, C.14aThe aroma of strawberry (Fragaria ananassa): characterisation of some cultivars and influence of freezing  ap. 517-531.  aThe volatiles of six strawberry (Fragaria ananassa Duch) cultivars, both fresh and deep-frozen, were isolated by direct dichloromethane extraction. Sixty compounds were identified and quantified by GC-MS. Characterisation of cultivars was achieved by applying principal component analysis to the chromatographic data. Great differences were observed. Maxim and Directeur Paul Wallbaum are rather low in volatiles while Gariguette and Tioga are rich in mesifurane (2,5-dimethyl-4-methoxy-2,3-dihydrofuran-3-one), furaneol (2,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-2,3-dihydrofuran-3-one) and nerolidol. Esters are the major compounds in Senga Sengana and Vicomtesse Hericart de Thury. This last cultivar is also characterised by high concentrations of gamma-decalactone. Trans-hex-2-enal and hexanal are found mainly in fresh fruits. Determinations of volatiles in stored frozen fruits have shown only slight influence on mesifurane and furaneol while the concentration of nerolidol increases and that of esters decreases. 3astrawberries 3acultivars 3aodors 3avolatile compounds 3afreezing 3afrozen storage1 aGuichard, E.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1990, v. 50, no. 4 p.517-531x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02398naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245009800167300001600265520124100281650000901522650001801531650002901549650001601578650002101594650001601615650001701631650004401648650001101692700002101703700002101724700002001745773012101765852000901886856008501895939003301980946001102013655001202024IND4457200220221122005810.0110423e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445720022DNAL7 a10.1007/s10858-011-9485-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuggan, Gavin E. 10aMetabolic profiling of vitamin C deficiency in Gulo−/− mice using proton NMR spectroscopy  ap. 165-173.  aNutrient deficiencies are an ongoing problem in many populations and ascorbic acid is a key vitamin whose mild or acute absence leads to a number of conditions including the famously debilitating scurvy. As such, the biochemical effects of ascorbate deficiency merit ongoing scrutiny, and the Gulo knockout mouse provides a useful model for the metabolomic examination of vitamin C deficiency. Like humans, these animals are incapable of synthesizing ascorbic acid but with dietary supplements are otherwise healthy and grow normally. In this study, all vitamin C sources were removed after weaning from the diet of Gulo−/− mice (n = 7) and wild type controls (n = 7) for 12 weeks before collection of serum. A replicate study was performed with similar parameters but animals were harvested pre-symptomatically after 2-3 weeks. The serum concentration of 50 metabolites was determined by quantitative profiling of 1D proton NMR spectra. Multivariate statistical models were used to describe metabolic changes as compared to control animals; replicate study animals were used for external validation of the resulting models. The results of the study highlight the metabolites and pathways known to require ascorbate for proper flux. 3aGulo 3aascorbic acid 3aascorbic acid deficiency 3ablood serum 3aknockout mutants 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ascurvy1 aJoan Miller, B. 1 aJirik, Frank R. 1 aVogel, Hans J. 0 tJournal of biomolecular NMR.g2011 Apr., v. 49, no. 3-4 p.165-173dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0925-27387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10858-011-9485-53Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110424  aNon-US 7aarticle03188naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245007300162300001200235520181500247650002002062650002502082650003002107650002902137650000802166650001602174650001402190650001202204650001002216650003802226650001202264650001102276650001102287650001102298650002202309650002602331650005202357650002202409650001202431651001102443651001002454651002002464700002402484700001502508773011802523856004402641852000902685655001202694IND60538131020221121193628.0160811e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053813102DNAL7 a10.4454/JPP.V97I3.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSelvarajan, R.10aFirst report of Bean yellow mosaic virus in Alpinia galanga in India  ap. 545.  aAlpinia galanga (family Zingiberaceae), commonly called greater galangal or blue ginger, is a rhizomatous herb distributed in various parts of India and throughout Southeast Asia. In a garden of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (New Delhi), 90% of the plants exhibited spindle-shaped yellow or light green streaks in the interveinal tissues and midribs. Based on symptoms and leaf dip preparations that revealed flexuous filamentous particle of ca. 750×12 nm, infection by the potyvirus Banana bract mosaic virus (BBrMV) was suspected. Antigen- coated plate (ACP)-ELISA with a general potyvirus antiserum (DSMZ, Germany) reacted positively, whereas there was no reaction with an antiserum to BBrMV raised at ICAR-National Research Centre for Banana (Tiruchirappalli). Total RNA extracted from symptomatic and healthy leaf tissues using a RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, USA) was tested by RT-PCR, using Chen et al. (2001) degenerate potyvirus-specific primers that amplify a ca.1.7 kb fragment from the 3' genome end (FP: 5' GGNAAYAAYAGYGGNCARCC 3; RP: 5' GTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC(T)15 3’). A product of 1.649 kb was amplified from symptomatic but not from healthy plants, which was cloned and sequenced (GenBank accession No. KM198742), revealing 87-94% and 91-94% identity at the nucleotide and amino acid level, respectively, with Bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) isolates from various crops. In ACP- ELISA using a polyclonal antiserum to BYMV (NBPGR, New Delhi), 10 infected leaf samples tested positive, whereas healthy sample were negative. Thus, the symptoms observed in A. galanga, which resemble those elicited by BBrMV in A. purpurata in Hawaii (Wang et al., 2010) are caused by BYMV. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of the natural occurrence of BYMV in A. galanga in India. 3aAlpinia galanga 3aAlpinia mosaic virus 3aBanana bract mosaic virus 3aBean yellow mosaic virus 3aRNA 3aamino acids 3aantiserum 3abananas 3acrops 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agardens 3agenome 3aginger 3aleaves 3amolecular cloning 3apolyclonal antibodies 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3atissues 3aHawaii 3aIndia 3aSouth East Asia1 aBalasubramanian, V.1 aMandal, B.0 tJournal of plant pathology.g2015 Nov., v. 97, no. 3 p.545-545dEdizioni ETSwJournal:jnl4181443x1125-46537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4454/JPP.V97I3.011  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245010600161300001200267520157600279650002501855650004201880650001601922650000901938650001501947650000901962650001201971650002001983650003302003650001702036650003002053651001102083651001502094651001102109651001102120651001702131773011802148856004402266852000902310655001202319IND60538131120221121193635.0160811e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053813112DNAL7 a10.4454/JPP.V97I3.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTziros, G. T.10aAlternaria alternata as the cause of bud rot on globe artichoke reported for the first time in Greece  ap. 546.  aA new disease of globe artichoke (Cynara scolymus), affecting ca. 50% of the edible portion, was observed during 2011 in Peloponnese (southern Greece). On flower buds, symptoms started as small concentric dark-brown sunken spots, later coalescing and covering the entire surface of the buds, which rotted completely. Single-spore cultures on potato dextrose agar (PDA) gave rise to white colonies which turned to grayish-black and produced verrucose, echinulate or smooth conidia in long chains. Conidia had 1 to 6 transverse and 0 to 2 longitudinal septa and measured 10.4-26.0x7.8-15.6 μm (average 18.1x10.1 μm). These morphological characteristics conform to those of Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissl. (Simmons, 2007). The ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region was amplified with primers ITS1 and ITS4 and sequenced (GenBank Accession No. KT071541). BLAST search revealed 100% homology with sequences of various A. alternata isolates (e.g., LN835252). Twenty healthy detached artichoke buds were sprayed with a spore suspension (106 spores/ml), covered with a polyethylene bag for 48 h and incubated in a growth chamber at 25oC. Ten days post inoculation, spots similar to those observed in the field developed on all inoculated buds, while control buds sprayed with sterile water remained symptomless. A. alternata was consistently reisolated from inoculated buds. Alternaria sp. has been reported on globe artichoke in Brazil, California, Mexico and South Africa (Farr and Rossman, 2015). This is the first report of A. alternata as the cause of bud rot on C. scolymus in Greece. 3aAlternaria alternata 3aCynara cardunculus subsp. cardunculus 3aDNA primers 3aagar 3aartichokes 3abuds 3aconidia 3agrowth chambers 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3apolyethylene 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aBrazil 3aCalifornia 3aGreece 3aMexico 3aSouth Africa0 tJournal of plant pathology.g2015 Nov., v. 97, no. 3 p.546-546dEdizioni ETSwJournal:jnl4181443x1125-46537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4454/JPP.V97I3.012  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245008600133300001600219500001500235520124800250650004301498650001201541650004501553650002901598650002201627650001701649650000801666650001401674650001601688650001201704650002901716650001001745650001101755650003201766650001801798651001201816653002401828653002401852700001701876700001701893700002201910700002001932700001601952773021101968856005702179852000902236655001202245IND60538133520161121000000.0160811e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053813352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRebelo, Ana Rita10aEquid herpesvirus 9 (EHV-9) isolates from zebras in Ontario, Canada, 1989 to 2007  ap. 155-159.  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of this study was to identify and partially characterize 3 equid herpesviruses that were isolated postmortem from zebras in Ontario, Canada in 1989, 2002, and 2007. These 3 virus isolates were characterized by plaque morphology, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of their genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, and sequence analyses of the full length of the glycoprotein G (gG) gene (ORF70) and a portion of the DNA polymerase gene (ORF30). The isolates were also compared to 3 reference strains of equid herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1). Using rabbit kidney cells, the plaques for the isolates from the zebras were found to be much larger in size than the EHV-1 reference strains. The RFLP patterns of the zebra viruses differed among each other and from those of the EHV-1 reference strains. Real-time PCR and sequence analysis of a portion of the DNA polymerase gene determined that the herpesvirus isolates from the zebras contained a G at nucleotide 2254 and a corresponding N at amino acid position 752, which suggested that they could be neuropathogenic EHV-1 strains. However, subsequent phylogenetic analysis of the gG gene suggested that they were EHV-9 and not EHV-1. 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arabbits 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aEquid alphaherpesvirus 1 3asequence analysis 3akidney cells 3aDNA 3aphylogeny 3aamino acids 3aviruses 3aEquid alphaherpesvirus 9 3agenes 3azebras 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aglycoproteins 3aOntario 0aEquid herpesvirus 1 0aEquid herpesvirus 91 aCarman, Susy1 aShapiro, Jan1 aVan Dreumel, Tony1 aHazlett, Murray1 aNagy, Éva,0 tCanadian journal of veterinary research.g2015 Apr., v. 79, no. 2 p.155-159dCanadian Veterinary Medical Association = Association canadienne                des vétérinaireswJournal:2054x0830-90007nnas40uhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4365709/  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002400112245011800136300001600254520174200270650002002012650001402032650001502046650001502061650001602076650000902092650002302101650001202124650001402136650000902150650001202159700002002171700002402191700002402215773021102239856005702450852000902507655001202516IND60538134320161121000000.0160812e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053813432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHermeto, Larissa C.10aPotentiation of epidural lidocaine by co-administering tramadol by either intramuscular or epidural route in cats  ap. 214-220.  aThis study investigated the analgesic and systemic effects of intramuscular (IM) versus epidural (EP) administration of tramadol as an adjunct to EP injection of lidocaine in cats. Six healthy, domestic, shorthair female cats underwent general anesthesia. A prospective, randomized, crossover trial was then conducted with each cat receiving the following 3 treatments: EP injection of 2% lidocaine [LEP; 3.0 mg/kg body weight (BW)]; EP injection of a combination of lidocaine and 5% tramadol (LTEP; 3.0 and 2.0 mg/kg BW, respectively); or EP injection of lidocaine and IM injection of tramadol (LEPTIM; 3.0 and 2.0 mg/kg BW, respectively). Systemic effects, spread and duration of analgesia, behavior, and motor blockade were determined before treatment and at predetermined intervals afterwards. The duration of analgesia was 120 ± 31 min for LTEP, 71 ± 17 min for LEPTIM, and 53 ± 6 min for LEP (P < 0.05; mean ± SD). The cranial spread of analgesia obtained with LTEP was similar to that with LEP or LEPTIM, extending to dermatomic region T13–L1. Complete motor blockade was similar for the 3 treatments. It was concluded that tramadol produces similar side effects in cats after either EP or IM administration. Our findings indicate that EP and IM tramadol (2 mg/kg BW) with EP lidocaine produce satisfactory analgesia in cats. As an adjunct to lidocaine, EP tramadol provides a longer duration of analgesia than IM administration. The adverse effects produced by EP and IM administration of tramadol were not different. Further studies are needed to determine whether EP administration of tramadol could play a role in managing postoperative pain in cats when co-administered with lidocaine after painful surgical procedures. 3aadverse effects 3aanalgesia 3aanalgesics 3aanesthesia 3abody weight 3acats 3across-over studies 3afemales 3alidocaine 3apain 3asurgery1 aDeRossi, Rafael1 aMarques, Beatriz C.1 aJardim, Paulo H.

A novel type I PRRSV vaccinal strain (94881) was evaluated for safety and efficacy/onset of immunity (OOI) in piglets. In 2 experiments, groups of piglets were vaccinated intramuscularly (IM) at approximately 14 d of age with a maximum-range commercial dose, an overdose, or a placebo in experiment 1 and either a minimum-range commercial dose or a placebo in experiment 2. The piglets in experiment 1 were evaluated for local and systemic reactions from days -2 through 14 after vaccination. The piglets in experiment 2 were challenged with a virulent heterologous type I PRRSV isolate 14 d after vaccination and observed once daily for general health from days -1 through 12 after vaccination and once daily for clinical signs associated with challenge from days 13 through 24 after vaccination. The average daily weight gain (ADWG) and the results of serologic and viremia testing were evaluated in experiments 1 and 2. Lung lesion scores and results of testing for PRRSV in lung tissue were evaluated in experiment 2. In experiment 1 the vaccine was shown to be safe, as there were no relevant differences between the vaccinated piglets and the piglets given a placebo. In experiment 2 the vaccine's efficacy, with an OOI of 14 d after vaccination, was established, as the vaccinated and challenged piglets exhibited significantly lower lung lesion scores, viremia, viral load in lung tissue, and total clinical sign scores, along with a significantly greater ADWG, compared with the placebo-vaccinated and challenged piglets. 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aimmunity 3alungs 3aoverdose 3apiglets 3aplacebos 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aviral load 3aviremia 3avirulence 3aweight gain1 aKroll, Jeremy1 aKraft, Christian1 aColl, Teresa0 tCanadian journal of veterinary research.g2016 Apr., v. 80, no. 2 p.124-133dCanadian Veterinary Medical Association = Association canadienne                des vétérinaireswJournal:2054x0830-90007nnas40uhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27127339  aDNAL 7aarticle01872naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245005400168300001600222520096300238650003001201650001101231650001301242650001301255650001701268700001901285773012801304852000901432856008501441939003301526946001101559655001201570IND4457189520221121161323.0110423e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445718952DNAL7 a10.1007/s00359-010-0586-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNecknig, Veronika 10aBetween-species jamming avoidance in Pipistrelles  ap. 469-473.  aPast studies have reported that bats modify the spectral-temporal features of their vocalizations to avoid interference from the vocalizations of conspecifics (jamming avoidance). We tested for within, and between-species jamming avoidance in two sympatrically occurring species of vespertilionid bats, Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Pipistrellus nathusii. In both species the peak frequencies of the narrowband frequency component from samples of bats flying with conspecifics varied more than those from samples of bats flying alone, indicating intraspecific jamming avoidance. If individuals of the two species were recorded together, we found no reaction of P. nathusii. P. pipistrellus, however, used significantly higher frequencies than when recorded alone. As the narrowband frequency of this species normally overlaps with the frequency modulated (FM) part of P. nathusii calls, this can be interpreted as an interspecific jamming avoidance response. 3aPipistrellus pipistrellus 3aflight 3asampling 3asympatry 3avocalization1 aZahn, Andreas 0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2011 May, v. 197, no. 5 p.469-473dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-010-0586-53Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110424  aNon-US 7aarticle02730naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245010300167300001600270520161500286650002101901650001401922650001101936650001301947650001301960650001201973650001201985650000901997650001702006700002402023700002502047700001802072773012802090852000902218856008502227939003302312946001102345655001202356IND4457189420221121161409.0110423e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445718942DNAL7 a10.1007/s00359-010-0614-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonroy, Jenna A. 10aDevelopment of echolocation and communication vocalizations in the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus  ap. 459-467.  aBig brown bats form large maternity colonies of up to 200 mothers and their pups. If pups are separated from their mothers, they can locate each other using vocalizations. The goal of this study was to systematically characterize the development of echolocation and communication calls from birth through adulthood to determine whether they develop from a common precursor at the same or different rates, or whether both types are present initially. Three females and their six pups were isolated from our captive breeding colony. We recorded vocal activity from postnatal day 1 to 35, both when the pups were isolated and when they were reunited with their mothers. At birth, pups exclusively emitted isolation calls, with a fundamental frequency range <20 kHz, and duration >30 ms. By the middle of week 1, different types of vocalizations began to emerge. Starting in week 2, pups in the presence of their mothers emitted sounds that resembled adult communication vocalizations, with a lower frequency range and longer durations than isolation calls or echolocation signals. During weeks 2 and 3, these vocalizations were extremely heterogeneous, suggesting that the pups went through a babbling stage before establishing a repertoire of stereotyped adult vocalizations around week 4. By week 4, vocalizations emitted when pups were alone were identical to adult echolocation signals. Echolocation and communication signals both appear to develop from the isolation call, diverging during week 2 and continuing to develop at different rates for several weeks until the adult vocal repertoire is established. 3aEptesicus fuscus 3aadulthood 3aadults 3abreeding 3aduration 3afemales 3amothers 3apups 3avocalization1 aCarter, Matthew E. 1 aMiller, Kimberly E. 1 aCovey, Ellen 0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2011 May, v. 197, no. 5 p.459-467dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-010-0614-53Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110424  aNon-US 7aarticle02157naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245010600158300001600264500001500280520100500295650001301300650001001313650002901323650003001352650003901382650001601421650001201437650002701449650000901476653002601485700001401511700001501525700001701540700001801557700001301575773011801588856004401706852000901750655001201759IND60538124320221121161336.0160809e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053812432DNAL7 a10.4454/JPP.V97I2.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAureli, G.10aDurum wheat infected by Stagonospora nodorum: survey on electrophoretic protein pattern modifications  ap. 315-319.  a2019-12-06  aStagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB) is a fungal disease of wheat caused by Stagonospora nodorum. The fungus attacks epigeous parts of the plant causing direct damage to kernel with heavy yield losses. This study aimed at evaluating the effect of S. nodorum infection on the electrophoretic protein pattern of durum wheat kernels. The protein pattern of kernels harvested from plants artificially infected in the field and of kernels inoculated in vitro, was defined by SDS- PAGE. Starting from this experimental set, two sub-samples were analysed, the first without further manipulation, the second after an incubation at different time intervals on water agar plates. The results did not disclose any change in the protein pattern of the first sub-sample of kernels whereas a profound alteration of their protein profile occurred after incubation. This result would suggest that albeit the pathogen has the ability to degrade host proteins is unable to express the same ability during field infection. 3aproteins 3aseeds 3aParastagonospora nodorum 3afungal diseases of plants 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3adurum wheat 3asurveys 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aagar 0aLeptosphaeria nodorum1 aScala, V.1 aNiglio, A.1 aL'Aurora, A.1 aFabbri, A.

The main agents of the disease are Podosphaera xanthii and Golovinomyces orontii. To determine the occurrence of chasmothecia as overwintering forms of both fungal species in northern Italy, powdery mildew-infected samples from cultivated cucurbits were collected in different locations of the provinces of Bologna and Mantova during 2010, 2011 and 2012. Only the sexual stage of P. xanthii was found, indicating that in northern Italy, contrary to what reported from other areas of the Mediterranean basin, the pathogen overwinters as chasmothecia. In parallel, to determine the frequency and distribution of both MAT 1-1-1 and MAT 1-2-1 P. xanthii idiomorphs, a multiplex- PCR with MAT idiomorph-specific primers was carried out on 147 monoconidial isolates obtained from infected leaf samples. The obtained frequencies were tested for random mating. Results showed a MAT ratio that tended to 1:1, supporting the finding of the sexual stage thus suggesting the occurrence of actively mating populations and that sexual reproduction plays a significant role in the life cycle of P. xanthii in this area. The lack of G. orontii chasmothecia suggests that this species might have alternative overwintering strategies. 3aCucurbitaceae 3aGolovinomyces orontii 3aPodosphaera 3abasins 3afungi 3aleaves 3aoverwintering 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apowdery mildew 3arandom mating 3asexual reproduction 3aItaly 3aMediterranean region1 aPerez-Garcia, A.1 aPortillo, I.1 aBattistini, G.1 aTuran, C.1 aBrunelli, A.1 aCollina, M.0 tJournal of plant pathology.g2015 July, v. 97, no. 2 p.307-313dEdizioni ETSwJournal:jnl4181443x1125-46537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4454/JPP.V97I2.018  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001400143245009800157300001200255520157000267650002901837650002501866650000801891650002401899650002801923650003501951650001401986650001802000650001602018650003802034650001002072650001002082650001102092650002602103650001802129650005202147650001202199651001002211651001102221700001802232700001602250700001402266700001302280700002002293700001802313700001502331700002202346700001802368700001502386773011802401856004402519852000902563655001202572IND60538127320221121161324.0160810e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053812732DNAL7 a10.4454/JPP.V97I2.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRizzo, D.10aFirst report of Zantedeschia mild mosaic virus on Zantedeschia Aethiopica (l) Spreng in Italy  ap. 399.  aCalla lily [Zantedeschia aethiopica (L.) Spreng] has become one of the most popular cut flowers worldwide. It has been reported as the natural host of various plant viruses, including potyviruses such as Bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV), Dasheen mosaic virus (DsMV), Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) and Zantedeschia mosaic virus (ZaMV). In 2005 a new potyvirus named Zantedeschia mild mosaic virus (ZaMMV) was identified in Taiwan (Huang and Chang, 2005). In 2012, 15 plants of Calla lily cultivated in Tuscan farms showed leaves with yellow spots and stripes, green islands and an unusual mild mosaic. Seventeen samples (15 symptomatic and two symptomless) were collected and assayed by ELISA for BYMV, DsMV, TuMV, ZaMV and potyviruses using antisera produced by DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany) and LOEWE Biochemica (Sauerlach, Germany). Plants were positive for an anti-potyvirus group monoclonal antibody. Positive samples were assayed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for ZaMMV using total RNA extracted from leaves and specific primers for the coat protein gene (Wen-Chi et al., 2010). Amplicons of the expected size (792 bp) were obtained for 15 samples that reacted positively to the potyvirus antibodies, while no amplification was observed in symptomless samples. The sequence obtained from one ZaMMV amplicon (accession No. KF156666) had 99% nucleotide identity with the corresponding fragment of a reference ZaMMV isolate (GenBank accession no. AY626825.4). To our knowledge this is the first report of ZaMMV on Zantedeschia aethiopica in Italy. 3aBean yellow mosaic virus 3aDasheen mosaic virus 3aRNA 3aTurnip mosaic virus 3aZantedeschia aethiopica 3aZantedeschia mild mosaic virus 3aantiserum 3acoat proteins 3acut flowers 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afarms 3agenes 3aleaves 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aplant viruses 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aviruses 3aItaly 3aTaiwan1 aPanattoni, A.1 aStefani, L.1 aPaoli, M.1 aNesi, B.1 aLazzereschi, S.1 aVanarelli, S.1 aFarina, P.1 aDella Bartola, M.1 aMaterazzi, A.1 aLuvisi, A.0 tJournal of plant pathology.g2015 July, v. 97, no. 2 p.399-399dEdizioni ETSwJournal:jnl4181443x1125-46537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4454/JPP.V97I2.019  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245008700161300001200248520132200260650001501582650000801597650002201605650000901627650001201636650001001648650001201658650001401670650001101684650001301695650001301708650001801721650001701739650003001756650002201786650001101808650001301819650001001832650001101842651001001853700001701863700001601880700002201896700001901918773011801937856004402055852000902099655001202108IND60538127420221121161357.0160810e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053812742DNAL7 a10.4454/JPP.V97I2.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaribaldi, A.10aFirst report of a leaf spot caused by Alternaria SP. on Rudbeckia Fulgida in Italy  ap. 400.  aIn summer 2014, symptoms of a previously unknown leaf spot were observed on about 100 plants of Rudbeckia fulgida (family Asteraceae) growing in a garden located near Biella (northern Italy). Extensive necrosis was observed on the leaves, starting from the basal ones, then on flowers and, as the time went on, on the stems. Eventually leaves and stems wilted and the plant, in full blooming, died. A fungus with a soft, greenish mycelium was consistently isolated on potato dextrose agar (PDA). DNA was extracted using the Nucleospin Plant kit (Macherey Nagel, Germany) and PCR was carried out using ITS1/ITS4 primers. A 473 bp PCR product was sequenced (GenBank accession No. KP941053) and a BLASTn search (Altschul et al., 1997) assigned the sequence to Alternaria sp. In pathogenicity tests, leaves of three healthy plants of R. fulgida were inoculated by spraying a spore and mycelium suspension, 1×105 CFU/ml, of the fungus grown on PDA. Plants treated only with sterile water served as control. Plants were covered with plastic bags for 5 days and maintained at 20 -25°C. About five days post inoculation, the first lesions developed only on inoculated leaves from which an Alternaria sp. was consistently reisolated. This is the first report of Alternaria sp. on R. fulgida in Italy as well as in the world. 3aAlternaria 3aDNA 3aRudbeckia fulgida 3aagar 3aflowers 3afungi 3agardens 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3amycelium 3anecrosis 3apathogenicity 3aplastic bags 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3aspores 3aspraying 3astems 3asummer 3aItaly1 aBertetti, D.1 aGilardi, G.1 aFranco Ortega, S.1 aGullino, M.

Coratina were found, exhibiting cankers on twigs and branch dieback. Phomopsis spp. were isolated (15-65%) from symptomatic twigs. Genomic DNA was extracted from 43 fungal isolates. The ITS gene region was amplified with primers ITS1/ITS4 (White etal., 1990) and sequenced. Blast analysis of ITS sequences of 38 isolates showed 100% similarity with Diaporthe neotheicola A.J.L. Phillips et J.M. Santos (GenBank accession No. EU814480) whereas five isolates had 100% similarity with D. ambigua Nitschke (EU814478). ITS sequences of D. ambigua and D. neotheicola isolates from olive were deposited in GenBank under the accession Nos. HM575419, HM575420 and HM575421, HM575422, respectively. Microscopic features of D. neotheicola from Apulian olive trees and matched those described by Phillips and Santos (2009) while features of D. ambigua were identical with those previously described for this species. Pathogenicity tests were conducted in May 2012 and 2013 using two isolates/species on 1-year-old twigs of cv. Coratina by inoculating them with each isolate or with sterile agar (controls). Symptoms were observed after 90 days and Diaporthe species were re-isolated thus, fulfilling Koch’s postulates. Control plants were symptomless. The two species of Phomopsis from olive could be a potential inoculum source for grapevines. Indeed, Mostert etal. (2001) reported D. ambigua and Phomopsis sp. 1, the latter referred to as D. neotheicola, from Vitis vinifera. To our knowledge, this is the first report of D. neotheicola and D. ambigua on olive. 3aDNA 3aDNA primers 3aDiaporthe 3aVitis vinifera 3aagar 3abranches 3adieback 3afungi 3agenes 3agenetic databases 3agroves 3ainoculum 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aolives 3apathogenicity 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asurveys 3atrees 3aItaly1 aElshafie, H.
