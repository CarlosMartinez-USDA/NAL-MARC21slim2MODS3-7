The largest event occurred in the 2nd–3rd century CE. It generated clearly visible erosive effects in the coastal barriers, including washover fans and erosional scarps. In the inner estuary, however, the effects were minor: crevasse splays that broke levees and cheniers, as well as a residual sedimentary lag. The significant development of the spits protected the inner estuary from the marine incursion, which only caused a water level rise with low-regime waves. Correlation of the geomorphological and sedimentary marks left by this event with the archaeological and geological evidence of other events recognized elsewhere in the Gulf of Cadiz effectively argues for a tsunami as to the nature of the 2nd–3rd century CE event. Yet this and the other identified EWEs in the Guadalquivir estuary during the pre-Roman and the Roman period all fit a model of paleogeographic evolution dominated by processes of coastal progradation and estuarine infilling. Radiocarbon dating, geomorphological analysis, and historical references fail to warrant the so-called ‘218–209BCE’ Atlantic tsunami, as hypothesized in the received scientific literature. In pre-Roman and Roman times, human occupation at the mouth of the Guadalquivir River was strongly influenced by various geodynamic processes, the location of the settlements being contingent upon dependable, fast communication with the sea and, above all, upon adequate protection from EWEs, on the leeward side of spits. Progressive progradation of these coastal barriers combined with the gradual infilling of the estuary to make navigation to open sea increasingly difficult and, eventually, to result in the abandonment of settlements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aestuaries 3aewes 3ageomorphology 3ahumans 3amodels 3aradiocarbon dating 3arivers 3atsunamis 3aIberian Peninsula 3aSpain 0aExtreme wave events (EWEs) 0aCoastal geomorphology 0aRoman period 0aSouthwest Spain1 aVillarías-Robles, Juan J.R.1 aPérez-Asensio, José N.1 aSantos, Ana1 aMorales, Juan Antonio1 aCelestino Pérez, Sebastián,1 aLeón Conde, Angel,1 aSantos-Arévalo, Francisco Javier0 tGeomorphology.g2016 May 15, v. 261 p.103-118dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2016.02.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013300168300001600301520081800317592002801135650002401163650002101187650000901208650002001217650002801237650001401265650001701279650003001296650002501326650002301351650001901374650001301393700001701406700001901423700002001442700001701462700001801479700002101497700002001518700001901538700001701557773009801574856008101672852000901753655001201762IND50090664320221120225058.0140812e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009066432DNAL7 a10.1007/s12275-014-3679-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Hyung-Lyun13aAn easy way for the rapid purification of recombinant proteins from Helicobacter pylori using a newly designed expression vector  ap. 604-608.  aWe constructed a H. pylori expression vector which consisted of both a His-tag and a GST tag as purification tools for recombinant protein and a chloramphenicol resistant cat gene as a reporter.

Observations were made onboard hake (January 2007) and shrimp vessels (November 2008). The Kelp Gull and Black-browed Albatross were the most frequent and abundant seabirds at both fisheries, while Argentine Hake (Merluccius hubbsi) dominated the composition of discards. Kelp Gulls and Black-browed Albatrosses consumed 91% of experimentally discarded hake (n = 1236). Mean sizes of prey consumed by gulls were 22.4 and 23.7 cm in the hake and shrimp fisheries, respectively, while those of prey consumed by albatrosses were 28.5 and 31.3 cm, respectively. In both fisheries, gulls selected the smaller prey available (<25 and < 30 cm in hake and shrimp fisheries, respectively) while Black-browed Albatrosses selected the larger prey available (>25 and >30 cm in hake and shrimp fisheries, respectively). Intraspecific and interspecific kleptoparasitism were significantly more frequent than expected in Kelp Gulls and Black-browed Albatrosses, respectively. Robbing efficiency was clearly higher in albatrosses than gulls. In both species, sizes of prey consumed by direct capture were significantly smaller than those stolen, and the rate of kleptoparasitism increased with prey size. Gulls stole significantly smaller prey than albatrosses. Prey selection by Kelp Gulls is affected by the interaction with Black-browed Albatrosses, and the degree at which discards are used by both species appears to depend on the fishery considered, the food on offer and the selection of prey sizes according to seabird species-specific preferences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarus 3aMerluccius 3afishing boats 3aforaging 3ahake 3akleptoparasitism 3amacroalgae 3arobbing 3aseabirds 3ashrimp 3ashrimp fisheries 3aArgentina1 aYorio, Pablo0 tJournal of ornithology.g2011 Oct., v. 152, no. 4 p.827-838dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001150x2193-71927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-011-0657-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01788naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245007300163300001600236520069900252592002800951650001800979650001900997650001001016650003301026650001701059650001801076650001301094650001201107653000901119653001401128700001501142700002001157700001901177773012501196856008401321852000901405655001201414IND60689870720221122135855.0200424e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068987072DNAL7 a10.3109/1040841X.2011.5807232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Lina14aThe virology and developments toward control of human enterovirus 71  ap. 313-327.  aEnterovirus 71 (EV71), a member of the Enterovirus genus in the Picornaviridae family, was first recognized as a dermotrophic virus that usually cause mild, self-limiting hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD).

The data were obtained weekly, on a micro-tidal wave-dominated intermediate beach, along a survey line extending from the backshore to a water depth of approximately 5m. REOF analysis using the first eight empirical orthogonal functions led to the study area being divided into five unique zones based on beach profile change patterns, namely the backshore, the foreshore, the inner and outer transition zones and the bar-trough zone. Although these zones were notably distinct from one another, the profiles in foreshore and the shoreward part of the inner transition zone changed in the same way over periods of 6 and 12months.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3adata collection 3asurveys 3aJapan 0aForeshore 0aBackshore 0aLongshore bar 0aTransition zone1 aYanagishima, Shinichi0 tGeomorphology.g2016 May 15, v. 261 p.236-243dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2016.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01921naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245006600166300001600232520074300248592002800991650002601019650001001045650001201055650001401067650001301081650000901094653002401103653001401127653002101141653001601162653001201178700002201190700002201212700001801234700001901252700002201271773012501293856008401418852000901502655001201511IND60689870820221122135836.0200424e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068987082DNAL7 a10.3109/1040841X.2011.5812232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsu, Joe L.10aDiagnosing invasive fungal disease in critically ill patients  ap. 277-312.  aFungal infections are increasing, with a changing landscape of pathogens and emergence of new groups at risk for invasive disease.

Microbiological cultures, the current “gold standard”, demonstrate poor sensitivity, thus diagnosis of invasive disease in the critically ill is difficult. This diagnostic dilemma results in under- or over-treatment of patients, potentially contributing to poor outcomes and antifungal resistance. While other current diagnostic tests perform moderately well, many lack timeliness, efficacy, and are negatively affected by treatments common to critically ill patients.

It is found that the increase of the buffer concentration enhanced the thermal stability of protein BSA, and the stabilization tendency follows the order of TAPSO>TES≈TAPS. In this study, we have also investigated the interactions of BSA with TES, TAPS, and TAPSO by using various techniques, such as UV–vis absorption, fluorescence, and molecular docking. It is revealed that the main interactions between the studied buffers and the peptide moieties of proteins are electrostatic including hydrogen bonds. The results obtained from this series of studies confirmed that the biological buffers, TES, TAPS, and TAPSO can serve as good stabilizers for the globular protein BSA, in the aqueous solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3abovine serum albumin 3abuffers 3afluorescence 3ahydrogen bonding 3alight scattering 3amolecular models 3astabilizers 3atemperature 3athermal stability 0aProtein stability 0aMolecular Docking 0aBuffers 0aBSA 0aSpectroscopy1 aTaha, Mohamed1 aLee, Ming-Jer0 tProcess Biochemistry.g2013 Nov., v. 48 p.1686-1696dElsevier Ltdx1359-51137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2013.08.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01410naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245015100174300001600325520051700341592002800858650001500886650001100901650001700912700001600929700001600945773007800961856008401039852000901123655001201132IND60096434620221120071719.0141104e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009643462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2012.07.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrinivasa Reddy, A.10aDiscussion of “A new honey bee mating optimization algorithm for non-smooth economic dispatch” Taher Niknam et al.

For this, pre-ripening protocols are being applied, which do not always result in sufficiently juicy fruits. Therefore, the aim of this study is the development of objective instrumental procedures for quantification of the juiciness attributes of these fruits. In this work, we evaluated the juiciness of more than 2000 fruits belonging to 20 of the varieties of greatest interest in the southeast of Spain. An instrumental mechanical procedure based on the confined compression of a pulp specimen of known volume was designed and optimized. Instrumental juiciness was defined as the wet area (cm²) on an absorbent paper located under the compression probe. This test allowed for the defining of objective thresholds for the identification of juicy fruits; 90% of the fruits with areas higher than 5.4 cm² were considered to be juicy. Complementarily, non-invasive supervision by near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, based on pulp structural changes during ripening, allowed for estimation of the instrumental juiciness with coefficients of correlation above 0.83. The results of these instrumental procedures contribute to supporting decision tools in the logistics chain of stone fruits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus persica 3aabsorbents 3acultivars 3afruit pulp 3afruits 3ajuiciness 3amarkets 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3anectarines 3apaper 3apeaches 3aready-to-eat foods 3aripening 3aSpain1 aCorrea, Eva  Cristina1 aDiezma, Belén 0 tAgronomy.g2020 Jan. 21, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy100201523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03137naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245016200162300001600324520126400340592002801604650005901632650002501691650002501716650002001741650001401761650002401775650001601799650002001815650001501835650002001850650001501870650001001885650001201895650001101907650002001918650001201938650002501950650001001975653001601985653001002001653002402011653001002035653000802045653000802053653000902061653000802070653000902078653000802087653000802095653000802103653000902111653000802120700001802128700001602146700001402162700001602176700005502192700001702247773010802264856008202372852000902454655001202463IND60589715220221118232951.0190405e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058971522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2017.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Lulu10aAnalysis of the natural dehydration mechanism during middle and late stages of wheat seeds development by some physiological traits and iTRAQ-based proteomic  ap. 102-110.  aJimai 22 wheat seeds collected at eight developmental stages [20–38 days after anthesis (daa)] were used to characterize the natural dehydration of wheat seeds. An iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics technique was applied to identify differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) and evaluate several physiological traits at 20, 26, 32 and 38 daa. Superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activities as well as soluble sugar and soluble protein contents increased during dehydration, while the malondialdehyde content decreased. These results suggested that the antioxidant capacity of seeds increased during the dehydration process. A total of 128 proteins exhibited at least a 1.5-fold difference in abundance relative to the control levels in naturally dehydrating seeds. Forty of the DAPs were related to defense/stress responses. We observed an increase in the abundance of five late embryogenesis abundant proteins, five serpins, a heat shock cognate 70-kDa protein, and the 17.7-kDa Class I heat shock protein, with peak levels detected at 38 daa. Additionally, starch and sucrose metabolic activities were also associated with the natural dehydration of wheat seeds, with trehalose-6-phosphate synthase 7 increasing in abundance during the dehydration process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha,alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase (UDP-forming) 3aantioxidant activity 3abiochemical pathways 3aenzyme activity 3aflowering 3aheat shock proteins 3aheat stress 3amalondialdehyde 3aperoxidase 3aprotein content 3aproteomics 3aseeds 3aserpins 3astarch 3astress response 3asucrose 3asuperoxide dismutase 3awheat 0aDevelopment 0aiTRAQ 0aNatural dehydration 0aWheat 0aCAT 0adaa 0aDAPs 0aFDR 0aKEGG 0aLEA 0aMDA 0aPOD 0aRPLC 0aSOD1 aWang, Zhenlin1 aLi, Meiling1 aMa, Xueli1 aTian, Enyun1 aSun, Aiqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1309-669X1 aYin, Yanping0 tJournal of cereal science.g2018 Mar., v. 80 p.102-110dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2017.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01604naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013800158300002000296520065300316592002800969650004400997650003401041700001401075700001501089700001501104773012401119856007401243852000901317655001201326IND60640515020221119131430.0190504e20160329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064051502DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra04053e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Min-Yan10aControlled fabrication, characterization and comparison of porous poly(l-lactide) and poly(d-lactide) films by electric breath figure  ap. 31417-31421.  aPorous poly(l-lactide), PLLA, and poly(d-lactide), PDLA, films were fabricated by the electric breath figure (EBF) method.

Insect resistant transgenic sugarcane producing Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) was developed to improve control of E. loftini. The present laboratory study addressed whether transgenic sugarcane adversely affects parasitism of E. loftini by P. pyralophagus. Females of P. pyralophagus preferentially probed, drilled, and parasitized E. loftini larvae fed artificial diet based on conventional sugarcane versus larvae fed diet based on transgenic sugarcane. Activity levels of E. loftini were reduced when fed diet based on transgenic sugarcane, but no differences were evident in frass volatile profiles. Overall, the results suggested a positive association between larval activity level and likelihood of parasitism, which may render E. loftini larvae feeding on transgenic sugarcane less susceptible to parasitism by P. pyralophagus. However, it was concluded that this may not significantly affect control of E. loftini because (1) while E. loftini larvae that are most susceptible to transgenic sugarcane may be less prone to parasitism by P. pyralophagus, they are less likely to cause severe crop damage and reproduce successfully; and (2) those E. loftini larvae least susceptible to transgenic sugarcane, and therefore more active and damaging to plants, may be more prone to parasitism by P. pyralophagus.  aPublisher supplied data 0atransgenic crops 0anontarget effects 0ahost location 0ahost selection 0ahost acceptance1 aBernal, Julio S.1 aVinson, S.

In urban areas, where runoff generation is fast due to high imperviousness degree, it is especially relevant to capture the high spatiotemporal rainfall variability. Significant progress has been made in the development of spatially distributed rainfall measurements and of distributed hydrological models, to represent the variability of catchment's characteristics. Interactions between rainfall and basin scales on hydrological response sensitivity, however, needs deeper investigation. A previous study investigated the hydrological response in the small urbanized catchment of Cranbrook (8 km², London, UK) and proposed three dimensionless “scale factors” to identify if the available rainfall resolution is sufficient to properly predict hydrological response. We aim to verify the applicability of these scale factors to larger scales, with a distinct physiographic setting, in Little Sugar Creek (111 km², Charlotte, USA), to identify the required rainfall resolution and to predict model performance. Twenty‐eight events were selected from a weather radar data set from the National Weather Radar Network, with a resolution of 1 km² and 15 min. Rainfall data were aggregated to coarser resolutions and used as input for a distributed hydrological model. Results show that scale factors and associated thresholds are generally applicable for characterization of urban flood response to rainfall across spatiotemporal scales. Additionally, application of scale factors in observation‐based analysis supports identification of event characteristics that are poorly captured and critical improvements that need to be made before the model can benefit from high‐resolution rainfall.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3adata collection 3ahydrologic models 3ameteorological data 3amodel validation 3aradar 3arain 3aresearch 3arunoff 3atemporal variation 3aurbanization 3awatersheds1 aten Veldhuis, Marie‐claire1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9572-21931 aWright, Daniel B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9050-42661 aSmith, James A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4588-94351 aGiesen, Nick van de,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7200-33530 tWater resources research.g2019 Apr., v. 55, no. 4 p.3375-3390dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018WR0241433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001400189245009000203300002200293506007600315520113400391592002801525506003701553650001501590650001701605650001601622650001201638650001201650650001101662650001601673650001801689650002301707650002001730650001301750650002401763650001701787650002001804653000901824653000901833653000801842653001001850653001601860653001701876653001801893653002801911653002801939653002201967700001901989700001702008700001902025700002302044700002202067700001602089700001702105700001302122700002402135700001802159700001602177700001702193700002302210700002202233700002402255700001602279700002602295700002202321700001702343773010202360856008202462852000902544655001202553IND60609898920221207115249.0180824e20171214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060989892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.0372doi7 aPMC59206922pmcid7 a291538362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Gina10aPost-transcriptional Regulation of De Novo Lipogenesis by mTORC1-S6K1-SRPK2 Signaling  ap. 1545-1558.e18.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  amTORC1 is a signal integrator and master regulator of cellular anabolic processes linked to cell growth and survival. Here, we demonstrate that mTORC1 promotes lipid biogenesis via SRPK2, a key regulator of RNA-binding SR proteins. mTORC1-activated S6K1 phosphorylates SRPK2 at Ser494, which primes Ser497 phosphorylation by CK1. These phosphorylation events promote SRPK2 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of SR proteins. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis reveals that lipid biosynthetic enzymes are among the downstream targets of mTORC1-SRPK2 signaling. Mechanistically, SRPK2 promotes SR protein binding to U1-70K to induce splicing of lipogenic pre-mRNAs. Inhibition of this signaling pathway leads to intron retention of lipogenic genes, which triggers nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SRPK2 blunts de novo lipid synthesis, thereby suppressing cell growth. These results thus reveal a novel role of mTORC1-SRPK2 signaling in post-transcriptional regulation of lipid metabolism and demonstrate that SRPK2 is a potential therapeutic target for mTORC1-driven metabolic disorders.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiogenesis 3abiosynthesis 3acell growth 3aenzymes 3aintrons 3alipids 3alipogenesis 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolic diseases 3aphosphorylation 3aproteins 3asignal transduction 3atherapeutics 3atranscriptomics 0amTOR 0aS6K1 0aCK1 0aSRPK2 0aSR proteins 0aRNA splicing 0aRNA stability 0anonsense-mediated decay 0ade novo lipid synthesis 0acancer metabolism1 aZheng, Yuxiang1 aCho, Sungyun1 aJang, Cholsoon1 aEngland, Christina1 aDempsey, Jamie M.1 aYu, Yonghao1 aLiu, Xiaolei1 aHe, Long1 aCavaliere, Paola M.1 aChavez, Andre1 aZhang, Erik1 aIsik, Meltem1 aCouvillon, Anthony1 aDephoure, Noah E.1 aBlackwell, T.

The efflux pumps of Gram-negative bacteria have a broad substrate range and transport antibiotics out of the bacterium, conferring intrinsic multidrug resistance (MDR). The genomes of pre- and posttherapy MDR clinical isolates of Salmonella Typhimurium from a patient that failed antibacterial therapy and died were sequenced. In the posttherapy isolate we identified a novel G288D substitution in AcrB, the resistance-nodulation division transporter in the AcrAB-TolC tripartite MDR efflux pump system. Computational structural analysis suggested that G288D in AcrB heavily affects the structure, dynamics, and hydration properties of the distal binding pocket altering specificity for antibacterial drugs. Consistent with this hypothesis, recreation of the mutation in standard Escherichia coli and Salmonella strains showed that G288D AcrB altered substrate specificity, conferring decreased susceptibility to the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin by increased efflux. At the same time, the substitution increased susceptibility to other drugs by decreased efflux. Information about drug transport is vital for the discovery of new antibacterials; the finding that one amino acid change can cause resistance to some drugs, while conferring increased susceptibility to others, could provide a basis for new drug development and treatment strategies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aamino acids 3aantibiotics 3aciprofloxacin 3adrugs 3agenes 3amodels 3amultiple drug resistance 3amutation 3apatients 3aphenotype 3asequence analysis 3asubstrate specificity 3atherapeutics 3atransporters 0aefflux 0aantimicrobial resistance 0aAcrB 0awhole genome sequencing1 aBavro, Vassiliy N.1 aRicci, Vito1 aModi, Niraj1 aCacciotto, Pierpaolo1 aKleinekathӧfer, Ulrich1 aRuggerone, Paolo1 aVargiu, Attilio V.1 aBaylay, Alison J.1 aSmith, Helen E.1 aBrandon, Yvonne1 aGalloway, David1 aPiddock, Laura J.

The study involved the investigation of webs made by four types of spiders: Pholcus phalangioides (Pholcidae), Eratigena atrica and Agelena labirynthica (Agelenidae) and Linyphia triangularis (Linyphiidae). These webs were obtained from outdoor and indoor study sites. Compared to the clean reference webs, an increase was observed in the values of magnetic susceptibility in the webs sampled from both indoor and outdoor sites, which indicates contamination by anthropogenically produced pollution particles that contain ferrimagnetic iron minerals. This pilot study has demonstrated that spider webs are able to capture particulate matter in a manner that is equivalent to flora-based bioindicators applied to date (such as mosses, lichens, leaves). They also have additional advantages; for example, they can be generated in isolated clean habitats, and exposure can be monitored in indoor and outdoor locations, at any height and for any period of time. Moreover, webs are ubiquitous in an anthropogenic, heavily polluted environment, and they can be exposed throughout the year. As spider webs accumulate pollutants to which humans are exposed, they become a reliable source of information about the quality of the environment. Therefore, spider webs are recommended for magnetic biomonitoring of airborne pollution and for the assessment of the environment because they are non-destructive, low-cost, sensitive and efficient.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgelenidae 3aLinyphiidae 3aPholcus 3aair pollution 3aenvironmental monitoring 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3airon 3aleaves 3alichens 3amagnetism 3aminerals 3amosses and liverworts 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3awebs 0aSpider webs 0aMagnetic susceptibility 0aBiomonitoring 0aAirborne particulate matter 0aIndoor air 0aOutdoor air1 aRybak, Justyna1 aRogula-Kozłowska, Wioletta0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2018 Mar., v. 234 p.543-551dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.11.0883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009600168300001600264520161100280592002801891653001201919653001301931653001901944653001401963653003301977700002202010773011702032856008402149852000902233655001202242IND60126814720221119023804.0151108e200308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012681472DNAL7 a10.1603/0046-225X-32.4.8812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeckman, Noelle10aPollen Feeding and Fitness in Praying Mantids: The Vegetarian Side of a Tritrophic Predator  ap. 881-885.  aAlthough the importance of omnivory in food webs has been established, the community niche of generalist arthropod predators such as praying mantids is usually assumed to be at most bitrophic, feeding on herbivores and other carnivores. As with most predators, mantids often are food limited in nature. Flowering plants in their environment offer mantids an opportunity to obtain high-protein pollen, a potential vegetarian alternative to their normal arthropod prey. Although some arthropod predators have been shown to feed occasionally on pollen, the extent to which they gain fitness from this behavior is unclear, and often assumed to be minor. In replicated laboratory tests, Chinese mantids, Tenodera aridifolia sinensis (Saussure), actively fed on pollen just after hatching, and on pollen-laden insects as adults. Pollen feeding enhanced fitness of these mantids by: 1) preventing starvation of nymphs at egg hatch in the absence of normal insect prey; 2) increasing body mass of nymphs fed pollen in addition to normal prey; and 3) allowing adults that were fed both pollen and insects to maintain the same fecundity on fewer insect prey than those fed insects alone. These predators are therefore tritrophic because the extent of their omnivory includes a fitness-enhancing plant product in addition to herbivore and carnivore prey. Pollen feeding may explain higher fecundity of females located on flowers, and also may enable these and other generalist predators to maintain high population densities when animal prey are scarce, which has potential consequences for the rest of the community.  aPublisher supplied data 0amantids 0aomnivory 0apollen feeding 0apredation 0aTenodera aridifolia sinensis1 aHurd, Lawrence E.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2003 Aug., v. 32, no. 4 p.881-885dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2F0046-225X-32.4.8813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008400170300001400254520148700268592002801755650002601783650002001809650001201829650001101841650001401852650001701866650001101883650001201894700001901906773008701925856004802012852000902060655001202069IND50069742320221118163754.0131017e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006974232DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-012-1387-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHershkovitz, Yaron10aResistance, resilience, and community dynamics in mediterranean-climate streams  ap. 59-75.  aStreams and rivers in mediterranean-climate regions (med-rivers) are subjected to sequential, yet contrasting hydrologic disturbances of drying and flooding. Although seasonally predictable, these disturbances can vary in intensity and duration within and among mediterranean-climate regions (med-regions). Consequently, med-rivers differ in the permanence of their aquatic habitats. To persist, species have acquired matched resistance and resilience adaptations. They gain resistance either by enduring the stress or avoiding it. Community recovery (or resilience) is achieved with cessation of hydrologic stress that permits maximization of re-colonization and reproduction. Endurance strategies are usually disturbance-specific, but avoidance enables organisms to cope with both drying and flooding, and is the prevalent resistance strategy. Correspondingly, community persistence depends to a large extent on the integrity of refuges, an aspect that has so far been little explored. Existing information suggests that seasonal community succession becomes more pronounced with increasing aridity and declining water permanence. The invertebrate community in semi-arid med-rivers can therefore undergo succession through three to four identifiable assemblages, whereas in perennial streams the difference between wet and dry period assemblages is smaller. Community turnover is influenced by the intensity of the hydrologic disturbances and varies between wet and drought years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3aaquatic habitat 3adrought 3adrying 3ahydrology 3areproduction 3arivers 3astreams1 aGasith, Avital0 tHydrobiologia.g2013 Nov., v. 719, no. 1 p.59-75dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1387-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010000174300001300274520139300287592002801680650002401708650002701732650002801759650001501787650001901802650000801821650001001829650001701839650001201856650001201868650001301880650001301893650001001906650001201916650000901928650001401937650002501951650002301976650001001999650001402009650000902023650001002032650001502042651001002057653002002067653002102087653001802108700002502126700002002151700002102171773012202192856008402314852000902398655001202407IND60689871220221122135904.0200424e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068987122DNAL7 a10.3109/1040841X.2011.6064262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChowdhary, Anuradha10aEnvironmental prevalence of Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii in India: An update  ap. 1-16.  aAn overview of work done to-date in India on environmental prevalence, population structure, seasonal variations and antifungal susceptibility of Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii is presented. The primary ecologic niche of both pathogens is decayed wood in trunk hollows of a wide spectrum of host trees, representing 18 species. Overall, C. neoformans showed a higher environmental prevalence than that of C. gattii which was not found in the avian habitats. Apart from their arboreal habitat, both species were demonstrated in soil and air in close vicinity of their tree hosts. In addition, C. neoformans showed a strong association with desiccated avian excreta. An overwhelming number of C. neoformans strains belonged to genotype AFLP1/VNI, var. grubii (serotype A), whereas C. gattii strains were genotype AFLP4/VGI, serotype B. All of the environmental strains of C. neoformans and C. gattii were mating type α (MATα). Contrary to the Australian experience, Eucalyptus trees were among the epidemiologically least important and, therefore, the hypothesis of global spread of C. gattii through Australian export of infected Eucalyptus seeds is rebutted. Reference is made to long-term colonization of an abandoned, old timber beam of sal wood (Shorea robusta) by a melanin positive (Mel⁺) variant of Cryptococcus laurentii that was pathogenic to laboratory mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptococcus gattii 3aCryptococcus laurentii 3aCryptococcus neoformans 3aEucalyptus 3aShorea robusta 3aair 3abirds 3adecayed wood 3aexcreta 3aexports 3agenotype 3ahabitats 3ahosts 3amelanin 3amice 3apathogens 3apopulation structure 3aseasonal variation 3aseeds 3aserotypes 3asoil 3atrees 3awood beams 3aIndia 0anatural habitat 0aecological niche 0adecaying wood1 aRandhawa, Harbans S.1 aPrakash, Anupam1 aMeis, Jacques F.0 tCritical reviews in microbiology.g2012 Feb. 1, v. 38, no. 1 p.1-16dTaylor & FranciswJournal:14619x1549-78287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3109/1040841X.2011.6064263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01840naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002400092040001800116100002100134245014400155300001600299520059000315592002800905650002200933650001400955650003300969650001601002650001401018650001501032650003501047651001101082653002601093653002201119653001601141653001501157653001301172700002701185700001901212700001701231773010201248852000901350856007101359655001201430IND4462720520221118093400.0200516e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446272052DNAL7 a10.3852/11-0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontoya, Leticia12aA new species of Lactarius (subgenus Gerardii) from two relict Fagus grandifolia var. mexicana populations in Mexican montane cloud forests  ap. 175-181.  aA new milkcap species, Lactarius fuscomarginatus, was found in the subtropical region of central Veracruz (eastern Mexico) associated with two relict populations of Fagus grandifolia var. mexicana.

This is especially the case for the successive regressions and transgressions over the last interglacial cycle, which have shaped the deposition, preservation and erosion patterns of unconsolidated sediments currently submerged on continental shelves. The current study focuses on creating an integrated marine and terrestrial geophysical and litho-stratigraphic framework of the coastal zone of Hadera, north-central Israel. This research presents a case study, investigating the changing sedimentological units in the study area. Analysis suggest these represent various coastal environments and were deposited during times of lower than present sea level and during the later stages of the Holocene transgression.A multi-disciplinary approach was applied by compiling existing elevation raster grids, bathymetric charts, one hundred lithological borehole data-sets, and a 110km-long sub-bottom geophysical survey. Based on seismic stratigraphic analysis, observed geometries, and reflective appearances, six bounding surfaces and seven seismic units were identified and characterized. These seismic units have been correlated with the available borehole data to produce a chronologically constrained lithostratigraphy for the area. This approach allowed us to propose a relationship between the lithological units and sea-level change and thus enable the reconstruction of Hadera coastal evolution over the last ~100ka. This reconstruction suggests that the stratigraphy is dominated by lowstand aeolian and fluvial terrestrial environments, subsequently transgressed during the Holocene. The results of this study provide a valuable framework for future national strategic shallow-water infrastructure construction and also for the possible locations of past human settlements in relation to coastal evolution through time.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acoasts 3acontinental shelf 3adata collection 3ageometry 3ageophysics 3ahuman settlements 3ainfrastructure 3asea level 3asediments 3astratigraphy 3asurveys 3aIsrael 0aShallow geophysics 0aContinental shelf 0aLate Pleistocene–Holocene sequence 0aIsrael 0aCoastal and marine geology1 aDix, Justin1 aWaldmann, Nicolas1 aMakovsky, Yizhaq1 aGolan, Arik1 aSivan, Dorit0 tGeomorphology.g2016 May 15, v. 261 p.200-211dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2016.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03662naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003300135040001800168100001900186245011600205300001200321506007600333520222600409592002802635506003702663650002202700650001302722650002002735650002402755650001102779650001902790650001202809650001202821650001502833650001602848650002202864650001002886650001302896650001002909700001902919700001802938700002202956700002202978773009203000856007903092852000903171655001203180IND50090665220221207093908.0161029e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009066522DNAL7 aPMC40675192pmcid7 a249483542pmid7 a10.1186/1756-3305-7-2722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDugassa, Sisay10aEvaluation of the influence of electric nets on the behaviour of oviposition site seeking Anopheles gambiae s.s  ap. 272.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Electric nets (e-nets) are used to analyse the flight behaviour of insects and have been used extensively to study the host-oriented flight of tsetse flies. Recently we adapted this tool to analyse the oviposition behaviour of gravid malaria vectors, Anopheles gambiae s.s., orienting towards aquatic habitats and traps by surrounding an artificial pond with e-nets and collecting electrocuted mosquitoes on sticky boards on the ground next to the nets. Here we study whether e-nets themselves affect the responses of gravid An. gambiae s.s.. METHODS: Dual-choice experiments were carried out in 80 m² screened semi-field systems where 200 gravid An. gambiae s.s. were released each night for 12 nights per experiment. The numbers of mosquito landing on or approaching an oviposition site were studied by adding detergent to the water in an artificial pond or surrounding the pond with a square of e-nets. We also assessed whether the supporting framework of the nets or the sticky boards used to retain electrocuted mosquitoes influenced the catch. RESULTS: Two similar detergent treated ponds presented in choice tests caught an equal proportion of the mosquitoes released, whereas a pond surrounded by e-nets caught a higher proportion than an open pond (odds ratio (OR) 1.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 - 2.7; p < 0.017). The separate evaluation of the impact of the square of electric nets and the yellow boards on the approach of gravid females towards a pond suggests that the tower-like construction of the square of electric nets did not restrict the approach of females but the yellow sticky boards on the ground attract gravid females to a source of water (OR 2.7 95% CI 1.7 – 4.3; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The trapping efficiency of the electric nets is increased when large yellow sticky boards are placed on the ground next to the e-nets to collect electrocuted mosquitoes, possibly because of increased visual contrast to the aquatic habitat. It is therefore important when comparing two treatments that the same trapping device is used in both. The importance of contrast around artificial habitats might be exploited to improve collections of An. gambiae s.s. in gravid traps.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnopheles gambiae 3aGlossina 3aaquatic habitat 3aconfidence interval 3aflight 3agravid females 3ainsects 3amalaria 3aodds ratio 3aoviposition 3aoviposition sites 3aponds 3atrapping 3atraps1 aLindh, Jenny M1 aTorr, Steve J1 aLindsay, Steven W1 aFillinger, Ulrike0 tParasites & vectors.g2014 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.272-272dBioMed Centralx1756-33057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-7-2723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03116naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245009200162300001600254520158800270592002801858650002301886650002001909650001001929650001001939650001401949650001501963650002601978650002202004650001002026650002302036650001302059650001402072650000902086650001102095650001402106650001202120650001502132651001002147651001802157653001702175653001502192653001502207653001702222653001302239700001602252700002502268700001502293700002402308700001702332773010702349856008502456852000902541655001202550IND60597316920221121034654.0201202e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059731692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2017.11.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Lei10aUsing the Asian clam as an indicator of microplastic pollution in freshwater ecosystems  ap. 347-355.  aBioindicators play an important role in understanding pollution levels, bioavailability and the ecological risks of contaminants. Several bioindicators have been suggested for understanding microplastic in the marine environment. A bioindicator for microplastics in the freshwater environment does not exist. In our previous studies, we found a high frequency of microplastic pollution in the Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea) in Taihu Lake, China. In the present study, we conducted a large-scale survey of microplastic pollution in Asian clams, water and sediment from 21 sites in the Middle-Lower Yangtze River Basin from August to October of 2016. The Asian clam was available in all sites, which included diverse freshwater systems such as lakes, rivers and estuaries. Microplastics were found at concentrations ranging from 0.3-4.9 items/g (or 0.4–5.0 items/individual) in clams, 0.5–3.1 items/L in water and 15–160 items/kg in sediment. Microfibers were the most dominant types of microplastics found, accounting for 60–100% in clams across all sampling sites. The size of microplastics ranged from 0.021-4.83 mm, and microplastics in the range of 0.25–1 mm were dominant. The abundance, size distribution and color patterns of microplastics in clams more closely resembled those in sediment than in water. Because microplastic pollution in the Asian clam reflected the variability of microplastic pollution in the freshwater environments, we demonstrated the Asian clam as an bioindicator of microplastic pollution in freshwater systems, particularly for sediments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorbicula fluminea 3abioavailability 3aclams 3acolor 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3afreshwater ecosystems 3aindicator species 3alakes 3amarine environment 3aplastics 3apollution 3arisk 3arivers 3asediments 3asurveys 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aMicroplastic 0aFreshwater 0aAsian clam 0aBioindicator 0aSediment1 aCai, Huiwen1 aKolandhasamy, Prabhu1 aWu, Chenxi1 aRochman, Chelsea M.1 aShi, Huahong0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2018 Mar., v. 234 p.347-355dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.11.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002200189245010300211300002200314506007600336520105400412592002801466506003701494650002701531650002601558650001601584650001501600650002001615650002001635650001301655650003001668653002601698653002401724653002601748653004301774653003001817653001101847653002501858653002001883653002201903653003001925700002401955700002501979700001802004700002302022700002402045700001502069773010202084856008202186852000902268655001202277IND60609899120221207115247.0180824e20171214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060989912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.0402doi7 aPMC57333942pmcid7 a291985252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmin-Wetzel, Niko12aA J-Protein Co-chaperone Recruits BiP to Monomerize IRE1 and Repress the Unfolded Protein Response  ap. 1625-1637.e13.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWhen unfolded proteins accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the unfolded protein response (UPR) increases ER-protein-folding capacity to restore protein-folding homeostasis. Unfolded proteins activate UPR signaling across the ER membrane to the nucleus by promoting oligomerization of IRE1, a conserved transmembrane ER stress receptor. However, the coupling of ER stress to IRE1 oligomerization and activation has remained obscure. Here, we report that the ER luminal co-chaperone ERdj4/DNAJB9 is a selective IRE1 repressor that promotes a complex between the luminal Hsp70 BiP and the luminal stress-sensing domain of IRE1α (IRE1ᴸᴰ). In vitro, ERdj4 is required for complex formation between BiP and IRE1ᴸᴰ. ERdj4 associates with IRE1ᴸᴰ and recruits BiP through the stimulation of ATP hydrolysis, forcibly disrupting IRE1 dimers. Unfolded proteins compete for BiP and restore IRE1ᴸᴰ to its default, dimeric, and active state. These observations establish BiP and its J domain co-chaperones as key regulators of the UPR.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3ahomeostasis 3ahydrolysis 3aoligomerization 3aprotein folding 3aproteins 3aunfolded protein response 0aAllosteric Regulation 0aBiological Feedback 0aEndoplasmic Reticulum 0aFluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer 0aHSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins 0aStress 0aProtein Dimerization 0aProtein Folding 0aRepressor Protein 0aUnfolded Protein Response1 aSaunders, Reuben A.1 aKamphuis, Maarten J.1 aRato, Claudia1 aPreissler, Steffen1 aHarding, Heather P.1 aRon, David0 tCell.g2017 Dec. 14, v. 171, no. 7 p.1625-1637.e13dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002400092040001800116100002400134245009500158300001600253520103900269592002801308650002001336650001901356650001701375650001801392650001501410650001001425650001501435650001401450650001201464650001601476650001401492650001501506650001001521650001401531650001601545650001101561650001401572650001601586650001201602650001601614650001001630653001001640653001301650653001401663653001201677653001001689653001001699700001901709700002201728700002601750700002201776700002401798773010201822852000901924856007101933655001202004IND4462720820221118093447.0200516e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446272082DNAL7 a10.3852/11-0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPažoutová, Sylvie10aLiberomyces gen. nov. with two new species of endophytic coelomycetes from broadleaf trees  ap. 198-210.  aDuring a study of endophytic and saprotrophic fungi in the sapwood and phloem of broadleaf trees (Salix alba, Quercus robur, Ulmus laevis, Alnus glutinosa, Betula pendula) fungi belonging to an anamorphic coelomycetous genus not attributable to a described taxon were detected and isolated in pure culture. The new genus, Liberomyces, with two species, L. saliciphilus and L. macrosporus, is described. Both species have subglobose conidiomata containing holoblastic sympodial conidiogenous cells. The conidiomata dehisce irregularly or by ostiole and secrete a slimy suspension of conidia. The conidia are hyaline, narrowly allantoid with a typically curved distal end. In L. macrosporus simultaneous production of synanamorph with thin filamentous conidia was observed occasionally. The genus has no known teleomorph. Related sequences in the public databases belong to endophytes of angiosperms. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a position close to the Xylariales (Sordariomycetes), but family and order affiliation remained unclear.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlnus glutinosa 3aBetula pendula 3aCoelomycetes 3aQuercus robur 3aSalix alba 3aUlmus 3aXylariales 3aanamorphs 3aconidia 3aconidiomata 3adatabases 3aendophytes 3afungi 3anew genus 3anew species 3aphloem 3aphylogeny 3asaprotrophs 3asapwood 3ateleomorphs 3atrees 0aAlnus 0aanamorph 0aphylogeny 0aQuercus 0aSalix 0aUlmus1 aŠrůtka, Petr1 aHoluša, Jaroslav1 aChudíčková, Milada1 aKubátová, Alena1 aKolařík, Miroslav0 tMycologia.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 104, no. 1 p.198-210dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1951x1557-25367nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3852/11-0813Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02747naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245017400168300001800342520126600360592002801626650003401654650001901688650001501707650002101722650003101743650002501774650000701799650001801806650002201824650000901846650002701855650001601882650001001898650001401908653001301922653002501935653001401960653003401974700001802008700001802026700001902044700002102063773008702084856008502171852000902256655001202265IND60114028520221119222759.0161024e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011402852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2013.07.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChi, Won-Jae10aProduction and characterization of a thermostable endo-type β-xylanase produced by a newly-isolated Streptomyces thermocarboxydus subspecies MW8 strain from Jeju Island  ap. 1736-1743.  aA xylanase-producing, Gram-positive, aerobic, and spore-forming bacterium was isolated from a soil sample collected from Jeju Island and was classified as a novel subspecies of Streptomyces thermocarboxydus on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, the results of DNA–DNA hybridization analysis, and phenotypic characteristics. The novel strain was named as S. thermocarboxydus subsp. MW8 (=KCTC29013=DSM52054). This strain produced extracellular xylanase. Xylanase from the strain was purified to homogeneity and had an apparent molecular weight of 52kDa. The NH2-terminal sequence (Ala-Glu-Ile-Arg-Leu) was distinct from those of previously reported xylanases. The purified xylanase produced xylobiose as the end-product of birchwood xylan hydrolysis. The Km and Vmax values of the purified xylanase on birchwood xylan were 1.71mg/ml and 357.14U/mg, respectively. The optimum pH and temperature for the enzyme were found to be 7.0 and 50°C, respectively, and the enzyme exhibited significant heat stability. In addition, the enzyme was active over broad pH ranges: 84% of the maximum activity at pH 5.0, 84–88% at pH 6.0, 88% at pH 8.0, and 75–81% (pH 9.0). These enzymatic properties may be very useful for use in bio-industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptomyces thermocarboxydus 3aheat stability 3ahydrolysis 3amolecular weight 3anucleic acid hybridization 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence homology 3asoil 3aspore-forming bacteria 3atemperature 3axylan 3axylanases 0aXylanase 0aEndo-β-1,4-xylanase 0aXylobiose 0aStreptomyces thermocarboxydus1 aLim, Ju Hyeon1 aPark, Da Yeon1 aPark, Jae Seon1 aHong, Soon-Kwang0 tProcess Biochemistry.g2013 Nov., v. 48 p.1736-1743dElsevier Ltdx1359-51137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2013.07.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005200153245012400205520098300329592002801312650001601340650001401356650001801370650001701388650001001405650001101415650001901426650002501445650001401470650002301484650002101507650001701528653002901545653003401574653002601608653001701634700001801651700001701669700001701686700001801703700001901721700001701740700001901757700001701776773009801793856008801891852000901979655001201988IND60782594420221120095928.0220830e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078259442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2022.1132942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZang, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1013-402410aAureoterrolides B‒M: Eremophilane-type sesquiterpenoids isolated from Aspergillus aureoterreus and their cytotoxicity  aUncovered by genome sequence analyses, twelve undescribed sesquiterpenoids designated aureoterrolides B‒M, were isolated from the culture broth of the fungus Aspergillus aureoterreus together with two known analogues.

To assess biochemical and molecular responses of alfalfa to abrupt chilling, the cultivars “WL440HQ” (WL) and “ZhaoDong” (ZD) were subjected to a five-phase experimental regime that included two abrupt-chilling events. The freezing tolerance of the crown was determined as the semi-lethal temperature (LT₅₀) calculated from electrolyte leakage. Soluble sugar concentrations were quantified by ion chromatography. The mRNA transcript levels of four genes encoding enzymes (β-amylase, sucrose phosphate synthase, galactinol synthase, and stachyose synthase) involved in sugar metabolism and two cold-regulated genes (Cas15A and K3-dehydrin) were quantified using quantitative real-time PCR analysis. During the abrupt-chilling events, the LT₅₀ decreased significantly in ZD but not in WL. The rapid response of ZD to abrupt chilling may have been due to the large increases in raffinose and stachyose concentrations, which were consistent with increased transcript levels of the galactinol synthase and stachyose synthase genes. Transcript levels of the cold-regulated genes Cas15A and K3-dehydrin were correlated with increased freezing tolerance under abrupt chilling. The results provide a reference for selection of appropriate cultivars to reduce the risk of crop damage in production areas where early autumn or late spring frosts are likely.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3aautumn 3abeta-amylase 3acold tolerance 3acold treatment 3acrop damage 3acultivars 3aelectrolyte leakage 3agenes 3ainositol 3-alpha-galactosyltransferase 3aion exchange chromatography 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3araffinose 3arisk reduction 3aspring 3astachyose 3asucrose-phosphate synthase 3atemperature1 aTong, Zongyong 1 aHe, Feng 1 aLi, Xianglin 0 tAgronomy.g2020 Feb. 10, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy100202553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245012900208300001600337520135400353592002801707650002201735650002101757650001601778650002201794650001301816650001701829650001301846650002301859650002101882650001901903650000901922650001101931650001501942650001601957650001201973650001401985653001601999653002302015653002302038653002902061700001502090700002202105700005902127773010802186856008202294852000902376655001202385IND60589715820221118232545.0190405e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058971582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2018.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNawaz, Malik Adil1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8552-874910aEffect of starch modification in the whole white rice grains on physicochemical properties of two contrasting rice varieties  ap. 143-149.  aThe effect of acetylation of milled rice of selected rice varieties viz. TDK8 and DG on their physicochemical properties was investigated at different acetic anhydride concentrations (1–7 g per 100 g of milled rice samples in 225 mL of water). Results showed that the intact starch of milled grains of both selected verities could be acetylated (Acetyl % for TDK8 = 2.18 and for DG = 0.89) even with 1 g of acetic anhydride. X-ray diffraction patterns showed that acetylation resulted in reduced crystallinity. Acetylation resulted in reduced peak and final viscosities and gel strength, particularly in glutinous (TDK 8) and non-glutinous (DG) rice. Thermal study showed acetylation resulted in reduced thermal transition temperatures and enthalpy of both varieties. Although the increase in retrogradation thermal temperatures was observed, the amount of retrograded starch was decreased in both varieties. Furthermore, the texture of cooked acetylated grains was less hard and more adhesive. In vitro digestion showed significant decrease in GI possibly due to structural changes in the native starch during acetylation. These findings suggest a good potential of applying acetic anhydride pre-treatments in rice processing, especially glutinous varieties to control the hardness and maintain the stickiness properties of rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacetic anhydride 3aacetylation 3acrystal structure 3aenthalpy 3agel strength 3ahardness 3ain vitro digestion 3aphase transition 3aretrogradation 3arice 3astarch 3astickiness 3atemperature 3atexture 3aviscosity 0aAcetylation 0aPasting properties 0aThermal properties 0aTexture profile analysis1 aFukai, Shu1 aPrakash, Sangeeta1 aBhandari, Bhesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8800-62950 tJournal of cereal science.g2018 Mar., v. 80 p.143-149dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2018.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245008900170300001600259520144900275592002801724650002101752650003301773650001601806650001601822650001601838650003101854650001201885650001101897650000901908650001901917650001701936650001001953650001201963650001901975650002001994650001602014650001502030650001502045651001102060653002002071653002002091653001702111653001102128653001402139773009702153856008602250852000902336655001202345IND60606813020221120062520.0180730e20160515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060681302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2016.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNachshon, Uri10aSeepage weathering impacts on erosivity of arid stream banks: A new conceptual model  ap. 212-221.  aField observations have indicated the formation of horizontal, pipe shape cavities, along gully and dry stream channel banks in the semi-arid region of the northern Negev Desert, Israel. Piping is a well-known phenomenon in humid regions due to subsurface water flow and seepage weathering. However, in dry environments where rain events are scarce and subsurface water flow is rare, it is proposed here that capillary flow of saline water in the vadose zone leads to similar processes. It is suggested that where saline and shallow ground water persists, capillary flow may result in salt accumulation and precipitation at the top of the capillary fringe, consequently rendering this zone to be more susceptible to erosion. A conceptual model is presented and field observations, laboratory experiments, and a physically-based model are used to prove the feasibility of the proposed conceptual model and to explain why salts accumulate at the top of the capillary fringe, even though evaporation acts all along the vertical stream channel or gully banks. It is suggested that the low evaporative flux, in comparison to the liquid water flux, disables salt accumulation along the profile to the top of the capillary fringe where the liquid water flux is minimal. The presented findings strengthen the conceptual model, but thorough field studies are needed to estimate the impact of the proposed mechanism on erosion processes on a field scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapillary fringe 3adry environmental conditions 3aevaporation 3agroundwater 3ahumid zones 3alaboratory experimentation 3aliquids 3amodels 3arain 3ariparian areas 3asaline water 3asalts 3aseepage 3asemiarid zones 3astream channels 3avadose zone 3awater flow 3aweathering 3aIsrael 0aSeepage erosion 0aSalt weathering 0aPipe erosion 0aSolute 0aTransport0 tGeomorphology.g2016 May 15, v. 261 p.212-221dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2016.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02435naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002100189245005700210300002200267506007600289520104300365592002801408506003701436650000801473650000801481650001501489650001801504650001401522650001001536650001301546650001101559650001601570650002501586650001101611653002201622653002001644653001301664653001201677653001301689653001401702653001401716700001801730773010201748856008201850852000901932655001201941IND60609899320221207130456.0180824e20171214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060989932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.0432doi7 aPMC57320572pmcid7 a291985232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTruong, David M.10aResetting the Yeast Epigenome with Human Nucleosomes  ap. 1508-1519.e13.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHumans and yeast are separated by a billion years of evolution, yet their conserved histones retain central roles in gene regulation. Here, we “reset” yeast to use core human nucleosomes in lieu of their own (a rare event taking 20 days), which initially only worked with variant H3.1. The cells adapt by acquiring suppressor mutations in cell-division genes or by acquiring certain aneuploid states. Converting five histone residues to their yeast counterparts restored robust growth. We reveal that humanized nucleosomes are positioned according to endogenous yeast DNA sequence and chromatin-remodeling network, as judged by a yeast-like nucleosome repeat length. However, human nucleosomes have higher DNA occupancy, globally reduce RNA content, and slow adaptation to new conditions by delaying chromatin remodeling. These humanized yeasts (including H3.3) pose fundamental new questions about how chromatin is linked to many cell processes and provide a platform to study histone variants via yeast epigenome reprogramming.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aaneuploidy 3acell division 3aevolution 3agenes 3ahistones 3ahumans 3anucleosomes 3anucleotide sequences 3ayeasts 0asynthetic biology 0asystems biology 0agenomics 0ahistone 0ahistones 0achromatin 0ahumanized1 aBoeke, Jef D.0 tCell.g2017 Dec. 14, v. 171, no. 7 p.1508-1519.e13dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02285naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010400155300002000259520113700279592002801416650002601444650001701470650001601487650001001503650002501513650001901538650001701557650001501574650001901589650001301608650001701621700002401638700001501662700001601677773012301693856007401816852000901890655001201899IND60640515620221119131356.0190504e20160504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064051562DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra04066g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHynek, Jan10aDesign of porphyrin-based conjugated microporous polymers with enhanced singlet oxygen productivity  ap. 44279-44287.  aNovel non-toxic materials with antimicrobial surfaces are needed for medicinal applications. Potential alternatives for bacterial inactivation include materials that produce singlet oxygen, O₂(¹Δg), a short-lived, highly oxidative, and cytotoxic species. We synthesized a promising group of materials, porphyrin-based conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs), which effectively generate O₂(¹Δg) under visible light irradiation. CMPs were rationally designed and synthesized to maximize O₂(¹Δg) production. A strategy based on three-dimensional frameworks allowed the immediate environment of the porphyrin units to be tuned and their structure–property relationships to be elucidated. We investigated the photophysical and photochemical properties of the frameworks and compared them with the properties of porphyrin-based CMPs and metal–organic frameworks. In general, the O₂(¹Δg) production activity of the CMPs correlated with neither the surface area nor with the pore volume. The novel CMPs displayed high O₂(¹Δg) production, were stable in organic solvents, and did not undergo measurable photobleaching.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoordination polymers 3acytotoxicity 3airradiation 3alight 3amedicinal properties 3aphotobleaching 3aporous media 3aporphyrins 3asinglet oxygen 3asolvents 3asurface area1 aRathouský, Jiří,1 aDemel, Jan1 aLang, Kamil0 tRSC advances.g2016 May 04, v. 6, no. 50 p.44279-44287dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra04066g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03175naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245007800166520155100244592002801795650001701823650001001840650001601850650001201866650001601878650001801894650001801912650001401930650002301944650001201967650002301979650002502002650001502027650001202042650002002054650001802074650002302092650001402115650002602129650001302155650000802168650000902176650001302185650002002198650002202218650002002240650002302260650001702283650001002300700002002310700002602330700001702356773012202373856008102495852000902576655001202585IND60702038920221120113141.0200717e20200211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070203892DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy100202572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMennan, Husrev 10aNon-Chemical Weed Management in Vegetables by Using Cover Crops: A Review  aVegetables are a substantial part of our lives and possess great commercial and nutritional value. Weeds not only decrease vegetable yield but also reduce their quality. Non-chemical weed control is important both for the organic production of vegetables and achieving ecologically sustainable weed management. Estimates have shown that the yield of vegetables may be decreased by 45%–95% in the case of weed–vegetable competition. Non-chemical weed control in vegetables is desired for several reasons. For example, there are greater chances of contamination of vegetables by herbicide residue compared to cereals or pulse crops. Non-chemical weed control in vegetables is also needed due to environmental pollution, the evolution of herbicide resistance in weeds and a strong desire for organic vegetable cultivation. Although there are several ways to control weeds without the use of herbicides, cover crops are an attractive choice because these have a number of additional benefits (such as soil and water conservation) along with the provision of satisfactory and sustainable weed control. Several cover crops are available that may provide excellent weed control in vegetable production systems. Cover crops such as rye, vetch, or Brassicaceae plants can suppress weeds in rotations, including vegetables crops such as tomato, cabbage, or pumpkin. Growers should also consider the negative effects of using cover crops for weed control, such as the negative allelopathic effects of some cover crop residues on the main vegetable crop.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassicaceae 3aVicia 3aallelopathy 3acabbage 3acover crops 3acrop residues 3acrop rotation 3aevolution 3afood contamination 3agrowers 3aherbicide residues 3aherbicide resistance 3aherbicides 3alegumes 3anutritive value 3aorganic foods 3aorganic production 3apollution 3aproduction technology 3apumpkins 3arye 3asoil 3atomatoes 3avegetable crops 3avegetable growing 3avegetable yield 3awater conservation 3aweed control 3aweeds1 aJabran, Khawar 1 aZandstra, Bernard H.,1 aPala, Firat 0 tAgronomy.g2020 Feb. 11, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy100202573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02988naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245012200158300001600280500001500296520168600311592002801997650002102025650000902046650001602055650002202071650001502093650001202108650001302120650001202133650001102145651001002156653001702166653002302183653001802206653001202224653001602236653001402252653002102266700002002287700001102307773012702318856007602445852000902521655001202530IND50065175820221119225349.0151127e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006517582DNAL7 a10.3170/2007-8-183652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yonghua10aPlant height as a simple predictor of the root to shoot ratio: Evidence from alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau  ap. 245-252.  a2019-12-04  aQuestion: Since increases in altitude and grazing intensity generally result in decreases in height growth of alpine grasslands, plant height may integrate effects of environmental stress and grazing disturbance and provide better assessments of the variation in root:shoot (R:S) biomass ratio than other variables. However, it is unclear if there is a general relationship between plant height and R:S ratio across grassland ecosystems. Such knowledge would be helpful for root biomass estimation in grasslands.Location: An altitudinal transect in the Gonghe Basin (2880––4040 m a.s.l.), northeast Tibetan plateau.Methods: We measured standing biomass both above-ground and below-ground, maximum plant height (MPH) and soil variables across 43 plots.Results: Climatic variables explained the variations in MPH and R:S ratio of undegraded grasslands better than soil variables (46––50%% vs <19%%), while those of degraded grasslands generally showed insignificant correlations with climatic and soil variables. There was a general relationship between R:S ratio and MPH (negative, R² == 0.76, P < 0.001) across degraded and undegraded grasslands. The relationship was used to predict R:S ratio in 13 additional plots in steppe grasslands of Inner Mongolia, and good agreement of expected and observed values has been found (R² == 0.87, P < 0.001).Conclusions: MPH, that is relatively easy to measure, can be used to predict R:S ratio at plot to regional scales. It is promising to develop a new method for large-scale estimation of root biomass in grasslands using MPH and shoot biomass avoiding tedious procedures of physical measuring of above and below-ground biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aroot shoot ratio 3asoil 3amethodology 3agrazing intensity 3aecosystems 3asteppes 3aaltitude 3abiomass 3ashoots 3aChina 0aRoot biomass 0aElevation transect 0aHeight growth 0agrazing 0anew methods 0aR:S ratio 0aAlpine ecosystem1 aLuo, Tiangxiang1 aLu, Qi0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2008 Apr., v. 19, no. 2 p.245-252dOpulus Press UppsalawJournal:jnl46820x1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3170/2007-8-183653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245008700205300001800292520178900310592002802099650001302127650001702140650002402157650001202181650001802193650001502211650001202226650002102238650001302259650002602272650001702298651001402315653001402329653000902343653001102352653001202363653001302375653001402388700001802402700002102420700002202441700002202463773013002485856008102615852000902696655001202705IND60655625520221118001740.0190803e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065562552DNAL7 a10.1017/S13689800190007522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, Phillip1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0802-234910aTrade and nutrition policy coherence: a framing analysis and Australian case study  ap. 2329-2337.  aMaximising synergies and minimising conflicts (i.e. building policy coherence) between trade and nutrition policy is an important objective. One understudied driver of policy coherence is the alignment in the frames, discourses and values of actors involved in the respective sectors. In the present analysis, we aim to understand how such actors interpret (i.e. ‘frame’) nutrition and the implications for building trade–nutrition policy coherence. We adopted a qualitative single case study design, drawing on key informant interviews with those involved in trade policy. We focused on the Australian trade policy sub-system, which has historically emphasised achieving market growth and export opportunities for Australian food producers. Nineteen key informants involved in trade policy spanning the government, civil society, business and academic sectors. Nutrition had low ‘salience’ in Australian trade policy for several reasons. First, it was not a domestic political priority in Australia nor among its trading partners; few advocacy groups were advocating for nutrition in trade policy. Second, a ‘productivist’ policy paradigm in the food and trade policy sectors strongly emphasised market growth, export opportunities and deregulation over nutrition and other social objectives. Third, few opportunities existed for health advocates to influence trade policy, largely because of limited consultation processes. Fourth, the complexity of nutrition and its inter-linkages with trade presented difficulties for developing a ‘broader discourse’ for engaging the public and political leaders on the topic. Overcoming these ‘ideational challenges’ is likely to be important to building greater coherence between trade and nutrition policy going forward.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvocacy 3acase studies 3aexperimental design 3aexports 3afood industry 3ainterviews 3amarkets 3anutrition policy 3apolitics 3asocial responsibility 3atrade policy 3aAustralia 0aNutrition 0aFood 0aHealth 0aFraming 0aIdeology 0aCoherence1 aFriel, Sharon1 aGleeson, Deborah1 aThow, Anne Marie,1 aLabonté, Ronald,0 tPublic health nutrition.g2019 Aug., v. 22, no. 12 p.2329-2337dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800190007523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245010100178300001600279520117700295592002801472650001401500650001101514650002101525650002201546650001101568650003101579650002001610650002901630650002101659651000901680653001801689653002201707653002301729653001701752653002301769653001301792700002301805700001901828700001901847773009701866856008501963852000902048655001202057IND60601546120221120101121.0200614e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060154612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2018.06.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarimi, Mohammad Sadjad10aComparative study of solar-powered underfloor heating system performance in distinctive climates  ap. 524-535.  aAccording to the International Energy Agency, buildings are the largest energy-consuming sector globally, producing over one-third of greenhouse gas emissions in 2013. Renewable energies such as solar can be harnessed to fully or partially meet the energy demands of buildings. In this study, solar thermal collectors are used in a building to provide the hot water required for an underfloor heating system. Three cities in Iran, namely Tabriz, Tehran and Kish island, with distinctive climatic conditions are considered to gain a better understanding of the performance of solar-powered underfloor heating systems in different climates. Moreover, an economic analysis is conducted to assess the feasibility of the proposed system. DesignBuilder software is applied to simulate the energy performance of the building. The results indicate that the annual fuel consumption of the building with a solar collector located in Tehran, Tabriz and Kish island is reduced by 125.39, 303.58 and 1.41 MWh compared to that of without collector, respectively. The payback period of the system for Tehran, Tabriz and Kish Island is found to be 8.2, 9.4 and 12.1 years, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acities 3aclimatic factors 3acomputer software 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3aheating systems 3arenewable energy sources 3asolar collectors 3aIran 0aDesignBuilder 0aEconomic analysis 0aEnergy performance 0aSolar energy 0aUnderfloor heating 0aBuilding1 aFazelpour, Farivar1 aRosen, Marc A.1 aShams, Mehrzad0 tRenewable energy.g2019 Jan., v. 130 p.524-535dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2018.06.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245014200163300001600305520147500321592002801796650004801824650002901872650003101901650001001932650001301942650001401955650002001969650001201989650001102001650001102012650001202023650001802035650000902053650002302062650002102085650002302106700002002129700002502149773012702174856007902301852000902380655001202389IND50075024120221121134738.0150206e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007502412DNAL7 a10.1111/1471-0307.121182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOluk, Aylin C10aInfluence of exopolysaccharide‐producing cultures on the volatile profile and sensory quality of low‐fat Tulum cheese during ripening  ap. 265-276.  aThe objective of this investigation was to compare the composition and changes in the concentration of volatiles in low‐fat and full‐fat Tulum cheeses during ripening. Tulum cheese was manufactured from low‐ or full‐fat milk using exopolysaccharide (EPS)‐producing or non‐EPS‐producing starter cultures. A total of 82 volatile compounds were identified belonging to the following chemical groups: acids (seven), esters (21), ketones (14), aldehydes (six), alcohols (14) and miscellaneous compounds (20). The relative amounts of acids, alcohols and aldehydes increased in the cheeses made with EPS‐producing cultures during 90 days of ripening. Differences were found in the volatile profile of full‐fat Tulum cheese compared with the low‐fat variant, especially after 90 days of ripening. Exopolysaccharide‐producing cultures changed the volatile profile, and the EPS‐producing cultures including Streptococcus thermophilus + Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus + Lactobacillus helveticus (LF‐EPS2) produced cheese with higher levels of methyl ketones and aldehydes than the non‐EPS cultures. In the sensory analysis, full‐fat Tulum cheeses and the cheese produced with the EPS‐producing culture containing Lb. helveticus (LF‐EPS2) were preferred by the expert panel. It was concluded that the use of EPS‐producing starter cultures in the manufacture of low‐fat Tulum cheese had the potential to improve the flavour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 3aLactobacillus helveticus 3aStreptococcus thermophilus 3aacids 3aalcohols 3aaldehydes 3acheese ripening 3acheeses 3aesters 3aflavor 3aketones 3amanufacturing 3amilk 3asensory evaluation 3astarter cultures 3avolatile compounds1 aGüven, Mehmet,1 aHayaloglu, Ali Adnan0 tInternational journal of dairy technology.g2014 May, v. 67, no. 2 p.265-276dSociety of Dairy Technologyx1364-727X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1471-0307.121183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007500169300001600244500001400260520140700274536014201681592002801823650001401851650001001865650002301875650002901898650002001927650001101947650001801958650002201976650000901998650001002007653001302017653001902030653002702049653002202076653002802098700002602126700002302152700001602175700003102191700002002222773013002242856008502372852000902457655001202466IND60729876520221120022834.0210303e20210316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072987652DNAL7 a10.1080/10807039.2020.17503442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFadaei, Saeid10aInvestigating determinants of parabens concentration in maternal urine  ap. 668-686.  aNAL-light  aParabens are used as antimicrobial preservatives in a wide range of cosmetics, foodstuffs and pharmaceuticals. There is increasing evidence that has linked paraben exposure to adverse health effects. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the determinants of urinary parabens concentration among Iranian pregnant women. The urinary concentrations of methylparaben (MeP), ethylparaben (EtP), propylparaben (PrP), and butylparaben (BuP) were measured among 117 pregnant women at their first trimester. The associations between urinary concentrations of these compounds with different variables were assessed. MeP, EtP, PrP, and BuP were detected with a median concentration of 160.1, 0.04, 7.8, and 7.5 μg/g.cre, respectively. Significant associations were observed between urinary concentrations of MeP and PrP with educational level, between MeP, PrP and BuP with plastic packaging of foodstuffs and physical activity status, and between MeP and sampling season. All the measured parabens were significantly correlated with the use of personal care products. PrP and BuP were found to be correlated to passive smoking and intake of supplements, respectively. MeP and EtP showed negative significant relationships with the consumption of drinking water and MeP concentration correlated with gestational age. According to our findings, Iranian pregnant women are at high risk of exposure to parabens.  aThis research was conducted as a part of the Ph.D. dissertation of the first author, supported by Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.  aPublisher supplied data 3acosmetics 3adrugs 3aeducational status 3aenvironmental assessment 3agestational age 3ahumans 3amethylparaben 3aphysical activity 3arisk 3aurine 0aParabens 0amaternal urine 0aenvironmental exposure 0alifestyle factors 0asocioeconomic variables1 aPourzamani, Hamidreza1 aEbrahimpour, Karim1 aFeizi, Awat1 aDaniali, Seyede Shahrbanoo1 aKelishadi, Roya0 tHuman and ecological risk assessment.g2021 Mar. 16, v. 27, no. 3 p.668-686dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12198x1549-78607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2020.17503443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010600166300001600272520167900288592002801967650002701995650001602022650001602038650002502054650002702079650001602106650001102122650002302133650001602156650002402172650001602196650003102212650000902243650001602252650001002268650001802278650002502296650001802321650001302339650003302352700001502385700001102400700001502411773010702426856005102533852000902584655001202593IND50075028420221121134655.0140410e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007502842DNAL7 a10.1080/00071668.2010.5474572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, J.W.10aEffect of dietary energy source on deposition and fatty acid synthesis in the liver of the laying hen  ap. 704-710.  a1. This experiment was conducted to determine the effect of different dietary energy sources on hepatic lipid deposition and fatty acid synthesis in the layer's liver.2. A total of 120 Lohmann Pink commercial layers were divided into three groups of 40 birds each and restricted-fed so that they had similar metabolisable energy intakes. Experimental diets were prepared as follows: (1) maize-soybean meal basal diet (CS) fed at 108 g/d, (2) soybean isolated protein plus lard diet (SL) fed at 63 g/d, (3) soybean isolated protein plus maize starch diet (SC) fed at 94·4 g/d. All feed intakes were limited so that the birds consumed similar quantities of the major nutrient daily; all the birds were fed 4 times/d.3. Compared with chicks fed on the CS and SC, hepatic EE (ether extraction) and triglyceride of the SL group were increased significantly and the total of cholesterol and phospholipids was increased. However, there were no significant reductions in plasma VLDL and ApoB100 concentrations.4. The birds fed on the maize starch diets up-regulated srebp-1c and chrebp mRNA transcription levels significantly. The maize starch diet also increased the activity of acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) significantly. However, the lard diet led to a decrease of ACC activity, but had no significant effect on FAS.5. These results showed that dietary carbohydrates can induce hepatic lipid deposition by increasing the ACC and FAS activities and up-regulating the srebp-1c and chrebp mRNA transcription levels in the layer's liver much more readily than dietary fat, and layers fed on high carbohydrate diets tend to have more fatty livers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3acholesterol 3acorn starch 3adietary carbohydrate 3adietary energy sources 3adietary fat 3aenergy 3aexperimental diets 3afatty acids 3afatty-acid synthase 3afeed intake 3agene expression regulation 3alard 3alaying hens 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolizable energy 3aphospholipids 3asoybeans 3avery low density lipoprotein1 aChen, D.W.1 aYu, B.1 aWang, Y.M.0 tBritish poultry science.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 52, no. 6 p.704-710dTaylor & Francis Groupx1466-17997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00071668.2010.547457  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245006700202300001600269520135200285592002801637650001101665650001701676650001101693650002101704650001401725650001101739650002401750650001801774650001901792650001701811651001001828653003201838653002501870653000901895653002101904700001401925700001601939700001501955773012201970856008102092852000902173655001202182IND60623001720221123030459.0181127e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062300172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2018.03.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Longyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5775-491710aFactor decomposition of carbon emissions in Chinese megacities  ap. 209-215.  aIn this article, per capita urban carbon emissions were decomposed into manufacturing, transportation, and construction sectors using logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) method. This new decomposition method can provide information about specific drivers of carbon emissions, including urban growth and resident living standards, rather than general demographic and economic factors identified by traditional methods. Using four Chinese megacities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing) as case studies, we analyzed the factors that influenced per capita carbon emissions from 2010 to 2015. The results showed that per capita carbon emissions increased in Tianjin and Chongqing whereas decreased in Beijing and Shanghai, and that manufacturing was a key driving force. In these four megacities, energy conservation strategies were successfully implemented despite poor energy structure optimization during 2010–2015. Development of manufacturing and improvement of resident living standards in the cities led to an increase in carbon emissions. The unique dual-core urban form of Tianjin might mitigate the increased carbon emissions caused by the transportation sector. Reductions in carbon emissions could be achieved by further optimizing energy structures, limiting the number of private cars, and controlling per capita construction.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acase studies 3acities 3aeconomic factors 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3amanufacturing 3atransportation 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aPer capita carbon emissions 0aFactor decomposition 0aLMID 0aChina megacities1 aSun, Jing1 aLin, Jianyi1 aZhao, Yang0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2019 Jan., v. 75 p.209-215dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2018.03.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04201naa a2200865 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001400171245017200185300001600357520140600373592002801779650002501807650002101832650001201853650001101865650002001876650002101896650002401917650001101941650001501952650001601967650001701983650002502000650001502025650001702040650001302057650001302070650001502083650001102098650002102109650001802130650002402148650004502172650002202217650006502239650004902304650002202353650003202375650002302407650004402430650002302474650002902497650001802526650004202544650005902586650001702645650004402662650002302706650001402729650002902743650003302772650003302805650004002838650003602878650004702914650002902961700001802990700001803008700001603026700001803042700001803060700001803078700002603096700001703122700002003139773010003159856005503259852000903314655001203323IND4464756020221123003818.0120727e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446475602DNAL7 a222690692pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.04026.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Feng12aA dual‐targeted purple acid phosphatase in Arabidopsis thaliana moderates carbon metabolism and its overexpression leads to faster plant growth and higher seed yield  ap. 206-219.  a• Overexpression of AtPAP2, a purple acid phosphatase (PAP) with a unique C‐terminal hydrophobic motif in Arabidopsis, resulted in earlier bolting and a higher seed yield. Metabolite analysis showed that the shoots of AtPAP2 overexpression lines contained higher levels of sugars and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) metabolites. Enzyme assays showed that sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) activity was significantly upregulated in the overexpression lines. The higher SPS activity arose from a higher level of SPS protein, and was independent of SnRK1. • AtPAP2 was found to be targeted to both plastids and mitochondria via its C‐terminal hydrophobic motif. Ectopic expression of a truncated AtPAP2 without this C‐terminal motif in Arabidopsis indicated that the subcellular localization of AtPAP2 is essential for its biological actions. • Plant PAPs are generally considered to mediate phosphorus acquisition and redistribution. AtPAP2 is the first PAP shown to modulate carbon metabolism and the first shown to be dual‐targeted to both plastids and mitochondria by a C‐terminal targeting signal. • One PAP‐like sequence carrying a hydrophobic C‐terminal motif could be identified in the genome of the smallest free‐living photosynthetic eukaryote, Ostreococcus tauri. This might reflect a common ancestral function of AtPAP2‐like sequences in the regulation of carbon metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aacid phosphatase 3abolting 3acarbon 3aenzyme activity 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene overexpression 3agenome 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amitochondria 3anucleotide sequences 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3aplastids 3aproteins 3aseed yield 3ashoots 3asucrose synthase 3asugar content 3atricarboxylic acids 2aAcid Phosphatasexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aAmino Acid Motifs 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgrowth & development. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aBlotting, Western 2aCarbohydratesxpharmacology 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aChloroplastsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aConserved Sequence 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aEnzyme Assays 2aGlycoproteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aHydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactionsxdrug effects 2aMetabolomics 2aMitochondriaxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aModels, Biological 2aPhenotype 2aPhosphorusxpharmacology 2aPhotosynthesisxdrug effects 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPlastidsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Transportxdrug effects 2aSeedsxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aSolubilityxdrug effects1 aSuen, Pui Kit1 aZhang, Youjun1 aLiang, Chao1 aCarrie, Chris1 aWhelan, James1 aWard, Jane L.1 aHawkins, Nathaniel D.1 aJiang, Liwen1 aLim, Boon Leong0 tnew phytologist.g2012 Apr., v. 194, no. 1 p.206-219dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.04026.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02273naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009400171300001600265520106100281592002801342650002001370650000901390650002001399650001101419650002601430650003001456650000901486650002801495650002201523650001501545650001101560650001401571650001401585650001401599650000901613650001301622651001201635773011001647856008501757852000901842655001201851IND60635245620221119203055.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063524562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsci.2019.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemly, A.

A scientific analysis of environmental hazards of the project reveals numerous flaws in both the projected environmental performance of the mine and its regulatory control. From both environmental and economic perspectives, the proposed mine will do far more damage than can be reasonably justified on any level. In this report, I present science-backed facts that show 6 specific, and grave, points of environmental hazard. If approved and made operational, the Grassy Mountain Coal Project will create a serious environmental threat from selenium pollution of high quality, high value aquatic habitats and culminate in poisoning of provincially and federally protected fish, coupled with substantial negative economic impacts. Prudent, timely, and decisive action by the Alberta Energy Regulator can eliminate the selenium risk and protect the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic habitat 3acoal 3aeconomic impact 3aenergy 3aenvironmental hazards 3aenvironmental performance 3afish 3ahazard characterization 3aissues and policy 3alandscapes 3amining 3amountains 3apoisoning 3apollution 3arisk 3aselenium 3aAlberta0 tEnvironmental science & policy.g2019 June, v. 96 p.105-113dElsevier LtdwJournal:12413x1462-90117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2019.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245010200173300001600275520162700291592002801918650001101946650002001957650001901977650001101996650001902007650000902026650001302035650001202048650002902060650001102089650001602100650000902116653000902125653000802134653001002142653000802152653001102160653001102171700005802182700005602240700002402296700001802320700002202338700001602360700002202376700001902398700002202417700001902439773011502458856008202573852000902655655001202664IND60597164120221122154504.0190613e20180915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059716412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2018.05.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKing, Joshq(Joshua),14aThe influence of snow microstructure on dual-frequency radar measurements in a tundra environment  ap. 242-254.  aRecent advancement in the understanding of snow-microwave interactions has helped to isolate the considerable potential for radar-based retrieval of snow water equivalent (SWE). There are however, few datasets available to address spatial uncertainties, such as the influence of snow microstructure, at scales relevant to space-borne application. In this study we introduce measurements from SnowSAR, an airborne, dual-frequency (9.6 and 17.2 GHz) synthetic aperture radar (SAR), to evaluate high resolution (10 m) backscatter within a snow-covered tundra basin. Coincident in situ surveys at two sites characterize a generally thin snowpack (50 cm) interspersed with deeper drift features. Structure of the snowpack is found to be predominantly wind slab (65%) with smaller proportions of depth hoar underlain (35%). Objective estimates of snow microstructure (exponential correlation length; lex), show the slab layers to be 2.8 times smaller than the basal depth hoar. In situ measurements are used to parametrize the Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS3&a) and compare against collocated SnowSAR backscatter. The evaluation shows a scaling factor (ϕ) between 1.37 and 1.08, when applied to input of lex, minimizes MEMLS root mean squared error to <1.1 dB. Model sensitivity experiments demonstrate contrasting contributions from wind slab and depth hoar components, where wind rounded microstructures are identified as a strong control on observed backscatter. Weak sensitivity of SnowSAR to spatial variations in SWE is explained by the smaller contributing microstructures of the wind slab.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3adata collection 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3asnow 3asnowpack 3asurveys 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atundra 3auncertainty 3awind 0aSnow 0aSWE 0aRadar 0aSAR 0aTundra 0aArctic1 aDerksen, Chris1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6821-54791 aToose, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0591-74431 aLanglois, Alexandre1 aLarsen, Chris1 aLemmetyinen, Juha1 aMarsh, Phil1 aMontpetit, Benoit1 aRoy, Alexandre1 aRutter, Nick Ray,1 aSturm, Matthew0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2018 Sept. 15, v. 215 p.242-254dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2018.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245009300178300001400271520162800285592002801913650002701941650002601968650001401994650001002008650001402018650001402032650001602046650000902062650001702071650001302088650002402101650001002125653002302135653002302158653002702181653001902208700002902227700002802256700002702284773009602311856008502407852000902492655001202501IND60541549620221119115945.0190318e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054154962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2013.10.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuk̲h̲tār, T̤āriq,10aEvaluation of resistance to root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) in okra cultivars  ap. 25-30.  aThe root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita, is one of the major limiting factors affecting plant growth and yield causing an estimated $100 billion loss per year worldwide. Synthetic pesticides, though instantaneously effective, are usually prohibitively expensive, not readily available, may cause hazards to both man and livestock, and inflict injury to the environment. Notable among the alternatives to nematicides is the use of resistant cultivars which are inexpensive and eco-friendly. In the present studies, twelve okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L) cultivars were evaluated for their resistance against M. incognita under field conditions. Ten-day old okra plants of test cultivars were inoculated with 3000 freshly hatched second stage juveniles of M. incognita. The nematode caused reductions in various growth parameters of all the cultivars to varying levels over their respective controls. None of the cultivars was found completely resistant. The cultivar ‘Sharmeeli’ was highly susceptible as >100 galls were recorded on the roots. Sharmeeli also showed maximum reductions in growth among the cultivars evaluated. The cultivars Anmol and Sindha were susceptible with 71–100 galls. The cultivars Sabz Pari, Super Star, PMS-55 and PMS Beauty were moderately susceptible with 31–70 galls and comparatively less reductions in growth. Cultivars Sanam, Dikshah, Arka Anamika, Ikra-1 and Ikra-2 with 11–30 galls were rated as moderately resistant and showed less damage by the nematode as compared to susceptible cultivars and their planting could provide a useful tool to control root-knot nematodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbelmoschus esculentus 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3acultivars 3agalls 3ajuveniles 3alivestock 3anematicides 3aokra 3aplant growth 3aplanting 3aroot-knot nematodes 3aroots 0aRoot-knot nematode 0aVarietal screening 0aAbelmoschus esculentus 0aSusceptibility1 aHussain, Muhammad Arshad1 aKayani, Muhammad Zameer1 aAslam, Muhammad Naveed0 tCrop protection.g2014 Feb., v. 56 p.25-30dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2013.10.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245014300172300001300315520149400328592002801822650001101850650002501861650002101886650001301907650001401920650002101934650001401955650001601969650001501985653001402000653002202014653001202036653001602048653001402064700001402078700001402092700001602106700001402122700001302136773012202149856008202271852000902353655001202362IND60605892220221122162520.0180723e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060589222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2016.07.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShangguan, Yongming10aInvestigation of the inner corrosion layer formed in pulse electrodeposition coating on Mg-Sr alloy and corresponding degradation behavior  ap. 1-12.  aMagnesium-based metals are considered as promising biodegradable orthopedic implant materials due to their potentials of enhancing bone healing and reconstruction, and in vivo absorbable characteristic without second operation for removal. However, the rapid corrosion has limited their clinical applications. Ca-P coating by electrodeposition has been supposed to be effective to control the degradation rate and enhance the bioactivity. In this work, a brushite coating was fabricated on the Mg-Sr alloy by pulse electrodeposition (PED) to evaluate its efficacy for orthopedic application. Interestingly, an inner corrosion layer was observed between the PED coating and the alloy substrate. Meanwhile the results of in vitro immersion and electrochemical tests showed that the corrosion resistance of the coated alloy was undermined in comparison with the uncoated alloy. It was deduced that the existence of this corrosion layer was attributed to the worse corrosion performance of the alloy. The mechanism on formation of the inner corrosion layer and its influence on consequent degradation were analyzed. It can be concluded that the electrodeposition coating should be not suitable for those magnesium alloys with poor corrosion resistance such as the Mg-Sr alloy. More importantly, it should be noted that the process of coating formation combined with the nature of substrate alloy is important to evaluate the efficacy of coating for biodegradable Mg-based implants application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3abioactive properties 3abiodegradability 3acoatings 3acorrosion 3aelectrochemistry 3amagnesium 3aorthopedics 3aprostheses 0aMagnesium 0aElectrodeposition 0aCoating 0aDegradation 0aStrontium1 aWan, Peng1 aTan, Lili1 aFan, Xinmin1 aQin, Ling1 aYang, Ke0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 481 p.1-12dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2016.07.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02254naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245011100177300001400288520106500302592002801367650001801395650002401413650002601437650001901463650001801482650001101500650002401511650001501535650001701550653003001567653002301597653001601620653000801636653001201644700002001656773009001676856008101766852000901847655001201856IND60085821620221121023037.0160901e20130226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008582162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2012.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlexandrino, Guilherme L.10aNIR imaging spectroscopy for quantification of constituents in polymers thin films loaded with paracetamol  ap. 37-44.  aThin films loaded with the drug paracetamol were produced from polymer blends formed by hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and polyethyleneglycol (PEG), at various mass ratios of polymers and drug defined by a d-optimal experimental design. NIR hyperspectral images were obtained from each thin film formulation and the pixel-to-pixel quantification of the constituents were carried out by partial least square (PLS) and multivariate curve resolution–alternating least square (MCR-ALS) with three different calibration/validation strategies. These strategies differ in the way to construct the calibration and validation matrices and they had to be carried out to suppress the bias on the quantification of the constituents in the polymer blend. The errors of prediction in the models from MCR-ALS were influenced by the calibration/validation strategy employed, but they were similar to the ones from PLS model. Concentration distribution maps were built after pixel-to-pixel predictions and their characteristics were analyzed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3aexperimental design 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aimage analysis 3aleast squares 3amodels 3apolyethylene glycol 3aprediction 3aspectroscopy 0aNIR hyperspectral imaging 0aPolymer thin films 0aParacetamol 0aPLS 0aMCR-ALS1 aPoppi, Ronei J.0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2013 Feb. 26, v. 765 p.37-44dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2012.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01822naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245007200179300001600251520077900267592002801046650001101074650001101085650001801096650001601114650001901130653002901149653002501178653002001203653002001223653001701243700002101260773009701281856008501378852000901463655001201472IND60601546920221120120446.0200614e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060154692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2018.06.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHosseinipour, Sayed Amir10aComparison of the biogas upgrading methods as a transportation fuel  ap. 641-655.  aThe aim of this study is investigating and analyzing the water scrubbing, cryogenic separation, amine scrubbing and caustic wash biogas upgrading processes.

The results of this study indicate that although amine scrubbing process consumes less power but the required hot utility is higher than other upgrading methods. In the cryogenic process, high pressure operating condition needs high compression power. This process also needs low temperature refrigeration system.

The carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) doped nylon 6 (PA6) composite nanofibers (MWNTs–PA6) was prepared using electrospinning, which served as the nanosized backbone for pyrrole (Py) electropolymerization. The functional composite nanofibers (MWNTs–PA6–PPy) used as supporting scaffolds for ssDNA immobilization can dramatically increase the amount of DNA attachment and the hybridization sensitivity. The biosensor displayed good sensitivity and specificity. The target wild type p53 sequence (wtp53) can be detected as low as 50fM and the discrimination is up to 57.5% between the wtp53 and the mutant type p53 sequence (mtp53).

However, greenhouse gas (GHG) losses can offset the climatic benefits gained from C storage depending on how these tidal marshes are constructed and managed. This study attempts to determine the GHG emissions from a 4–6 year old created brackish marsh, what environmental factors governed these emissions, and how the magnitude of the fluxes relates to other wetland ecosystems. The static flux chamber method was used to measure GHG fluxes across three distinct plant zones segregated by elevation. The major of soil GHG fluxes from the marsh were from CO₂ (−48–192 mg C m⁻² h⁻¹), although it was near the lower end of values reported from other wetland types having lower salinities, and would mostly be offset by photosynthetic uptake in this created brackish marsh. Methane flux was also low (−0.33–0.86 mg C m⁻² h⁻¹), likely inhibited by the high soil SO₄ ²⁻ and soil redox potentials poised above −150 mV in this in this created brackish marsh environment. Low N₂O flux (−0.11–0.10 mg N m⁻² h⁻¹) was due to low soil NO₃ ⁻ and soil redox conditions favoring complete denitrification. GHG fluxes from this created brackish marsh were generally lower than those recorded from natural marshes, suggesting that C sequestration may not be offset by the radiative forcing from soil GHG emissions if projects are designed properly.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3adenitrification 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3amethane production 3anitrates 3anitrous oxide 3aphotosynthesis 3aradiative forcing 3aredox potential 3asalinity 3asalt marshes 3asoil 3asulfates 3aNorth Carolina1 aBurchell, Michael R.1 aKrauss, Ken W.1 aBirgand, Francois1 aBroome, Stephen W.0 tWetlands.g2016 Dec., v. 36, no. 6 p.1009-1024dSpringer Netherlandsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-016-0815-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03158naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245014500171300001600316520171800332592002802050650002102078650001302099650001402112650002502126650003002151650002802181650001702209650000902226650001302235650001102248650001002259653001902269653001802288653002202306653001202328653002502340653001902365700001502384700001602399700001802415700001702433700001802450773011302468856008602581852000902667655001202676IND60646713320221118041541.0200405e20191001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064671332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.06.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Shuaicheng12aA critical review of corrosion development and rust removal techniques on the structural/environmental performance of corroded steel bridges  ap. 126-146.  aCorrosion is one of the most severe threats to the stability of steel bridges and regular rust removal techniques is needed for the maintenance of steel bridges. Currently the correlation between rust development/removal process and the structural/environmental performance of the steel bridges has not been fully understood. This study intends to fill this knowledge gap through critically reviewing. The characteristic analysis of the rust on the corroded steel bridges was first introduced, which provided information that was needed to understand the corrosion mechanisms and classify the rust type. Then the related rust removal techniques (chemical and physical methods) are analyzed by considering the environmental impact and cleaning efficiency. Based on the discussion, the laser cleaning method is proposed due to its cleaning efficiency and environmentally friendliness. After that, the influence of developed rust (uniform and pitting) on the structural performance (static and dynamic) of steel members were summarized. Through the discussion, the potential environmental impact of the corroded steel bridges was identified, including runoff of heavy metal and bacteria growth caused by iron rust. Besides that, an improved kinetic model was proposed by considering the influence of rust removal on the corrosion rate. Furthermore, the structural impact of laser cleaning was simulated with the finite element analysis. This study will serve as solid base for the future studies of corrosion development and rust removal on steel bridges, and the proposed technical routes can be proceeded during future studies to better understand the environmental and structural performance of the steel bridges.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacterial growth 3acleaning 3acorrosion 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3afinite element analysis 3aheavy metals 3airon 3akinetics 3arunoff 3asteel 0aRust corrosion 0aSteel bridges 0aUniform corrosion 0aPitting 0aEnvironmental impact 0aLaser cleaning1 aSi, Ruizhe1 aDai, Qingli1 aYou, Zhanping1 aMa, Yunxiang1 aWang, Jiaqing0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Oct. 01, v. 233 p.126-146dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.06.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010100157500001900258520095500277592002801232650002801260650003101288650002901319650001501348650001301363650001701376650002001393650001501413650001001428650000901438650001901447650001601466650002601482700002701508700001901535700002401554700001801578700001401596700002701610700001501637700002001652773012601672856007401798852000901872655001201881IND60703232320221116180419.0200720e20200223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070323232DNAL7 a10.3390/md180201292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Xiaoqin 10aPolyketide Derivatives from Mangrove Derived Endophytic Fungus <i>Pseudopestalotiopsis theae</i>  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aChemical investigation of secondary metabolites from the endophytic fungus <i>Pseudopestalotiopsis theae</i> led to the isolation of eighteen new polyketide derivatives, pestalotheols I&ndash;Q (<b>1</b>&ndash;<b>9</b>) and cytosporins O&ndash;W (<b>15</b>&ndash;<b>23</b>), together with eight known analogs (<b>10</b>&ndash;<b>14</b> and <b>24</b>&ndash;<b>26</b>).

Numerous applications of insecticide were made, but papaya losses were severe and the pest spread to several other crops. The pest was identified in 2008 as the papaya mealybug Paracoccus marginatus Williams and Granara de Willink (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), and a classical biological control program was initiated. Three parasitoids, Acerophagus papayae Noyes and Schauff, Pseudleptomastix mexicana Noyes and Schauff, and Anagyrus loecki Noyes and Menezes (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), were imported from Puerto Rico in July 2010, and A. papayae was multiplied and released. Excellent control of the papaya mealybug was obtained within five months, pesticide usage was reduced, and production and income were increased. The purpose of this article is to quantify the economic benefits of this classical biological control program. The annual economic benefits for the five most important crops affected by the biocontrol program range from $121 million to $309 million, and the net present value of benefits over five years total $524 million to $1.34 billion. Implications are drawn for biological control programs in other countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarica papaya 3aparasitoids 3aincome 3apesticide application 3aAnagyrus 3afarmers 3acrops 3aParacoccus marginatus 3aeconomic impact 3abiological control 3aIndia 3aPuerto Rico 0aPapaya mealybug 0aHemiptera 0aEconomic benefits 0aClassical biocontrol1 aNorton, George W.1 aSelvaraj, K.N.1 aNatarajan, Kiruthika1 aMuniappan, R.0 tCrop protection.g2014 Feb., v. 56 p.82-86dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2013.10.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245008100166300001400247500002000261520161100281592002801892650002301920650002001943650001201963650003101975650001002006650001002016650001002026650002202036650001502058650001302073650001502086650002702101650002802128650002202156650002102178650001902199700001902218700002002237773013002257856007402387852000902461655001202470IND60589087520221121025725.0180202e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058908752DNAL7 a10.1111/phen.122202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl‐Wathiqui, Nooria10aMolecular dissection of nuptial gifts in divergent strains of Ostrinia moths  ap. 10-19.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSeminal fluid proteins (SFPs) produced in the male accessory glands and ejaculatory duct are subject to strong sexual selection, often evolve rapidly and therefore may play a key role in reproductive isolation and species formation. However, little is known about reproductive proteins for species in which males transfer ejaculate to females using a spermatophore package. By combining RNA sequencing and proteomics, we characterize putative SFPs, identify proteins transferred in the male spermatophore and identify candidate genes contributing to a one‐way gametic incompatibility between Z and E strains of the European corn borer moth Ostrinia nubilalis. We find that the accessory glands and ejaculatory duct secrete over 200 highly expressed gene products, including peptidases, peptidase regulators and odourant‐binding proteins. A comparison between Ostrinia strains reveals that accessory gland and ejaculatory duct sequences with hormone degradation and peptidase activity are among the most extremely differentially expressed. However, most spermatophore peptides lack reproductive tissue bias or canonical secretory signal motifs and aproximately one‐quarter may be produced elsewhere before being sequestered by the male accessory glands during spermatophore production. In addition, most potential gene candidates for postmating reproductive isolation do not meet standard criteria for predicted SFPs and almost three‐quarters are novel, suggesting that both postmating sexual interactions and gametic isolation likely involve molecular products beyond traditionally recognized SFPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOstrinia nubilalis 3aenzyme activity 3afemales 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amales 3amoths 3aodorant receptors 3apeptidases 3apeptides 3aproteomics 3areproductive isolation 3aseminal plasma proteins 3asequence analysis 3asexual selection 3aspermatophores1 aLewis, Sara M.1 aDopman, Erik B.0 tPhysiological entomology.g2018 Mar., v. 43, no. 1 p.10-19dThe Royal Entomological SocietywJournal:jnl6908x0307-69627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/phen.122203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03444naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002200165245011900187300001800306520167100324592002801995650001102023650002002034650001702054650001902071650001802090650001702108650001002125650002202135650002502157650001202182650002202194650003102216650001602247650001002263650002002273650003002293650004202323650001802365650001102383650001002394650001102404650000902415650001602424650002002440650002602460650001902486650002802505700002302533700003202556700001902588700001802607773012602625856008202751852000902833655001202842IND4491790820221118093259.0141111e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449179082DNAL7 a225750722pmid7 a10.1016/j.jand.2012.02.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaynor, Hollie A.14aThe Effects of an Energy Density Prescription on Diet Quality and Weight Loss: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial  ap. 1397-1402.  aDietary goals specific for lowering energy density (ED) may promote a nutrient-dense diet and weight loss. This pilot study examined the effects of ED-based diet prescriptions on diet quality and weight loss during a 3-month behavior-based obesity intervention conducted in a research setting. Forty-four adults with overweight/obesity (age 52.1±7.6 years, body mass index [BMI; calculated as kg/m²] 34.8±4.8, 81.8% women, and 93.2% white) were recruited between December 2009 and March 2010 and randomly assigned to: Low ED (consume ≥10 foods ≤1.0 kcal/g dietary ED and ≤2 foods ≥3.0 kcal/g dietary ED per day (n=15); Low-Energy, Low-Fat (1,200 to 1,500 kcal/day, ≤30% energy from fat (n=15); or Low-ED, Low-Energy, Low-Fat (n=14). Participants received 12 weekly group sessions led by a research interventionist. Dietary intake (measured by 3-day food records), self-reported physical activity, and weight were measured at baseline and 3 months. Intent-to-treat analyses showed all conditions reduced dietary ED and energy intake (P<0.001). Low-ED and Low-ED, Low-Energy, Low-Fat interventions increased fruit consumption (P<0.05). All conditions increased self-reported physical activity (P<0.001), with no difference between conditions. Although participants in all conditions lost weight (P<0.001), those in the Low-ED condition lost more (P<0.05) than those in the Low-ED, Low-Energy, Low-Fat condition (Low-ED −20.5±7.0 lb, Low-Energy, Low-Fat −16.9±10.1 lb, and Low-ED, Low-Energy, Low-Fat −12.5± 6.5 lb). A diet prescription that lowered ED increased fruit intake and enhanced weight loss compared with other weight loss prescriptions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abody mass index 3adiet therapy 3aenergy density 3aenergy intake 3afood records 3afoods 3afruit consumption 3anutritional adequacy 3aobesity 3aphysical activity 3arandomized clinical trials 3aweight loss 3awomen 2aBody Mass Index 2aDiet, Reducingxstandards 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aFruit 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutritive Value 2aObesityxdiet therapy 2aPilot Projects 2aWeight Lossxphysiology1 aLooney, Shannon M.1 aSteeves, Elizabeth Anderson1 aSpence, Marsha1 aGorin, Amy A.0 tJournal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.g2012 Sept., v. 112, no. 9 p.1397-1402dElsevier Inc.x2212-26727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2012.02.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03582naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245016200164300001600326520196300342592002802305650002602333650001902359650002102378650002202399650001402421650001402435650002902449650001502478650001502493650002202508650002002530650002402550650001902574650002802593650002002621651001002641653000702651653000702658653000702665653001002672653002502682653002202707653002202729653002702751653003602778653001202814700001802826773010102844856008602945852000903031655001203040IND60635246520221119203056.0190410e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063524652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.03.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yi12aA bibliometric analysis of comparative research on the evolution of international and Chinese ecological footprint research hotspots and frontiers since 2000  ap. 650-665.  aThe ecological footprint (EF) methodology, which is a tool for evaluating the natural resource use level and regional carrying capacity, has been extensively used to measure the capacity to reach both an ecological supply and demand balance and a level of sustainable development. In this study, to systematically sort and analyse the distribution of EF research, its hot areas and the evolution of its fronts, papers with “ecological footprint” as the subject term in the Web of Science Core Collection Database and the China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database Core Journals since 2000 are visually analysed using CiteSpace. The characteristics of these papers, including the quantity trend, quality, author group, affiliated institution type and journal type, are summarized, and keyword co-appearance and paper co-citation knowledge maps are produced. The results show the following: (1) Chinese researchers have been closely following international research fronts and steadily improving their research results. (2) Hotspots such as carbon dioxide emissions, the carbon footprint (CF), water footprint (WF) and sustainable use have been receiving attention both in China and internationally. International researchers focus on hot topics such as public satisfaction, land and resource use, spatial equity and policy analysis. In comparison, Chinese researchers prefer to modify and improve relevant methods, such as the three-dimensional EF (3D EF) and footprint family methods. (3) The research frontier of EF is based on improving the EF accounting method, which is aimed at assessing and monitoring the relationship between ecology and the economic society on a multi-scale basis, establishing an index system that can evaluate the demand for natural resources and environmental pressure, and explore the issues of mechanisms of regional ecology resource allocation fairness, and market-led and government-led ecological governance efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3abibliometric analysis 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon footprint 3acarrying capacity 3adatabases 3aemissions 3aenvironmental indicators 3agovernance 3amonitoring 3anatural resources 3apolicy analysis 3aresource allocation 3asupply balance 3asustainable development 3awater footprint 3aChina 0aEF 0aCF 0aWF 0a3D EF 0aEcological footprint 0aKnowledge mapping 0aResearch hotspots 0aEvolution of frontiers 0aDerek John de Solla Price curve 0aX index1 aMeng, Guanfei0 tEcological indicators.g2019 July, v. 102 p.650-665dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.03.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245016300167300001400330520128500344592002801629650002701657650002301684650001801707650002301725650001501748650003201763650001101795650001501806650002001821650001301841650001101854653001401865653001501879653001601894653001101910653002701921653001501948700002201963700002901985700001802014700001602032700001702048700002202065773009602087856008502183852000902268655001202277IND60541550220221119233019.0190318e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054155022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2013.10.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorza, Tudor10aIon chromatography analysis of phosphite uptake and translocation by potato plants: Dose-dependent uptake and inhibition of Phytophthora infestans development  ap. 74-81.  aPhosphite-based fungicides are increasingly used to control fungi-like plant pathogens from the Oomycetes group. A rapid, precise, and cost-effective suppressed conductivity high performance ion chromatography (HPIC) method was developed to assess the concentrations of soluble phosphites (Phi) and phosphates (Pi) in plant samples. This technique was used to determine the amount of Phi and Pi in leaves and tubers of potato plants following foliar applications of the Phi-based fungicide Confine™. High amounts of Phi were determined in both leaves and tubers indicating that potato plants efficiently uptake and translocate the fungicide. The number of applications of Confine™ and its concentration were found to be directly proportional with the amount of Phi detected in potato plants and inversely proportional with the development of Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary in these plants. Levels of Phi comparable to those determined in plants were found to strongly inhibit the growth of P. infestans in vitro. The simultaneous estimation of the in planta Phi concentration and of the sensitivity of P. infestans to Phi represent the most comprehensive approach of assessing the efficacy of Phi-based fungicides in controlling late blight development in potatoes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytophthora infestans 3acost effectiveness 3adose response 3afoliar application 3afungicides 3aion exchange chromatography 3aleaves 3aphosphates 3aplant pathogens 3apotatoes 3atubers 0aPhosphite 0aFungitoxic 0aLate blight 0aPotato 0aPhytophthora infestans 0aConfine™1 aSchofield, Andrew1 aSakthivel, Geethalakshmi1 aBergese, John1 aGao, Xingxi1 aRand, Jennie1 aWang-Pruski, Gefu0 tCrop protection.g2014 Feb., v. 56 p.74-81dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2013.10.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245016800164300001400332520146000346592002801806650001801834650001301852650001401865650001901879650001601898650002101914650002101935650002501956650002101981650001502002650002502017650002602042650001302068650002202081653003202103653003002135653002002165653002702185653002502212653002402237700001502261700002102276700002302297700001702320773012002337856008102457852000902538655001202547IND60623002320221123041903.0181127e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062300232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2018.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Zhenzhen10aDynamic membrane bioreactor performance enhancement by powdered activated carbon addition: Evaluation of sludge morphological, aggregative and microbial properties  ap. 73-83.  aThe effects of powdered activated carbon (PAC) addition on sludge morphological, aggregative and microbial properties in a dynamic membrane bioreactor (DMBR) were investigated to explore the enhancement mechanism of pollutants removal and filtration performance. Sludge properties were analyzed through various analytical measurements. The results showed that the improved sludge aggregation ability and the evolution of microbial communities affected sludge morphology in PAC-DMBR, as evidenced by the formation of large, regularly shaped and strengthened sludge flocs. The modifications of sludge characteristics promoted the formation process and filtration flux of the dynamic membrane (DM) layer. Additionally, PAC addition did not exert very significant influence on the propagation of eukaryotes (protists and metazoans) and microbial metabolic activity. High-throughput pyrosequencing results indicated that adding PAC improved the bacterial diversity in activated sludge, as PAC addition brought about additional microenvironment in the form of biological PAC (BPAC), which promoted the enrichment of Acinetobacter (13.9%), Comamonas (2.9%), Flavobacterium (0.31%) and Pseudomonas (0.62%), all contributing to sludge flocs formation and several (such as Acinetobacter) capable of biodegrading relatively complex organics. Therefore, PAC addition could favorably modify sludge properties from various aspects and thus enhance the DMBR performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aAnimalia 3aComamonas 3aFlavobacterium 3aPseudomonas 3aactivated carbon 3aactivated sludge 3abiochemical pathways 3aeukaryotic cells 3afiltration 3amembrane bioreactors 3amicrobial communities 3aprotists 3asequence analysis 0aDynamic membrane bioreactor 0aPowdered activated carbon 0aSludge property 0aFiltration performance 0aWastewater treatment 0aMicrobial community1 aHu, Yisong1 aDzakpasu, Mawuli1 aWang, Xiaochang C.1 aNgo, Huu Hao0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2019 Jan., v. 75 p.73-83dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2018.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01869naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002200169245009600191300001800287520075000305592002801055650003101083650002001114650001801134650001001152650000901162650002001171650004401191700002201235700002001257700002401277700002001301773009101321856008601412852000901498655001201507IND4459980320221123003635.0141111e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445998032DNAL7 a252123412pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.05.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimamura, Tomoko10aDemonstration of the presence of aminoreductone formed during the Maillard reaction in milk  ap. 1088-1092.  aThe Maillard reaction is a common chemical reaction that occurs in food and it generates multiple reaction products. Aminoreductone (AR) is one of the early-stage Maillard reaction products. At present the formation of AR has only been demonstrated in a model system consisting of a monosaccharide or disaccharide and an amino group-containing compound. There is no direct evidence to show the presence of AR in food. In this study, we demonstrated the formation and presence of AR in milk using a combination of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNP) and Cu²⁺. A DNP derivative of AR oxidised by Cu²⁺ was isolated and its detailed structure was identified by NMR analysis. We thus directly demonstrated the formation and presence of AR in milk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaillard reaction products 3aamino compounds 3adisaccharides 3afoods 3amilk 3amonosaccharides 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy1 aKurogi, Yoshikazu1 aKatsuno, Shinya1 aKashiwagi, Takehiro1 aUkeda, Hiroyuki0 tFood chemistry.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 129, no. 3 p.1088-1092dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.05.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245014100157300001800298520132600316592002801642650001501670650002101685650001501706650000901721650001901730650001501749650001101764700002001775700002101795773011201816856007501928852000902003655001202012IND60529097020221120144320.0160717e20120904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052909702DNAL7 a10.1021/ac30150922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoda, Tatsuro10aSimultaneous Monitoring of Protein Adsorption Kinetics Using a Quartz Crystal Microbalance and Field-Effect Transistor Integrated Device  ap. 7308-7314.  aWe developed an integrated device comprising a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and a field-effect transistor (FET) with a single common gold electrode in a flow chamber. An alternating current inducing oscillations in the piezoelectric quartz of the QCM sensor is electrically independent of the circuit for the FET output so that the two sensors in different detection mechanisms simultaneously record binding kinetics from a single protein solution on the same electrode. A conjunction of adsorbed mass from QCM with electric nature of bound protein from FET provided deeper understanding on a complex process of nonspecific protein adsorption and subsequent conformational changes at a solid/liquid interface. Lower apparent kₒₙ values obtained by FET than those obtained by QCM on hydrophobic surfaces are interpreted as preferred binding of protein molecules facing uncharged domains to the electrode surface, whereas higher kₒff values by FET than those by QCM imply active macromolecular rearrangements on the surfaces mainly driven by hydrophobic association in an aqueous medium. The advanced features of the combined sensor including in situ, label-free, and real-time monitoring provide information on structural dynamics, beyond measurements of affinities and kinetics in biological binding reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abinding proteins 3aelectrodes 3agold 3ahydrophobicity 3amonitoring 3aquartz1 aMaeda, Yasuhiro1 aMiyahara, Yūji,0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2012 Sept. 04, v. 84, no. 17 p.7308-7314dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac30150923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013500168300001400303520164500317592002801962650001701990650001002007650002102017650001202038650001402050650001602064650000902080650001602089650001502105650001402120650000902134650001902143650001802162650001202180653001602192653001602208653002202224653001402246700001802260700001402278700001902292700002002311773009602331856008502427852000902512655001202521IND60541550320221119232732.0190318e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054155032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2013.10.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Qian-Qian10aEffects of cabergoline on the fertility of female mice during early and late pregnancy, and potential for its use in mouse control  ap. 69-73.  aTo evaluate the dose effects of cabergoline on the fertility of female mice during early or late pregnancy, cabergoline was continuously administered by gastrogavage for three days within 1 day to 3 day or 15 day to 17 day of gestation. The body mass, reproductive rate, litter size at birth and weaning of females, as well as the body mass, survival rate of pups, were recorded. During early pregnancy, cabergoline treatment effectively terminated the pregnancy of mice. Cabergoline (100μg/kg) was half effective in terminating pregnancy and significantly reduced the average litter size and survival rate of pups compared with those of the controls. Cabergoline treatment of 200 and 400μg/kg completely terminated pregnancy of mice and induced incomplete restoration of fertility (40% and 44%, respectively) even at the second cycle of reproduction. During late pregnancy, cabergoline did not change the litter size at birth but significantly reduced the litter size at weaning and the survival rate of pups, 400μg/kg cabergoline markedly reduced the survival rate to 77% compared with the controls. The death of pups mainly occurred during seven days after parturition. Cabergoline had no significant difference on the average body mass of surviving pups in treated groups compared with controls during lactation. In conclusion, cabergoline may inhibit or reduce the reproduction of female mice, and demonstrate different dose effects on the fertility during early or late pregnancy. Together with infertility efficacy in phase prior to mating and lactation, cabergoline is a potential fertility control agent for pest rodent control.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirth weight 3adeath 3afemale fertility 3afemales 3alactation 3alitter size 3amice 3aparturition 3apesticides 3apregnancy 3apups 3arodent control 3asurvival rate 3aweaning 0aCabergoline 0aFemale mice 0aFertility control 0aPregnancy1 aXiang, Zuo-Fu1 aQin, Jiao1 aGuo, Ming-Fang1 aLiu, Quan-Sheng0 tCrop protection.g2014 Feb., v. 56 p.69-73dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2013.10.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003500140245009100175300001400266500002000280520131300300592002801613650002001641650001901661650001401680650001701694650001101711650001301722650001601735650002101751650001501772650001301787650001301800650001201813650002101825650001001846700002101856700003301877700002501910700002401935773013001959856007402089852000902163655001202172IND60589087720221120164650.0180202e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058908772DNAL7 a10.1111/phen.122302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrios‐Sanmartín, Joceline10aProteomic profile of aphids exposed to wheat with different contents of benzoxazinoids  ap. 69-76.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBenzoxazinoids are key defence chemicals in cereals that are known to affect several aspects of aphid biology. However, little is known about how they affect aphid physiology. In the present study, we report changes in the whole‐body proteomic profiles of a 2,4‐dihydroxy‐7‐methoxy‐1,4‐benzoxazin‐3‐one (DIMBOA)‐susceptible genotype of the grain aphid Sitobion avenae (F.) after being exposed to wheat cultivars containing contrasting levels of DIMBOA. The proteome is analyzed after 14 days (short term) and 28 days (long term) of rearing on these cultivars. Seventy‐two proteins are differentially regulated among the treatments and 49 are identified. Exposure to high‐DIMBOA plants results in a higher number of proteins regulated long term. DIMBOA exposure in S. avenae initially generates greater cellular activities, mostly involving cytoskeleton function and possibly related to detoxification. This function appears to be unimportant at long term and is eventually replaced by effects on metabolism function and homeostasis. Taken together, the results of the present study show that the responses of aphids to the secondary plant compounds, such as DIMBOA, exhibit a temporal dynamic in the proteome, possibly helping aphids to overcome the effect of these toxic compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSitobion avenae 3abenzoxazinoids 3acultivars 3acytoskeleton 3adimboa 3agenotype 3ahomeostasis 3ahydroxamic acids 3ametabolism 3aproteins 3aproteome 3arearing 3atoxic substances 3awheat1 aBosquée, Emilie1 aRubio‐Meléndez, María E.1 aRamírez, Claudio C.1 aFrancis, Frédéric0 tPhysiological entomology.g2018 Mar., v. 43, no. 1 p.69-76dThe Royal Entomological SocietywJournal:jnl6908x0307-69627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/phen.122303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008000166300001600246520125100262592002801513650002201541650001201563650001001575650001901585650001301604650001101617650001301628650002501641650000901666650001301675650001201688650001401700650001201714650001101726650002301737650001301760651001001773700001501783700002101798700001601819700001701835700001501852700001801867773010701885856005101992852000902043655001202052IND50075029720221122040722.0140410e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007502972DNAL7 a10.1080/00071668.2011.6403062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMishra, SK,10aInheritance of plumage colour variations in a large flock of Japanese quail  ap. 686-693.  a1. The inheritance of various plumage colour variants and their underlying interactions were investigated in a large flock of Japanese quail maintained at CARI (India) by conducting reciprocal crosses between four breeding stocks inheriting Pharaoh, White Breasted, White and Brown plumages, followed by test crosses.2. Based on the proportion of plumage-colour types in the progeny, putative genotypes were determined for parents and offspring for each of the crosses.3. The White and Brown phenotypes were attributed to the Panda (S) and Roux (Br) loci respectively in agreement with contemporary quail stocks.4. The White Breasted plumage type present in our stock was caused by a novel mutation with dominant gene action at an autosomal locus that was not allelic to either Panda or the White feather locus.5. A recessive epistatic action of the Panda locus (S) on White Breasted (Wb) resulted in a White colour phenotype.6. A novel phenotype, White Breasted-Brown was co-expressed with the Br and Wb loci.7. It was concluded that breeding for customized feather colour phenotypes in Japanese quail using colour mutations was feasible and would be advantageous in order to overcome the limitations of legislation to protect wildlife in India.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoturnix japonica 3abromine 3acolor 3adominant genes 3afeathers 3aflocks 3agenotype 3alaws and regulations 3aloci 3amutation 3aparents 3aphenotype 3aprogeny 3aquails 3areciprocal crosses 3awildlife 3aIndia1 aKhan, A.A.1 aNārāʼin Rāj,1 aSingh, S.P.1 aPratap, S.O.1 aSaxena, D.1 aChaudhuri, D.0 tBritish poultry science.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 52, no. 6 p.686-693dTaylor & Francis Groupx1466-17997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00071668.2011.640306  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010900168300001600277520112500293592002801418650004401446650002101490650001601511650002001527650001701547650001801564650001901582650001301601650003301614650001101647650002101658650003701679650002101716653004101737653002001778653001601798653001801814653004201832700001701874700001901891700001801910700001401928700001501942773012501957856008202082852000902164655001202173IND60605892920221121145220.0180723e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060589292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2016.07.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Cheng-bin10aPhotoresponsive hollow molecularly imprinted polymer for the determination of trace bisphenol A in water  ap. 236-244.  aA photoresponsive hollow molecularly imprinted polymer (PHMIP) was fabricated for photoresponsive recognition and determination of trace bisphenol A (BPA) in aqueous media using a water-soluble azo compound as the functional monomer. The PHMIP was prepared on sacrificial silica microspheres by surface imprinting and subsequent removal of the silica core. The PHMIP displayed photocontrolled recognition for BPA. SEM, TEM, FT-IR, TGA and N2 adsorption-desorption analyses confirmed successful formation of the hollow structure. The PHMIP displayed higher binding capacity, a larger specific area, and faster mass transfer rate than its corresponding surface molecularly imprinted polymer. The PHMIP was used to determine trace BPA in real samples with a limit of detection of 0.5ppm. For samples spiked at 0–10ppm, the BPA recoveries were in the range of 93.0%–99.0%. This PHMIP-based method provides convenient and inexpensive detection method for trace BPA in environmental samples. This method is especially suitable for determining materials that do not possess specific spectroscopic or luminescent properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abinding capacity 3abisphenol A 3adetection limit 3aluminescence 3amass transfer 3amicroparticles 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awater solubility 0aHollow molecularly imprinted polymer 0aPhotoresponsive 0aBisphenol A 0aHigh-capacity 0aSurface molecularly imprinted polymer1 aYang, Yu-zhu1 aYang, Yue-hong1 aZheng, An-xun1 aLiu, Song1 aTang, Qian0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 481 p.236-244dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2016.07.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02517naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245010600171300001600277520127700293592002801570650003001598650001201628650001901640650001001659650002401669650002101693650001501714650000901729650002501738650001601763653001801779653002901797653002401826653001601850653002801866700002301894773009401917856008702011852000902098655001202107IND60084123920221119031329.0161027e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008412392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2012.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeslop, David10aCalculating uncertainties on predictions of palaeoprecipitation from the magnetic properties of soils  ap. 379-385.  aQuantitative predictions of past climate states based on calibrated proxy data are key to the reconstruction of palaeoenvironments and are essential for climate model validation. Magnetic climofunctions have been used to make predictions concerning past climates based on soil magnetic mineral assemblages. For example, detailed time series of Quaternary mean annual precipitation and palaeoprecipitation gradients across wide geographic regions have been predicted from the rock magnetic properties of Chinese loess and palaeosol units. Quantitative prediction requires full assessment of the uncertainties associated with predictions. However, little attention has been given to this important aspect of climofunction prediction. We present an analysis of an ensemble of published rock magnetic climofunctions and estimate the uncertainty of the associated predictions. We find that existing climofunctions have associated uncertainties that are so large that their subsequent predictions are effectively invalid. Thus, palaeoprecipitation reconstructions must be treated with extreme caution. In the future climofunctions that are constrained geologically through the inclusion of theoretical models of soil development may provide predictions with lower uncertainties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3aloess 3amagnetic properties 3amodel validation 3aprediction 3asoil 3atime series analysis 3auncertainty 0aclimofunction 0adiscrimination intervals 0apalaeoprecipitation 0apedogenesis 0amagnetic susceptibility1 aRoberts, Andrew P.0 tGlobal and Planetary Change.g2013 Nov., v. 110 p.379-385dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2012.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003600151245010400187300001800291520122600309592002801535650001401563650000901577650002001586650001701606650001301623653002301636653003401659653002801693653003301721700002001754700001801774773011601792856008601908852000901994655001202003IND60646713920221118041457.0190725e20190920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064671392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.06.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Fabíola Negreiros de10aEnvironmental risk management in supply chains: A taxonomy, a framework and future research avenues  ap. 1257-1271.  aRisk management in supply chains has emerged as one of the most attractive research topics in the supply chain management field. However, much more is still needed towards hedging against environmental risks. The recent environmental scandals and accidents bring to light the negligence of the environmental issues by supply chains. The present study analyses both external and internal factors of environmental risk and their impact on supply chain management, as well as the mitigation strategies through the literature study. Thus, by conducting a systematic literature review and after analysing 767 abstracts and 70 full papers, we identify fourteen environmental risks, three main consequences and nineteen strategies to manage these risks. As a result, we develop an Environmental Supply Chain Risk Management taxonomy, which covers the existing body of knowledge on the topic. Moreover, a framework is also proposed to synthesise and relate the environmental risks, consequences and strategies covered by the academic research. Finally, we provide a research agenda to support future works on environmental supply chain risk management, building foundations towards the formalisation and improvement of the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3arisk 3arisk management 3asupply chain 3ataxonomy 0aEnvironmental risk 0aEnvironmental risk management 0aSupply chain management 0aSystematic literature review1 aLeiras, Adriana1 aCeryno, Paula0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Sept. 20, v. 232 p.1257-1271dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.06.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04035naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100006800166245012900234300001800363520161300381592002801994650001102022650001002033650002002043650002802063650001802091650000902109650001602118650001602134650002602150650001202176650002702188650002902215650001002244650003102254650001302285650002402298650001602322653001502338653002702353653002502380700002602405700001502431700002002446700002502466700002002491700002202511700002102533700002302554700003002577700002702607700002002634700002102654700002702675700002202702700002602724700003502750700001902785700001902804700002102823700002202844700002202866700002302888700002402911700001802935700002202953700002402975700002202999773013003021856008103151852000903232655001203241IND60655624120221118002016.0190803e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065562412DNAL7 a274991872pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800160019322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLivingstone, Katherine M1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9682-754110aClustering of adherence to personalised dietary recommendations and changes in healthy eating index within the Food4Me study  ap. 3296-3305.  aTo characterise clusters of individuals based on adherence to dietary recommendations and to determine whether changes in Healthy Eating Index (HEI) scores in response to a personalised nutrition (PN) intervention varied between clusters. Food4Me study participants were clustered according to whether their baseline dietary intakes met European dietary recommendations. Changes in HEI scores between baseline and month 6 were compared between clusters and stratified by whether individuals received generalised or PN advice. Pan-European, Internet-based, 6-month randomised controlled trial. Adults aged 18–79 years (n 1480). Individuals in cluster 1 (C1) met all recommended intakes except for red meat, those in cluster 2 (C2) met two recommendations, and those in cluster 3 (C3) and cluster 4 (C4) met one recommendation each. C1 had higher intakes of white fish, beans and lentils and low-fat dairy products and lower percentage energy intake from SFA (P<0·05). C2 consumed less chips and pizza and fried foods than C3 and C4 (P<0·05). C1 were lighter, had lower BMI and waist circumference than C3 and were more physically active than C4 (P<0·05). More individuals in C4 were smokers and wanted to lose weight than in C1 (P<0·05). Individuals who received PN advice in C4 reported greater improvements in HEI compared with C3 and C1 (P<0·05). The cluster where the fewest recommendations were met (C4) reported greater improvements in HEI following a 6-month trial of PN whereas there was no difference between clusters for those randomised to the Control, non-personalised dietary intervention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abeans 3abody mass index 3adietary recommendations 3aenergy intake 3afish 3afood intake 3afried foods 3ahealthy eating habits 3alentils 3alow fat dairy products 3anutritional intervention 3apizza 3arandomized clinical trials 3ared meat 3awaist circumference 3aweight loss 0aClustering 0aPersonalised nutrition 0aHealthy Eating Index1 aCelis-Morales, Carlos1 aLara, Jose1 aWoolhead, Clara1 aO’Donovan, Clare B1 aForster, Hannah1 aMarsaux, Cyril FM1 aMacready, Anna L1 aFallaize, Rosalind1 aNavas-Carretero, Santiago1 aSan-Cristobal, Rodrigo1 aKolossa, Silvia1 aTsirigoti, Lydia1 aLambrinou, Christina P1 aMoschonis, George1 aSurwiłło, Agnieszka1 aDrevon, C.

Females from the selected colony were paired with males of the control colony and vice versa to create both a selected female by control male colony (Sel') and control female by selected male colony (Con'). Both colonies along with their parental colonies (eCry3.1Ab-selected and control) were evaluated on eCry3.1Ab-expressing corn and it’s near isoline in greenhouse experiments, seedling assays in growth chambers, and diet toxicity assays with increasing doses eCry3.1Ab being applied to the surface of artificial diet for western corn rootworm larvae. Statistical analysis of larval recovery, adult recovery, and plant root damage in greenhouse experiments showed no significant colony × corn interaction but did show a significant main effect of corn type. Similar results were seen for larvae recovery from the seedling assays with only a significant main effect of corn type being found. Results from the diet toxicity assays showed the control colony to have a significantly lower LC50 value than the selected and cross colonies and a significantly lower EC50 than the selected and Con' colonies. Calculations of dominance values (h) of eCry3.1Ab resistance traits from seedling assays indicated that the two reciprocal cross colonies to have a dominance value (h) of approximately 1, suggesting dominance of the eCry3.1Ab resistance trait. Data from these experiments help to showcase how eCry3.1Ab resistance traits can be transferred between resistant and susceptible western corn rootworms. 3aDiabrotica virgifera virgifera 3aZea mays 3aadults 3aartificial diets 3acorn 3afemales 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agrowth chambers 3ainsecticide resistance 3alarvae 3alethal concentration 50 3amales 3aprogeny 3arearing 3areciprocal crosses 3arootworms 3aseedlings 3astatistical analysis 3atoxicity1 aEllersieck, Mark R.1 aHibbard, Bruce0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2016 Apr., v. 109, no. 2 p.815-820dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/622993Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/tov3353Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Geisert%20et%20al.%202016%20JEE.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015700168300001400325520098000339592002801319650002501347650002101372650002001393650001301413650002001426650002301446650002201469650002001491650001401511650002101525650001301546650001501559650003201574650002501606650002201631650001101653653002101664653001301685653002201698653001801720653002501738700001301763700001301776700001401789700001301803700001201816773009601828856008501924852000902009655001202018IND60541547920221119114124.0190318e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054154792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2013.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jiaping10aCombination effect of chitosan and methyl jasmonate on controlling Alternaria alternata and enhancing activity of cherry tomato fruit defense mechanisms  ap. 31-36.  aThe effect of chitosan treatment alone or in combination with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) against Alternaria alternata in vitro and in vivo, and defense related enzyme activities were investigated. 100–500 μl/l MeJA significantly inhibited mycelial growth of A. alternata. The inhibitory activity of MeJA on mycelial growth, spore production, spore germination and germ tube length of A. alternata in vitro could be enhanced by 0.1% chitosan. The combination of 0.1% chitosan and 500 μl/l methyl jasmonate was more effective to reduce the disease incidence and lesion diameter of postharvest decay of cherry tomato than the application of MeJA or chitosan alone.

This work indicated that the combination of chitosan and methyl jasmonate is a promising method to control postharvest decays of fruit and vegetables.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria alternata 3acatechol oxidase 3acherry tomatoes 3achitosan 3acontrol methods 3adefense mechanisms 3adisease incidence 3aenzyme activity 3agerm tube 3amethyl jasmonate 3amycelium 3aperoxidase 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3apostharvest diseases 3aspore germination 3aspores 0aMethyl jasmonate 0aChitosan 0aPostharvest decay 0aCherry tomato 0aAlternaria alternata1 aZou, Xin1 aLiu, Qin1 aWang, Fei1 aFeng, Wu1 aWan, Na0 tCrop protection.g2014 Feb., v. 56 p.31-36dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2013.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03359naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245013600165300001600301500001900317520152900336536018901865592002802054650001702082650002602099650001102125650002002136650001002156650001302166650001502179650001202194650002302206650001602229650001502245650001402260650001402274653001502288653002402303653000902327653000802336653001902344700001802363700001502381700002802396700001602424700001802440700001502458700001602473700001802489700002002507700001502527700001702542773011602559856008502675852000902760655001202769IND60729874520221122031316.0210303e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072987452DNAL7 a10.1080/01490451.2020.18229582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Lei10aDominant and Active Methanogens in the Production Waters From a High-Temperature Petroleum Reservoir by DNA- and RNA-Based Analysis  ap. 191-198.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMethane metabolism in deep subsurface petroleum reservoirs is of paramount interest in the global biogeochemical cycle of carbon. Methanogenesis in such habitats is driven mostly by methanogens in syntrophic association with bacteria. In the present study, methanogenic communities in production water samples from six wells of a high-temperature petroleum reservoir were analyzed based on both genomic 16S rDNA and metabolically active 16S rRNA. The PCR-amplified mcrA gene analysis showed that Methanosaeta (26%) and Methanomassiliicoccus (56%) were separately the dominant members in sample W2_71 and W9_18 at the DNA level. In comparison, the RNA-based analysis showed that Methanosaeta (63 ∼ 83%) followed by Methanolinea (16 ∼ 23%) were the most active methanogens, which were different from the communities of genomic DNA. While several lines of studies indicated that CO₂-reducing methanogens of the genus Methanothermobacter was the most frequently detected phylotype in deep-subsurface petroleum reservoirs. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed the possible correlation between active methanogens (Methanosaeta) and environmental factors (CO₃ ²⁻). The datasets indicated the importance of investigating methanogenic community by integrating DNA- and RNA-based approaches. These results provide new insight into active methanogens in high-temperature petroleum reservoirs, and promote a comprehensive understanding of methanogens as well as their potential methanogenic pathways in such environments.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [No. 41403066], and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [No. 222201414029].  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethanosaeta 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon 3adata collection 3agenes 3agenomics 3ametabolism 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3aoil fields 3apetroleum 3aphylotype 0aMethanogen 0apetroleum reservoir 0amcrA 0aRNA 0amethanogenesis1 aHu, Qian-Qian1 aLu, Yu-Wei1 aMbadinga, Serge Maurice1 aLiu, Yi-Fan1 aLi, Xiao-Xiao1 aWang, Biao1 aLv, Hongmei1 aLiu, Jin-Feng1 aYang, Shi-Zhong1 aGu, J.-D.,1 aMu, Bo-Zhong0 tGeomicrobiology journal.g2021 Mar. 1, v. 38, no. 3 p.191-198dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12314x1521-05297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490451.2020.18229583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245012200159300001800281520174200299592002802041650001902069650001902088650001602107650003202123650002402155650001002179650002102189650001502210650000902225650001602234650004302250650002502293650001802318650002902336650003602365650003202401700001802433700001502451700001502466700001702481773011502498856008102613852000902694655001202703IND60573591220221121062341.0170724e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057359122DNAL7 a10.1007/s11626-016-0068-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Xin10aInhibition of Runx2 signaling by TNF-α in ST2 murine bone marrow stromal cells undergoing osteogenic differentiation  ap. 1026-1033.  aTumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) inhibits osteogenic differentiation of murine bone marrow stromal cells, and transcription factor Runx2 serves as an essential regulation target in the process. The underlying mechanism may involve the regulation of Runx2 expression and the Runx2 activity in downstream gene transcription, which has not been fully elucidated. In this study, ST2 murine bone marrow-derived stromal cells were treated with bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and/or TNF-α in osteogenic medium, and the expression of Runx2 was estimated. Cells were transfected with Runx2, p65, inhibitor of κBα (IκBα), 9.0 kb bone sialoprotein (BSP) promoter-luciferase or osteoblast-specific cis-acting element 2 (OSE2)-luciferase reporter vectors, and then real time-PCR and dual luciferase analysis were used to investigate the effect of TNF-α on Runx2-activated osteogenic gene transcription and the molecular mechanism. We found that TNF-α inhibited BMP-2-induced osteogenic marker expression and both the spontaneous and BMP-2-induced Runx2 expression. TNF-α stimulation or overexpression of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p65 subunit repressed the Runx2-activated BSP and osteocalcin (OC) transcriptions. The Runx2-induced 9.0 kb BSP promoter activity was attenuated by TNF-α or p65, while the OSE2 activity was not affected. Besides, blockage of NF-κB by IκBα overexpression eliminated these inhibitory effects of TNF-α on Runx2 signaling. These results suggest that in murine bone marrow stromal cells undergoing osteogenic differentiation, TNF-α and it activated NF-κB pathway inhibit the expression of Runx2 gene, and suppress the Runx2-mediated osteogenic gene transcription via the 9.0 kb BSP promoter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIKappaB kinase 3abone formation 3abone marrow 3abone morphogenetic proteins 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ain vitro studies 3aluciferase 3amice 3aosteocalcin 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aregulatory sequences 3astromal cells 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aHuang, Haiyun1 aZhao, Ning1 aZhang, Jin1 aYang, Pishan0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2016 Dec., v. 52, no. 10 p.1026-1033dSpringer USx1071-26907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11626-016-0068-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003800117024004100155040001800196100002000214245010300234300001400337506007600351506003100427520102300458592002801481596008301509506003701592650002501629650001701654650001801671650002001689650001201709650002301721650001701744700001501761700002001776700001801796700002301814773010901837856008501946856011402031961000902145852000902154655001202163IND60635243420221215143040.0190411e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063524342DNAL7 a10113/63524342hdl7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2018.03.0092doi7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2018.03.0092chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Seong-Hoon10aImpact of market conditions on the effectiveness of payments for forest-based carbon sequestration  ap. 33-42.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThis research analyzes the effects of market conditions on the performance of incentive payment approaches for forest-based carbon sequestration. We develop supply curves for sequestered carbon using the relationship between deforestation for urbanization and the relative returns from forest products and urban uses under two different market conditions. The empirical results for an 18-county case study show that a hypothetical payment system was effective and the marginal cost of carbon sequestration increased with the target level of carbon sequestration during the 2001–2006 real estate upturn, while the same system was ineffective during the 2006–2011 period that included a real estate downturn. Our study is the first to examine the role of temporal changes in market conditions on the performance of incentive payment approaches. Although a first step, our snapshot, static approach shows the value in thinking of the dynamic role of changing market conditions in evaluating incentive payment systems.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon sequestration 3acase studies 3adeforestation 3aforest products 3amarkets 3atemporal variation 3aurbanization1 aLee, Juhee1 aRoberts, Roland1 aYu, Edward T.1 aArmsworth, Paul R.0 tForest policy and economics.g2018 July, v. 92 p.33-42dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2018.03.0093Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/63524343Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle04221naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009200169300001600261500001900277520235500296536030202651592002802953596001902981596001303000596001703013650001703030650001603047650001803063650002003081650002503101650001403126650001903140650002203159650001303181650002203194650002803216650001303244653001703257653002603274653002403300653002203324700001803346700001803364700001203382700001603394700001403410700001803424700001503442773011603457856008503573852000903658655001203667IND60729874620221122031409.0210303e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072987462DNAL7 a10.1080/01490451.2020.18229592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMing, Hongxia10aDiversity and Abundance of Denitrifying Bacteria in the Sediment of a Eutrophic Estuary  ap. 199-209.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe relationships between denitrifying microbial communities and their controlling factors are largely unknown in eutrophic estuaries sediment. This work showed that in Liaohe Estuary, nirS-type denitrifiers were consistently more abundant and diverse than nirK and nosZ-type denitrifiers, which probably means that they play an important role in nitrogen removal, particularly around nearshore stations. The dominant genera of nirK, nirS and nosZ-type denitrifiers were Sinorhizobium, Pseudomonas, and Azospirillum. Salinity, nitrogen levels, and sediment grain size were the main factors affecting the denitrification process in this eutrophic estuary. These results provide more information about the dynamics of denitrifying microbiota in marine sediments. Summary: The relationships between denitrifying microbial communities and abundance in estuaries sediment and their controlling factors are largely unknown, especially in eutrophic estuaries. In this study, nitrite reductase genes (nirS, nirK) and nitrous oxide reductase genes (nosZ) were used as molecular markers, qPCR and illumina Miseq high-throughput sequencing technology were used to study the relative abundance of key functional microflora groups and major environmental impact factors in Liaohe Estuary. The results showed that nirS-type denitrifiers were consistently more abundant and diverse than nirK and nosZ-type denitrifiers, which suggested that nirS-type denitrifiers probably play an important role in nitrogen removal in Liaohe Estuary, particularly around nearshore stations. The dominant genera of the bacterial containing nirK, nirS and nosZ genes were Sinorhizobium, Pseudomonas, and Azospirillum, in which Sinorhizobium and Azospirillum were nitrogen-fixing bacteria, while Pseudomonas was denitrogenation bacteria. The different dominant denitrifiers indicated that sedimentary denitrification was accomplished by cooperation of different denitrifying species rather than a single species. Salinity, NH₄ ⁺, NO₃ ⁻, NO₂ ⁻ and sediment grain size were regarded as determinants for the denitrification process in the sediment of the estuary. Overall, the results of this study suggest that a comprehensive analysis of different denitrifying functional genes may provide more information about the dynamics of denitrifying microbiota in marine sediments.  aThis work was supported by National Key R&D program of china [2016YFA0601401], the Natural Science Foundation of China [No. 41676115], and Key Laboratory of Integrated Monitoring and Applied Technology for Marine Harmful Algal Blooms of State Oceanic Administration Open Foundation [MATHAB201815].  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFA0601401  a41676115  aMATHAB201815 3aAzospirillum 3aPseudomonas 3aSinorhizobium 3adenitrification 3aenvironmental impact 3aestuaries 3aeutrophication 3anitrite reductase 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrous-oxide reductase 3asalinity 0aDenitrifiers 0amicrobial communities 0amicrobial abundance 0aeutrophic estuary1 aFan, Jingfeng1 aChen, Quanrui1 aSu, Jie1 aSong, Jixue1 aYuan, Jin1 aShi, Tingting1 aLi, Bochao0 tGeomicrobiology journal.g2021 Mar. 1, v. 38, no. 3 p.199-209dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12314x1521-05297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490451.2020.18229593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04332naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245011300172300001400285520224100299592002802540650001402568650001502582650001702597650001602614650001202630650001102642650002602653650000902679650003302688650001702721650001702738650001202755650000902767650001302776650002502789650001902814650000902833650001402842650001102856650001102867650001702878650001602895650001502911650001602926651001802942651002602960653003102986653002203017653002003039653003603059653002703095653002503122653001303147700002903160700002103189700002103210700002103231700001803252700002003270700002003290700002303310700002803333700001603361700002003377773009303397856008703490852000903577655001203586IND60084121020221119031450.0161027e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008412102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2013.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMargalef, Olga12aA 70,000 year multiproxy record of climatic and environmental change from Rano Aroi peatland (Easter Island)  ap. 72-84.  aThe Rano Aroi mire on Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui; 27°09′S, 109°27′W, 430m above sea level) provides a unique non-marine record in the central South Pacific Ocean for reconstructing Late Pleistocene environmental changes. The results of a multiproxy study on two cores from the center and margin of the Rano Aroi mire, including peat stratigraphy, facies analysis, elemental and isotope geochemistry on bulk organic matter, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanning and macrofossil analysis, were used to infer past water levels and vegetation changes. The chronology was based on 18 14C AMS dates for the upper 8.7m. The extrapolated age for the base of the sequence is 70kyr, which implies that this record is the oldest paleolimnological record on Easter Island. The recovered Rano Aroi sequence consists of a radicel peat formed primarily from the remains of sedges, grasses and Polygonaceae that have accumulated since Marine Isotopic Stage (MIS) 4 (70kyr BP) to the present. From 60 to 40kyr BP (MIS 3), high precipitation/runoff events were recorded as organic mud facies with lighter δ13C, low C/N values and high Ti content, indicating higher detritic input to the mire. A gradual shift in δ13C bulk organic matter from −14% to −26%, recorded between 50 and 45calkyr BP, suggests a progressive change in local peat-forming vegetation from C4 to C3 plant types. Post-depositional Ca and Fe enrichment during sub-aerial peat exposure and very low sedimentation rates indicate lower water tables during Late MIS 3 (39–31calkyr BP). During MIS 2 (27.8–19calkyr BP), peat production rates were very low, most likely due to cold temperatures, as reconstructed from other Easter Island records during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Geochemical and macrofossil evidence shows that peat accumulation reactivates at approximately 17.5calkyr BP, reaching the highest accumulation rates at 14calkyr BP. Peat accretion decreased from 5.0 to 2.5calkyr BP, coinciding with a regional Holocene aridity phase. The main hydrological and environmental changes in Rano Aroi reflect variations in the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ), Southern Westerlies (SW) storm track, and South Pacific Anticyclone (SPA) locations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC3 plants 3aCyperaceae 3aPolygonaceae 3aX-radiation 3acalcium 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acold 3adry environmental conditions 3afluorescence 3ageochemistry 3agrasses 3airon 3aisotopes 3anucleotide sequences 3aorganic matter 3apeat 3apeatlands 3arunoff 3astorms 3astratigraphy 3atemperature 3avegetation 3awater table 3aPacific Ocean 3aPacific Ocean Islands 0aSouth Pacific paleoclimate 0aPeat geochemistry 0aStable isotopes 0aX-ray fluorescence core scanner 0aMarine Isotope Stage 3 0aLast Glacial Maximum 0aHolocene1 aCañellas-Boltà, Núria1 aPla-Rabes, Sergi1 aGiralt, Santiago1 aPueyo, Juan Jose1 aJoosten, Hans1 aRull, Valentí,1 aBuchaca, Teresa1 aHernández, Armand1 aValero-Garcés, Blas L.1 aMoreno, Ana1 aSáez, Alberto,0 tGlobal and Planetary Change.g2013 Sept., v. 108 p.72-84dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2013.05.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013400170300001400304520089600318592002801214650001101242650001601253650001101269650002001280650001101300650001301311650001801324650000901342650000901351650001201360650001301372650001701385650001101402650001701413650001101430650001301441650001601454650001101470650001001481650000901491650001101500650001101511650001101522651002101533653001901554653001501573653001701588653001701605653002301622700001901645773009601664856008501760852000901845655001201854IND60541548020221119120006.0190318e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054154802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2013.10.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJang, Yong Seok14aThe first report on the winter breeding life history of Epuraea domina (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) in a citrus grove in Jeju, Korea  ap. 68-73.  aEpuraea domina Reitter (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) is a flower-visiting insect and a pest that causes corky scar on citrus fruit. This study was conducted to investigate the life cycle of E. domina in a citrus grove. E. domina showed the characteristics of cold breeders as they complete key life history events of oviposition and immature development during the winter. E. domina adults spent the summer in uncultivated habits started to lay eggs in soil near fallen citrus fruit in orchards during late autumn. Oviposition activity continued throughout the winter with a large decrease in activity when the minimum air temperature was <0 °C. Hatched larvae fed on decaying citrus and pupated in soil in the spring. The pupae emerged as new adults in mid-May to feed on the pollen and nectar of citrus flowers, probably followed by their migration to uncultivated habitats in the summer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aNitidulidae 3aadults 3aair temperature 3aautumn 3abreeding 3acitrus fruits 3acold 3aeggs 3aflowers 3ahabitats 3ainsect pests 3alarvae 3alife history 3anectar 3aorchards 3aoviposition 3apollen 3apupae 3asoil 3aspring 3asummer 3awinter 3aKorean Peninsula 0aEpuraea domina 0aSap beetle 0aCold breeder 0aLife history 0aSeasonal migration1 aKim, Dong-Soon0 tCrop protection.g2014 Jan., v. 55 p.68-73dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2013.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01835naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008700168300001600255520069100271592002800962650001100990650000901001650001301010650001501023650002401038650001101062650001701073653001101090653003001101653002801131700001701159700001701176700002201193700001801215773012501233856008201358852000901440655001201449IND60605890520221121030446.0180723e20161015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060589052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2016.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Prashant10aOrganic phase synthesis of noble metal-zinc chalcogenide core-shell nanostructures  ap. 159-165.  aMulti-component nanostructures have been attracting tremendous attention due to their ability to form novel materials with unique chemical, optical and physical properties.

Policy attempts have been made to improve women's participation in forest governance at the local level. However, this has had insignificant effect on women's inclusion in forestry as it neglected the structural problems of power and inequity. This paper examines how forest policy has attended to gender concerns in India. It maps the gender trajectory within policy positions and identifies the gap in policy and research. It provides an analytical framework to analyse the Gender Responsiveness of forest policies. The framework helps classifying post-independence forest policies as Gender Blind, Gender Aware and Gender Responsive, based on the gender specific provisions. Analysis indicates that except for few provisions in the FRA, 2006, none of the forest policies appear to be categorically Gender Responsive. This could possibly be because of the limited engagement with structural issues; and, failure to design enabling institutions. Finally, our findings suggest that forest policies need to be grounded in a more nuanced understanding of gender relations and gender roles for sustainable socio-ecological outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforest policy 3aforestry 3aforests 3agender 3agovernance 3awomen 3aIndia 0aForest policy 0aGender responsive 0aGender needs 0aContent 0aDiscourse analysis1 aDas, Smriti0 tForest policy and economics.g2018 July, v. 92 p.160-168dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2018.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03502naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245010800175300001300283520170200296592002801998650001802026650002502044650001702069650001702086650000902103650001202112650001802124650002002142650001702162650001102179650001402190650002102204650001402225650002602239653000802265653000802273653000802281653000902289653001002298653000902308653001102317653000902328653000902337653000802346653000802354653001002362653001002372653001302382653000802395653000802403653000802411653000802419653001002427653001102437653002502448653002002473653002402493653002002517653002802537653003002565700001802595773008902613856008102702852000902783655001202792IND60085819420221122225451.0160901e20130206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008581942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2012.11.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez-Alarcón, Camilo10aEvaluating the antioxidant capacity of natural products: A review on chemical and cellular-based assays  ap. 1-10.  aOxidative stress is associated with several pathologies like cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, cancer and even aging. It has been suggested that a diet rich in antioxidants would be beneficial to human health and a lot of interest is focused on the determination of antioxidant capacity of natural products. Different chemical methods have been developed including the popular ORAC that evaluates the potential of a sample as inhibitor of a target molecule oxidation. Chemical-based methods are useful for screening, they are low cost, high-throughput and yield an index value (expressed as equivalents of Trolox) that allows comparing and ordering different products. More recently, nanoparticles-based assays have been developed to sense the antioxidant power of natural products. However, the antioxidant capacity indexes obtained by chemical assays cannot extrapolate the performance of the sample in vivo. Considering that antioxidant action is not limited to scavenging free radicals but includes upregulation of antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes, modulation of redox cell signaling and gene expression, it is necessary to move to cellular assays in order to evaluate the potential antioxidant activity of a compound or extract. Animal models and human studies are more appropriate but also more expensive and time-consuming, making the cell culture assays very attractive as intermediate testing methods. Cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) assays, activation of redox transcription factors, inhibition of oxidases or activation of antioxidant enzymes are reviewed and compared with the classical in vitro chemical-based assays for evaluation of antioxidant capacity of natural products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acell culture 3adiet 3aenzymes 3afree radicals 3agene expression 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3ascreening 3atranscription factors 0aROS 0aRNS 0aSOD 0aDPPH 0aABTS+ 0aFRAP 0aCUPRAC 0aORAC 0aTRAP 0aLDL 0aESR 0aHepG2 0aDCFH2 0aDCFH2-DA 0aCAA 0aRBC 0aNOx 0aNOS 0aNrf-2 0aNF-κB 0aAntioxidant capacity 0aChemical assays 0aNanoparticle assays 0aCellular assays 0aReactive oxygen species 0aReactive nitrogen species1 aDenicola, Ana0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2013 Feb. 06, v. 763 p.1-10dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2012.11.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01482naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245010900164506002800273520047300301592002800774506003700802650001700839650001400856650001300870650001000883700002000893700002200913700001700935773012800952856007901080852000901159655001201168IND60785560920221207081457.0190503s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078556092DNAL7 a10.5281/zenodo.25607162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKorshikov, I.I.10aLife form and vegetative expansion of white poplar (Populus alba L.) on the iron ore dumps of Kriviy Rig  aResource is Open Access  aDiversity of life forms of white poplar (Populus alba L.) on the iron ore dumps of Kriviy Rig is studied.

This project started from the realization that parcel delivery trucks have become one of the main sources of PM emissions especially as the parcel delivery service industry has rapidly grown in Korea amid inefficient driving environment for delivery trucks. To evaluate the marketability and feasibility of the project, this study analyzed diesel truck owners’ preferences for converting to hybrid vehicles. Hierarchical Bayesian choice-based conjoint analysis was employed to forecast conversion probabilities and willingness to pay for various vehicle attributes, and the influencing demographic factors were then analyzed. The demand forecasting results are expected to enable decision makers to set a reasonable budget for hybrid conversion. For policy implications, the findings suggest that truck owners should be allowed to pay for the conversion in installments, not in a lump sum, and it would be strategically effective to target the consumer segment that prioritizes fuel cost savings relative to other vehicle attributes to promote hybrid conversion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3acost effectiveness 3adecision making 3aenergy costs 3afeasibility studies 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aissues and policy 3aparticulate emissions 3aparticulates 3aplanning 3aresearch and development 3aservice industry 3atrucks 3awillingness to pay 3aKorean Peninsula 0aHybrid conversion 0aSmall diesel trucks 0aConsumer preference 0aHierarchical bayesian 0aKorean government1 aHur, Sung Ho1 aKang, Namwoo0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Sept. 20, v. 232 p.559-574dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.05.3163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007200169300001400241520111000255592002801365650001601393650002401409650001401433650001001447650001601457650001701473650001201490650001901502650002001521650001401541650001501555650002301570651001101593700002801604700002001632773010901652856008501761852000901846655001201855IND60635243720221119204328.0190411e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063524372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2018.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEngelman, Marc10aHunters' trade-off in valuation of different game animals in Sweden  ap. 73-81.  aVehicle accidents and damage to farm and forest land by ungulates have been documented in several studies, which call for regulation of population size according to their damages. These species may also create value for hunters in terms of recreational and other values. However, in Sweden and many other countries hunters have access to multiple game species, which needs to be considered when comparing eventual costs and values of different game. In this study we estimated hunters' trade-offs in valuation of the four main game animals in Sweden, moose, roe deer, wild boar and small game, by regarding them as different attributes of hunting. To this end, a discrete choice experiment framework was used to elicit hunters' trade-offs between the different game animals. Estimates with a mixed logit model showed significant differences in valuations of the game animals. Average annual marginal willingness to pay (WTP) for hunting moose was SEK 1878/animal (SEK 8.44 = 1 USD in 2015), which was approximately four-fold and six-fold the corresponding WTP for roe deer and wild boar, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlces alces 3aCapreolus capreolus 3aaccidents 3afarms 3aforest land 3agame animals 3ahunters 3alogit analysis 3apopulation size 3aungulates 3awild boars 3awillingness to pay 3aSweden1 aLagerkvist, Carl Johan,1 aGren, Ing-Marie0 tForest policy and economics.g2018 July, v. 92 p.73-81dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2018.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003900147245017100186300001400357520149300371592002801864650001501892650001501907650001501922650003001937650002001967650001801987650001102005650001902016650002102035653000802056653000902064653000802073653000802081653001002089653000802099653000802107653001002115653000802125653000902133653000802142653000802150653004202158653006002200653001902260653002102279700002602300700002702326700003702353773009002390856008102480852000902561655001202570IND60085819520221122225434.0160901e20130206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008581952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2012.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGodoy-Caballero, María del Pilar,10aNovel combination of non-aqueous capillary electrophoresis and multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares to determine phenolic acids in virgin olive oil  ap. 11-19.  aThis paper presents the development of a non-aqueous capillary electrophoresis method coupled to UV detection combined with multivariate curve resolution-alternating least-squares (MCR-ALS) to carry out the resolution and quantitation of a mixture of six phenolic acids in virgin olive oil samples. p-Coumaric, caffeic, ferulic, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic, vanillic and 4-hydroxyphenilacetic acids have been the analytes under study. All of them present different absorption spectra and overlapped time profiles with the olive oil matrix interferences and between them. The modeling strategy involves the building of a single MCR-ALS model composed of matrices augmented in the temporal mode, namely spectra remain invariant while time profiles may change from sample to sample. So MCR-ALS was used to cope with the coeluting interferences, on accounting the second order advantage inherent to this algorithm which, in addition, is able to handle data sets deviating from trilinearity, like the data herein analyzed. The method was firstly applied to resolve standard mixtures of the analytes randomly prepared in 1-propanol and, secondly, in real virgin olive oil samples, getting recovery values near to 100% in all cases. The importance and novelty of this methodology relies on the combination of non-aqueous capillary electrophoresis second-order data and MCR-ALS algorithm which allows performing the resolution of these compounds simplifying the previous sample pretreatment stages.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-propanol 3aabsorption 3aalgorithms 3acapillary electrophoresis 3adata collection 3aleast squares 3amodels 3aphenolic acids 3avirgin olive oil 0aVOO 0aNACE 0aCZE 0aBGE 0ap-CUM 0aCAF 0aFER 0aDOPAC 0aVAN 0a4HP4 0aLOD 0aLOQ 0aNon-aqueous capillary electrophoresis 0aMultivariate curve resolution-alternating least-squares 0aPhenolic acids 0aVirgin olive oil1 aCulzoni, María Julia1 aGaleano-Díaz, Teresa,1 aAcedo-Valenzuela, María Isabel,0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2013 Feb. 06, v. 763 p.11-19dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2012.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009500170300001600265520104100281592002801322650001501350650001201365650002001377650002401397650001501421650001801436650001001454650001201464650001501476650001601491650002501507650001401532653002301546653002201569653002301591653002801614653001401642653002701656700002201683700002101705700002201726700002001748700006601768773009901834856008501933852000902018655001202027IND60597162520221122122605.0201125e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059716252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2018.06.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahimi, Alireza10aDouble-MRT lattice Boltzmann simulation of natural convection in a C-shaped heat exchanger  ap. 465-480.  aThe hydrothermal analysis of a C-shaped heat exchanger during the natural convection phenomenon is carried out.

The PT-DMIP cartridge was prepared by packing the dummy molecularly imprinted polymer at the tip of the micropipette. The polymerization used betamethasone (BM) as the dummy template, 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) as the functionalized monomer, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as the cross-linker and aluminum ion (Al³⁺) as a dopant to produce Lewis acid sites in the silica matrix for metal coordinative interactions with the analyte. Compared to conventional solid phase extraction (SPE), the PT-DMIP is cost-effective, fast, and easy to handle, while the system is very approachable and reduces the consumption of toxic organic solvent. HPLC-UV analysis revealed successful applicability of the sorbent for highly efficient extraction of perdnisolone from urine matrices. The extraction recovery was investigated and optimum conditions were obtained using central composite design. Good linearity for prednisolone in the range of 0.22–220μgL⁻¹ with regression coefficients of 0.99 reveals high applicability of the method for trace analysis. Under the optimized conditions, the recoveries are 89.0–96.1 with relative standard deviations (RSD) of less than 9.0%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aaluminum 3abetamethasone 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrophilicity 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aprednisolone 3aregression analysis 3asilica 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3asorbents 3atoxicity 3aultrasonic treatment 3aurine 0aMolecularly imprinted polymer 0aDummy template 0aPipette-tip solid phase extraction 0aPrednisolone1 aGhaedi, Mehrorang1 aOstovan, Abbas1 aWang, Shaobin0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 480 p.232-239dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2016.07.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245009800172300001600270520148100286592002801767650001201795650001101807650003001818650002701848650001401875650002301889650001301912650000901925651001801934653002601952653001401978653002101992653002902013653002302042700001302065700002002078700002002098773009502118856008702213852000902300655001202309IND60084121320221119031111.0161027e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008412132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2013.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Yi-Ting10aSea level variations in the tropical Pacific Ocean during two types of recent El Niño events  ap. 119-127.  aSea level variations in the tropical Pacific Ocean (TPO) exhibit the prominent periods of 30 and 52months on interannual timescale, and the interannual variance illustrates the geographical distribution over the 1993–2010 period. The quasi-biennial amplitude is comparable to the seasonal variation in the east off the Philippine coast (EOP). The Central Pacific El Niño (CP El Niño) events have occurred frequently and comparably in the satellite altimetry era compared with the Eastern Pacific El Niño (EP El Niño), and the sea level varies closely related to the two types of El Niño events. A see–saw mode of sea level is dominant during the EP El Niño event, but a “shuttle” pattern towers mainly in the central equatorial Pacific during the CP El Niño events. The oceanic and atmospheric processes interpret the sea level evolution during the CP El Niño and the EP El Niño events. Sea level variations in the EOP are impacted by the local and remote responses of atmospheric wind fields. The remote effect caused by the westward Rossby wave dominates in the atmospheric contribution which is nearly twice the magnitude of the local Ekman pumping effect. The local wind contributes to sea level evolution primarily in the beginning of the El Niño events. The remote process of the Rossby wave persists in 35% of the three CP El Niño phases, while the predicted skill distribution, about 43—53%, maps geographical variability in the EP El Niño event.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3acoasts 3ageographical distribution 3ageographical variation 3asea level 3aseasonal variation 3avariance 3awind 3aPacific Ocean 0ainterannual variation 0asea level 0atropical Pacific 0aCentral Pacific El Niño 0aatmospheric effect1 aDu, Ling1 aZhang, Shou-Wen1 aHuang, Peng-Fei0 tGlobal and Planetary Change.g2013 Sept., v. 108 p.119-127dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2013.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012300168300001800291520111500309592002801424650002501452650001601477650002001493650002801513650002401541651000901565653002701574653002601601653002501627653003101652700001901683700001701702773011601719856008601835852000901921655001201930IND60646710320221122064432.0190725e20190920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064671032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.05.3362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Hyunha10aAppropriate technology for grassroots innovation in developing countries for sustainable development: The case of Laos  ap. 1167-1175.  aAppropriate technology for sustainable development in developing countries should consider comprehensive societal aspects of the target area and, at the same time, ensure target areas are capable of sustainable transformation. However, appropriate technology has mainly been approached from the engineering or technological aspects, thus becoming a short-term or one-time technology transfer or, despite the social science approach, it has no definite theoretical background. For successful and sustainable appropriate technology activities, appropriate technology should be approached theoretically. Therefore, this study applies the theory of grassroots innovation to appropriate technology, examines how the concepts of grassroots innovation based on local community units can relate to appropriate technology activities in developing countries, and analyzes a case of appropriate technology activity to show that future appropriate technology activities should involve grassroots innovation.

In this paper, the phase change materials (PCMs) attached to the back side of the PV cell is used to control the temperature of the PV cells. The PCMs transfers the heat absorbed from the PV cell to the TE modules. A comprehensive experimental study is carried out to investigate the performance of the photovoltaic-thermoelectric hybrid system with PCMs. The outdoor tests are performed to reveal the influence of the cooling methods, the sunlight intensity, and the uniformity of the concentrated light spot on the conversion efficiency of the system. The results indicate that the conversion efficiency of the PV-TE hybrid system with PCMs is 0.56% more than solo PV cell system due to a decrease of the PV cell temperature and the efficiency contribution of the TE modules. This work investigates the factors that affect the full spectrum utilization of solar energy in PV cell systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheat 3aheat tolerance 3aphase transition 3asolar cells 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 0aPhotovoltaic 0aThermoelectric 0aPhase change material 0aTriple-junction solar cells1 aXuan, Y.q(Yimin),1 aYin, Ershuai1 aLi, Qiang0 tRenewable energy.g2018 Oct., v. 126 p.960-968dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2018.04.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245008400171300001600255520176100271592002802032650001202060650001202072650002602084650001102110650001502121650000902136650001402145650001002159650001602169651002602185653001802211653001502229653001302244653001402257653004102271653001202312653001002324653001102334700002502345700002002370700002502390700002002415700002302435773009502458856008702553852000902640655001202649IND60084121420221119031133.0161027e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008412142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2013.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoeke, Ron K.10aWidespread inundation of Pacific islands triggered by distant-source wind-waves  ap. 128-138.  aIt is essential to understand the causes of sea level extremes in order to anticipate and respond to coastal flooding (inundation), and to adapt to sea level rise. We investigate a series of inundation events which occurred across the western Pacific over several consecutive days during December 2008, causing severe impacts to five Pacific Island nations. These events were not associated with commonly identified causes: tropical cyclones or unusually large astronomical tides. Instead, the dissipation of wind-waves generated by distant extra-tropical cyclones (swell) was the main cause, although regional sea level variability, including recent accelerated rise, significantly contributed to the severity of impact experienced at many locations. The implication of recent sea level rise in the severity of these events suggests that episodic swell will increasingly cause major impacts of the nature described herein, although such impacts will continue to be modulated by El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability in the region. Significantly, tide gauges recorded little evidence of extreme sea levels during the event, implying that causes of extreme sea levels inferred from tide gauge analysis are unlikely to include this important cause of inundation. Therefore, any assessment of inundation risk predicated on tide gauge information (as well as larger scale sea level information such as satellite altimetry) may fail at many locations in the Pacific. To be accurate, such efforts must include information on the relationship between wave climate, wave forecasts and local extreme water levels. Further development of related early warning systems will become more pertinent as modern SLR continues to add to the magnitude of extremes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aclimate 3aearly warning systems 3agauges 3ahurricanes 3arisk 3asea level 3atides 3awater waves 3aPacific Ocean Islands 0adisaster risk 0ainundation 0aflooding 0asea level 0aEl Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) 0aPacific 0awaves 0astorms1 aMcInnes, Kathleen L.1 aKruger, Jens C.1 aMcNaught, Rebecca J.1 aHunter, John R.1 aSmithers, Scott G.0 tGlobal and Planetary Change.g2013 Sept., v. 108 p.128-138dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2013.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245015200169300001400321520096100335592002801296650002301324650002401347650001601371650001901387650001801406650001801424650001801442650001501460650001601475650001201491650002301503650001701526650001801543650001001561650002001571650001901591653002401610653002301634653001801657653002101675653003401696700002201730773012001752856008101872852000901953655001201962IND60623000720221123002955.0181127e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062300072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2018.02.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurcios, Ariel E.10aBiofiltration of the antibacterial drug sulfamethazine by the species Chenopodium quinoa and its further biodegradation through anaerobic digestion  ap. 54-63.  aThe biofiltering capacity, distribution patterns and degradation of the antimicrobial sulfamethazine (SMT) by halophyte Chenopodium quinoa under hydroponic conditions and its further biodegradation through anaerobic digestion were evaluated.

The higher the SMT concentration in the culture medium, the higher the SMT content in the plant tissue. SMT has different distribution patterns within the plant organs, and no SMT is found in the seeds. Dry crop residues containing SMT have a great potential to produce methane through anaerobic digestion and, in addition, SMT is further biodegraded.

In this study, occurrence, distribution, and ear damage of the corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), were evaluated in three planting patterns of non-Bt and Bt corn plants containing Genuity® SmartStax™ traits. The three planting patterns were 1) pure stands of 27 Bt plants; 2) pure stands of 27 non-Bt plants; and 3) one non-Bt plant in the center surrounded by 26 Bt plants. A total of six trials were conducted in open field conditions with natural infestations in 2011 and 2012. Egg populations of H. zea were distributed randomly or uniformly, and the number of eggs laid was similar between Bt and non-Bt corn ears regardless of the planting patterns, suggesting that females of H. zea have no egg-laying preference between Bt and non-Bt plants. Bt corn plants containing Genuity® SmartStax™ traits were equally effective in the control of H. zea in pure stands of Bt corn and “RIB” plantings. Occurrence of larvae and ear damage on Bt corn were significantly lower than on non-Bt plants and there were no significant differences between pure stands of Bt and “RIB” plantings across all trials. However, the limited numbers of live larvae in the pure stands of Bt plants were distributed non-randomly, suggesting a possibility of uneven expression of Bt proteins or elevated larval movement in the pure stands of Bt plants. Larval occurrence (3rd–5th instars) and ear damage on the refuge ears in “RIB” plantings were similar to or greater than found on ears of pure stands of non-Bt plants. However, more studies are needed to understand the effect of pollen movement on the full life cycle of H. zea before a final conclusion on the refuge function of RIB planting can be made.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aHelicoverpa zea 3aZea mays 3abacterial proteins 3acorn 3acorn ears 3across pollination 3aears 3aeggs 3afemales 3ainstars 3alarvae 3apests 3aplanting 3apollen 3apure stands 3aresistance management 3aseed mixtures 3aseeds 3atransgenic plants 0aTransgenic crops 0aBacillus thuringiensis 0aHelicoverpa zea 0aResistance management 0aSeed mixture refuge strategy1 aKerns, David L.1 aHead, Graham P.1 aLeonard, B.

In this study, we combined datasets of the satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and climatic factors to analyze spatio-temporal patterns of vegetation growth in 1982–2006 in the Koshi River Basin (KRB) in the middle Himalayas. In addition, the dataset from the global land surface satellite sensor from SPOT-4's Vegetation instrument in 1998–2011 was used to further verify the results of this study. At the regional scale, although a statistically significant increase in average growing season NDVI was observed (0.0008yr−1, P=0.03) during the entire study period, there existed three distinct periods with opposing trends. Growing season NDVI significantly increased in 1982–1994 (0.0019yr−1, P=0.03), and then decreased in 1994–2000 (−0.0058yr−1, P<0.001), while increased again in 2000–2006 (0.0049yr−1, P<0.001) and in 2000–2011 (0.0034yr−1, P<0.001). A sudden drop in NDVI in 1994–2000 largely contributed to these fluctuations in growing season NDVI over the KRB. Spring, summer and autumn NDVI significantly decreased in 1994–2000 (−0.0077yr−1, P<0.001; −0.0067yr−1, P<0.001; and −0.0155yr−1, P<0.001; respectively). Our further spatial analyses supported the existence of the sudden decrease in spring, summer and autumn NDVI in 1994–2000.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3acarbon cycle 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3adata collection 3amonitoring 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aspring 3asummer 3avegetation 3awatersheds 0aclimate change 0aKoshi River Basin 0aNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 0avegetation change 0agrowing season 0apiecewise linear regression1 aGao, Jungang1 aLiu, Linshan1 aWang, Zhaofeng1 aDing, Minjung1 aYang, Xuchao0 tGlobal and Planetary Change.g2013 Sept., v. 108 p.139-148dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2013.06.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245021000160500001900370520144900389592002801838650001301866650001401879650001501893650001901908650001001927650001101937650001401948650001201962650001701974650001801991650002602009650001102035650002702046650001902073650002502092650001802117650003202135650002602167700001802193700002002211700002002231700002002251700002002271773012602291856007402417852000902491655001202500IND60703227620221122081331.0200720e20200129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070322762DNAL7 a10.3390/md180200872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHwang, Jiyoung 10aPhotoprotective Activity of Topsentin, A Bis(Indole) Alkaloid from the Marine Sponge <i>Spongosorites genitrix</i>, by Regulation of COX-2 and Mir-4485 Expression in UVB-Irradiated Human Keratinocyte Cells  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSkin is an important barrier to protect the body from environmental stress. However, exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UV) and various environmental oxidative stresses can cause skin inflammation. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an inducible enzyme that mediates the formation of prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) against internal and external inflammatory stimulations. Therefore, the inhibition of COX-2 is an important approach to maintain skin health and prevent skin inflammation and carcinogenesis. Topsentin, a bis(indolyl)imidazole alkaloid isolated from the marine sponge <i>Spongosorites genitrix</i>, has been reported to exhibit anti-tumor and anti-microbial activities. However, the effect of topsentin on skin inflammation and its underlying molecular mechanism has not been elucidated. In the present study, we identified the photoprotective effects of topsentin on UVB irradiated human epidermal keratinocyte HaCaT cells. Topsentin suppresses COX-2 expression and its upstream signaling pathways, AP-1 and MAPK. Furthermore, topsentin inhibits miR-4485, a new biomarker selected from a microarray, and its target gene tumor necrosis factor alpha induced protein 2 (TNF-&alpha; IP2). The photoprotective effect of topsentin was also confirmed in a reconstructed human skin model. These findings suggest that topsentin may serve as a potential candidate for cosmetic formulations with skin inflammatory-mediated disorder.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorifera 3aalkaloids 3abiomarkers 3acarcinogenesis 3agenes 3ahumans 3aimidazole 3aindoles 3ainflammation 3akeratinocytes 3amicroarray technology 3amodels 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aprostaglandins 3aradiation resistance 3askin (animal) 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aultraviolet radiation1 aKim, Donghwa 1 aPark, Jae-Sung,1 aPark, Hyen  Joo1 aShin, Jongheon 1 aLee, Sang  Kook0 tMarine drugs.g2020 Jan. 29, v. 18, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md180200873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02166naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245007100168300001600239506002800255520091300283592002801196506003701224650003001261650002101291650002401312650001901336650001801355650001401373653001701387653002101404653001901425653001901444653002001463653001901483700001901502700001701521773013101538856007801669852000901747655001201756IND60785561620221207094556.0190903e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078556162DNAL7 a10.19159/tutad.4407832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCERİTOĞLU, Mustafa10aVermicompost Production Technique and Materials Used in Production  ap. 230-236.  aResource is Open Access  aVermicompost is the final product obtained by subjecting organic wastes to mesolytic composting through the digestive system of worms. The shortage of organic matter in soil reduces the productivity of agricultural production and hampers its continuity. Soil organic matter helps to increase agricultural productivity by increasing microbial viability, improving soil structure, regulating nutrient and hormonal content of soil. For this reason, the use of vermicompost in agricultural lands should be encouraged. The installation of the vermicompost production facility is extremely easy and practical. It is possible to achieve commercial success with a properly installed facility. Thus, both the reduction of the use of synthetic fertilizers and the contribution to the domestic economy will be encouraged. The aim of this study is to give information about vermicompost production methods and materials.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural productivity 3adigestive system 3asoil organic matter 3asoil structure 3avermicomposts 3aviability 0aVermicompost 0aearthworm manure 0aorganic manure 0aorganic matter 0aplant nutrition 0aEisenia fetida1 aŞAHİN, Sezer1 aERMAN, Murat0 tTürkiye tarımsal araştırmalar dergisi.g2019 June, v. 6, no. 2 p.230-236dSiirt UniversitywJournal:27812x2528-858X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.19159/tutad.4407833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02131naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245015200174300001400326500001900340520062900359536023200988592002801220596002001248650001301268650002001281650001201301650000901313650002001322650001201342650001501354651001401369653005501383653001901438653001601457700001701473700002701490773010901517856008601626852000901712655001201721IND60729875620221122042628.0210501e20210102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072987562DNAL7 a10.1080/02508060.2020.18681242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorbulyk, Theodore10aCommunity response to the provision of alternative water supplies: A focus on chronic kidney disease of unknown aetiology (CKDu) in rural Sri Lanka  ap. 37-58.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUntil recently, households in the most chronic kidney disease-affected rural areas of Sri Lanka used untreated groundwater for drinking and cooking, but, by 2018, that share was only 35%. About 50% of households consume water treated by reverse osmosis; others rely on piped water, water delivery by tanker and rainwater harvesting. Based on a new and representative survey of 1500 households, households’ propensities to treat drinking water and adopt improved water sources are shown to be associated with their perceptions of water safety and trust in the institutions that provide alternatives to untreated well water.  aThis work was funded by the US Department of State [grant number SLMAQM17GR2021].

Emerging evidence shows that miR-135a is down-regulated in breast cancer cells, but the functional roles of miR-135a in breast cancer cells remains unexplored. For this purpose, we investigated the expression of miR-135a in breast cancer cells and explored its functional role during breast cancer progression. In vitro study showed that miR-135a may be a novel tumor suppressor. Further studies showed that transcription factors ELK1 and ELK3 are direct target genes of miR-135a that modulates the suppressive function of miR-135a in breast cancer cells. Induced expression of miR-135a significantly downregulated the expression of ELK1 and ELK3 both at mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, the effect of miR-135a in MCF-7 and T47D cells was investigated by the overexpression of miR-135a mimics. In vitro, induced expression of miR-135a in breast cancer cells inhibited cell Proliferation and clongenicity. Moreover, a luciferase activity assay revealed that miR-135a could directly target the 3′-untranslated region (3′ UTRS) of ELK1 and ELK3 oncogenes. In addition, rescue experiment demonstrated that the promoted cell growth by transcription factors ELK1 and ELK3 was attenuated by the over-expression of miR-135a. Our study demonstrates that miR-135a regulates cell proliferation in breast cancer by targeting ELK1 and ELK3 oncogenes, and suggests that miR-135a potentially can act as a tumor suppressor.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3acarcinogenesis 3acell growth 3acell proliferation 3adisease course 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3ain vitro studies 3aluciferase 3amessenger RNA 3amicroRNA 3aneoplasm cells 3anon-coding RNA 3aoncogenes 3atranscription factors 3awomen1 aZhang, Weijie1 aWu, Mingming1 aTan, Sheng1 aZhu, Tao0 tGenes & genomics.g2018 Mar., v. 40, no. 3 p.243-251dThe Genetics Society of KoreawJournal:J000001676x1976-95717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13258-017-0624-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04914naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002700155245020900182300001600391506002800407520318300435592002803618506003703646650002303683650001303706650001403719650001503733650001703748650001103765650001103776650001903787650001003806650001403816650000903830650002403839650002203863650001303885650001103898650001603909651001103925653002003936653001603956653002203972700003103994700003504025700003604060700002804096700002404124773012504148856009004273852000904363655001204372IND60785562120221207090425.0151014e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078556212DNAL7 a10.18227/1982-8470ragro.v9i3.25022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrassato, Luciana Baú10aPopulation fluctuations of Anastrepha striata (Diptera: Tephritidae) in commercial guava orchards = Flutuação populacional de Anastrepha striata (Diptera: Tephritidae) em pomares comerciais de goiabeira  ap. 317-326.  aResource is Open Access  aThe aim of this research was to evaluate population fluctuations in Anastrepha striata (Diptera: Tephritidae) for two commercial guava orchards, cultivars Paluma and Japanesa, in an area of savanna, in Boa Vista, in the State of Roraima, Brazil, and relate these to plant phenology, relative humidity (%), temperature (°C) and rainfall in the region, from December 2011 to November 2012. The fruit flies were captured using McPhail traps, with 300 ml of 30% passion fruit juice as food bait, which was renewed every week at the time the flies were collected and taken to the Entomology Laboratory of the Federal University of Roraima to be sorted, counted, separated by sex and placed into a 70% alcohol solution for later identification of the species A. striata. The population fluctuations of the pest were calculated using the MAD index (Fly / Trap / Day) and the values for temperature (°C), relative humidity (%) and cumulative rainfall (mm). The correlation between the number of females and the climatic variables was calculated by the Pearson correlation coefficient. Using the Student t-test, the contribution of climatic factors to the population of A. striata was verified by multiple regression analysis. The greatest MAD indices for the Paluma cultivar are in April, August and September, and for the Japonesa cultivator, in April, May and July, coinciding with the fruiting period of the guava. Relative humidity has a positive influence on population fluctuations in A. striata. = Objetivou-se com esta pesquisa avaliar a flutuação populacional de Anastrepha striata (Diptera: Tephritidae) em dois pomares comerciais de goiabeira das cultivares Paluma e Japonesa, em área de savana, em Boa Vista, Roraima, além de relacioná-la com a fenologia das plantas, umidade relativa do ar (%), temperatura (°C) e pluviosidade da região, no período de dezembro de 2011 a novembro de 2012. A captura das moscas-das-frutas foi realizada por meio de armadilhas McPhail, cujo atrativo alimentar foi composto por 300 mL de suco de maracujá a 30%, sendo semanalmente renovado, ocasião em que as moscas foram coletadas e conduzidas ao Laboratório de Entomologia da Universidade Federal de Roraima para triagem, contagem, separação por sexo e acondicionamento em solução de álcool 70%, para posterior identificação da espécie A. striata. Calculou-se a flutuação populacional da referida praga através do índice MAD (Mosca/Armadilha/Dia) e dos valores de temperatura (ºC), umidade relativa (%) e precipitação pluviométrica acumulada (mm). A correlação entre o número de fêmeas e as variáveis climáticas foi calculada pelo coeficiente de correlação de Pearson. Utilizando o teste “t” de Student, a contribuição dos elementos climáticos sobre a população de A. striata foi verificada por meio da análise de regressão múltipla. Os maiores índices MAD na cultivar Paluma ocorrem nos meses de abril, agosto e setembro, enquanto na cultivar Japonesa ocorrem nos meses de abril, maio e julho, coincidindo com o período de frutificação das goiabeiras. A umidade relativa interfere positivamente na flutuação populacional de A. striata.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnastrepha striata 3aalcohols 3acultivars 3aentomology 3afruit juices 3afruits 3aguavas 3apassion fruits 3apests 3aphenology 3arain 3aregression analysis 3arelative humidity 3asavannas 3at-test 3atemperature 3aBrazil 0aNorthern Amazon 0aFruit flies 0aPsidium guajava L1 aLima, Antônio Cesar Silva1 aJoão Luiz Lopes Monteiro Neto1 aHugo Falkyner da Silva Bandeira1 aSilva, Edgley Soares da1 aStrücker, Anderson0 tAgro@mbiente on-line.g2015 Oct., v. 9, no. 3 p.317-326dUniversidade Federal de RoraimawJournal:27788x1982-84707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18227/1982-8470ragro.v9i3.25023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245016000169300001600329500001400345520135400359592002801713650001701741650002101758650002901779650001701808650001301825650001101838650001401849650003301863650001401896650000901910650001301919650001201932651001201944653002301956653002201979653002702001653002202028700001702050700001602067700001802083700001702101773013002118856008502248852000902333655001202342IND60729875920221122052515.0210303e20210316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072987592DNAL7 a10.1080/10807039.2020.17321892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChabbi, Iness10aToxic metal pollution and ecological risk assessment in superficial soils of “rural-agricultural and coastal-urban” of Monastir region, Eastern Tunisia  ap. 575-594.  aNAL-light  aSpatial variability of heavy metal concentrations namely Fe, Pb, Cu, Cd, Ni and Zn, in surface soils of Monastir region showed almost similar trends (an exception made for Fe). The spatial distribution of calculated enrichment factors showed moderate enrichment of superficial soils collected from sites located in both western (rural-agricultural) and eastern (coastal-urban) parts of the region. Contrary, superficial soils collected from sites located in the central part were characterized by a minor enrichment. Adopted chemometric approaches based on principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis highlighted the significant impact of local man-made sources (Traffic road in the costal-urban area and the motorway and railway crossing its western rural-agricultural area). Calculated geoaccumulation index values revealed that mobile source’s influence presumed by a moderate contamination in terms of Pb, Zn, Cu, Cd, and Ni. Referring to the coastal-urban area, a significant horizontal extension of contaminated sites in the western part of the region was recognized. Spatial distribution of the integrated pollution index revealed that only site neighboring the busy railway and motorway (≈0.6 km), indicated a high pollution level. Furthermore, it showed a moderate potential ecological risk for all selected metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemometrics 3acluster analysis 3aenvironmental assessment 3aheavy metals 3ahighways 3ahumans 3apollution 3aprincipal component analysis 3arailroads 3arisk 3atoxicity 3atraffic 3aTunisia 0aMonastir (Tunisia) 0asuperficial soils 0achemometric approaches 0apollution indices1 aBaati, Houda1 aDammak, Rym1 aBahloul, Moez1 aAzri, Chafai0 tHuman and ecological risk assessment.g2021 Mar. 16, v. 27, no. 3 p.575-594dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12198x1549-78607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2020.17321893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008900170300001800259520167000277592002801947650002201975650001101997650002702008650002002035650001402055650000902069650001302078650001202091650001402103650002202117650001502139650002502154650001202179650001402191650001902205650001802224650001602242651001302258653002802271653002702299653002802326700001802354700001602372700002202388700002202410700006002432773013002492856008102622852000902703655001202712IND60655625220221118001551.0190803e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065562522DNAL7 a10.1017/S13689800190007032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagourney, Emily M10aObese women’s perceptions of weight gain during pregnancy: a theory-based analysis  ap. 2228-2236.  aExcess gestational weight gain (GWG) in obese women is linked to adverse maternal outcomes and is particularly pervasive among African Americans, who have the highest obesity rates in the USA. A better understanding of culturally relevant attitudes and perceptions of GWG is needed to develop targeted interventions to prevent excess GWG among this group. Using the constructs of Social Cognitive Theory, we explored attitudes and perceptions surrounding diet and exercise among low-income obese African-American pregnant women in Baltimore. We conducted twenty-one semi-structured in-depth interviews with pregnant adult women. Participants were recruited from a referral clinic for obese pregnant women at a large urban hospital in Baltimore, MD, USA. Twenty-one low-income African-American adult females in the first two trimesters of pregnancy with BMI > 30·0 kg/m². Lack of knowledge was not the main obstacle to healthy behaviours during pregnancy. Rather, food cravings and fatigue, an unhealthy physical food environment, limited self-efficacy for controlling excessive GWG, and a lack of adequate emotional and informational support impacted women’s agency. While digital technology was discussed as a vehicle to promote maintenance of a healthy weight in pregnancy, further research is needed to test how it can be used to empower women to engage in healthy behaviours during pregnancy. Interventions to prevent excess GWG among African-American pregnant women should harness support from partners and family and must go beyond sharing of clinical knowledge to also include strategies that improve the food environment, diet quality and self-efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican Americans 3aadults 3aattitudes and opinions 3abody mass index 3acognition 3adiet 3aexercise 3afemales 3ahospitals 3aideal body weight 3ainterviews 3anutritional adequacy 3aobesity 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3aself-efficacy 3aweight gain 3aMaryland 0aGestational weight gain 0aAfrican-American women 0aSocial Cognitive Theory1 aGoodman, Dina1 aLam, Yukyan1 aHurley, Kristen M1 aHenderson, Janice1 aSurkan, Pamela J1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0334-59310 tPublic health nutrition.g2019 Aug., v. 22, no. 12 p.2228-2236dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800190007033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04484naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245018500170300001200355520227700367592002802644596004602672596005002718596004702768596007402815650002402889650001402913650001802927650002802945650001402973650001502987650001703002650002003019650001303039650001903052650001403071650001103085650001403096650001403110650002003124650001203144650001003156650002203166650003003188650001503218650002403233650001403257650001003271650002503281650001503306650001503321650001503336650001803351650000903369650002703378650001003405650002403415651001003439651001303449651001103462700002603473700006603499773011703565856008303682852000903765655001203774IND60712587420221117210223.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071258742DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-020-02585-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Anh H.

The objectives of this study were to determine the identity, prevalence, and geographic distribution of Ehrlichia and Anaplasma in naturally infected water buffalo in Thailand using PCR amplification and sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA and heat shock protein groEL genes. A total of 456 buffalo blood samples from Thailand were investigated. Species identification and genetic differentiation of intra-population and inter-population with the global isolates were conducted based on nucleotide sequences. Interplay between the infection and host factors was also assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 41% of water buffalo were found to be infected with rickettsial organisms in the family Anaplasmataceae, but Ehrlichia spp., Neorickettsia spp., and Wolbachia spp. were not found in any of the sequenced samples in this study. Female buffalo were more frequently infected with bacteria in the family Anaplasmataceae than males [71 out of 176 females (40.3%) versus 11 out of 47 males (23.4%)]. The Odds Ratio value indicated that the risk of infection for female buffalo was 2.2-fold higher than that for males (p < 0.05). We detected three haplotypes of A. marginale 16S rRNA gene and they were placed in a clade that was closely related to the A. marginale in buffalo in China; and cattle in Thailand, Uganda, and China. Homology searching of groEL sequences against the GenBank™ database using the BLASTn algorithm revealed that the obtained sequences had a high percentage similarity (98.36–99.62%) to A. platys sequences. The groEL sequences of three A. platys-like isolates were clustered in the same clade as the A. platys from the tick Rhipicephalus microplus in China. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that the apparently healthy buffalo were naturally infected by bacteria in the family Anaplasmataceae at a relatively high prevalence. We also report the finding of A. platys-like infections in water buffalo in Thailand for the first time. Water buffalo serving as the reservoir host of anaplasmosis is of concern for managing the disease control and prevention in ruminants.  aPublisher supplied data  aSTF6101331002-1cChulalongkorn University  aSecond Century FundcChulalongkorn University  aGRU 6203331007-1cChulalongkorn University  aMid-Career Research Grant 2020cNational Research Council of Thailand 3aAnaplasma marginale 3aEhrlichia 3aNeorickettsia 3aRhipicephalus microplus 3aWolbachia 3aalgorithms 3aanaplasmosis 3aanimal diseases 3abacteria 3ablood sampling 3abuffaloes 3acattle 3adatabases 3adetection 3adisease control 3afemales 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ageographical distribution 3ahaplotypes 3aheat shock proteins 3ainfection 3amales 3anucleotide sequences 3aobjectives 3aodds ratio 3aprevalence 3aribosomal RNA 3arisk 3aspecies identification 3aticks 3aveterinary medicine 3aChina 3aThailand 3aUganda1 aTiawsirisup, Sonthaya1 aKaewthamasorn, Morakot1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3072-87080 tBMC veterinary research.g2020 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.380-380dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-020-02585-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005200147245013500199300001200334520088300346592002801229650002201257650001801279650001501297650002601312650001401338650001801352650002101370650001201391650001101403650002301414650001501437650000901452650002401461650001001485650001901495650001601514651001301530700001801543700002201561700003501583700001801618773015101636856008201787852000901869655001201878IND60591964420221117041159.0180619e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059196442DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-018-6615-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Asad1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5164-794210aSpatial modeling of rat bites and prediction of rat infestation in Peshawar valley using binomial kriging with logistic regression  ap. 245.  aIn this study, we propose to develop a geostatistical computational framework to model the distribution of rat bite infestation of epidemic proportion in Peshawar valley, Pakistan. Two species Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus are suspected to spread the infestation. The framework combines strengths of maximum entropy algorithm and binomial kriging with logistic regression to spatially model the distribution of infestation and to determine the individual role of environmental predictors in modeling the distribution trends. Our results demonstrate the significance of a number of social and environmental factors in rat infestations such as (I) high human population density; (II) greater dispersal ability of rodents due to the availability of better connectivity routes such as roads, and (III) temperature and precipitation influencing rodent fecundity and life cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRattus norvegicus 3aRattus rattus 3aalgorithms 3aenvironmental factors 3afecundity 3ageostatistics 3ahuman population 3akriging 3amodels 3apopulation density 3aprediction 3arats 3aregression analysis 3aroads 3asocial factors 3atemperature 3aPakistan1 aZaidi, Farrah1 aFatima, SyedaHira1 aKātibī, Muḥammad ʻAdnān,1 aUllah, Saleem0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2018 Apr., v. 190, no. 4 p.245-245dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-6615-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02152naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245008600160500001400246520106300260592002801323650001301351650001401364650002401378650001301402650001101415650002101426650002101447650000901468650000801477700002001485700001901505700002501524700002401549773012201573856007401695852000901769655001201778IND60729381420221119220402.0210228e20210206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072938142DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130205372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLondzin, Piotr 10aPotential of Caffeine in Alzheimer’s Disease—A Review of Experimental Studies  aNAL-light  aAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia leading to progressive memory loss and cognitive impairment. Considering that pharmacological treatment options for AD are few and not satisfactory, increasing attention is being paid to dietary components that may affect the development of the disease. Such a dietary component may be caffeine contained in coffee, tea or energy drinks. Although epidemiological data suggest that caffeine intake may counteract the development of cognitive impairment, results of those studies are not conclusive. The aim of the present study is to review the existing experimental studies on the efficacy of caffeine against AD and AD-related cognitive impairment, focusing on the proposed protective mechanisms of action. In conclusion, the reports of studies on experimental AD models generally supported the notion that caffeine may exert some beneficial effects in AD. However, further studies are necessary to elucidate the role of caffeine in the effects of its sources on cognition and possibly AD risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3acaffeine 3acognition 3acognitive disorders 3adementia 3aenergy 3afood composition 3amemory disorders 3arisk 3atea1 aZamora, Milena 1 aKąkol, Beata 1 aTaborek, Aleksandra 1 aFolwarczna, Joanna 0 tNutrients.g2021 Feb. 06, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130205373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01932naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245008900184300001800273520090400291592002801195650001401223650001501237650002501252650002301277650001201300650002601312650005001338700001801388700001501406773011601421856004801537852000901585655001201594IND50088758220221120141737.0140415e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008875822DNAL7 a245324422pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-014-0729-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jinghan10aMixotrophic Cultivation of Microalgae for Biodiesel Production: Status and Prospects  ap. 3307-3329.  aBiodiesel from microalgae provides a promising alternative for biofuel production. Microalgae can be produced under three major cultivation modes, namely photoautotrophic cultivation, heterotrophic cultivation, and mixotrophic cultivation. Potentials and practices of biodiesel production from microalgae have been demonstrated mostly focusing on photoautotrophic cultivation; mixotrophic cultivation of microalgae for biodiesel production has rarely been reviewed. This paper summarizes the mechanisms and virtues of mixotrophic microalgae cultivation through comparison with other major cultivation modes. Influencing factors of microalgal biodiesel production under mixotrophic cultivation are presented, development of combining microalgal biodiesel production with wastewater treatment is especially reviewed, and bottlenecks and strategies for future commercial production are also identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3amicroalgae 3awastewater treatment 2aBiofuelsxanalysis 2aBiomass 2aBiotechnologyxtrends 2aMicroalgaexgrowth & developmentxmetabolism.1 aYang, Haizhen1 aWang, Feng0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2014 Apr., v. 172, no. 7 p.3307-3329dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-014-0729-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001700161245007700178300001600255500000900271520172700280592002802007650002202035650001502057650001302072650001402085650001402099650001602113650001902129650001402148650001302162650001002175700001902185773014802204856009602352852000902448655001202457IND60669663820221120165414.0191125e199301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066966382DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1993.03615995005700010022x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShann, J.

The objective of this study was to investigate the response of six wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars, having a demonstrated differential tolerance to Al under field conditions, to mononuclear and polynuclear Al when exposed in a solution culture bioassay system. The order of cultivar tolerance to mononuclear Al observed in this investigation was ‘Yecora Rojo’ > ‘Titan’> ‘Caldwell’> ‘Wampum’> ‘Hart,’ which is identical to that reported for these cultivars grown in acid soils. This observation demonstrates the utility of the hydroponic bioassay technique as a simple and effective means for screening genetically diverse plants for Al tolerance. Consistent with some previous reports, polynuclear Al was found to be much more toxic to all of the wheat cultivars studied than mononuclear Al, yet, in contrast to the limited data on polynuclear Al toxicity to wheat cultivars differing in Al tolerance, some differential response among cultivars was noted. The order of cultivar tolerance to polynuclear Al generally agreed with that of mononuclear Al, at least at the highest concentration of polynuclear Al, i.e., 7 µM. Based on the nature of the partially neutralized Al stock solutions utilized, we concluded that the toxic polynuclear Al component is the Al₁₃ species.

D.10aBiological lignocellulose solubilization: comparative evaluation of biocatalysts and enhancement via cotreatment  ap. 8.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Feedstock recalcitrance is the most important barrier impeding cost-effective production of cellulosic biofuels. Pioneer commercial cellulosic ethanol facilities employ thermochemical pretreatment and addition of fungal cellulase, reflecting the main research emphasis in the field. However, it has been suggested that it may be possible to process cellulosic biomass without thermochemical pretreatment using thermophilic, cellulolytic bacteria. To further explore this idea, we examine the ability of various biocatalysts to solubilize autoclaved but otherwise unpretreated cellulosic biomass under controlled but not industrial conditions. RESULTS: Carbohydrate solubilization of mid-season harvested switchgrass after 5 days ranged from 24 % for Caldicellulosiruptor bescii to 65 % for Clostridium thermocellum, with intermediate values for a thermophilic horse manure enrichment, Clostridium clariflavum, Clostridium cellulolyticum, and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) featuring a fungal cellulase cocktail and yeast. Under a variety of conditions, solubilization yields were about twice as high for C. thermocellum compared to fungal cellulase. Solubilization of mid-season harvested switchgrass was about twice that of senescent switchgrass. Lower yields and greater dependence on particle size were observed for Populus as compared to switchgrass. Trends observed from data drawn from six conversion systems and three substrates, including both time course and end-point data, were (1) equal fractional solubilization of glucan and xylan, (2) no biological solubilization of the non-carbohydrate fraction of biomass, and (3) higher solubilization for three of the four bacterial cultures tested as compared to the fungal cellulase system. Brief (5 min) ball milling of solids remaining after fermentation of senescent switchgrass by C. thermocellum nearly doubled carbohydrate solubilization upon reinnoculation as compared to a control without milling. Greater particle size reduction and solubilization were observed for milling of partially fermented solids than for unfermented solids. Physical disruption of cellulosic feedstocks after initiation of fermentation, termed cotreatment, warrants further study. CONCLUSIONS: While the ability to achieve significant solubilization of minimally pretreated switchgrass is widespread, a fivefold difference between the most and least effective biocatalyst—feedstock combinations was observed. Starting with nature’s best biomass-solubilizing systems may enable a reduction in the amount of non-biological processing required, and in particular substitution of cotreatment for pretreatment.  aPublisher supplied data  aSubcontract No. 4000114284cBioEnergy Science Center (BESC), Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR227250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCaldicellulosiruptor bescii 3aClostridium cellulolyticum 3aClostridium thermocellum 3aPanicum virgatum 3aPopulus 3aautoclaving 3abiocatalysts 3abioethanol 3abiomass 3acellulolytic microorganisms 3acost effectiveness 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3afeedstocks 3afermentation 3aglucans 3ahorse manure 3alignocellulose 3amilling 3aparticle size 3asaccharification 3asolubilization 3axylan 3ayeasts1 aGuseva, Anna1 aHammer, Sarah K.1 aGjersing, Erica1 aDavis, Mark F.1 aDavison, Brian H.1 aOlstad, Jessica1 aDonohoe, Bryon S.1 aNguyễn, Thành Yến,1 aWyman, Charles E.1 aPattathil, Sivakumar1 aHahn, Michael G.1 aLynd, Lee R.0 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2016 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.8-8dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350543x1754-68347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13068-015-0412-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007200170300001400242520175600256592002802012650001302040650001902053650002002072653002902092653002802121653004502149653002102194653002302215653001702238700001802255700001502273700001902288773011102307856008502418852000902503655001202512IND60628865420221121060829.0190516e20190524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062886542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2019.01.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGritti, Fabrice10aOn the performance of conically shaped columns: Theory and practice  ap. 34-46.  aThe chromatographic performance (speed, efficiency, and gradient peak capacity for the same analysis time) of conical columns are investigated from fundamental and experimental viewpoints. A stainless steel, conically shaped column (2.1 mm i.d/4.2 mm i.d. × 15 cm long, 0.4° opening angle) was prepared in-house and packed with 5 μm XBridge-C18 fully porous particles. Its performance was compared to that of a conventional 3.0 mm × 15 cm cylindrical column packed with the same batch of particles. Both Giddings’ theory of non-uniform columns and experiments agree and show that, irrespective of flow direction, the conical column is 15% less efficient than the conventional column. Remarkably, Blumberg's theory of band broadening in gradient elution mode predicts that conical columns may outperform conventional cylindrical columns if the ratio of their outlet i.d. to their inlet i.d. is 0.95 and 0.80 for small molecule and peptide mixtures, respectively. The maximum relative gain is marginal as it does not exceed a few percents. The theory reveals that the flow direction should be from the wide to the narrow end of the conical column in order to deliver the highest peak capacity. In agreement with the theory, the observed losses in absolute peak capacity for the same analysis time are 14.5% (narrow to wide end) and only 11.0% (wide to the narrow end) for small molecules (n-alkanophenones). They are 14.2% (narrow to wide end) and only 8.5% (wide to the narrow end) for peptide samples (bombesin). Additionally, conical columns reduce peak tailing with respect to standard columns. They are suitable column technology for ultra-fast gradient separations as they also minimize sample dispersion through the narrow i.d. outlet frit.  aPublisher supplied data 3abombesin 3achromatography 3astainless steel 0aConically shaped columns 0aGradient chromatography 0aPeak capacity for the same analysis time 0aPeak compression 0aPeptide separation 0aPeak tailing1 aBelanger, Jon1 aIzzo, Gary1 aLeveille, Wade0 tJournal of chromatography.g2019 May 24, v. 1593 p.34-46dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2019.01.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245006800173300002100241520103600262592002801298650000801326650001601334650002001350650003401370650001301404650001101417650001901428650001601447653001701463653002601480653001501506653001401521653001001535653001801545700001801563700002601581700002001607773011001627856008501737852000901822655001201831IND60633143320221119182728.0190321e20190321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063314332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2019.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaldonado, Rodrigo10aNucleosomes Stabilize ssRNA-dsDNA Triple Helices in Human Cells  ap. 1243-1254.e6.  aChromatin-associated non-coding RNAs modulate the epigenetic landscape and its associated gene expression program. The formation of triple helices is one mechanism of sequence-specific targeting of RNA to chromatin. With this study, we show an important role of the nucleosome and its relative positioning to the triplex targeting site (TTS) in stabilizing RNA-DNA triplexes in vitro and in vivo. Triplex stabilization depends on the histone H3 tail and the location of the TTS close to the nucleosomal DNA entry-exit site. Genome-wide analysis of TTS-nucleosome arrangements revealed a defined chromatin organization with an enrichment of arrangements that allow triplex formation at active regulatory sites and accessible chromatin. We further developed a method to monitor nucleosome-RNA triplexes in vivo (TRIP-seq), revealing RNA binding to TTS sites adjacent to nucleosomes. Our data strongly support an activating role for RNA triplex-nucleosome complexes, pinpointing triplex-mediated epigenetic regulation in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aepigenetics 3agene expression 3agenome-wide association study 3ahistones 3ahumans 3anon-coding RNA 3anucleosomes 0atriple helix 0atriplex forming oligo 0anucleosome 0achromatin 0ancRNA 0ahistone tails1 aSchwartz, Uwe1 aSilberhorn, Elisabeth1 aLängst, Gernot0 tMolecular cell.g2019 Mar. 21, v. 73, no. 6 p.1243-1254.e6dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2019.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245011400178520142700292592002801719650001801747650001601765650001901781650001201800650001501812650001901827653003601846653002501882653003301907653001901940653001201959700002201971700002201993700002002015773009002035856009002125852000902215655001202224IND60767251320221119102649.0220509e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076725132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2022.1068572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhazimoradi, Mehdi10aCharacterizing the macroscopic response and local deformation mechanisms of a unidirectional non-crimp fabric  aThe macroscopic response and local deformation mechanisms of a warp stitched heavy-tow unidirectional non-crimp fabric (UD-NCF) was characterized. Quasi-static uniaxial tests captured the fabric in-plane longitudinal, transverse, and shear deformation response where digital image correlation was employed. The fabric bending response was captured through modified cantilever tests. Off-axis extension tests conducted along 30°, 45° and 60° bias directions revealed that extension and contraction of the polyester stitching web and resulting transverse compression of the carbon fiber tows and inter-tow sliding were the dominant local deformation mechanisms. At a bias angle of 30°, the extent of inter-tow sliding increased when compared to a bias angle of 45° leading to earlier onset of fabric shear locking, while at a bias angle of 60° shear locking also occurred sooner. Shear angle maps and strain profiles at different bias angles further revealed the notable inter-dependency between the fabric shear, longitudinal and transverse deformations, which was governed by the interactions between the stitching and carbon fiber tows. The distinct out-of-plane bending behavior of the fabric reinforcement along longitudinal and transverse directions was also captured and quantified. The study provided a comprehensive characterization of the UD-NCF, which is critical for the development of constitutive models.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon fibers 3adeformation 3adigital images 3afabrics 3apolyesters 3athermodynamics 0aUnidirectional non-crimp fabric 0aMacroscopic response 0aLocal deformation mechanisms 0aIn-plane shear 0aBending1 aTrejo, Eleazar A.1 aButcher, Clifford1 aMontesano, John0 tComposites.g2022 May, v. 156 p.106857-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12034x1359-835X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2022.1068573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245010700172520115600279592002801435650002301463650002501486650001301511650001101524650001901535650001801554650001901572650001101591650001501602650001201617650001301629653001601642653001901658653002701677700002001704700002001724700001801744700002301762773009001785856009001875852000901965655001201974IND60767251420221119101237.0220509e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076725142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2022.1068592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlores, Mark10aExperimental analysis of polymer matrix composite microstructures under transverse compression loading  aStrengthening the fundamental understanding of micromechanical methods in continuity is a critical aspect in developing and designing future composite systems. Virtual testing has provided additional understanding of the behavior of materials on a microstructural scale. However, experiments must be executed to determine their validity. Modeling realistic microstructures under realistic loading conditions could help develop physically based micromechanical constitutive laws needed to predict their intrinsic failure. In this study, a micropillar with varying sizes was manufactured out of continuous fiber reinforced composites and transversely compressed to observe micromechanical phenomena. The fiber shape, size, and distribution were recorded as well as stress vs strain curves for each size of micropillar. The specimens were speckled to perform 2D digital image correlation (DIC) to analyze displacement and strain contours of the surface. The results from this study provides basic knowledge of microstructural instabilities, effects of nanovoids, interfacial debonded and matrix crack formation while under transverse compressive loading.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3acompression strength 3acracking 3adesign 3adigital images 3amanufacturing 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3aprediction 3astrains 3asurfaces 0aIn Situ SEM 0aMicromechanics 0aTransverse Compression1 aSharits, Andrew1 aWheeler, Robert1 aSesar, Nathan1 aMollenhauer, David0 tComposites.g2022 May, v. 156 p.106859-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12034x1359-835X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2022.1068593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245015300176300001400329520166100343592002802004650001302032650002102045650001102066650001402077653002002091653002102111653001702132653002402149653001402173700002102187700001602208773012502224856008802349852000902437655001202446IND60531707620221118204037.0200221e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053170762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2016.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenckens, M.L.C.M.10aHow can we adapt to geological scarcity of antimony? Investigation of antimony's substitutability and of other measures to achieve a sustainable use  ap. 54-62.  aAntimony is an element that is applied in many useful applications for mankind. However, antimony resources are very scarce, when comparing the current extraction rates with the availability of antimony containing ores. From an inter-temporal sustainability perspective, current generations should not deprive future generations from extractable ores. The extraction rate of a mineral resource is defined sustainable, if such a rate can be sustained for 1000 years assuming the same consumption per capita in all countries of the world. To achieve a sustainable extraction of antimony, it is necessary to reduce the current extraction with 96% compared to the primary antimony extraction in 2010. We have investigated whether such an ambitious extraction reduction goal would be technically feasible, without losing any of the current services that are provided by antimony. Reduction of the use of primary antimony can be achieved through (a combination of) substitution, improved material efficiency and recycling. Because the potential of material efficiency and recycling are limited in the case of antimony, the focus is on substitution of antimony in its applications.The major application of antimony (more than 50%) is in flame retardants. It appears that about 95% of antimony in flame retardants can be replaced by other components or systems. Overall, the substitutability of antimony in all its applications is estimated at around 90%.The required additional extraction reduction needs to be realized by improved material efficiency and further recycling, especially from the remaining antimony containing flame retardants and from lead-alloys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimony 3aflame retardants 3apeople 3arecycling 0aSustainable use 0aPrimary antimony 0aSubstitution 0aMaterial efficiency 0aRecycling1 aDriessen, P.P.J.1 aWorrell, E.0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2016 Mar.,  Apr., v. 108 p.54-62dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2016.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007700164300001800241520141400259592002801673650001701701650002801718650000801746650001501754650001401769650001101783650001001794650001001804650001501814650003301829650002201862650001401884650001401898650001601912650002201928650001201950650001001962650001201972651001001984700002101994700001802015700001802033700002602051700001702077700001702094700001902111773010102130856008102231852000902312655001202321IND60133404920221121051225.0150520e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013340492DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-015-0441-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Feifei,10aNew Ceratocystis species from Eucalyptus and Cunninghamia in South China  ap. 1451-1473.  aDuring routine surveys for possible fungal pathogens in the rapidly expanding plantations of Eucalyptus and Cunninghamia lanceolata in China, numerous isolates of unknown species in the genus Ceratocystis (Microascales) were obtained from tree wounds. In this study we identified the Ceratocystis isolates from Eucalyptus and Cunninghamia in the GuangDong, GuangXi, FuJian and HaiNan Provinces of South China based on morphology and through comparisons of DNA sequence data for the ITS, partial β-tubulin and TEF-1α gene regions. Morphological and DNA sequence comparisons revealed two previously unknown species residing in the Indo-Pacific Clade. These are described here as Ceratocystis cercfabiensis sp. nov. and Ceratocystis collisensis sp. nov. Isolates of Ceratocystis cercfabiensis showed intragenomic variation in their ITS sequences and four strains were selected for cloning of the ITS gene region. Twelve ITS haplotypes were obtained from 17 clones selected for sequencing, differing in up to seven base positions and representing two separate phylogenetic groups. This is the first evidence of multiple ITS types in isolates of Ceratocystis residing in the Indo-Pacific Clade. Caution should thus be exercised when using the ITS gene region as a barcoding marker for Ceratocystis species in this clade. This study also represents the first record of a species of Ceratocystis from Cunninghamia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeratocystis 3aCunninghamia lanceolata 3aDNA 3aEucalyptus 3abarcoding 3aclones 3afungi 3agenes 3ahaplotypes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amolecular cloning 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3aplantations 3asequence analysis 3asurveys 3atrees 3atubulin 3aChina1 aMbenoun, Michael1 aBarnes, Irene1 aRoux, Jolanda1 aWingfield, Michael J.1 aLi, Guoqing,1 aLi, JieQiong1 aChen, ShuaiFei0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2015 June, v. 107, no. 6 p.1451-1473dSpringer-Verlagx0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-015-0441-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001800161245010700179300001600286500000900302520127900311592002801590650001201618650000901630650001501639650001501654650001601669650001401685650002001699650001401719650000901733650002101742650002001763650001301783651001301796700001701809773014801826856009601974852000902070655001202079IND60669664020221120165241.0191125e195404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066966402DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1954.03615995001800020008x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcLean, E.

The study dealt with Lakeland loamy fine sand, Ruston sandy loam, Crowley silt loam, Houston clay, Sharkey clay soils and the <.2 µ clay, the <25 µ clay, and the crude humic acid fractions extracted from the Sharkey clay soil. The characteristic curves resulting from the plotting of the fractions of K active at various K-Ca saturations of the soils and extracted materials were prepared. Comparison of these curves with those of the individual clay minerals made possible the characterization of the soils and the extracts with respect to which clay minerals appeared to predominate in them. The results indicate that kaolinite clay dominates the regulation of cationic interactions in the Lakeland, Ruston,a nd Crowley soils. Beidellite appears to predominate in the Houston and Sharkey soils. Montmorillonite seems to play the major role in the < 25 µ clay from the Sharkey, but the beidellite evidently masks the effect of the montmorillonite in the < .2 µ clay and in the whole soil. The crude humic acid from the Sharkey gave no evidence of any appreciable effect upon the cationic interactions of the whole soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3aclay 3aclay soils 3aelectrodes 3ahumic acids 3akaolinite 3amontmorillonite 3apotassium 3asand 3asandy loam soils 3asilt loam soils 3asmectite 3aArkansas1 aBaker, F.

Interactions between members of these communities often determine the state of the habitat in which they live. When these habitats include sites on the human body, these interactions can affect health and disease. Polymicrobial synergy can occur during infection, in which the combined effect of two or more microbes on disease is worse than seen with any of the individuals alone. Powerful genomic methods are increasingly used to study microbial communities, including metagenomics to reveal the members and genetic content of a community and metatranscriptomics to describe the activities of community members. Recent efforts focused toward a mechanistic understanding of these interactions have led to a better appreciation of the precise bases of polymicrobial synergy in communities containing bacteria, eukaryotic microbes, and/or viruses. These studies have benefited from advances in the development of in vivo models of polymicrobial infection and modern techniques to profile the spatial and chemical bases of intermicrobial communication. This review describes the breadth of mechanisms microbes use to interact in ways that impact pathogenesis and techniques to study polymicrobial communities.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abacteria 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3ametagenomics 3amicrobial communities 3amodels 3apathogenesis 3aviruses1 aConnell, Jodi L.1 aStacy, Apollo1 aTurner, Keith H.1 aWhiteley, Marvin0 tjournal of microbiology.g2014 Mar., v. 52, no. 3 p.188-199dSpringer-Verlagx1225-88737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12275-014-4067-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007300164300001800237520122800255592002801483650002401511650001101535650001601546650001701562650001001579650001101589650001001600650003301610650001101643650002201654650001701676650001001693650002001703650001401723650000901737653002401746653001601770653002601786653001801812653001601830700005901846700001801905700001801923773013001941856008102071852000902152655001202161IND60540092420221118142207.0190318e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054009242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2015.03.0962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerta, Marco10aEffect of viscoelasticity on foam development in zein–starch dough  ap. 1229-1235.  aAbove the zein glass transition temperature (∼40 °C), the viscoelasticity of zein–starch dough is similar to that of gluten. This is of interest because this dough might be used to develop gluten-free products, although it has certain limitations such as workability and aging at room temperature. The most effective way to decrease the dough glass transition temperature is to use a plasticizer, which also influences the viscosity. In this study, viscoelastic zein–starch dough samples were prepared with several concentrations of citric acid as the plasticizer, and the effect of viscoelasticity on crumb structure formation during baking was investigated. Extensional viscosity was correlated with the average bubble size after baking. We found that viscosity could be predicted for this system by measuring the shear viscosity, whereby the Trouton ratio was near-constant for the range of plasticizer concentrations investigated. In addition, our dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) revealed that bubble growth occurs mainly when the dough reaches 100 °C, due to a combination of steam formation and thermal softening of the matrix. At higher temperatures, hardening occurs due to drying and zein crosslinking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abaking 3acitric acid 3acrosslinking 3adough 3adrying 3afoams 3aglass transition temperature 3agluten 3agluten-free foods 3aplasticizers 3asteam 3aviscoelasticity 3aviscosity 3azein 0aZein–starch dough 0aGluten-free 0aExtensional viscosity 0aBubble growth 0aPlasticizer1 aGmoser, Rebecca1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0923-10971 aKrona, Annika1 aStading, Mats0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2015 Oct., v. 63, no. 2 p.1229-1235dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2015.03.0963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03305naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245018000173300001600353520169200369592002802061650001302089650002902102650001202131650001102143650001602154650002002170650000902190650000902199650001402208650001802222650002002240650000702260650001202267650003302279650001102312650001302323650001302336650001402349650001702363650001602380653002202396653001302418653001302431653001202444653001302456653001302469700002302482700001902505700001702524773010402541856008502645852000902730655001202739IND60635766020221122161800.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063576602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2019.03.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdel Rahman, R.O.10aOptimizing the removal of strontium and cesium ions from binary solutions on magnetic nano-zeolite using response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN)  ap. 397-410.  aThe feasibility of using magnetic nano-zeolite (MNZ) to remove cesium and strontium from their binary corrosive solutions was investigated by considering the multi-variant/multi-objective nature of the process. RSM (Response Surface Methodology) and ANN (Artificial Neural Network) were used to model and optimize the removal system and assess sensitive parameters that can affect the process reliability. MNZ is characterized by its high surface area and cation exchange capacity and possesses good regeneration behavior for both elements using citric acid. Its stability is comparable to other sorbents in acidic media and the stability increases in alkaline media, where dissolution rate follow first order reaction on heterogeneous sites. MNZ removes both contaminants simultaneously with small tendency toward Cs, where MNZ is suggested for application in pre-treatment of highly contaminated alkaline solutions. The percentage removal, decontamination factors, and separation factors have different dependency on the effluent/process conditions; this dependency is the same for both contaminants. Sorption kinetics is initially controlled by external mass transfer through the boundaries then intra-particle diffusion dominates the reactions. The process sensitivity to pH changes is attributed to changes in structural elements -species distribution at the solid/aqueous interface. Cs+ and Sr+2 are exchanged with Na+ and H+, regardless the effluent pH value, and with Al and Fe cations at specific pH. Isosteric heat of sorption calculations indicated that the total heat needed to complete the reaction was considerably reduced by operating the process at optimized temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acation exchange capacity 3acations 3acesium 3acitric acid 3adecontamination 3aheat 3airon 3amagnetism 3amass transfer 3aneural networks 3apH 3aprotons 3aresponse surface methodology 3asodium 3asorbents 3asorption 3astrontium 3asurface area 3atemperature 0aRadioactive waste 0aModeling 0aSorption 0aZeolite 0aKinetics 0aIsotherm1 aAbdel Moamen, O.A.1 aAbdelmonem, N.1 aIsmail, I.M.0 tEnvironmental research.g2019 June, v. 173 p.397-410dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2019.03.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014000170300001400310520156400324592002801888650001801916650001401934650001001948650001901958650001301977650002501990650001702015650001002032650002002042650002902062650004102091650002302132650001202155650001702167650002102184650001202205650000902217650002302226650001702249650002102266653002402287653002202311653002702333653002202360700001902382700001702401700002202418700002202440700002102462700005902483773012702542856008502669852000902754655001202763IND60628865720221121041523.0190328e20190426xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062886572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2019.01.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhadra, Subrata10aAnalysis of potential cyanide antidote, dimethyl trisulfide, in whole blood by dynamic headspace gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy  ap. 71-78.  aCyanide is a rapidly acting and highly toxic chemical. It inhibits cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, resulting in cellular hypoxia, cytotoxic anoxia and potentially death. In order to overcome challenges associated with current cyanide antidotes, dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS), which converts cyanide to less toxic thiocyanate in vivo, has gained much attention recently as a promising next-generation cyanide antidote. While there are three analysis methods available for DMTS, they each have significant disadvantages. Hence, in this study, a dynamic headspace (DHS) gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy method was developed for the analysis of DMTS from rabbit whole blood. The method is extremely simple, involving only acidification of a blood sample, addition of an internal standard (DMTS-d6) and DHS-GC–MS analysis. The method produced a limit of detection of 0.04 μM for DMTS with dynamic range from 0.2 to 50 μM. Inter- and intraassay accuracy (100 ± 15% and 100 ± 9%, respectively), and precision (<10% and <9% relative standard deviation, respectively) were good. The validated method performed well during pharmacokinetic analysis of DMTS from the blood of rats treated with DMTS, producing excellent pharmacokinetic parameters for the treatment of cyanide exposure. The method produced significant advantages over current methods for analysis of DMTS and should be considered as a “gold standard” method for further development of DMTS as a potential next-generation cyanide countermeasure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aantidotes 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3acyanides 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3acytotoxicity 3adeath 3adetection limit 3aelectron transport chain 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheadspace analysis 3ahypoxia 3amitochondria 3apharmacokinetics 3arabbits 3arats 3astandard deviation 3athiocyanates 3atoxic substances 0aDimethyl trisulfide 0aDynamic headspace 0aCyanide countermeasure 0aMethod validation1 aZhang, Zhiling1 aZhou, Wenhui1 aOchieng, Fredrick1 aRockwood, Gary A.1 aLippner, Dennean1 aLogue, Brian A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2400-93390 tJournal of chromatography.g2019 Apr. 26, v. 1591 p.71-78dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2019.01.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03355naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002000167245010600187300001600293520148400309592002801793650002501821650001901846650002501865650001001890650002401900650001301924650001301937650004301950650002901993650001202022650002802034650002502062650003102087650001002118650004502128650004002173650003102213650004002244653001202284653001902296653002702315653002102342653002002363653001702383700001902400700002302419700002002442700002002462700001702482700001402499700001702513773013102530856008302661852000902744655001202753IND60114080220221118022152.0190318e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011408022DNAL7 a230172552pmid7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2012.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPratheesh, M.D.10aIsolation, culture and characterization of caprine mesenchymal stem cells derived from amniotic fluid  ap. 313-319.  aAmniotic fluid (AF) represents heterologous cell types and a specific group of these cells show high growth rate and multipotent characteristics. The aim of the present study was to culture and fully characterize the putative stem cell population isolated from caprine mesenchymal stem cells. Plastic adherent fibroblastoid cell population could be successfully isolated from the caprine amniotic fluid. In vitro expanded caprine amniotic fluid derived mesenchymal stem cells (cAF-MSCs) showed high proliferation ratio with a doubling time of 33.1h and stained positive for alkaline phosphatase. Relative transcript abundance of CD-73, CD-90 and CD-105 surface markers were analyzed by SYBR green based real time PCR and their respective proteins were localized through immunocytochemistry, however cAF-MSCs were found negative for haematopoietic marker CD-34. When exposed to corresponding induction condition, cAF-MSCs differentiated into osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages which was confirmed through von Kossa, Oil Red O and Alcian blue staining respectively. Furthermore, these cells were found positive for undifferentiated embryonic stem cell markers like Oct-4, Nanog, Sox-2, SSEA-1 and SSEA-4 which accentuate their pluripotent property. In conclusion, caprine amniotic fluid represents a promising source of mesenchymal stem cells with high proliferative and differentiation potential and these cells offer their scope for multiple regenerative therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aamniotic fluid 3aembryonic stem cells 3agoats 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aplastics 3aproteins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 2aAmniotic Fluidxcytology 2aAnimals 2aCell Culture Techniques 2aCell Differentiation 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGoats 2aMembrane Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMesenchymal Stem Cellsxphysiology. 2aRNAxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 0aCaprine 0aAmniotic fluid 0aMesenchymal stem cells 0aCharacterization 0aDifferentiation 0aPluripotency1 aGade, Nitin E.1 aKatiyar, Amar Nath1 aDubey, Pawan K.1 aSharma, Bhaskar1 aSaikumar, G.1 aAmarpal, 1 aSharma, G.T.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2013 Apr., v. 94, no. 2 p.313-319dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.wJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2012.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001800180245008500198506007600283520127800359592002801637506003701665650002101702650001101723650001401734650001901748650001901767650001601786650000801802650002101810650002501831650002501856650001601881650002501897650001001922651001101932700002101943700002201964700002401986700001602010773012202026856007302148852000902221655001202230IND60650073420221207125241.0190709e20161031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065007342DNAL7 a10.3390/nu81106892doi7 aPMC51330772pmcid7 a278092362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGazan, Rozenn10aDrinking Water Intake Is Associated with Higher Diet Quality among French Adults  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study aimed to examine the association between drinking water intake and diet quality, and to analyse the adherence of French men and women to the European Food Safety Authority 2010 Adequate Intake (EFSA AI). A representative sample of French adults (≥18) from the Individual and National Survey on Food Consumption (INCA2) was classified, by sex, into small, medium, and large drinking water consumers. Diet quality was assessed with several nutritional indices (mean adequacy ratio (MAR), mean excess ratio (MER), probability of adequate intakes (PANDiet), and solid energy density (SED)). Of the total sample, 72% of men and 46% of women were below the EFSA AI. This percentage of non-adherence decreased from the small to the large drinking water consumers (from 95% to 34% in men and from 81% to 9% in women). For both sexes, drinking water intake was associated with higher diet quality (greater MAR and PANDiet). This association remained significant independently of socio-economic status for women only. Low drinking water consumers did not compensate with other sources (beverages and food moisture) and a high drinking water intake was not a guarantee for reaching the EFSA AI, meaning that increasing consumption of water should be encouraged in France.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAdequate Intakes 3aadults 3abeverages 3adrinking water 3aenergy density 3afood safety 3amen 3anational surveys 3anutrition assessment 3anutritional adequacy 3aprobability 3asocioeconomic status 3awomen 3aFrance1 aSondey, Juliette1 aMaillot, Matthieu1 aGuelinckx, Isabelle1 aLluch, Anne0 tNutrients.g2016 Oct. 31, v. 8, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu81106893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011800168300001600286520140300302592002801705650002101733650001501754650001501769650002201784650002001806650001201826650003101838650001501869650001701884650001101901650001501912650001901927650001801946650000701964650001801971650001501989650001402004650000902018650002302027650001702050650002002067650001502087700001802102700002102120700002502141700001802166700001902184773010402203856008502307852000902392655001202401IND60635766220221122161822.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063576622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2019.03.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlhan, Sarita10aPotential use of ZnO@activated carbon nanocomposites for the adsorptive removal of Cd2+ ions in aqueous solutions  ap. 411-418.  aNowadays, the pollution in water resources has become a major concern, both environmentally and in perspective of human health. The bioaccumulation of pollutants, especially heavy metal ions through the food chain, poses a hazardous risk to humans and other living organisms. Nanomaterials and their composites have been recognized for their potential to resolve such problems. Herein, ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized via different microscopic/spectroscopic techniques. ZnO nanoparticles (i.e., 20 to 50 nm) were obtained in high yield via a facile chemical approach. The ratio of ZnO nanoparticles and activated carbon was optimized to achieve enhanced electrostatic interactions for the effective adsorption of cadmium ions (Cd2+). The adsorptive performance of the nanocomposite was further assessed in relation to several key parameters (e.g., contact time, solution pH, and adsorbent/adsorbate dosage). The nanocomposites (1 mg/ml) offered amaximum adsorption capacity of 96.2 mg/g for Cd2+ ions as confirmed through adsorption isotherms for a best interpretation of the adsorption phenomenon. The favourable adsorption capacity of the synthesized ZnO/activated carbon (9:1) nanocomposites supported their use as an efficient sorbent material in practical performance metrics (e.g., partition coefficient of 0.54 mg g−1μM−1) for the adsorption of Cd2+ ions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3abioaccumulation 3acadmium 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afood chain 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3ametal ions 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aparticle size 3apollutants 3apollution 3arisk 3asorption isotherms 3aspectroscopy 3awater resources 3azinc oxide1 aNehra, Monika1 aDilbaghi, Neeraj1 aSinghal, Nitin Kumar1 aKim, Ki Hyun,1 aKumar, Sandeep0 tEnvironmental research.g2019 June, v. 173 p.411-418dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2019.03.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03518naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012100167300001300288520206900301592002802370650001902398650001502417650001602432650000902448650001402457650002802471650002202499650001702521650002302538650001802561650001102579650001502590650002502605650001402630650001502644653001502659653001802674653001602692653000802708653001602716653002502732700001502757700001802772700001702790773011102807856008502918852000903003655001203012IND60628865920221121065853.0190425e20190607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062886592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2019.01.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQian, Wenbin10aModeling of the static batch desorption and dynamic column elution of geniposidic acid from a porous anion-exchanger  ap. 1-12.  aFor several decades, plenty of iridoid glycosides including geniposide (GS) and geniposidic acid (GSA) in the gardenia yellow pigment extraction waste water was not recovered effectively. This study is aimed to supply an efficient GSA recycling route. In this study, a model incorporating a superficial desorption rate constant was applied to the batch GSA desorption process, i.e., recycling, for verification. Then, the model was further developed to research the feasibility in dynamic column elutions simulation through porous uniform media. The simulation approach was done by coupling velocity field and mass transfer equations using COMSOL Multiphysics™ Finite element method, with appropriate mesh refinement was employed to solve the equation system. The HCl solutions ranging from 0.03 mol/L to 0.06 mol/L were used to desorb/elute the GSA from a presaturated polymeric porous anionic resin D08. Good results were accomplished in terms of ion exchange desorption rate and GSA recovery. The pore diffusion model (PDM) considering counter ion was established to describe the desorption/elution kinetics in the batch/column experiment. By the least square fitting method, the superficial desorption rate constant Kd of GSA/HCl reaction on the ion-exchange sites of porous resin was fitted to 0.116 L/(mol s). Subsequently, this value was sequentially applied in the simulation of the dynamic elution process. The individual pore diffusion coefficients for GSA and Cl− were estimated to be 5.07 × 10−10 and 1.77 × 10−9 m2/s, respectively. In order to validate the simulation feasibility of this pore diffusion model to a dynamic column elution process, the effects of HCl concentration, flow rate and column's height/diameter ratio on the column performance were investigated systematically. The results from this work should serve as motivation for further experimental and theoretical study in the scaling-up of GSA purification process. Finally, repeated adsorption–elution column cycles were simulated by the PDM model well.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatography 3adesorption 3adiffusivity 3adyes 3aequations 3afinite element analysis 3ahydrochloric acid 3aion exchange 3airidoid glycosides 3amass transfer 3amodels 3amotivation 3apurification methods 3arecycling 3awastewater 0aDesorption 0aPacked column 0aWaste water 0aGSA 0aCounter ion 0aSuperficial constant1 aWang, Juan1 aDing, Hanjing1 aXie, Wenjing0 tJournal of chromatography.g2019 June 07, v. 1594 p.1-12dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2019.01.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02132naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245010300173300001200276520080200288592002801090650001701118650002501135650001101160650002001171650001401191650001501205650001201220650002201232650001701254650002101271650001101292651001201303651001001315653002101325653002101346653001801367653001801385653002001403700002101423700001701444773011601461856008801577852000901665655001201674IND60531708120221118204004.0180830e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053170812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2016.03.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViani, Costanza10aRecovering value from used medical instruments: A case study of laryngoscopes in England and Italy  ap. 1-9.  aThe healthcare sector has a relevant environmental footprint because of the significant materials throughput, the hazardousness of certain wastes it generates and the energy intensive treatment necessary to manage them.

Each theoretical frame is different in terms of complexity and predictive capabilities. To clarify the latter point, we derived the R(Δa) (LEFM) and J(ω) (CZM) curves from a set of published results on over-height compact tension fracture specimens of different sizes. Then, these curves were used to predict the strength of other coupons of the same material (geometrically similar, scaled, open hole and center cracked specimens). Since the idealization of the fracture phenomena in cohesive zone models is more realistic than in LEFM, the fracture property so obtained is more independent from the size of the specimen used to measure it and its predictive capability embraces a wider range of sizes and geometries.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomposite materials 3acracking 3ageometry 3amechanics 3amodels 3aprediction 0aTranslaminar fracture toughness 0aFracture mechanics 0aSize effect law1 aOrtega, A.1 aGonzález, E.V.1 aCosta, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7134-71460 tComposites.g2022 May, v. 156 p.106867-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12034x1359-835X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2022.1068673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03558naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245008600175520189300261592002802154650002202182650002602204650002102230650001502251650001402266650001402280650001902294650001302313650001502326651001702341700002502358700001702383700002002400700002002420700001902440700002002459700002002479700001802499700002502517700002402542700001902566700002302585700002302608700002202631700002002653700002302673700002102696700002102717700004502738773012702783856008502910852000902995655001203004IND60732140220221121045021.0210326e20210312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073214022DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms90305862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaffer, Jeffrey G.10aSpace-Time Trends in Lassa Fever in Sierra Leone by ELISA Serostatus, 2012–2019  aLassa fever (LF) is a viral hemorrhagic disease found in Sub-Saharan Africa and is responsible for up to 300,000 cases and 5000 deaths annually. LF is highly endemic in Sierra Leone, particularly in its Eastern Province. Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) maintains one of only a few LF isolation facilities in the world with year-round diagnostic testing. Here we focus on space-time trends for LF occurring in Sierra Leone between 2012 and 2019 to provide a current account of LF in the wake of the 2014–2016 Ebola epidemic. Data were analyzed for 3277 suspected LF cases and classified as acute, recent, and non-LF or prior LF exposure using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Presentation rates for acute, recent, and non-LF or prior LF exposure were 6.0% (195/3277), 25.6% (838/3277), and 68.4% (2244/3277), respectively. Among 2051 non-LF or prior LF exposures, 33.2% (682/2051) tested positive for convalescent LF exposure. The overall LF case-fatality rate (CFR) was 78.5% (106/135). Both clinical presentations and confirmed LF cases declined following the Ebola epidemic. These declines coincided with an increased duration between illness onset and clinical presentation, perhaps suggesting more severe disease or presentation at later stages of illness. Acute LF cases and their corresponding CFRs peaked during the dry season (November to April). Subjects with recent (but not acute) LF exposure were more likely to present during the rainy season (May to October) than the dry season (p < 0.001). The findings here suggest that LF remains endemic in Sierra Leone and that caseloads are likely to resume at levels observed prior to the Ebola epidemic. The results provide insight on the current epidemiological profile of LF in Sierra Leone to facilitate LF vaccine studies and accentuate the need for LF cohort studies and continued advancements in LF diagnostics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLassa virus fever 3adiagnostic techniques 3adisease severity 3adry season 3ahospitals 3amortality 3aspace and time 3avaccines 3awet season 3aSierra Leone1 aSchieffelin, John S.1 aMomoh, Mambu1 aGoba, Augustine1 aKanneh, Lansana1 aAlhasan, Foday1 aGbakie, Michael1 aEngel, Emily J.1 aBond, Nell G.1 aHartnett, Jessica N.1 aNelson, Diana K.

A standard herbicide treatment of metribuzin applied preemergence (PRE) at 0.4 kg ai/ha (standard herbicide weed management system [[STD]]) was compared with (1) fall-planted winter rye followed by metribuzin at 0.4 kg/ha applied in a band in the potato hill, followed by reservoir tillage (rye cover crop with herbicide-banded and reservoir-tilled weed management system [[RYESTD]]); (2) cultivation with tine-tooth harrow followed by hilling with shovels and rolling cultivators (total-cultivation weed management system [[CULT]]); (3) fall-planted rapeseed followed by reservoir tillage (rapeseed cover crop and reservoir-tilled weed management system [[RPSD]]); and (4) reservoir tillage alone (reservoir-tilled weed management system [[RESTIL]]). In both years, early-season weed density and final weed biomass were lower in the STD, RYESTD, and CULT systems than in RPSD and RESTIL. Total tuber yield and yield of U.S. ##2 or better were greatest in the RYESTD and STD systems in both years. The CULT system reduced early-season weed densities, but tuber yield was reduced 15%% in 1994, and yield of U.S. ##2 or better was reduced 25%% in 1995 compared with the STD system. The RPSD system reduced early-season in-row weed density from 60 to 70%% and final weed biomass from 29 to 40%% compared with a nontreated check, i.e., a no––cover crop, no-cultivation, no-herbicide weed management system, but tuber yield was 27 to 30%% lower than in the STD system. The RYESTD system was an effective alternative weed management strategy that controlled weeds, decreased PRE-applied herbicide inputs 66%%, and maintained tuber yield.Nomenclature: Metribuzin; potato, Solanum tuberosum L.; rapeseed, Brassica napus; rye, Secale cereale L.Additional index words: Banding, cover crops, cultivation, integrated weed management, glyphosate, reservoir tillage, tillage.Abbreviations: BR, between row; CHECK, no––cover crop, no-cultivation, no-herbicide weed management system; CULT, total-cultivation weed management system; IR, in row; PRE, preemergence; RESTIL, reservoir-tilled weed management system; RPSD, rapeseed cover crop and reservoir-tilled weed management system; RYESTD, rye cover crop with herbicide-banded and reservoir-tilled weed management system; STD, standard herbicide weed management system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aband placement 3aweed control 3aSolanum tuberosum 3ametribuzin 3aSecale cereale 3acover crops 3acrop yield 3atubers 3aglyphosate 3aintegrated pest management 3aBrassica napus 3aconservation tillage 0aWashington 0atillage1 aVAUGHN, STEVEN F.0 tWeed technology.g2002 Jan., v. 16, no. 1 p.23-28dThe Societyx0890-037X7nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/246133Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1614%2F0890-037X%282002%29016%5B0023%3AAWMSCW%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245009900163500001400262520148300276592002801759650002201787650001601809650001801825650001901843650001301862650001801875650001401893650001901907650001801926700002401944700001901968700002201987700001802009700002402027700002402051773012202075856007302197852000902270655001202279IND60721806120221120204607.0201224e20201217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072180612DNAL7 a10.3390/v121214602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichelini, Zuleika 10aIntegrase-Defective Lentiviral Vectors for Delivery of Monoclonal Antibodies against Influenza  aNAL-light  aDelivering rapid protection against infectious agents to non-immune populations is a formidable public health challenge. Although passive immunotherapy is a fast and effective method of protection, large-scale production and administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is expensive and unpractical. Viral vector-mediated delivery of mAbs offers an attractive alternative to their direct injection. Integrase-defective lentiviral vectors (IDLV) are advantageous for this purpose due to the absence of pre-existing anti-vector immunity and the safety features of non-integration and non-replication. We engineered IDLV to produce the humanized mAb VN04-2 (IDLV-VN04-2), which is broadly neutralizing against H5 influenza A virus (IAV), and tested the vectors’ ability to produce antibodies and protect from IAV in vivo. We found that IDLV-transduced cells produced functional VN04-2 mAbs in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. These mAbs specifically bind the hemagglutinin (HA), but not the nucleoprotein (NP) of IAV. VN04-2 mAbs were detected in the serum of mice at different times after intranasal (i.n.) or intramuscular (i.m.) administration of IDLV-VN04-2. Administration of IDLV-VN04-2 by the i.n. route provided rapid protection against lethal IAV challenge, although the protection did not persist at later time points. Our data suggest that administration of mAb-expressing IDLV may represent an effective strategy for rapid protection against infectious diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3ablood serum 3adose response 3ahemagglutinins 3aimmunity 3aimmunotherapy 3ainfluenza 3anucleoproteins 3apublic health1 aMinkoff, Judith  M.1 aYang, Jianjun 1 aNegri, Donatella 1 aCara, Andrea 1 aHanson, Brendon  J.1 aSalvatore, Mirella 0 tViruses.g2020 Dec. 17, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v121214603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03030naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245018500163500001400348520146400362592002801826650005301854650001701907650001101924650000801935650002801943650001101971650002201982650001802004650001402022650001702036650001102053650003602064650001902100650002202119650001902141650001902160650002402179650002502203650001302228650001102241650001102252700001902263700001802282700001902300773012202319856007402441852000902515655001202524IND60729382320221119220336.0210228e20210207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072938232DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130205452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsunaga, Masako 10aDietary Quality Associated with Self-Reported Diabetes, Osteoarthritis, and Rheumatoid Arthritis among Younger and Older US Adults: A Cross-Sectional Study Using NHANES 2011–2016  aNAL-light  aBackground: To date, few studies have compared the dietary quality of US adults with diabetes mellitus (DM), osteoarthritis (OA), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by age groups. Methods: This study used cross-sectional data from adult participants from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011–2016 to identify dietary quality measured by Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 total and component scores and self-reported disease status for DM, OA, and RA. Associations between the disease status and HEI-2015 total/component scores among younger adults aged 20–59 years (n = 7988) and older adults aged 60 years and older (n = 3780) were examined using logistic regression models. These accounted for the complex survey design and were adjusted for self-reported disease status, sex, race/ethnicity, education levels, income status, weight status, physical activity levels, and smoking status. Results: Among younger adults, 7% had DM, 7% had OA, and 3% had RA. Among older adults, 20% had DM, 32% had OA, and 6% had RA. Moderate added sugar intake was associated with diabetes in all adults. Excess sodium intake was associated with DM among younger adults. Inadequate seafood and plant protein intake was associated with RA among younger adults, while a poor overall dietary pattern was associated with RA among older adults. Conclusions: The dietary quality of US adults varied by self-reported DM, OA, and RA status, and each varied by age group.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aadded sugars 3aadults 3aage 3across-sectional studies 3adesign 3adiabetes mellitus 3aeating habits 3aeducation 3afood quality 3aincome 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aosteoarthritis 3aphysical activity 3aplant proteins 3aprotein intake 3aregression analysis 3arheumatoid arthritis 3aseafoods 3asodium 3aweight1 aIm, Ŭn-jŏng,1 aDavis, James 1 aChen, John  J.0 tNutrients.g2021 Feb. 07, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130205453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002100167245012100188300001600309520104700325592002801372650001601400650001401416650002501430650001401455650001701469650001201486650002601498650000901524650002001533650001201553650002801565650002801593650004101621650000901662650004801671650005501719650000901774650001701783650003801800650004001838650003101878650004301909653001901952653001401971653001701985653001602002653002002018653001502038700001902053700001702072700002202089773013102111856008302242852000902325655001202334IND60114080520221118022149.0190318e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011408052DNAL7 a230405442pmid7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2012.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShiina, Takahiko10aInhibitory actions of a local neural reflex on propulsive activity of the esophageal striated muscle portion in rats  ap. 331-335.  aThe aim of the present study was to clarify functional roles of a local neural reflex in propulsive activity of the rat esophageal striated muscle. Firstly, we established a method for measuring the volume of fluid expelled from an isolated esophageal segment to evaluate propulsive activity. Electrical stimulation to vagus nerves induced propulsion of intraluminal solution in the esophageal segment. The vagally evoked propulsion was abolished in the presence of d-tubocurarine. Next, this quantitative method was applied to examine the functional roles of intrinsic nerves in the esophagus. Capsaicin, a stimulant of primary afferents, inhibited the vagally mediated propulsion. A nitric oxide synthase inhibitor or a selective tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist significantly blocked the inhibitory effect of capsaicin. These findings suggest that the local neural reflex, which consists of tachykininergic and nitrergic neurons, might participate in modulation of propulsive activity in the striated muscle portion of the rat esophagus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3acapsaicin 3aelectrical treatment 3aesophagus 3anerve tissue 3aneurons 3anitric oxide synthase 3arats 3astriated muscle 2aAnimals 2aCapsaicinxpharmacology 2aDeglutitionxphysiology 2aEsophagusxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMale 2aMuscle, Striatedxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aNeuromuscular Nondepolarizing Agentsxpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aReflexxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aSensory System Agentsxpharmacology 2aTubocurarinexpharmacology 2aVagus Nervexdrug effectsxphysiology. 0aEnteric neuron 0aEsophagus 0aNitric oxide 0aPeristalsis 0aStriated muscle 0aTachykinin1 aShima, Takeshi1 aSuzuki, Yuji1 aShimizu, Yasutake0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2013 Apr., v. 94, no. 2 p.331-335dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.wJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2012.09.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100001800170245007700188300001600265520106000281592002801341650001001369650001401379650001101393650001301404650000901417650002501426650001601451650001001467650000901477650003001486650001801516650001301534650003001547650001001577650002701587650001001614650001201624650001201636650001401648650001301662650001101675650001301686650006501699650004401764650001201808650002501820650002501845650003901870650004601909650001001955650002401965650001001989650001201999700001802011700002202029773008402051856008502135852000902220655001202229IND60113685620221120221330.0141112e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011368562DNAL7 a219962882pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2011.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaider, Nadia10aIdentification of meat species by PCR-RFLP of the mitochondrial COI gene  ap. 490-493.  aMeat authenticity verification is pertinent for economical, religious or public health concerns. The present study investigates the use of PCR-RFLP of a part of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene for identification of species origin of raw meat samples of cow, chicken, turkey, sheep, pig, buffalo, camel and donkey. PCR yielded a 710-bp fragment in all species. The amplicons were digested with seven restriction endonucleases (Hind II, Ava II, Rsa I, Taq I, Hpa II, Tru 1I and Xba I) that were selected based on the preliminary in silico analysis. Different levels of polymorphism were detected among samples. The level of COI variation revealed using only Hpa II was sufficient to generate easily analyzable species-specific restriction profiles that could distinguish unambiguously all targeted species. Compared to previously published reports for the determination of meat origin at the molecular level, the approach developed here is much cheaper and faster for routine identification of meats in food control laboratories.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasses 3abuffaloes 3acamels 3achickens 3acows 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3afood safety 3agenes 3ameat 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apublic health 3araw meat 3arestriction endonucleases 3asheep 3aspecies identification 3aswine 3aturkeys 2aAnimals 2aBuffaloes 2aCamelus. 2aCattle 2aChickens 2aDNA Restriction Enzymesxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxanalysisxgenetics. 2aEquidae 2aGenes, Mitochondrial 2aMeatxclassification 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aSheep 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSwine 2aTurkeys1 aNabulsi, Imad1 aAl-Safadi, Bassam0 tMeat science.g2012 Feb., v. 90, no. 2 p.490-493dElsevier Ltdx0309-17407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2011.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245012400202300002000326500001900346520164100365592002802006596007202034650002502106650002202131650001902153650001502172650000902187650001402196650001602210650001502226650001902241650001402260650001102274650001402285650001402299650001102313650001302324650001402337650001402351650001302365700001602378700001802394700001902412773015502431856008302586852000902669655001202678IND60739443220221118071642.0210731e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073944322DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-12639-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3935-810910aAnalysis of hydrochemical evolution in main discharge aquifers under mining disturbance and water source identification  ap. 26784-26793.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo discuss the hydrochemical evolution characteristics of the mining process of Peigou Coal Mine, based on the test results of 43 water samples collected at different times from three main discharge aquifers, namely, Carboniferous Taiyuan Formation limestone water (L₇–₈ + L₅–₆ water), Ordovician limestone water (including Taiyuan Formation L₁–₄), and Permian main mining coal seam roof and floor sandstone water (roof and floor water), a hydrochemical evolution model of the mining disturbances since 2003 has been established. The carbonate and sulphate dissolution and pyrite oxidation in Ordovician limestone water significantly decreased and then increased in 2006, and silicate weathering was weak. The carbonate and sulphate dissolution, silicate weathering and pyrite oxidation of roof and floor sandstone water increased. At the same time, a water source identification model suitable for the Peigou Coal Mine was developed by comparing the Fisher discriminant and the BP (back propagation) neural network discriminant. The accuracy rates of Fisher discriminant and BP neural network discriminant are 81.40% and 83.72% respectively, which indicates that BP neural network is more accurate. Finally, the evolution of hydraulic connection between aquifers is analysed. We speculate that there is a fracture development channel between Ordovician limestone water and roof and floor water aquifers that is affected in 2005 by the mining disturbance. This study has significance for examining the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater in mines and acting as a guideline to prevent and control water inrushes.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017CXNL03cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aCarboniferous period 3aOrdovician period 3aPermian period 3acarbonates 3acoal 3aevolution 3agroundwater 3aguidelines 3ahydrochemistry 3alimestone 3amodels 3aoxidation 3apollution 3apyrite 3aresearch 3asandstone 3asilicates 3asulfates1 aZhu, Shuyun1 aYang, Chaowei1 aXiao, Shuaijun0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 June, v. 28, no. 21 p.26784-26793dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-12639-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03245naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005400147245014800201300002000349520177300369592002802142650002102170650001302191650002802204650002502232650002502257650002402282650001802306650003702324650001802361650001702379650001702396650002002413650004302433650000902476650001702485700001302502700001902515700001802534773016802552856008202720852000902802655001202811IND60595207320221122014430.0200207e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059520732DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-1694-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Rong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4929-208910aUp-regulation of contractile endothelin receptors by airborne fine particulate matter in rat mesenteric arteries via activation of MAPK pathway  ap. 14713-14725.  aFine particle matters (PM₂.₅) is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Vascular hyper-reactivity plays an important roles in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The present study was designed to investigate a hypothesis that PM₂.₅ up-regulated endothelin receptors in mesenteric artery and the potential underlying mechanisms. Rat mesenteric arteries were cultured with PM₂.₅. The artery contractile responses were recorded by a sensitive myograph. ETB and ETA receptor expressions of mRNA and protein were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Results showed that ETB receptor agonist, sarafotoxin 6c induced a negligible contraction in fresh artery segments, while ETA receptor agonist, ET-1 induced an obvious contraction. After organ culture, the contraction curve mediated by ETB and ETA receptors were shifted toward the left. PM₂.₅ 1.0 μg/ml cultured for 16 h further enhanced ETB and ETA receptor-mediated contractile responses with a markedly increased maximal contraction. The organ culture enhanced ETB and ETA receptor mRNA and protein levels from fresh arteries, which were further increased by PM₂.₅. The U0126 (MEK/ERK1/2 inhibitor) and SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) significantly attenuated both organ cultured-induced and PM₂.₅-induced up-regulation of ETB receptor. U0126 also suppressed organ culture-increased and PM₂.₅-increased expressions of ETA receptor. SB203580 only suppressed PM₂.₅-induced enhanced expressions of ETA receptor In conclusion, airborne PM₂.₅ up-regulates ETB and ETA receptors of mesenteric artery via p38 MAPK and MEK/ERK1/2 MAPK pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aagonists 3acardiovascular diseases 3aendothelin receptors 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amesenteric arteries 3amessenger RNA 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aorgan culture 3aparticulates 3apathogenesis 3aprotein content 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3arisk factors1 aCao, Lei1 aShen, Zhenxing1 aCao, Yongxiao0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 May, v. 25, no. 15 p.14713-14725dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-1694-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006900151245014200220300001200362520134600374592002801720650000801748650001801756650002201774650002401796650002201820650001001842650001201852650002201864653002101886653002101907653002501928653002401953700002701977700001902004700002302023700002202046700001702068700002102085700005602106700005302162700001802215773010802233856008602341852000902427655001202436IND60755249020221116154944.0220222e20220110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075524902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2021.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGovindkumar, Balagannavar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9370-381810aEx-Ex Primer: An experimentally validated tool for designing oligonucleotides spanning spliced nucleic acid regions from multiple species  ap. 1-6.  aA comparative study of existing junction-primer-designing software revealed many limitations among them. Hence, we developed a new computational program, Ex-Ex Primer, which offers many improved, user-friendly features, and reliably creates junction primers and probes. This online suite can also be used to design primers/probes from other sites of nucleic acid recombination, insertion, deletion, or splicing, and regular probes/primers. The threshold for Tm difference between the complete junctional primer vs its partial sequence, which maps to one of the junctional regions, was changed based on an important observation made during the initial experimental validations. The tool is now thoroughly checked with RT-PCR and RT-qPCR experiments with more than 250 primer pairs over a few years. The junction-primer-designing features of the software are also better than other equivalent tools. Visualizing the exons and introns across transcripts, and enabling primer designing based on information from Ensembl, are some of the unique features of this tool. The primers suggested by the tool can be used to detect the expression of known transcripts, to test the existence of predicted DNA or RNA joints via hybridization-based techniques, or for validation and in silico analysis of RNA-Seq.

Few modifiable risk factors for early menopause have been identified, but emerging data suggest that high vitamin D intake may reduce risk. Objective: We evaluated how intakes of vitamin D and calcium are associated with the incidence of early menopause in the prospective Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS2). Design: Intakes of vitamin D and calcium from foods and supplements were measured every 4 y with the use of a food-frequency questionnaire. Cases of incident early menopause were identified from all participants who were premenopausal at baseline in 1991; over 1.13 million person-years, 2041 women reported having natural menopause before the age of 45 y. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate relations between intakes of vitamin D and calcium and incident early menopause while accounting for potential confounding factors. Results: After adjustment for age, smoking, and other factors, women with the highest intake of dietary vitamin D (quintile median: 528 IU/d) had a significant 17% lower risk of early menopause than women with the lowest intake [quintile median: 148 IU/d; HR: 0.83 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.95); P-trend = 0.03]. Dietary calcium intake in the highest quintile (median: 1246 mg/d) compared with the lowest (median: 556 mg/d) was associated with a borderline significantly lower risk of early menopause (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.00; P-trend = 0.03). Associations were stronger for vitamin D and calcium from dairy sources than from nondairy dietary sources, whereas high supplement use was not associated with lower risk. Conclusions: Findings suggest that high intakes of dietary vitamin D and calcium may be modestly associated with a lower risk of early menopause. Further studies evaluating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations, other dairy constituents, and early menopause are warranted.  aPublisher supplied data  aUM1CA176726cNIHdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000002  aR01HD078517cDepartment of Health and Human Services0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal ovaries 3acalcium 3acardiovascular diseases 3adietary nutrient sources 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afoods 3anurses 3aosteoporosis 3apremenopause 3arisk factors 3arisk reduction 3avitamin D 3awomen 0aanovulation 0acalcium 0adairy 0amenopause 0amenstrual cycle 0aovarian function 0avitamin D 0a25-hydroxyvitamin D1 aWhitcomb, Brian W1 aSzegda, Kathleen L1 aBoutot, Maegan E1 aManson, JoAnn E.,1 aHankinson, Susan E.,1 aRosner, Bernard A1 aTroy, Lisa M.,1 aMichels, Karin B.,1 aBertone-Johnson, Elizabeth R.,0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2017 June 01, v. 105, no. 6 p.1493-1501dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl45206x1938-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.116.1456073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245011400162300001600276520131500292592002801607650002101635650001501656650002301671650001401694650002101708650001301729650001901742650002401761650002501785650001801810650001301828653002701841653002601868653001301894653001701907653003401924700001901958700001801977700002001995700002402015773009602039856008202135852000902217655001202226IND60553457820221119204725.0161021e20150615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055345782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2015.01.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, Ekta10aMultifunctional magnetic reduced graphene oxide dendrites: Synthesis, characterization and their applications  ap. 726-735.  aIn this paper, for the first time, we have reported the novel synthesis of reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) dendrite kind of nanomaterial. The proposed r-GO dendrite possesses multifunctional properties in various fields of sensing and separation. The dendrite was synthesized by chemical reaction in different steps. Initially, the r-GO sheet was conjugated with silane group modified magnetic nanoparticle, resulting in nanoparticle decorated r-GO. The above r-GO sheet was further reacted with a new r-GO sheet, resulting in the formation of r-GO dendrite type of structure. Multifunctional behavior of this r-GO dendrite structure was studied by different methods. First, magnetic properties were studied by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and it was found that dendrite structure shows good magnetic susceptibility (180.2emu/g). The proposed r-GO dendrite also shows a very good antibacterial behavior for Escherichia coli and excellent electrochemical behavior towards ferrocyanide probe molecule. Along with these, it also acts as a substrate for the synthesis of molecularly imprinted polymer for europium metal ion, a lanthanide. The proposed imprinted sensor shows a very high selectivity and sensitivity for europium metal ion (limit of detection= 0.019μgL−1) in aqueous as well as real samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3abiosensors 3achemical reactions 3adendrites 3aelectrochemistry 3aeuropium 3agraphene oxide 3amagnetic properties 3amolecular imprinting 3ananoparticles 3apolymers 0aReduced graphene oxide 0aMagnetic nanoparticle 0aDendrite 0aEuropium ion 0aMolecularly imprinted polymer1 aPatra, Santanu1 aKumar, Deepak1 aMadhuri, Rashmi1 aSharma, Prashant K.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2015 June 15, v. 68 p.726-735dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.01.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03837naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002100127024001900148040001800167100001600185245011800201300001200319506007600331520210700407592002802514506003702542650001302579650001802592650001802610650001702628650002702645650002402672650001702696650001202713650001302725650001402738650002102752650001002773650002902783650001002812650001102822650001402833650001402847650001902861650001402880650002002894650002602914650001602940650002202956650001402978700002302992700002303015700001903038773010203057856007903159852000903238655001203247IND60119507620221207091247.0141214e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011950762DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2004-5-6-r382doi7 aPMC4630712pmcid7 a151864892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBudd, Aidan10aBacterial α2-macroglobulins: colonization factors acquired by horizontal gene transfer from the metazoan genome?  ap. 842.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Invasive bacteria are known to have captured and adapted eukaryotic host genes. They also readily acquire colonizing genes from other bacteria by horizontal gene transfer. Closely related species such as Helicobacter pylori and Helicobacter hepaticus, which exploit different host tissues, share almost none of their colonization genes. The protease inhibitor α₂-macroglobulin provides a major metazoan defense against invasive bacteria, trapping attacking proteases required by parasites for successful invasion. RESULTS: Database searches with metazoan α₂-macroglobulin sequences revealed homologous sequences in bacterial proteomes. The bacterial α₂-macroglobulin phylogenetic distribution is patchy and violates the vertical descent model. Bacterial α₂-macroglobulin genes are found in diverse clades, including purple bacteria (proteobacteria), fusobacteria, spirochetes, bacteroidetes, deinococcids, cyanobacteria, planctomycetes and thermotogae. Most bacterial species with bacterial α₂-macroglobulin genes exploit higher eukaryotes (multicellular plants and animals) as hosts. Both pathogenically invasive and saprophytically colonizing species possess bacterial α₂-macroglobulins, indicating that bacterial α₂-macroglobulin is a colonization rather than a virulence factor. CONCLUSIONS: Metazoan α₂-macroglobulins inhibit proteases of pathogens. The bacterial homologs may function in reverse to block host antimicrobial defenses. α₂-macroglobulin was probably acquired one or more times from metazoan hosts and has then spread widely through other colonizing bacterial species by more than 10 independent horizontal gene transfers. yfhM-like bacterial α₂-macroglobulin genes are often found tightly linked with pbpC, encoding an atypical peptidoglycan transglycosylase, PBP1C, that does not function in vegetative peptidoglycan synthesis. We suggest that YfhM and PBP1C are coupled together as a periplasmic defense and repair system. Bacterial α₂-macroglobulins might provide useful targets for enhancing vaccine efficacy in combating infections.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnimalia 3aBacteroidetes 3aCyanobacteria 3aFusobacteria 3aHelicobacter hepaticus 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aSpirochaetes 3aanimals 3abacteria 3adatabases 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3ahosts 3amodels 3aparasites 3apathogens 3apeptidoglycans 3aphylogeny 3aplants (botany) 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aproteinases 3asequence homology 3avirulence1 aBlandin, Stephanie1 aLevashina, Elena A1 aGibson, Toby J0 tGenome biology.g2004 May, v. 5, no. 6 p.842-842dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2004-5-6-r383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002100192245010500213300001800318506007600336520078300412592002801195506003701223650001801260650001201278650001401290650001201304650001901316650001101335650001601346650000901362650001201371650001301383650001301396650001401409653004701423653001601470653002801486653003501514653003101549653002401580700001601604700002001620700002401640700001801664700002001682700002001702700002201722700002001744700002001764773015601784856008601940852000902026655001202035IND60539326720221207142630.0190215e20150708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053932672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2015.05.0472doi7 aPMC47412822pmcid7 a260704242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBosen, Felicitas10aAltered epidermal lipid processing and calcium distribution in the KID syndrome mouse model Cx26S17F  ap. 1904-1910.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe keratitis–ichthyosis–deafness (KID) syndrome is caused by mutations in the gap junctional channel protein connexin 26 (Cx26), among them the mutation Cx26S17F. Heterozygous Cx26S17F mice resemble the human KID syndrome, i.e. exhibiting epidermal hyperplasia and hearing impairments. Newborn Cx26S17F mice show a defective epidermal water barrier as well as altered epidermal lipid secretion and location. Linoleoyl ω-esterified ceramides are strongly decreased on the skin surface of Cx26S17F mice. Moreover, the epidermal calcium gradient is altered in the mutant mice. These alterations may be caused by an abnormal Cx26S17F channel function that leads to a defective epidermal water barrier, which in turn may trigger the hyperproliferation seen in the KID syndrome.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3acalcium 3aceramides 3ahearing 3aheterozygosity 3ahumans 3ahyperplasia 3amice 3amutants 3amutation 3aneonates 3asecretion 0aKeratitis–ichthyosis–deafness syndrome 0aConnexin 26 0aTransgenic mouse mutant 0aEpidermal water barrier defect 0aEpidermal calcium gradient 0aEpidermal ceramides1 aCelli, Anna1 aCrumrine, Debra1 avom Dorp, Katharina1 aEbel, Philipp1 aJastrow, Holger1 aDormann, Peter,1 aWinterhager, Elke1 aMauro, Theodora1 aWillecke, Klaus0 tFEBS letters.g2015 July 08, v. 589, no. 15 p.1904-1910dElsevier B.V.aFederation of European Biochemical SocietieswJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2015.05.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245006700170300001800237520175700255592002802012650002202040650002002062650001402082650002402096650001402120650001302134650001402147650001902161650001902180650000902199650001602208650001302224651001202237653001402249653001402263653001402277653002502291653001702316653000702333653000802340700002202348700002202370700002602392773009902418856008602517852000902603655001202612IND60535059320221118055340.0190319e20150427xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053505932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.03.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaenen, Jolien10aInfluenza and pertussis vaccination coverage in pregnant women  ap. 2125-2131.  aPregnant women have an increased risk for complications and hospitalizations when infected with the influenza virus in the second or third trimester. Additionally, infants under six months of age are most vulnerable when contracting pertussis. Immunization against influenza and pertussis during pregnancy provides protection for mother and neonate against influenza and for neonates against pertussis pending protection through infant immunization. In Belgium, a gradual increase in pertussis cases over the past decade was observed. This study was undertaken to document vaccination coverage for influenza and pertussis and factors related to vaccination status in pregnant women.Two hundred and fifty pregnant women completed a questionnaire during their third trimester. Vaccination data were collected and reasons for non-vaccination were noted as well as socio-demographic data which are known to influence vaccination coverage.A documented vaccination coverage of 42.8% for influenza and 39.2% for pertussis was observed. Taking into account doses which were not documented, but administered according to the expectant mother, coverage for influenza would increase to 62% and for pertussis to 46%. The most important reasons for non-vaccination were the absence of a recommendation by medical staff (9.6%) and delay in vaccination (8.4%). The GP was the most important vaccinator. Pregnant women with a lower education and those with a foreign origin were more vulnerable for non-vaccination.Incomplete documentation is the most important barrier in determining the vaccination status of pregnant women. Immunization during pregnancy needs further integration through vaccination campaigns aimed at both health care providers and pregnant women.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3adata collection 3aeducation 3ahealth care workers 3ainfluenza 3aneonates 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3aquestionnaires 3arisk 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aBelgium 0aInfluenza 0aPertussis 0aPregnancy 0aVaccination coverage 0aImmunization 0aGP 0aHCP1 aRoelants, Mathieu1 aDevlieger, Roland1 aVandermeulen, Corinne0 tVaccine.g2015 Apr. 27, v. 33, no. 18 p.2125-2131dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.03.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02405naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245009900169300001600268520094100284592002801225650001601253650002701269650001501296650001501311650001601326650001701342650001701359650001101376650001901387650000701406650000901413650001101422650001101433650001001444650001401454650001501468653001801483653001601501653002201517653003401539700001301573700001301586700001701599700002001616700001801636700001901654773010601673856008701779852000901866655001201875IND60536554720221116171354.0190409e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053655472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2014.11.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Junyuan10aCharacterization and flocculation mechanism of a bioflocculant from hydrolyzate of rice stover  ap. 393-397.  aThis study investigated the characterization and flocculation mechanism of a bioflocculant from hydrolyzate of rice stover. Production of the bioflocculant was positively associated with cell growth and a highest value of 2.4gL−1 was obtained. During the kaolin suspension flocculation, charge neutralization and inter-particle bridging were proposed as the reasons for enhanced performance. Apart from this, the bioflocculant showed good performances in sludge dewatering and swine wastewater pretreatment. After conditioning by the bioflocculant, dry solids (DS) and specific resistance to filtration (SRF) of the sludge reached 18.4% and 4.8×1012mkg−1, respectively, which were much better than that by conventional chemical flocculants. In the swine wastewater pretreatment, the removal efficiencies of COD, ammonium, and turbidity reached 48.3%, 43.6% and 75.8% at pH 8.0 when the bioflocculant dose was adjusted to 20mgL−1.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell growth 3achemical oxygen demand 3adewatering 3afiltration 3aflocculants 3aflocculation 3ahydrolysates 3akaolin 3aneutralization 3apH 3arice 3asludge 3astover 3aswine 3aturbidity 3awastewater 0aBioflocculant 0aRice stover 0aSludge dewatering 0aSwine wastewater pretreatment1 aYu, Jing1 aXin, Xin1 aZou, Changwu1 aCheng, Qingfeng1 aYang, Huaijin1 aNengzi, Lichao0 tBioresource technology.g2015 Feb., v. 177 p.393-397dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2014.11.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03331naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245007600171300002000247520178700267592002802054596007502082650000802157650002702165650000902192650001402201650001002215650003002225650001402255650002602269650001302295650002702308650001402335650000902349650000902358650001002367650002302377700002202400700002402422700002202446700002502468700001902493700002002512700001502532700001902547773016802566856008202734852000902816655001202825IND60595207720221122014645.0200207e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059520772DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-1627-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKennedy, Rebekah C.10aTemporal dynamics of gut microbiota in triclocarban-exposed weaned rats  ap. 14743-14751.  aWidely used as an antimicrobial in antibacterial bar soaps, triclocarban (3,4,4′-trichlorocarbanilide; TCC) is effective against Gram-positive bacteria but shows little efficacy against Gram-negative strains, potentially altering the composition of indigenous microflora within and on the human body. To date, the consequence of continuous or previous nonprescription antimicrobial exposure from compounds in personal care products on commensal microflora is still elusive. Previous research has shown that TCC exposure during gestation and lactation induced dysbiosis of gut microbial communities among exposed dams and neonates. However, the impact of antimicrobial exposure specifically after discontinuation of the use of TCC on the gut microbiota has not been investigated. In this study, weaned Sprague Dawley rats (postnatal day, PND 22) were provided ad lib access to TCC-supplemented diet (0.2% w/w or 0.5% w/w) for 4 weeks (phase I) followed by a 4-week washout period (phase II) to determine gut microflora changes both during continuous exposure to TCC and to determine the potential rebound following TCC withdrawal. Fecal samples were collected at baseline (PND 22) prior to TCC exposure and throughout phase I and phase II. The V4 region of 16S rDNA was sequenced from extracted total fecal DNA with the MiSeq platform. Exposure to both 0.2% w/w and 0.5% w/w TCC was sufficient to alter diversity of microbiota during phase I of treatment. This effect was further prolonged into phase II, even when TCC exposure was discontinued. Collectively, these data highlight the impact of both continuous and prior TCC exposure on gut microbial ecology and shed light onto the potential long-term health risk of daily nonprescription antimicrobial personal care product use.  aPublisher supplied data  a1R21ES017475-01A1cNational Institute of Environmental Health Sciences 3aDNA 3aGram-positive bacteria 3adiet 3adysbiosis 3afeces 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alactation 3amicrobial communities 3aneonates 3apersonal care products 3apregnancy 3arats 3arisk 3asoaps 3atemporal variation1 aFling, Russell R.1 aRobeson, Michael S.1 aSaxton, Arnold M.1 aSchneider, Liesel G.1 aDarcy, John L.1 aBemis, David A.1 aZhao, Ling1 aChen, Jiangang0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 May, v. 25, no. 15 p.14743-14751dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-1627-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03417naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002100127024001900148040001800167100002100185245013500206300001200341506007600353520178600429592002802215506003702243650001602280650001302296650002102309650002202330650001402352650002002366650001002386650001902396650001202415650001202427650001502439650002502454650002002479650001302499650001402512650000902526650002402535650002102559650001202580650002602592700001802618700002902636700002002665773010202685856007902787852000902866655001202875IND60119507820221207091247.0141214e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011950782DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2004-5-6-r412doi7 aPMC4630742pmcid7 a151864922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchrick, Kathrin10aSTART lipid/sterol-binding domains are amplified in plants and are predominantly associated with homeodomain transcription factors  ap. 845.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: In animals, steroid hormones regulate gene expression by binding to nuclear receptors. Plants lack genes for nuclear receptors, yet genetic evidence from Arabidopsis suggests developmental roles for lipids/sterols analogous to those in animals. In contrast to nuclear receptors, the lipid/sterol-binding StAR-related lipid transfer (START) protein domains are conserved, making them candidates for involvement in both animal and plant lipid/sterol signal transduction. RESULTS: We surveyed putative START domains from the genomes of Arabidopsis, rice, animals, protists and bacteria. START domains are more common in plants than in animals and in plants are primarily found within homeodomain (HD) transcription factors. The largest subfamily of HD-START proteins is characterized by an HD amino-terminal to a plant-specific leucine zipper with an internal loop, whereas in a smaller subfamily the HD precedes a classic leucine zipper. The START domains in plant HD-START proteins are not closely related to those of animals, implying collateral evolution to accommodate organism-specific lipids/sterols. Using crystal structures of mammalian START proteins, we show structural conservation of the mammalian phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (PCTP) START domain in plants, consistent with a common role in lipid transport and metabolism. We also describe putative START-domain proteins from bacteria and unicellular protists. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of START domains in plants belong to a novel class of putative lipid/sterol-binding transcription factors, the HD-START family, which is conserved across the plant kingdom. HD-START proteins are confined to plants, suggesting a mechanism by which lipid/sterol ligands can directly modulate transcription in plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3abacteria 3abinding proteins 3acrystal structure 3aevolution 3agene expression 3agenes 3aleucine zipper 3aligands 3amammals 3ametabolism 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aplants (botany) 3aprotists 3areceptors 3arice 3asignal transduction 3asteroid hormones 3asterols 3atranscription factors1 aNguyen, Diana1 aKarłowski, Wojciech M.,1 aMayer, Klaus FX0 tGenome biology.g2004 May, v. 5, no. 6 p.845-845dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2004-5-6-r413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02350naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245006600168300001800234520116500252592002801417650001101445650001101456650000901467650001101476650001301487653002501500653001901525653001801544653002901562653003401591700002201625700002501647700001801672700002301690773015601713856008601869852000901955655001201964IND60539326920221117224430.0190215e20151007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053932692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2015.05.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJunier, Ivan10aOn the demultiplexing of chromosome capture conformation data  ap. 3005-3013.  aHow to describe the multiple chromosome structures that underlie interactions among genome loci and how to quantify the occurrence of these structures in a cell population remain important challenges to solve, which can be addressed via a proper demultiplexing of chromosome capture conformation related data. Here, we first aim to review two main methodologies that have been proposed to tackle this problem: restrained-based methods, in which the resulting chromosome structures stem from the multiple solutions of a distance satisfaction problem; and thermodynamic-based methods, in which the structures stem from the simulation of polymer models. Next, we propose a novel demultiplexing method based on a matrix decomposition of contact maps. To this end, we extend the notion of topologically associated domains (TADs) by introducing that of statistical interaction domains (SIDs). SIDs can overlap and occur in a cell population at certain frequencies, and we propose a simple method to estimate these frequency values. As an application, we show that SIDs that measure 100kb to tens of Mb long occur both frequently and specifically in the human genome.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenome 3ahumans 3aloci 3amodels 3apolymers 0aGenomic contact maps 0aDemultiplexing 0aDeconvolution 0aRestrained-based methods 0aPolymer models of chromosomes1 aSpill, Yannick G.1 aMarti-Renom, Marc A.1 aBeato, Miguel1 ale Dily, François0 tFEBS letters.g2015 Oct. 07, v. 589, no. 20 p.3005-3013dElsevier B.V.aFederation of European Biochemical SocietieswJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2015.05.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02374naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245007900172300001800251520102700269592002801296650002201324650003301346650001901379650002301398650001501421650001801436650001101454650000801465650001601473650000901489650002501498650002201523650001301545650002301558650001001581651001801591653001601609653002501625653003101650653001401681700001601695773009801711856008601809852000901895655001201904IND60535059520221118055352.0190319e20150521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053505952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.03.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhalla, Shayesta10aSocioeconomic status and HIV vaccine preparedness studies in North America  ap. 2536-2545.  aEducational level, employment, and income are key components of socioeconomic status (SES).

With the intent of identifying current topics of major interest and development of research directions in the field of bioenergy under climate change, we conducted a bibliometric analysis and network analysis from a country perspective based on 3050 articles published since 1999 derived from the Scopus database. The results indicated that USA, UK, and Germany led other countries in terms of number of publications (1006, 366, and 280 articles, respectively) and h-index (greater than 50) in this research area. The USA has also produced a large number of articles in highly respected journals. Compared with developed countries, some developing countries (e.g., China, India, and Brazil) have a larger proportion of publications which are cited less than 10 times and researchers who have academic age of 1 year. The number of publications dealing with some of these research topics coming from developing countries has lagged behind the number of similar publications coming from developed countries. In spite of this, research on sustainable energy systems is still needed for developing countries to further establish feasible systems that can effectively promote global economic development and strengthen climate change mitigation efforts.  aPublisher supplied data  a161461KYSB20170013cChinese Academy of Sciences 3abibliometric analysis 3abioenergy 3adatabases 3aenergy 3apollution 3aresearch 3aBrazil 3aChina 3aGermany 3aIndia1 aYu, Qiang1 aLi, Juan0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 June, v. 28, no. 21 p.26427-26440dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-12448-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245011300185300001800298520129000316592002801606650001301634650000901647650002001656650001601676650002701692650001901719650003001738650001501768650001701783650002001800650002801820650001001848650002501858650002201883650002301905650002901928650003801957650005701995650002302052700001902075700001402094700001802108700001302126700001702139700001802156700001502174773011002189856004802299852000902347655001202356IND50066735520221118001156.0130528e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006673552DNAL7 a234943932pmid7 a10.1007/s00122-013-2072-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Guodong10aFine mapping a major QTL for kernel number per row under different phosphorus regimes in maize (Zea mays L.)  ap. 1545-1553.  aPhosphorus (P) is one of the essential macronutrients for plant growth and development. Grain yield is the primary trait of interest in maize breeding programs. Maize grain yield and yield-related traits are seriously affected by P deficiency. Kernel number per row (KN), as one of the major components of grain yield, has attracted the attention of more and more breeders. In our previous study, one major QTL (named qKN), controlling KN under different P regimes was mapped to the interval between molecular markers bnlg1360 and umc1645 on chromosome 10 using a F ₂:₃ population derived from the cross between maize inbreds 178 and 5,003 (107). In order to understand its genetic basis, we developed a population of near isogenic lines (NILs) and two P regimes were used to fine map and characterize qKN. The QTL qKN was finally localized in a region of ~480 kb. A single qKN allele of inbred 178 increased KN by 6.08–10.76 % in the 5,003 (107) background; qKN acted in a partially dominant manner. Our results will be instrumental for the future identification and isolation of the candidate gene underlying qKN. The tightly linked molecular markers that we developed for qKN will be useful in maize breeding programs for improving KN applying the marker-assisted selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3agenetic markers 3agrain yield 3agrowth and development 3aisogenic lines 3amarker-assisted selection 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3aplant nutrition 3aquantitative trait loci 3aseeds 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aBreedingxmethods 2aChromosome Mapping 2aPhosphorusxpharmacology 2aQuantitative Trait Locixgenetics 2aSeedsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aZea maysxgenetics1 aWang, Xiaopeng1 aWang, Bin1 aTian, Yanchen1 aLi, Meng1 aNie, Yongxin1 aPeng, Qingcai1 aWang, Zeli0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2013 June, v. 126, no. 6 p.1545-1553dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-013-2072-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013100169300001500300520144000315592002801755650002301783650001301806650001801819650002101837650001901858650001901877650001301896700001501909700001301924700001501937700001501952700001501967773008801982856008602070852000902156655001202165IND60095485420221122004051.0141104e20120505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009548542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2012.03.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yiwan10aPreparation and swelling properties of graphene oxide/poly(acrylic acid-co-acrylamide) super-absorbent hydrogel nanocomposites  ap. 97-106.  aA series of novel graphene oxide (GO)/poly(acrylic acid-co-acrylamide) super-absorbent hydrogel nanocomposites were prepared by in situ radical solution polymerization. The effects of GO content on the chemical structure, morphology and miscibility of the hydrogels were studied. The swelling behaviors, swelling kinetics and pH-responsive behaviors of the hydrogels were also evaluated. Owing to the hydrogen bonds and possible covalent bonds between GO and polymer chains, relatively lower content (<0.30wt%) of GO could be dispersed well in the polymer matrix and enhanced the intermolecular interactions between the components effectively. On the contrary, an excessive amount of GO might form large agglomerates and weakened the interfacial interactions, resulting in the micro-phase separation between the components. Furthermore, the swelling capacities and swelling rates of hydrogels went up with increasing GO loadings to 0.30wt% and then decreased with further increasing GO loadings. It is worth noting that the hydrogel only containing 0.10wt% GO exhibited significant improvement of swelling capacity in neutral medium, and could also retain relatively higher swelling capacities to a certain degree at acidic and basic solutions. Therefore, the as-prepared GO-based super-absorbent hydrogels might have potential applications in many areas, such as biomedical engineering, construction engineering and hygienic products.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3agraphene 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrogen bonding 3ananocomposites 3apolymerization 3apolymers1 aZeng, Ming1 aRen, Jie1 aWang, Jing1 aFan, Liren1 aXu, Qingyu0 tColloids and surfaces.g2012 May 5, v. 401 p.97-106dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2012.03.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03360naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245015700153300002000310520188200330592002802212650002502240650001902265650001802284650002002302650001702322650002302339650001402362650001002376650002402386650001402410650001802424650001502442650004302457650001502500650001702515700001402532700001402546700001802560700001402578700001502592700002002607700001502627700001602642773012502658856007402783852000902857655001202866IND60641063320221120102141.0190505e20160906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064106332DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra16251g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMo, Ting10aExpanded investigations of the aglycon promiscuity and catalysis characteristic of flavonol 3-O-rhamnosyltransferase AtUGT78D1 from Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 84616-84626.  aRhamnosides usually possess better bioavailabilities and improved solubilities compared with their aglycons and are a major source of bioactive natural products. However, biosynthesis of rhamnosides is hindered by the commercially expensive UDP-rhamnose (UDP-Rha) donor and a lack of universal rhamnosyltransferases. In the present study, an efficient UDP-Rha production system via a two-step enzymatic reactions using UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) as a substrate was constructed. Extensive in vitro enzymatic assays and preparative reactions using the obtained UDP-Rha/UDP-Glc highlighted the robust glycosylation promiscuity of the reported rhamnosyltransferase AtUGT78D1. Based on HPLC-UV and HR-MS analyses, 30 of the tested aromatic compounds belonging to 7 structural types, including flavonoids, flavonoid glycosides, phenylethyl chromones, benzophenones, coumarins, lignanoids, and anthraquinones, were accepted by AtUGT78D1 to conduct the corresponding rhamnosylation and/or glucosylation with one or more glycosyl substitutions at different positions. Further preparative reactions expanded the catalytic characteristic of AtUGT78D1 since it can catalyse the rhamnosylation at the 3-OH position of the flavonols, glucosylation at the 7-OH position of the flavone baicalein, and multiple hydroxyl substitutions for diverse types of aromatics. Interestingly, a unique reversible catalysis activity of AtUGT78D1 was observed, and it has been effectively used in one-pot rhamnosylation of the desired rhamnoside. The enzymatic rhamnosylations of diverse “drug-like” scaffolds as well as bidirectional catalysis for one-pot rhamnosylations by plant rhamnosyltransferase were rarely reported before, which indicated that AtUGT78D1 was expected to be a universal and effective tool for chemo-enzymatic synthesis of diverse bioactive rhamnosylated derivatives for drug discovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aanthraquinones 3abenzophenones 3abioavailability 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3acoumarins 3adrugs 3aenzymatic reactions 3aflavonols 3aglucosylation 3aglycosides 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3asolubility 3atransferases1 aLiu, Xiao1 aLiu, Yuyu1 aWang, Xiaohui1 aZhang, Le1 aWang, Juan1 aZhang, Zhongxiu1 aShi, Shepo1 aTu, Pengfei0 tRSC advances.g2016 Sept. 06, v. 6, no. 88 p.84616-84626dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra16251g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014500165300001600310520133500326592002801661650000801689650002001697650001201717650004001729650001501769650001401784650002001798650001701818650002001835650001001855650002301865650001801888650001501906650002501921650003001946650001401976650001101990650001902001653003202020653002602052653001402078653002302092700001302115700001602128700001802144700001502162700002002177700001602197773009602213856008202309852000902391655001202400IND60553458420221119205050.0161021e20150615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055345842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2015.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wenting10aDNA methyltransferase activity detection based on fluorescent silver nanocluster hairpin-shaped DNA probe with 5’-C-rich/G-rich-3’ tails  ap. 736-740.  aDNA methylation has received a large amount of attention due to its close relationship to a wide range of biological phenomena, such as gene activation, gene imprinting, and chromatin stability. Herein, we have designed a hairpin-shaped DNA probe with 5’-C-rich/G-rich-3’ tails and developed a simple and reliable fluorescence turn-off assay for DNA adenine methylation (Dam) methyltransferase (MTase) detection combining site recognition and the fluorescence enhancement of DNA-templated silver nanoclusters (DNA–AgNCs) by guanine-rich DNA sequences. A designed hairpin probe with 5’ CCCTTACCCC and 3’ GGGTGGGGTGGGGTGGGG displays a bright red emission after reacting with AgNO3 and NaBH4. In the presence of Dam MTase, the methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease Dpn I which has the same recognition site with the Dam MTase can split the probe, freeing the G-rich sequence from the C-rich sequence, thus quenching the fluorescence of DNA–AgNCs. Compared to traditional fluorescent-based methods, this strategy is simple and inexpensive. A linear response to concentrations of Dam MTase which range from 1U/mL to 100U/mL and a detection limit of 1U/mL are obtained without any amplification steps. In addition, we also demonstrate the method can be used for evaluation and screening of inhibitors for Dam MTase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aadenine 3abiological properties and phenomena 3abiosensors 3achromatin 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3agene activation 3agenes 3amethyltransferases 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3anucleotide sequences 3arestriction endonucleases 3ascreening 3asilver 3asilver nitrate 0aSilver nanoclusters (AgNCs) 0aDNA methyltransferase 0aDam MTase 0aFluorescence assay1 aLai, Han1 aHuang, Rong1 aZhao, Chuntao1 aWang, Yimo1 aWeng, Xiaocheng1 aZhou, Xiang0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2015 June 15, v. 68 p.736-740dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245014200166300001600308520120500324592002801529650000801557650001501565650001601580650003401596650002301630650002001653650002101673650002901694650002201723650001701745650001301762650001701775650002101792653001101813653003901824653001101863653002201874653002001896700001701916700001201933700001401945773009601959856008202055852000902137655001202146IND60553458520221119204841.0161021e20150615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055345852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2015.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zonghua10aMultiple signal amplification electrogenerated chemiluminescence biosensors for sensitive protein kinase activity analysis and inhibition  ap. 771-776.  aA novel electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor was built for the detection of kinase activity based on multiple signal amplification nanoprobes. In this strategy, the Xanthine oxidase (XOD) and 5′-phosphate group end DNA conjugated AuNPs was integrated with the phosphorylated peptide by Zr4+. The XOD on gold nanoparticles can catalyze dissolved oxygen to produce H2O2 in the presence of hypoxanthine (HA) which acts as a coreactor for luminol ECL reaction. In addition, due to the excellent catalytic activity of gold nanoparticle toward luminol ECL reaction and its large surface area that can accommodate large number of XOD and DNA on the surface, the ECL signal of luminol was significantly amplified, affording a highly sensitive ECL analysis of kinase activity. The as-proposed biosensor presents a low detection limit of 0.09UmL−1 for protein kinase A (PKA) activity, wide linear range (from 0.1 to 10UmL−1) and excellent stability even in serum samples. This biosensor can also be applied for quantitative kinase inhibitor evaluation. The robust ECL biosensor provides a valuable tool for the high throughput assay in the applications of clinic diagnostic and therapeutic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3acAMP-dependent protein kinase 3acatalytic activity 3adetection limit 3adissolved oxygen 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahypoxanthine 3ananogold 3asurface area 3axanthine oxidase 0aKinase 0aElectrogenerated chemiluminescence 0aEnzyme 0aGold nanoparticle 0aPhosphorylation1 aYan, Zhiyong1 aSun, Na1 aLiu, Yang0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2015 June 15, v. 68 p.771-776dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02213naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245008200173300001800255520098700273592002801260650002201288650002201310650001401332650001501346650001401361650001401375650001401389650002201403650002201425650001401447653001301461653001301474653001201487653001001499653001701509700002501526773015701551856008601708852000901794655001201803IND60539327220221117224347.0190215e20150914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053932722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2015.05.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukadam, Aamir S.10aRetromer-mediated endosomal protein sorting: The role of unstructured domains  ap. 2620-2626.  aThe retromer complex is a key element of the endosomal protein sorting machinery that is conserved through evolution and has been shown to play a role in diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Through sorting various membrane proteins (cargo), the function of retromer complex has been linked to physiological processes such as lysosome biogenesis, autophagy, down regulation of signalling receptors and cell spreading. The cargo-selective trimer of retromer recognises membrane proteins and sorts them into two distinct pathways; endosome-to-Golgi retrieval and endosome-to-cell surface recycling and additionally the cargo-selective trimer functions as a hub to recruit accessory proteins to endosomes where they may regulate and/or facilitate retromer-mediated endosomal proteins sorting. Unstructured domains present in cargo proteins or accessory factors play key roles in both these aspects of retromer function and will be discussed in this review.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aParkinson disease 3aautophagy 3abiogenesis 3aendosomes 3aevolution 3alysosomes 3amembrane proteins 3aprotein transport 3areceptors 0aRetromer 0aEndosome 0aSorting 0aFAM21 0aWASH complex1 aSeaman, Matthew N.J.0 tFEBS letters.g2015 Sept. 14, v. 589, no. 19 p.2620-2626dElsevier B.V.aFederation of European Biochemical SocietieswJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2015.05.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03440naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006500138245011100203500002000314520222000334592002802554650002202582650001102604650002402615650001102639650001102650650001302661650001102674650001402685650001502699650002002714650001402734700002102748700002702769700002202796700001902818773012302837856007302960852000903033655001203042IND60779025220221117203041.0220603e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077902522DNAL7 a10.1002/eap.25422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEisaguirre, Joseph M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0450-847210aDemographic partitioning of dynamic energy subsidies revealed with an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck space use model  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn populations across many taxa, a large fraction of sexually mature individuals do not breed but are attempting to enter the breeding population. Such individuals, often referred to as “floaters,” can play critical roles in the dynamics and stability of these populations and buffer them through periods of high adult mortality. Floaters are difficult to study, however, so we lack data needed to understand their roles in the population ecology and conservation status of many species. Here, we analyzed satellite telemetry data with a newly developed mechanistic space use model based on an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process to help overcome the paucity of data in studying the differential habitat selection and space use of floater and territorial golden eagles Aquila chrysaetos. Our sample consisted of 49 individuals tracked over complete breeding seasons across 4 years, totaling 104 eagle breeding seasons. Modeling these data mechanistically was required to disentangle key differences in movement and particularly to separate aspects of movement driven by resource selection from those driven by use of a central place. We found that floaters generally had more expansive space use patterns and larger home ranges, as well as evidence that they partition space with territorial individuals seemingly on fine scales through differential habitat and resource selection. Floater and territorial eagle home ranges overlapped markedly, suggesting that floaters use the interstices between territories. Furthermore, floater and territorial eagles differed in how they selected for uplift variables, key components of soaring birds’ energy landscape, with territorial eagles apparently better able to find and use thermal uplift. We also found relatively low individual heterogeneity in resource selection, especially among territorial individuals, suggesting a narrow realized niche for breeding individuals, which varied from the level of among‐individual variation present during migration. This work furthers our understanding of floaters’ potential roles in the population ecology of territorial species and suggests that conserving landscapes occupied by territorial eagles also protects floaters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAquila chrysaetos 3aadults 3aconservation status 3aeagles 3aenergy 3ahabitats 3amodels 3amortality 3asatellites 3asexual maturity 3atelemetry1 aBooms, Travis L.1 aBarger, Christopher P.1 aLewis, Stephen B.1 aBreed, Greg A.0 tEcological applications.g2022 June, v. 32, no. 4 p.e2542-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.25423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01521naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245012200161300002000283520039400303592002800697650001400725650002300739650001100762650001500773650001200788650001700800700002300817700002400840700002300864700001900887700002400906700002200930773012400952856007401076852000901150655001201159IND60641063520221120102148.0190505e20160727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064106352DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra16255j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPellegrino, Sara10aCtr-1 Mets7 motif inspiring new peptide ligands for Cu(i)-catalyzed asymmetric Henry reactions under green conditions  ap. 71529-71533.  aTaking inspiration from the Ctr-1 Mets7 Cu(i) binding motif, effective hybrid catalysts have been developed for asymmetric Henry condensations under green conditions.

The spherical and monodispersed DNP-loaded microspheres were precisely fabricated by the Inventage Lab Precision Particle Fabrication method (IVL-PPFM®) based on micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and microfluidic technology. The types of polymers and end-groups, the drug/polymer ratio (DPR), and the routes of administration for DNP were studied to ensure an effective concentration and desired duration. Laser-light particle size analysis and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterization. Also, non-clinical animal models of beagle dogs are used to optimize DNP formulations and evaluate their pharmacokinetic properties. The PK results showed that the DPR was a critical factor in determining the exposure level and duration of DNR release. Furthermore, the lactide ratio, which varied depending upon the type of polymer, determined the hydrophobic interaction and was also an important factor affecting the desired DNP release. Since DNP shows a large inter-species variation between dogs and humans, PK modeling and simulation of the reference drug (i.e., Aricept®) and DNP-loaded microspheres were used for formulation development to overcome and interpret these variations. In addition, the developed PK model was extrapolated to humans using the estimated PK parameter and published clinical pharmacology data for DNP. The predicted PK profile of the DNP-loaded microsphere in humans showed that the formulation with PLGA 7525A and the DPR of 1/9 could maintain drug concentration for a month and could control initial burst release. The data obtained from the study could be used as scientific evidence for decision-making in future formulation development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeagle 3adecision making 3adrugs 3ahydrophobic bonding 3amicrofluidic technology 3amicroparticles 3aparticle size 3apatients 3apharmacokinetics 3apolymers 0aDonepezil 0aLong-acting injectable formulation 0aMicrosphere 0aPoly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) 0aMicrofluidics 0aIVL-PPFM® 0aModeling and simulation1 aLee, Sangno1 aKang, Dong-Wook,1 aKim, Ju Hee1 aKim, Ju Hee1 aCho, Hea-Young0 tJournal of controlled release.g2021 Dec. 10, v. 340 p.72-86dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.10.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245008100211300002000292500001900312520109900331592002801430596005801458596008201516596010001598650001301698650001601711650001201727650001801739650002101757650001501778650001701793650001801810650001001828650001701838650001401855650000701869650001401876650001301890650001301903651001301916700002101929700002401950700001801974700002501992773015502017856008302172852000902255655001202264IND60739444320221118071644.0210731e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073944432DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-12194-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMališová, Emília1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0894-041410aRemoval of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins by ferrate from polluted lake water  ap. 27084-27094.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFreshwater cyanobacterial blooms are becoming increasingly problematic microbiological pollutants, especially for the water resource and surface natural lakes. Cyanobacterial blooms, which produce toxins and microcystins, negatively affect the quality of water, animal, and human health, and they have also negative impact on recreational activities. The effect of electrochemically prepared potassium ferrate (green oxidation agent) on the water polluted by cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins was studied. The two most frequently occurring cyanobacterial genus Microcystis and Anabaena and the most toxic and abundant microcystin MC-LR were successfully inactivated and treated by ferrate. Potassium ferrates were applied at different conditions, such as varied hydrodynamics flow of samples, pH, and Fe(VI) concentrations. High detected elimination efficiency was consequently tested on the real water matrix from microbiological polluted natural lake Šaštín-Gazárka in Slovakia. The ferrate application leads to the better chemical, biological, microbiological, and ecotoxicological outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data  aAPVV-17-0183cAgentúra na Podporu Výskumu a Vývoja  aVEGA 1/0343/19cAgentúra Ministerstva Školstva, Vedy, Výskumu a Športu SR  aExcellent Teams of Young Researchers-ElCapFecSlovenská Technická Univerzia v Bratislave (SK) 3aAnabaena 3aMicrocystis 3aanimals 3aecotoxicology 3aelectrochemistry 3afreshwater 3ahuman health 3ahydrodynamics 3alakes 3amicrocystins 3aoxidation 3apH 3apotassium 3aresearch 3atoxicity 3aSlovakia1 aFašková, Lucia1 aPavúková, Daniela1 aHíveš, Ján1 aBenköová, Michaela0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 June, v. 28, no. 21 p.27084-27094dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-12194-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245008500177300001600262520131100278592002801589650001101617650001201628650001201640650001101652650001301663650001501676650000901691650001101700650001401711650001301725650001101738650000801749700001701757700002701774700001701801773008901818856008601907852000901993655001202002IND60095485820221122004238.0141104e20120505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009548582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2012.03.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorrent-Burgués, J.10aSynthesis, Langmuir and Langmuir–Blodgett films of a calix[7]arene ethyl ester  ap. 137-147.  aCalixarenes are promising compounds to be used as ionophores and for molecular recognition. Their ability to form Langmuir and Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films is of great interest in order to obtain small sensor devices which incorporate an active nanometric film. The p-tert-butylcalix[7]arene ethyl ester compound has been synthesised and its ability to form Langmuir and LB films has been shown. This macrocycle forms monolayers but it tends to form multilayers at higher compressions, as corroborated by AFM. BAM images show a uniform layer till the multilayer process occurs and a good correspondence with the features of the surface pressure–area isotherm. AFM images reveal that, in water subphase, films are quite homogeneous but the presence of small islands has also been observed. The presence of ions in the subphase, as sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, calcium, barium, cadmium and tin chloride salt solutions, leads to some changes in the surface pressure–area isotherms, but the more important changes are observed by AFM. More uniform films are observed for rubidium, cesium, cadmium and tin ions. A very different nanometric structure has been observed for tin ions. Some characteristics of the films, molecular area and height, are correlated with molecular modelling calculations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarium 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acesium 3acolloids 3aionophores 3aions 3amodels 3apotassium 3arubidium 3asodium 3atin1 aVocanson, F.1 aPérez-González, J.J.1 aErrachid, A.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2012 May 5, v. 401 p.137-147dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2012.03.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04172naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005900140245006900199300001800268500002000286520246500306592002802771596005902799596004502858596005502903596008202958650002303040650002103063650001103084650001103095650002203106650001303128650001303141650004403154650002003198650001503218650001203233650002803245650002103273651001303294700002403307700002103331700001703352700002003369700005703389773013603446856007503582852000903657655001203666IND60759799220221118144208.0211213e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075979922DNAL7 a10.1111/ejss.131792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTweedie, A.

We tested the hypothesis that P forms and functions in agricultural soils have changed over a period of 50–70 years of agricultural change using topsoils from 35 agricultural sites in North East Scotland compared at ‘original’ and ‘resampled’ timepoints. The original dried and archived samples were collected between 1951 and 1981, and resampling took place in the autumn of 2017 with all samples reanalysed at the same time and by same methods. A range of soil extractants, from labile (water soluble) P, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) forms, to surface exchangeable P (acid ammonium oxalate extraction), to complexed P (NaOH‐EDTA extraction), were compared with agronomic soil test P (modified Morgan; MM‐P), soil pH, and, on a subset of five time pairs (n = 10), specific P compounds using ³¹P NMR spectroscopy. Whilst MM‐P had declined significantly in time, all soils were originally and remained at high soil P status. In contrast, no change in labile P pools, nor in the more refractory P pools that replenish labile P, were observed. In the subset analysed by NMR, orthophosphate P consistently increased in concentration. This suggests that soil P shows a slow (multidecadal) response to the documented reductions in fertiliser P for the study region. Significantly greater soil pH (by 0.4 units) over time and reduced water‐soluble C and N forms suggests that labile P in contemporary soils exists in a biogeochemical environment of enhanced solubility and in excess to other available macronutrients that control its microbial cycling. This study represents a long and important period of changing drivers acting on soil P change with potential to improve understanding future soil P trajectories. The value of archived historical soils samples is shown, if care in interpretation of storage implications is made. HIGHLIGHTS: Phosphorus fractions in agricultural soil were compared at two timepoints 50–70 years apart. Whilst soil test P declined with time, other labile and refractory P pools did not change. The readjustment of P pools is slow even to substantial change in fertiliser inputs. The investigation of long‐term land use to inform future policy is enabled by soil archives.  aPublisher supplied data  cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  cEnvironmental Monitoring Solutions (EMS)  aNE/M009106/1cNatural Environment Research Council  cSoils Training and Research Studentships (STARS) Centre for Doctoral Training 3aagricultural soils 3aammonium oxalate 3aautumn 3acarbon 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorthophosphates 3aphosphorus 3asoil pH 3asustainable agriculture 3awater solubility 3aScotland1 aHaygarth, Philip M.1 aEdwards, Anthony1 aLilly, Allan1 aBaggaley, Nikki1 aStutter, Marc1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1483-376X0 tEuropean journal of soil science.g2021 Nov., v. 72, no. 6 p.2457-2476dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl51589x1351-07547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ejss.131793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013100168300001600299520139700315592002801712650002001740650001301760650002401773650002901797650002601826650002601852650002301878650003001901650002001931650001801951650002101969650001101990650000902001650002202010650001602032650001302048650001702061650001302078650001602091650001402107650003102121653001902152653002402171653001502195653003102210653001202241653001802253700001702271700001902288700005802307700001602365700001902381773013402400856008502534852000902619655001202628IND60706889120221122040717.0210226e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070688912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2020.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Rakesh10aChemo-profiling of bioactive metabolites from Chaetomium globosum for biocontrol of Sclerotinia rot and plant growth promotion  ap. 167-176.  aChaetomium globosum Kunze ex.

However, distinct research gaps are visible regarding detail characterization of bioactive metabolites. Thus the current study has been planned to characterize volatile and nonvolatile compounds of most potential strain of C. globosum 5157. GC–MS analysis of hexane fraction revealed twenty-six volatile organic compounds, representing 65.5% of total components in which 3-octanone (21.4%) was found to be most abundant. UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS analysis of ethyl acetate and methanolic fractions resulted tentative characterization of fifteen and eleven metabolites, respectively. Among these, nine metabolites were isolated, purified and characterized using ¹H NMR and High resolution mass spectrometric analysis to delineate mass fragmentation pattern for the first time. Antifungal potential of hexane fraction exhibited high inhibitory action against Sclerotium rolfsii (139.2 μg mL⁻¹) whereas ethyl acetate fraction was highly effective against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (112.1 μg mL⁻¹). Comparative assessment of C. globosum 5157 vis a vis Trichoderma harzianum A28 revealed promising effect of C. globosum 5157 with respect to antifungal properties and plant growth promotion of Brassica seedlings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAthelia rolfsii 3aBrassica 3aChaetomium globosum 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3aTrichoderma harzianum 3aantifungal properties 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3adisease control 3aethyl acetate 3agrowth promotion 3ahexane 3amass 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3amycology 3aplant growth 3aresearch 3aresearchers 3aseedlings 3avolatile organic compounds 0aChaetomium sp. 0aAntifungal activity 0aBiocontrol 0aVolatile organic compounds 0aGC–MS 0aUHPLC-QToF-MS1 aKundu, Aditi1 aDutta, Anirban1 aSaha, Supradip1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6655-40011 aDas, Amrita1 aBhowmik, Arpan0 tFungal biology.g2021 Mar., v. 125, no. 3 p.167-176dElsevier LtdaBritish Mycological SocietywJournal:jnl43377x1878-61467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2020.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03560naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245016500161300002000326500001900346520232200365592002802687650002202715650001102737650001902748650001502767650001402782650001302796650001202809650001302821650001302834651001002847700001402857700001502871700001302886700001602899773015502915856008303070852000903153655001203162IND60739444420221118071657.0210731e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073944442DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-12552-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Heng10aOptimal segmentation scale selection and evaluation of cultivated land objects based on high-resolution remote sensing images with spectral and texture features  ap. 27067-27083.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAs the remote sensing technology develops, there are increasingly more kinds of remote sensing images available from different sensors. High-resolution remote sensing images are widely used in the detection of land cover/land change due to their plenty of characteristics of a specific feature in terms of spectrum, shape, and texture. Current studies regarding cultivated land resources that are the material basis for the human beings to survive and develop focus on the method to accurately obtain the quantity of cultivated land in a region and understand the conditions and the trend of change of the cultivated land. Pixel-based method and object-oriented method are the main methods to extract cultivated land in remote sensing field. Pixel-based method ignores high-level image information, while object-oriented method takes the image spot after image segmentation as the basic unit of information extraction, which can make full use of spectral features, spatial features, semantic features, and contextual features. Image segmentation is a key step of object-oriented method; the core problem is how to obtain the optimal segmentation scale. Traditional methods for determining the optimal segmentation scale of features (such as the homogeneity-heterogeneity method, the maximum area method, and the mean variance method), in which only the spectral and geometrical characteristics are considered, while the textural characteristics are neglected. Based on this, the Quickbird and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images obtained in Xiyu Village, Pengzhou City, Sichuan Province, China, were selected as experimental objects, and the texture mean and spectral grayscale mean method (MANC method based on GLCM), which comprehensively considered the spectrum, shape, and texture features, was proposed to calculate the optimal segmentation scale of cultivated land in the study area. The error segment index (ESI) and centroids distance index (CDI) were adopted to evaluate image segmentation quality based on the method of area and position differences. The experimental results show that the MANC method based on GLCM can obtain higher segmentation precision than the traditional methods, and the segmentation results are in good agreement with the cultivated land boundary obtained by visual interpretation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3aland cover 3apollution 3aresearch 3atexture 3avariance 3avillages 3aChina1 aLiu, Chao1 aLi, Naiwen1 aFu, Xiao1 aLi, Longguo0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 June, v. 28, no. 21 p.27067-27083dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-12552-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03689naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015100165300001300316520210400329592002802433650002702461650001102488650001402499650001302513650002702526650001302553650002102566650001902587650001702606650001602623650001302639650001702652650003102669653001502700653001702715653001902732653000902751653001902760653001702779700005802796700002302854700001602877700002002893700002302913700001902936700001802955773009602973856008103069852000903150655001203159IND60528748720221119125333.0161016e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052874872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jim.2015.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeen, Miranda12aA small volume technique to examine and compare alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and non typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi)  ap. 7-14.  aA defective ability of alveolar macrophages to phagocytose both apoptotic airway epithelial cells and bacteria in chronic lung diseases potentially associated with inflammation and bacterial colonisation of the lower airways, often with non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), has been shown. We routinely assess phagocytosis in the airway of children: however, the small volume of BAL obtained usually precludes the investigation of phagocytosis of both (potentially equally relevant) apoptotic cells and NTHi.Methods: We established a ‘one-tube, dual target’ flow-cytometric assay for investigating alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of both apoptotic cells and NTHi. The effect of bacterial presence on phagocytosis of apoptotic cells was assessed by comparing results using this technique to standard ‘two tube, single target’ methods. The comparative ability of alveolar macrophages to phagocytose NTHi or apoptotic cells was assessed in 10/group of healthy adult controls and patients with COPD, 12 children with bronchiectasis, and 10 children controls. We then assessed the influence of increasing concentrations of NTHi targets on the ability of THP-1 macrophages to simultaneously phagocytose apoptotic cells.Results: Alveolar macrophages phagocytosed NTHi more avidly than apoptotic cells (mean±SEM: apoptotic cells 15.4%±0.5 vs. NTHi 17.2%±0.7, p<0.05). The presence of NTHi targets (ratio of 1:100 macrophage: NTHi; 2×107 CFU routinely applied in our assay) had no effect on the ability of macrophages to simultaneously phagocytose apoptotic cells. However, when bacterial numbers were increased (up to 4-fold) there was a small but significant suppressive effect on the ability of macrophages to phagocytose apoptotic cells.Conclusions: We describe a small volume ‘one tube, dual target’ technique to measure phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and NTHi. We show that alveolar macrophages phagocytose NTHi more avidly than apoptotic cells, and that an increased presence of NTHi in the airway may reduce the ability of alveolar macrophages to phagocytose apoptotic cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemophilus influenzae 3aadults 3aapoptosis 3abacteria 3abacterial colonization 3achildren 3aepithelial cells 3aflow cytometry 3ainflammation 3amacrophages 3apatients 3aphagocytosis 3arespiratory tract diseases 0aMacrophage 0aPhagocytosis 0aApoptotic cell 0aNTHi 0aFlow cytometry 0aLung disease1 aAhern, Jessica1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9414-87321 aCarroll, Alexander1 aHodge, Greg1 aPizzutto, Susan1 aJersmann, Hubertus1 aReynolds, Paul1 aHodge, Sandra0 tJournal of Immunological Methods.g2016 Feb., v. 429 p.7-14dElsevier B.V.x0022-17597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2015.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000008004100012016002200053024003200075040001800107100002200125245011900147300001600266500001500282520163500297592002801932650002301960650002501983650002102008650002402029650001002053650002002063650001702083650001202100650002202112650001202134650001502146650001202161650001302173651001002186653001502196700002102211700002102232700002402253700001702277700001902294700002102313700002202334700002902356773012902385856004502514852000902559655001202568IND44735521120531e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447355212DNAL7 a10.1002/jpln.2011003272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiesmeier, Martin10aShort‐term degradation of semiarid grasslands—results from a controlled‐grazing experiment in Northern China  ap. 434-442.  a2019-12-06  aThe assessment of grassland degradation due to overgrazing is a global challenge in semiarid environments. In particular, investigations of beginning steppe degradation after a change or intensification of the land use are needed in order to detect and adjust detrimental land‐use management rapidly and thus prevent severe damages in these sensitive ecosystems. A controlled‐grazing experiment was established in Inner Mongolia (China) in 2005 that included ungrazed (UG) and heavily grazed plots with grazing intensities of 4.5 (HG4.5) and 7.5 (HG7.5) sheep per hectare. Several soil and vegetation parameters were investigated at all sites before the start of the experiment. Topsoil samples were analyzed for soil organic C (SOC), total N (Ntot), total S (Stot), and bulk density (BD). As vegetation parameters, aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), tiller density (TD), and leaf‐area index (LAI) were determined. After 3 y of the grazing experiment, BD increased and SOC, Ntot, Stot, ANPP, and LAI significantly decreased with increasing grazing intensity. These sensitive parameters can be regarded as early‐warning indicators for degradation of semiarid grasslands. Vegetation parameters were, however, more sensitive not only to grazing but also to temporal variation of precipitation between 2006 and 2008. Contrary, soil parameters were primarily affected by grazing and resistant against climatic variations. The assessment of starting conditions in the study area and the application of defined grazing intensities is essential for the investigation of short‐term degradation in semiarid environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemporal variation 3aprimary productivity 3anitrogen content 3asoil organic carbon 3asheep 3aleaf area index 3abulk density 3atopsoil 3agrazing intensity 3asteppes 3aecosystems 3atillers 3aland use 3aChina 0agrasslands1 aKreyling, Olivia1 aSteffens, Markus1 aSchoenbach, Philipp1 aWan, Hongwei1 aGierus, Martin1 aTaube, Friedhelm1 aKölbl, Angelika,1 aKögel‐Knabner, Ingrid0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2012 June, v. 175, no. 3 p.434-442dWILEY‐VCH Verlagx1436-87307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.201100327  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245016900156300002000325520172100345592002802066650000802094650001602102650001102118650002102129650001502150650001702165650001202182650001802194650001102212650001602223650001302239700001602252700001702268700001802285700002002303773012502323856007502448852000902523655001202532IND60641063720221120092806.0210813e20160930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064106372DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra16262b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yifu10aHydrothermal synthesis of vanadium dioxides/carbon composites and their transformation to surface-uneven V₂O₅ nanoparticles with high electrochemical properties  ap. 93741-93752.  aVanadium dioxides/carbon composites composed of vanadium dioxides@carbon core–shell structures and amorphous carbon spheres were successfully synthesized using glucose as the carbon sources by a facile one-step hydrothermal route. Then vanadium dioxides/carbon composites were converted to surface-uneven V₂O₅ nanoparticles by the calcination in air atmospheres. The amorphous carbon reacting with O₂ in the air to release gas results in remaining V₂O₅ nanoparticles possessing broken, rough and poral structures. The electrochemical properties of surface-uneven V₂O₅ nanoparticles as supercapacitor electrodes were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) both in the aqueous and organic electrolyte. Surface-uneven V₂O₅ nanoparticles exhibit the specific capacitance of 406 F g⁻¹ at the current density of 0.2 A g⁻¹ and retain 246 F g⁻¹ even at high current density of 10 A g⁻¹. The influence of the calcined temperature and time on the specific capacitance, phase and morphology of the products were discussed in detail. The results revealed that the calcination at 400 °C for 4 h with comparatively low ratio of V⁵⁺/V⁴⁺ are favorable for surface-uneven V₂O₅ nanoparticles with the high electrochemical property. During the cycle performance, the specific capacitances of V₂O₅ nanoparticles after 100 cycles are 13.8% and 98.5% of the initial discharge capacity in the aqueous and organic electrolyte, respectively, indicating the cycle performance is significantly improved in organic electrolyte. It turns out that surface-uneven V₂O₅ nanoparticles are an ideal material for supercapacitor electrode in the present work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aglucose 3ananoparticles 3aoxygen 3atemperature 3avanadium1 aZheng, Jiqi1 aWang, Qiushi1 aNiuyuetaohua,1 aMeng, Changgong0 tRSC advances.g2016 Sept. 30, v. 6, no. 96 p.93741-93752dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra16262b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03247naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010300169300002000272520196200292592002802254650001502282650001402297650001302311650002502324650001802349650001702367650001802384650001902402650001602421650001202437650001102449650001402460650001802474650001802492700002002510700001802530700001802548773016802566856008202734852000902816655001202825IND60595208520221122165545.0200207e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059520852DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-9123-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaullier, Céline10aIs pesticide sorption by constructed wetland sediments governed by water level and water dynamics?  ap. 14324-14335.  aConstructed wetlands (CWs) are used to reduce the pesticide inputs from tile drainage or run-off to surface water. Their effectiveness appears variable and remains to be better characterized and understood. The aim of this study was to assess the influences of two hydraulic parameters (i.e., dynamics and water level) on the sorption process occurring in CWs. Then, two solid/liquid ratios were studied (1/1 and 1/5) to mimic the water level variation in the field, and two agitation speeds were used (none and gentle agitation) to simulate different water dynamics (stagnation and flow pass, respectively). Sorption kinetics and isotherms were obtained for four pesticides with contrasting properties. The pesticide adsorption coefficients were classified as follows: boscalid (BSC) > cyproconazole (CYP) > isoproturon (IPU) ∼ dimethachlor (DMT) at any ratio or agitation, in agreement with their water solubilities and K ₒw values. The effect of the solid/liquid ratio was evidenced for all conditions. Indeed, the adsorption equilibrium time was reached more quickly for the 1/1 ratio (24–72 h) than for the 1/5 ratio (96–120 h). In addition, the adsorption coefficients (K f ᵃᵈˢ) were larger for the 1/1 ratio (1.8–11.2 L kg⁻¹) than for the 1/5 ratio (1.0–5.9 L kg⁻¹). The agitation effect was ﻿more evidenced for the 1/5 ratio and for the more hydrophobic molecules, such as BSC and CYP, for which adsorption equilibrium time was never reached with agitation (>120 h), while it was reached at 96 h without agitation. Moreover, the K f ᵃᵈˢ values were larger with agitation than without agitation for BSC and CYP, whereas they were similar for the two agitations for IPU and DMT. Our results demonstrated that the hydrodynamic function of CWs could influence pesticide sorption with variable effects according to the molecular properties and consequently influence the mitigation effect of CWs throughout the year.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aagitation 3aboscalid 3aconstructed wetlands 3acyproconazole 3adimethachlor 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrophobicity 3aisoproturon 3aliquids 3arunoff 3asediments 3asurface water 3atile drainage1 aDousset, Sylvie1 aBillet, David1 aBaran, Nicole0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 May, v. 25, no. 15 p.14324-14335dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9123-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03407naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012000174520164400294592002801938650001901966650001601985650001402001650001502015650002202030650001302052650001902065650001102084650006602095650000902161650002202170650003002192650004502222650002202267650002702289650001602316651001102332651001202343651001102355653001702366653002102383653002702404700002302431700001602454700002402470700001802494700002302512700002502535700001902560700002302579700002202602773011002624856008602734852000902820655001202829IND60688294520221120070809.0200523e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068829452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2020.1078902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaradjian, Gregory10aSpecies identification of Trichinella originated from various host and different geographical location by MALDI-TOF  aThe foodborne zoonotic nematode Trichinella spp. can cause human trichinellosis when raw or undercooked contaminated meat is ingested.To date, twelve Trichinella species/genotypes have been described. According to EU regulation any Trichinella larvae detected during mandatory routine examinations need to be identified at a species level by a competent laboratory. Currently, Trichinella species identification is performed using molecular biology tools such as multiplex PCR, PCR-sequencing or PCR-RFLP. These techniques require high level of skills for good interpretation of the results. Due to its rapidness and ease of use a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) protocol was previously developed for the identification of Trichinella species.Using this method, spectra from different Trichinella species and strains were acquired allowing to generate new Main Spectra (MSP). Finally a new MSP database from Trichinella spp. Samples of different countries (France, Germany and Poland), including field samples, was generated. Comparing the different main spectra, Trichinella worms were identified at the species level and differences in the genetic diversities within the different species are discussed.In conclusion, using the previously described method on field samples is a reliable, rapid, easy-to-use and cheap tool for Trichinella species identification. The new Trichinella database could be incremented with new samples. It constitutes a tool, which could be used as an alternative method to replace the actual molecular methods for Trichinella species identification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aTrichinella 3adatabases 3adesorption 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ahuman diseases 3alarvae 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3ameat 3amolecular biology 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asequence analysis 3aspecies identification 3atrichinosis 3aFrance 3aGermany 3aPoland 0aMALDI-TOF MS 0aTrichinella spp. 0aSpecies identification1 aBilska-Zając, Ewa1 aBahn, Peter1 aPy, Jean-Sébastien1 aJohne, Anette1 aGassilloud, Benoit1 aRóżycki, Mirosław1 aCencek, Tomasz1 aMayer-Scholl, Anne1 aVallée, Isabelle0 tExperimental parasitology.g2020 June, v. 213 p.107890-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45466x0014-48947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2020.1078903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02346naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245011600208300002000324520106800344592002801412596012101440650001301561650001101574650001401585650001601599650001901615650001501634650004301649650001101692651001001703700002401713773016801737856008201905852000901987655001201996IND60595208620221120214119.0200207e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059520862DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-1607-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrivastava, Rohit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1552-915610aImpact of dynamical and microphysical schemes on black carbon prediction in a regional climate model over India  ap. 14844-14855.  aAerosol concentrations and their properties strongly depend on dynamics of atmosphere. Effects of physical and dynamical parameterizations on meteorology and black carbon (BC) mass in Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-CHEM) are investigated over India. Simulations are performed in ten experiments considering two boundary layer, three cumulus parameterization, and five microphysics schemes during winter and monsoon of 2008. Morrison double-moment physical parameterization, Yonsei University boundary layer parameterization with Kain-Fritsch and Grell-Freitas cumulus parameterization schemes are found suitable to simulate meteorology and BC mass over India. BC mass is found to be underestimated in almost all experiments during winter; while, BC mass is overestimated in monsoon over Ahmedabad, Delhi, and Kanpur, which suggests inefficient wet scavenging of BC in monsoon, while lower emission rate may cause differences in winter. The results will be useful in understanding parameterizations and their impact on aerosols.  aPublisher supplied data  aSR/S4/AS-107/2012cScience and Engineering Research Board, Department of Science and Technology.

The study was done using D-optimal design. Three variables in both acids were included in the design: time (20–80min), temperature (160–180°C) and initial lignin concentration (0–20g/l). The dependent variables were xylose conversion, furfural yield, furfural selectivity and pH change. The results showed that the xylose conversion and furfural yield decreased in sulphuric acid, while in formic acid the changes were minor. Additionally, it was showed that lignin has an acid-neutralising capacity, and the added lignin increased the pH of reactant solutions in both acids. The pH rise was considerably lower in formic acid than in sulphuric acid. However, the higher pH did not explain all the changes in conversion and yield, and thus lignin evidently inhibits the formation of furfural.  aPublisher supplied data 3aformic acid 3afurfural 3alignin 3apH 3asulfuric acid 3atemperature 3axylose 0aFurfural 0aXylose dehydration 0aLignin 0aDesign of experiments 0aAcid catalysis1 aAhola, Juha1 aTanskanen, Juha0 tBioresource technology.g2015 Feb., v. 177 p.94-101dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2014.11.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03447naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245017400199300001800373500001900391500002000410520143100430592002801861596007201889596007801961596004902039650001902088650002102107650001702128650003002145650001202175650002002187650001502207650001902222650001602241650001302257650002202270650001502292650000902307650001602316650001002332700006102342700006002403700007002463700006302533700005802596700006402654773011702718856007302835852000902908655001202917IND60734415320221118233019.0210417e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073441532DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.170122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHagenbo, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4192-051110aProduction and turnover of mycorrhizal soil mycelium relate to variation in drought conditions in Mediterranean Pinus pinaster, Pinus sylvestris and Quercus ilex forests  ap. 1609-1622.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn forests, ectomycorrhizal mycelium is pivotal for driving soil carbon and nutrient cycles, but how ectomycorrhizal mycelial dynamics vary in ecosystems with drought periods is unknown. We quantified the production and turnover of mycorrhizal mycelium in Mediterranean Pinus pinaster, Pinus sylvestris and Quercus ilex forests and related the estimates to standardised precipitation index (SPI), to study how mycelial dynamics relates to tree species and drought‐moisture conditions. Production and turnover of mycelium was estimated between July and February, by quantifying the fungal biomass (ergosterol) in ingrowth mesh bags and using statistical modelling. SPI for time scales of 1–3 months was calculated from precipitation records and precipitation data over the study period. Forests dominated by Pinus trees displayed higher biomass but were seasonally more variable, as opposed to Q. ilex forests where the mycelial biomass remained lower and stable over the season. Production and turnover, respectively, varied between 1.4–5.9 kg ha⁻¹ d⁻¹ and 7.2–9.9 times yr⁻¹ over the different forest types and were positively correlated with 2‐month and 3‐month SPI over the study period. Our results demonstrated that mycorrhizal mycelial biomass varied with season and tree species and we speculate that production and turnover are related to physiology and plant host performance during drought.  aPublisher supplied data  aAGL2015‐66001‐C3cSpanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity  aRTI2018‐099315‐a‐I00cSpanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity  aRYC‐2016‐20528cRamon y Cajal fellowship 3aPinus pinaster 3aPinus sylvestris 3aQuercus ilex 3aatmospheric precipitation 3adrought 3aectomycorrhizae 3aergosterol 3afungal biomass 3ahost plants 3amycelium 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aphysiology 3asoil 3asoil carbon 3atrees1 aPiñuela, Yasmine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1150-71601 aCastaño, Carles1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2403-70061 aMartínez de Aragón, Juan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5663-20801 ade‐Miguel, Sergio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9738-06571 aAlday, Josu G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7510-86551 aBonet, José Antonio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2209-93740 tnew phytologist.g2021 May, v. 230, no. 4 p.1609-1622dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.170123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02747naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001800160245009800178300001600276500000900292520170300301592002802004650002002032650001002052650001102062650002102073650001602094650001302110700002002123700002002143700001902163773012102182852000902303856009702312655001202409IND9003679820221121044229.0191122e199005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900367982DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1990.00021962008200030041x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLawlor, D.

The effect of location (environment) on the base temperature for growth of sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] genotypes was studied. Seeds of six sorghum genotypes were obtained from three locations: Manhattan, KS, College Station and Lubbock, TX. The seeds were placed on moist germination blotter paper on a one-way thermal gradient plate. Observations were made at least daily for 3 wk to determine the number of days required for (i) germination (i.e., protrusion of the radicle from the seed), (ii) root elongation to 10 mm or longer, and (iii) shoot elongation to 10 mm or longer. The base temperature for germination of each genotype was then determined as the x-intercept from regressing the rate of germination (i.e., the reciprocal of the number of days required to germinate) vs. the mean temperature. A similar regression was used to determine the base temperatures for shoot elongation and for root elongation of each genotype. The values of base temperature for shoot and root elongation were similar for the genotypes studied, and were consistent with the values of base temperature for emergence of sorghum reported in the literature; whereas the base temperature for germination values were up to 4.6 °C lower than reported values. Results indicated that: the base temperature for shoot elongation is not affected, the base temperature for root elongation is somewhat affected, and the base temperature for germination is more affected by the location (environment) of seed production.

The objective was to test whether tree spatial structure can be used as an indicator of stand dynamics. The model simulates the growth, mortality and recruitment of trees in a multi-specific and uneven-aged stand. It includes deterministic and stochastic processes so that repeated simulations do not lead to the same stand but provide several possible results for a given dynamic (defined by a set of parameters). Second-order neighbourhood analyses were used to characterize the resulting spatial structures. They showed a high variability for a given set of parameters. Only the main trends in the spatial structure can be interpreted. Sensitivity analyses, concerning the influence of competition on spatial structure, showed that in heterogeneous stands confounding effects can hinder the interpretation of the spatial structure if all the trees are considered. The spatial structure of the canopy trees alone proved easier to interpret as it is directly linked to post recruitment competition. Inference on the dominant modality of competition (one-sided or two-sided) based on the spatial structure proved difficult.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3amodels 3aforest stands 3atrees 3astochastic processes 3amortality 3aforests 0aIndividual-based model 0arecruitment 0aTwo-sided competition 0aIndia 0aSecond density neighbourhood spatial analysis 0aOne-sided competition 0aWet forest 0aEvergreen forest1 aRobert, Audrey0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2003 Dec., v. 14, no. 6 p.823-834dOpulus PresswJournal:jnl46820x1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1658/1100-9233(2003)014[0823:AMTARB]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03666naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001900160245012900179300001600308500000900324520218900333592002802522650002002550650002202570650002002592650002302612650001702635650002502652650001102677650001602688650001102704650002502715650001602740650001702756650002202773650001602795650002502811650003302836650002002869651001402889700002002903700001602923700001702939773012202956852000903078856009703087655001203184IND9004926020221121044132.0191122e198311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900492602DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1983.00021962007500060009x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharatt, B.

This paper describes a study on a Waukegan silt loam soil (fine-silty over sandy or sandy skeletal, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludolls) where stress differences between irrigated and nonirrigated alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) were evaluated during the daytime in order to expand the limited information available on alfalfa water relations. Canopy temperature (CT), evapotranspiration (ET), and leaf water potential (Χ₁ served as indicators of stress and were measured using an infrared thermometer, portable chamber, and pressure chamber, respectively. Canopy temperature and ET did not differ appreciably between irrigated and nonirrigated alfalfa in early morning, but after 0900 h and throughout the afternoon nonirrigated alfalfa had a higher CT and lower ET. Leaf water potential of nonirrigated alfalfa was consistently lower during the day. The maximum difference in CT, ET, and Ψ₁ between irrigated and nonirrigated alfalfa occurred at 1500 h where they equalled 2°C, 0.2 mm/h, and 0.7 MPa, respectively. These stress differences reflected the differences in the plant available water of 280 and 60 mm (corresponding to 117 and 25% of extractable water) in the 1.83-m soil profile of the irrigated and nonirrigated plots, respectively. Nonirrigated alfalfa Ψ declined at a faster rate as the peak stress period (1500 h) was approached; however, after this period a faster rehydration was observed for this treatment, as indicated by the relationship between and ET. Despite the faster rehydration of nonirrigated alfalfa, the degree of hysteresis was greater for this treatment than for irrigated alfalfa. The relationship between CT and ET indicated a larger rate of change in CT prior to the peak stress period for nonirrigated as compared to irrigated alfalfa. After this time and until 1700 h, CT remained constant as ET decreased, indicating a decreasing ratio between ET and net radiation and thus greater restrictions on water movement through the plant, a direct cause of the hysteresis observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago sativa 3airrigated farming 3adryland farming 3aevapotranspiration 3awater stress 3aleaf water potential 3acanopy 3atemperature 3aleaves 3awater use efficiency 3ameasurement 3athermometers 3adiurnal variation 3arehydration 3airrigated conditions 3adry environmental conditions 3astress response 3aMinnesota1 aReicosky, D.

The study aimed at developing and evaluating a microsphere-based immunofluorescence assay (MIA) for the measurement of IgA, trying to fulfill the need of a quicker method using only small volumes of CSF.Microsphere beads were coated with goat-anti-dog IgA antibodies and bound IgA was detected by a mouse-anti-dog IgA antibody in combination with a PE-labeled goat-anti-mouse IgG. CSF from 44 dogs were tested for IgA and compared with an in-house utilized ELISA.Using clinical relevant reference ranges, the new method showed a good agreement (84.17%) with the ELISA. A method comparison revealed a moderate agreement only. These findings indicate that the MIA will not replace the ELISA, but it opens the possibility for further research with microsphere-based assays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ablood serum 3aantibodies 3adogs 3acerebrospinal fluid 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aimmunoglobulin A 3afluorescent antibody technique 2aAnimals 2aArteritisxcerebrospinal fluidximmunologyxveterinary. 2aDog Diseasesxcerebrospinal fluidximmunology. 2aDogsxcerebrospinal fluidximmunology. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aFluorescent Antibody Techniquexmethodsxveterinary. 2aImmunoglobulin Axcerebrospinal fluid 2aMeningitisxcerebrospinal fluidximmunologyxveterinary. 2aMiceximmunology 2aMicrospheres 0aDog 0aMicrosphere-based immunofluorescence assay 0amethodology 0anew methods 0aCerebrospinal fluid 0aImmunoglobulin A1 aCarlson, R.1 aTipold, A.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2013 Feb., v. 94, no. 1 p.69-72dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.wJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2012.07.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245011100188300001600299520137600315592002801691650001701719650002101736650002201757650001201779650001301791650001501804650002401819650002201843650001601865650001201881650003701893650001201930650001401942650001201956650001101968650001401979650002501993650004202018650000902060650001202069650001602081651003102097651003102128700001802159773008402177856004802261852000902309655001202318IND50073517820221122083357.0140301e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007351782DNAL7 a244196632pmid7 a10.1007/s10393-013-0890-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTran, Phoebe Minh10aEffects of Landscape Fragmentation and Climate on Lyme Disease Incidence in the Northeastern United States  ap. 394-404.  aLyme disease is the most frequently reported vector borne illness in the United States, and incidences are increasing steadily year after year. This study explores the influence of landscape (e.g., land use pattern and landscape fragmentation) and climatic factors (e.g., temperature and precipitation) at a regional scale on Lyme disease incidence. The study area includes thirteen states in the Northeastern United States. Lyme disease incidence at county level for the period of 2002–2006 was linked with several key landscape and climatic variables in a negative binomial regression model. Results show that Lyme disease incidence has a relatively clear connection with regional landscape fragmentation and temperature. For example, more fragmentation between forests and residential areas results in higher local Lyme disease incidence. This study also indicates that, for the same landscape, some landscape variables derived at a particular scale show a clearer connection to Lyme disease than do others. In general, the study sheds more light on connections between Lyme disease incidence and climate and landscape patterns at the regional scale. Integrating findings of this regional study with studies at a local scale will further refine understanding of the pattern of Lyme disease as well as increase our ability to predict, prevent, and respond to disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLyme disease 3aclimatic factors 3adisease incidence 3aforests 3aland use 3alandscapes 3aregression analysis 3aresidential areas 3atemperature 2aAnimals 2aBorrelia burgdorferixphysiology 2aClimate 2aEcosystem 2aForests 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aIxodesxmicrobiology 2aLyme Diseasexepidemiologyxetiology. 2aRain 2aSeasons 2aTemperature 3aNortheastern United States 0aNew Englandxepidemiology.1 aWaller, Lance0 tEcohealth.g2013 Dec., v. 10, no. 4 p.394-404dSpringer-Verlagx1612-92027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10393-013-0890-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245008200180300001600262520108300278592002801361650001301389650001101402650001801413650001101431650001301442650000901455650001601464650001401480650001801494650001901512650001301531650001601544700001801560700002501578700005601603773008701659856008501746852000901831655001201840IND60635762620221119051507.0190523e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063576262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2019.03.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFakhrhoseini, Seyed Mousa10aNano-magnetite decorated carbon fibre for enhanced interfacial shear strength  ap. 361-369.  aThe modification of carbon fibres surface has been achieved by high temperature (1000 °C) growth of Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) on the surface of carbon fibres using ammonium iron (II) sulphate as a single precursor of the nanoparticles. As a consequence, the formation of MNPs on the surface of unsized carbon fibres increased the interfacial shear strength by 84.3%, as measured by single fibre fragmentation test. Further investigation on interfacial reinforcing mechanism confirmed an increase in average total surface energy of carbon fibres from 58.81 for unmodified carbon fibre to 64.31 mJ/m2 for MNPs decorated fibres. Fundamental analysis revealed a 12.44% increase in average dispersive and no significant reduction in average specific surface energy of carbon fibre after MNPs surface decoration. This led to an increase in interlaminar shear strength from 46.9 to 63.3 MPa due to the strong mechanical interlocking at the MNPs decorated-carbon fibre/epoxy interface which can be described by improve in the dispersive component of the surface energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3acarbon 3acarbon fibers 3aenergy 3aepoxides 3airon 3airon oxides 3amagnetism 3ananoparticles 3ashear strength 3asulfates 3atemperature1 aLi, Quanxiang1 aUnnikrishnan, Vishnu1 aNaebe, Minoo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0607-63270 tCarbon.g2019 July, v. 148 p.361-369dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.03.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010600166300001400272520111700286592002801403650002701431650002301458650002201481650001301503650001601516650001901532650002001551650001801571650002001589650001801609650001401627650001401641650001401655650001101669650001601680653002501696653002301721653002701744653001901771700001501790700001301805700002001818700001801838773010901856856008201965852000902047655001202056IND60633140620221119182525.0190516e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063314062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2019.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBao, Pengcheng10aSynergistic effect of a combined live Vibrio anguillarum and Edwardsiella piscicida vaccine in turbot  ap. 84-90.  aIn aquaculture, more than one pathogen usually be isolated from the sick fish, creating an urgent need for developing combined vaccines to control fish disease caused by multiple pathogens simultaneously. In our previous work, two live attenuated vaccines against Vibrio anguillarum and Edwardsiella piscicida were vaccinated in turbot, exhibiting an efficient protection. However, some immunological processes such as antigenic competition, antigenic cross-reaction and antigen induced suppression during combined vaccination are unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of the combined live vaccines and explored the immunological processes after vaccination. We found that the combined two live attenuated vaccines for V. anguillarum and E. piscicida induced a stronger immune response without existing antigen competition. Instead, a synergistic effect was observed not only for triggering innate immune response but for stimulation of adaptive immunity. Our study suggested that the two combined live vaccines against V. anguillarum and E. piscicida could be used simultaneously in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEdwardsiella piscicida 3aVibrio anguillarum 3aadaptive immunity 3aantigens 3aaquaculture 3across reaction 3adisease control 3afish diseases 3ainnate immunity 3alive vaccines 3apathogens 3ashellfish 3asynergism 3aturbot 3avaccination 0aCombined-vaccination 0aVibrio anguillarum 0aEdwardsiella piscicida 0aImmune synergy1 aSun, Xiang1 aLiu, Qin1 aZhang, Yuanxing1 aLiu, Xiaohong0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2019 May, v. 88 p.84-90dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2019.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014900165300001600314520096400330592002801294650001801322650001001340650001501350650002801365650002301393650001601416650002501432650001101457650001601468650001501484650001601499650001101515651001601526700001901542700002301561700001901584773009801603856008101701852000901782655001201791IND60133402320221120113252.0150520e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013340232DNAL7 a10.1007/s10340-015-0650-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCutler, G.

In the summer of 2012, we collected a large number of blueberry spanworm larvae from two managed blueberry fields in Colchester Co., Nova Scotia. Approximately 50–60 % of the field-collected larvae maintained in the laboratory were parasitized and killed. Identifications of parasitoids were based on morphological characters and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I sequencing. The majority of parasitism was by Phryxe pecosensis (Diptera: Tachinidae), and a wasp suspected to be a new species of Tranosemella or Tranosema (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae). Our results demonstrate that parasitism of blueberry spanworm can be high in lowbush blueberry and that conservation or augmentative biological control should be considered in future development of management programs for this pest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIchneumonidae 3aItame 3aTachinidae 3aVaccinium angustifolium 3abiological control 3ablueberries 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3alarvae 3anew species 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3asummer 3aNova Scotia1 aGariepy, T.

We herein report the synthesis of two new functionalized derivatives of pyrimethanil carrying an equivalent spacer arm at different positions of the molecule. The influence of the linker tethering site on the affinity of monoclonal antibodies was shown. Moreover, the development of competitive immunoassays in different formats and with high sensitivity to the target analyte – IC50 values below 0.3 μg/L – is described. Optimized assays were characterized by the determination of the limit of quantification, trueness, and precision using water-diluted QuEChERS extracts of fruits and vegetables fortified with pyrimethanil. Finally, in-field treated and blind spiked strawberry, tomato, and cucumber samples were analyzed by the developed immunoassays and a reference chromatographic method. Using Deming regression analysis, we show that results from both methodologies were statistically comparable.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatography 3acucumbers 3afoods 3afruits 3ahaptens 3aimmunoassays 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apyrimethanil 3aregression analysis 3astrawberries 3atomatoes 0aAnilinopyrimidine fungicides 0aELISA 0aFood safety 0aPesticide residues 0aRegioisomeric haptens 0aPyrimethanil (PubChem CID: 91650) 0aCyprodinil (PubChem CID: 86367) 0aMepanipyrim (PubChem CID: 86296)1 aMercader, Josep V.1 aAgulló, Consuelo1 aAbad-Somovilla, Antonio1 aAbad-Fuentes, Antonio0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2015 Sept., v. 63, no. 1 p.604-611dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2015.03.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02324naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245015900183300001600342520089700358592002801255650002801283650001501311650001001326650004301336650001201379650004601391650002601437650002601463650006201489650001501551650003501566651001501601651001101616651003001627700001901657700002201676700002001698700001901718773008401737856004801821852000901869655001201878IND50073518020221122083412.0140301e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007351802DNAL7 a244196682pmid7 a10.1007/s10393-013-0895-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuss, Monika10aPrevalence of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in 120 Archived Specimens of Lithobates catesbeianus (American Bullfrog) Collected in California, 1924–2007  ap. 339-343.  aThe chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has been identified as a major cause of the recent worldwide amphibian decline. Numerous species in North America alone are under threat or have succumbed to Bd-driven population extinctions. The American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) has been reported as a tolerant carrier of Bd. In this report, we used a qPCR assay to test 120 archived American bullfrog specimens collected between 1924 and 2007 in California, USA and Baja California, Mexico. The overall prevalence of Bd infection in this archived population of L. catesbeianus was 19.2%. The earliest positive specimen was collected in Sacramento County, California, USA in 1928 and is to date the earliest positive archived Bd specimen reported globally. These data demonstrate that Bd-infected wild amphibians have been present in California longer than previously known.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLithobates catesbeianus 3aamphibians 3afungi 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 2aAnimals 2aChytridiomycotaxisolation & purification 2aHistory, 20th Century 2aHistory, 21st Century 2aMycosesxepidemiologyxhistoryxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aPrevalence 2aRana catesbeianaxmicrobiology 3aCalifornia 3aMexico 0aCaliforniaxepidemiology.1 aHuntley, Laura1 aVredenburg, Vance1 aJohns, Jennifer1 aGreen, Sherril0 tEcohealth.g2013 Dec., v. 10, no. 4 p.339-343dSpringer-Verlagx1612-92027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10393-013-0895-6  aDNAL 7aarticle03365naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245014800164500001400312520191400326592002802240650000802268650002002276650002302296650001102319650002802330650002302358650001202381650001102393650002502404650002302429650001502452650002402467650001002491650002602501650002302527700002702550700002602577700002802603700001902631700002002650700002002670773012202690856007402812852000902886655001202895IND60729379020221118041921.0210228e20210204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072937902DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130205152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChrzastek, Zuzanna 10aAssociation of Lower Nutritional Status and Education Level with the Severity of Depression Symptoms in Older Adults—A Cross Sectional Survey  aNAL-light  aThe study analyzes the relationship between nutritional status and depression symptoms severity in the older population. A total of 1975 older outpatients (1457 women and 518 men, median age 75) were included in the study. Depression symptoms severity was assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Participants were divided into two subgroups according to GDS score. Group A: 0–5 points—without depression symptoms (1237, W:898, M:339), and group B: 6–15 points—with depression symptoms (738, W:559, M:179). The nutritional status of the patients was assessed with Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) and basic anthropometric variables (waist, hips, calf circumferences, body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio (WHR), and waist to height ratio (WHtR)). Education years and chronic diseases were also noted. Women with higher depression symptoms severity had significantly lower MNA scores [A: 26.5 (24–28) (median (25%−75% quartiles)) vs. B:23 (20.5–26)], shorter education time [A:12 (8–16) vs. B:7 (7–12)], smaller calf circumference [A:36 (33–38) vs. B: 34 (32–37)], and higher WHtR score [A:57.4 (52.3–62.9) vs. B:58.8 (52.1–65.6)]. Men with depression symptoms had lower MNA scores [A:26.5 (24.5–28) vs. B:24 (20.5–26.5)], shorter education [A:12 (9.5–16), B:10 (7–12)], and smaller calf circumference [A:37 (34–39), B:36 (33–38)]. In the model of stepwise multiple regression including age, years of education, anthropometric variables, MNA and concomitant diseases nutritional assessment, and education years were the only independent variables predicting severity of depression symptoms both in women and men. Additionally, in the female group, odds were higher with higher WHtR. Results obtained in the study indicate a strong relationship between proper nutritional status and education level with depression symptoms severity in older women and men.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage 3abody mass index 3acalf circumference 3acalves 3across-sectional studies 3aeducational status 3afemales 3amodels 3anutrition assessment 3anutritional status 3apopulation 3aregression analysis 3awaist 3awaist-to-height ratio 3awaist-to-hip ratio1 aGuligowska, Agnieszka 1 aSoltysik, Bartlomiej 1 aPigłowska, Malgorzata 1 aBorowiak, Ewa 1 aKostka, Joanna 1 aKostka, Tomasz 0 tNutrients.g2021 Feb. 04, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130205153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245007200204300001600276520129600292592002801588650001401616650001701630650001601647650001901663650001601682650001001698650001301708650002301721653001801744653002101762653001801783653002601801653003801827700001501865700001801880773008701898856008501985852000902070655001202079IND60635762820221119051504.0190523e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063576282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2019.03.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3234-691710aMicro-mechanism and influencing factors of graphene foam elasticity  ap. 267-276.  aThe emerging graphene foams (GrFs) have received increasing attention in both scientific and engineering fields in recent years. A good elasticity is the prerequisite for its further applications. However, the mechanism and basic characteristics of elasticity of GrFs have not been understood clearly so far. In this paper, we conduct systematic simulations of compression-uncompression and tension-untension to study the characteristics of GrF elasticity using the coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) method. We find that deformation of GrFs is highly nonuniform at the scale of both flakes and regions, which is qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations. The deformation of GrFs is dominated by the flake bending rather than stretching, which is independent of the loading type, size, shape or thickness of flakes, as well as the density or stiffness of crosslinks. The great asymmetry of elasticity under tension and compression is induced by different mode of bond breaking. Furthermore, by evaluating the elastic energy density, we find that both thicker flakes and more crosslinks are two key factors responsible for good elasticity of GrFs. These results should be useful for understanding GrF elasticity and further design of advanced graphene-based materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetry 3acrosslinking 3adeformation 3aenergy density 3aengineering 3afoams 3agraphene 3amolecular dynamics 0aGraphene foam 0aSuper-elasticity 0aNonuniformity 0aDeformation mechanism 0aCoarse-grained molecular dynamics1 aZhang, Cun1 aChen, Shaohua0 tCarbon.g2019 July, v. 148 p.267-276dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.03.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01970naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245006800166300001600234520077300250592002801023650002801051650001701079650001701096650002301113650002501136650002601161650001301187653002101200653001601221653001701237700002301254700002901277700001701306700002201323773015201345856007801497852000901575655001201584IND60523155920221122104149.0170211e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052315592DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-2013-7-8072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshitani, Tatsuya10aAntitermite Activity of β-Caryophyllene Epoxide and Episulfide  ap. 302-306.  aCaryophyllene-6,7-epoxide and caryophyllene-6,7-episulfide can be easily synthesized from β-caryophyllene by autoxidation or episulfidation.

The antifeedant, feeding, and termiticidal activities of each compound were tested using no-choice, dual-choice, and non-contact methods. Antitermitic activities were not shown by β-caryophyllene, but were observed for the oxide and sulfide derivatives. Caryophyllene- 6,7-episulfide showed especially high antifeedant and termiticidal activities.

Blood was drawn in the first (T1) and third trimester (T3). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) (N = 1985) was analysed by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. Season-corrected 25(OH)D was calculated by fitting cosine functions to the data. Mean (standard deviation) 25(OH)D was 64.5(24.5) nmol/L at T1 and 74.6(34.4) at T3. Mean age was 31.3(4.9) years, mean body mass index (BMI) was 24.5(4.2) kg/m2 and 74% of the women were born in Sweden. Vitamin D deficiency was common among women born in Africa (51%) and Asia (46%) and prevalent in 10% of the whole cohort. Determinants of vitamin D deficiency at T1 were of non-North European origin, and had less sun exposure, lower vitamin D intake and lower age. Season-corrected 25(OH)D increased by 11(23) nmol/L from T1 to T3. The determinants of season-corrected change in 25(OH)D were origin, sun-seeking behaviour, clothing style, dietary vitamin D intake, vitamin D supplementation and recent travel <35° N. In conclusion, season-corrected 25(OH)D concentration increased during pregnancy and depended partly on lifestyle factors. The overall prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was low but common among women born in Africa and Asia. Among them, the determinants of both vitamin D deficiency and change in season-corrected vitamin D status were fewer, indicating a smaller effect of sun exposure.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3aclothing 3alifestyle 3aliquid chromatography 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3apregnancy 3astandard deviation 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atravel 3avitamin D 3avitamin D deficiency 3avitamin status 3awomen 3aAfrica 3aAsia 3aSweden1 aSchoenmakers, Inez1 aGlantz, Anna1 aHulthén, Lena1 aJagner, Åse1 aEllis, Joy1 aBärebring, Mattias1 aBullarbo, Maria1 aAugustin, Hanna0 tNutrients.g2016 Oct. 22, v. 8, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu81006553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010600168300001600274520179900290592002802089650002502117650002002142650002402162650001402186650002102200650001502221650001202236650001002248651001602258700002002274700002802294700002102322773013102343856008202474852000902556655001202565IND60591962620221117040549.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059196262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-017-1572-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonneau, Mathieu10aOptimal schedule for monitoring a plant incursion when detection and treatment success vary over time  ap. 741-756.  aManagement of an invasive plant species can be viewed as two separate and successive processes. The first, survey, aims to find infested areas and remove individuals. The second, monitoring, consists of repeated visits to these areas in order to prevent possible re-emergence. As detection probability may vary over time, the timing and number of monitoring visits can dramatically impact monitoring efficacy. We explore the optimal timing and number of monitoring visits, by focusing on one infested site. Our decision-analysis framework defines an optimal monitoring schedule which accounts for a time-dependent probability of detection, based on the presence/absence of a flower. We use this framework to investigate the optimal monitoring schedule for Hieracium aurantiacum, an invasive species in the Australian Alps and many other countries. We also perform a sensitivity analysis to draw more general conclusions. For H. aurantiacum eight monitoring visits (compared to 12 visits in the current program) are sufficient to obtain a 99% monitoring efficacy. When four or fewer visits to a site are allowed, it is optimal to visit during the high season, when the weed is likely to initiate flowering. Any extra visits should be scheduled in the early season, before the plants flower. The sensitivity analysis shows that increasing the detection probability early in the season has a greater impact than increasing it late in the season. An effective treatment method increases the value of site visits late in the season, when the detection probability is higher. Our decision-analysis framework can assist invasive species managers to reduce or reallocate management resources by determining the minimum number of monitoring visits required to satisfy an acceptable risk of re-emergence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPilosella aurantiaca 3aacceptable risk 3aecological invasion 3aflowering 3ainvasive species 3amonitoring 3asurveys 3aweeds 3aAlps region1 aHauser, CindyE.1 aWilliams, NicholasS.

Cooperation between forest owners has been seen as one possibility for increasing the provision of various forest-related benefits and goods. Yet the extent of cooperation between forest owners is still not at a sufficient level, but the reasons have not been extensively studied. The authors’ aim was to find out the key determinants for forest owners to join a forest owner association and to explore how cooperation between owners could be increased. Survey data were used to divide the respondents into two groups according to whether they were members of forest owners associations or not. It was found that one key aspect is the size of the forest property—association members usually manage larger forest areas than non-members. In addition, the members tend to be more active and consistent in forest management activities than non-members. Also there is potential towards cooperation within non-members as their plans for the future are much more targeted. Although there are limits to voluntary cooperation, a huge potential for Estonian private forest owners could be realised by diversifying forest owner association activities and services to meet the different expectations of forest owners.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforest management 3aforests 3aprivate forestry 3aprivate ownership 3asurveys 3aEstonia1 aKorjus, Henn1 aKaimre, Paavo1 aVahter, Tarmo0 tSmall-scale forestry.g2014 Mar., v. 13, no. 1 p.19-33dSpringer-Verlagx1873-76177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11842-013-9237-3  aDNAL 7aarticle03691naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245010300208300001600311520209700327592002802424650000802452650001302460650002702473650002402500650001402524650002502538650001202563650001302575650001902588650000902607650002002616650001402636650000702650650001102657650001602668650002002684650001202704650001502716653002402731653001802755653001902773653000802792653002002800653001902820700002102839700002702860700006402887773010402951856008503055852000903140655001203149IND60531705620221118204326.0170607e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053170562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.07.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Bruno1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3493-734710aOil refinery hazardous effluents minimization by membrane filtration: An on-site pilot plant study  ap. 762-769.  aExperiments for treating two different types of hazardous oil refinery effluents were performed in order to avoid/minimize their adverse impacts on the environment. First, refinery wastewater was subjected to ultrafiltration using a ceramic membrane, treatment, which did not provide an adequate reduction of the polar oil and grease content below the maximal contaminant level allowed. Therefore the option of reducing the polar oil and grease contamination at its main emission source point in the refinery – the spent caustic originating from the refinery kerosene caustic washing unit – using an alkaline-resistant nanofiltration polymeric membrane treatment was tested. It was found that at a constant operating pressure and temperature, 99.9% of the oil and grease and 97.7% of the COD content were rejected at this emission point. Moreover, no noticeable membrane fouling or permeate flux decrease were registered until a spent caustic volume concentration factor of 3.These results allow for a reuse of the purified permeate in the refinery operations, instead of a fresh caustic solution, which besides the improved safety and environmentally related benefits, can result in significant savings of 1.5 M€ per year at the current prices for the biggest Portuguese oil refinery. The capital investment needed for nanofiltration treatment of the spent caustic is estimated to be less than 10% of that associated with the conventional wet air oxidation treatment of the spent caustic that is greater than 9 M€. The payback period was estimated to be 1.1 years. The operating costs for the two treatment options are similar, but the reuse of the nanofiltration spent caustic concentrate for refinery pH control applications can further reduce the operating expenditures.Overall, the pilot plant results obtained and the process economics evaluation data indicate a safer, environmentally friendly and highly competitive solution offered by the proposed nanofiltration treatment, thus representing a promising alternative to the use of conventional spent caustic treatment units.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aceramics 3achemical oxygen demand 3aeconomic investment 3aeffluents 3aenvironmental impact 3afouling 3akerosene 3ananofiltration 3aoils 3aoperating costs 3aoxidation 3apH 3aprices 3atemperature 3aultrafiltration 3awashing 3awastewater 0aRefinery wastewater 0aSpent caustic 0aOil and grease 0aCOD 0aUltrafiltration 0aNanofiltration1 aCrespo, João G.1 aSantos, Maria António1 aVelizarov, Svetlozar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9446-08970 tJournal of environmental management.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 181 p.762-769dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.07.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245015600206300001600362520112300378592002801501650002901529650001201558650001301570650000901583650002401592650001501616650001401631650001001645650002301655650002601678651001101704700001801715700002201733700002001755700001901775700001701794773013101811856008201942852000902024655001202033IND60591962820221117040451.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059196282DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-017-1570-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGirdner, ScottF.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5471-021410aReplacement of a unique population of newts (Taricha granulosa mazamae) by introduced signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) in Crater Lake, Oregon  ap. 721-740.  aThe signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) was introduced to Crater Lake in 1915 and now threatens the local extinction of an endemic salamander, the Mazama newt (Taricha granulosa mazamae). More than a century after their introduction, crayfish have expanded in distribution to occupy nearly 80% of the lakeshore. Although newts remain in uninvaded areas, they are almost entirely absent in crayfish occupied areas. Abundance of benthic macroinvertebrates was dramatically reduced in locations with crayfish compared with areas of the lake where crayfish were absent. Isotopic signatures of newt and crayfish tissue confirm overlap in the diets of the two species and demonstrate their similar position in the Crater Lake food web. Mesocosm experiments conducted with newts and crayfish revealed that crayfish prey directly on newts, displace newts from cover, and generally alter newt behavior. Combined, this evidence suggests that further crayfish expansion likely will cause additional declines in newt abundance and distribution, and could lead to extinction of the unique population of newts in Crater Lake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPacifastacus leniusculus 3aTaricha 3acrayfish 3adiet 3aecological invasion 3aextinction 3afood webs 3alakes 3amacroinvertebrates 3asalamanders and newts 3aOregon1 aRay, AndrewM.1 aBuktenica, MarkW.1 aHering, DavidK.1 aMack, JeremyA.1 aUmek, JohnW.0 tBiological invasions.g2018 Mar., v. 20, no. 3 p.721-740dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl66237x1387-35477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-017-1570-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011600171520148600287592002801773650002501801650004801826650001501874650001001889650001001899650001601909650003601925650002601961650001601987650000902003650004102012650001702053700002202070700002002092700002702112773012702139856008502266852000902351655001202360IND60732137920221120040314.0210326e20210309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073213792DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms90305642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŞahin, Mehmet,14aThe Janus Kinase Inhibitor Ruxolitinib Prevents Terminal Shock in a Mouse Model of Arenavirus Hemorrhagic Fever  aArenaviruses such as Lassa virus cause arenavirus hemorrhagic fever (AVHF), but protective vaccines and effective antiviral therapy remain unmet medical needs. Our prior work has revealed that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) induction by IFN-γ represents a key pathway to microvascular leak and terminal shock in AVHF. Here we hypothesized that Ruxolitinib, an FDA-approved JAK inhibitor known to prevent IFN-γ signaling, could be repurposed for host-directed therapy in AVHF. We tested the efficacy of Ruxolitinib in MHC-humanized (HHD) mice, which develop Lassa fever-like disease upon infection with the monkey-pathogenic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus strain WE. Anti-TNF antibody therapy was tested as an alternative strategy owing to its expected effect on macrophage activation. Ruxolitinib but not anti-TNF antibody prevented hypothermia and terminal disease as well as pleural effusions and skin edema, which served as readouts of microvascular leak. As expected, neither treatment influenced viral loads. Intriguingly, however, and despite its potent disease-modifying activity, Ruxolitinib did not measurably interfere with iNOS expression or systemic NO metabolite levels. These findings suggest that the FDA-approved JAK-inhibitor Ruxolitinib has potential in the treatment of AVHF. Moreover, our observations indicate that besides IFN-γ-induced iNOS additional druggable pathways contribute essentially to AVHF and are amenable to host-directed therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLassa mammarenavirus 3aLymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus 3aantibodies 3aedema 3afever 3ahypothermia 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3amacrophage activation 3ametabolites 3amice 3anon-specific protein-tyrosine kinase 3atherapeutics1 aRemy, Melissa  M.1 aMerkler, Doron 1 aPinschewer, Daniel  D.0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 Mar. 09, v. 9, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms90305643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100006100188245007300249300001100322506007600333520164300409592002802052506003702080650002002117650001802137650002302155650001502178650001302193650001202206650001902218650004002237650002702277650001302304650001502317650002102332700002102353700001802374700001702392700001502409700002302424700003202447773011702479856008202596852000902678655001202687IND60548663420221207101840.0200912e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054866342DNAL7 a269852372pmid7 aPMC47935402pmcid7 a10.1186/s13068-016-0475-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenvenuti, Giulia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2206-578010aMicroalgal TAG production strategies: why batch beats repeated-batch  ap. 64.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: For a commercially feasible microalgal triglyceride (TAG) production, high TAG productivities are required. The operational strategy affects TAG productivity but a systematic comparison between different strategies is lacking. For this, physiological responses of Nannochloropsis sp. to nitrogen (N) starvation and N-rich medium replenishment were studied in lab-scale batch and repeated-batch (part of the culture is periodically harvested and N-rich medium is re-supplied) cultivations under continuous light, and condensed into a mechanistic model. RESULTS: The model, which successfully described both strategies, was used to identify potential improvements for both batch and repeated-batch and compare the two strategies on optimized TAG yields on light (amount of TAGs produced per mol of supplied PAR photons). TAG yields on light, for batch, from 0.12 (base case at high light) to 0.49 g mol ₚₕ⁻¹ (at low light and with improved strain) and, for repeated-batch, from 0.07 (base case at high light) to 0.39 g mol ₚₕ⁻¹ (at low light with improved strain and optimized repeated-batch settings). The base case yields are in line with the yields observed in current state-of-the-art outdoor TAG production. CONCLUSIONS: For continuous light, an optimized batch process will always result in higher TAG yield on light compared to an optimized repeated-batch process. This is mainly because repeated-batch cycles start with N-starved cells. Their reduced photosynthetic capacity leads to inefficient light use during the regrowth phase which results in lower overall TAG yields compared to a batch process.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNannochloropsis 3abatch systems 3amechanistic models 3amicroalgae 3anitrogen 3aphotons 3aphotosynthesis 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aphysiological response 3aregrowth 3astarvation 3atriacylglycerols1 aLamers, Packo P.1 aBreuer, Guido1 aBosma, Rouke1 aCerar, Ana1 aWijffels, René H.1 aBarbosa, M.

However, the mechanism of the biological functions of T6P is not fully understood. Quantification of T6P in plants will be beneficial to elucidate the mechanism. However, it is still a challenge to chromatographically separate and sensitively detect T6P and related sugar phosphates. In the current study, we developed a method for effective separation and sensitive detection of glucose-1-phosphate (G1P), glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), sucrose-6-phosphate (S6P) and T6P in plant tissues by chemical derivatization combined with hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (ChD-HILIC-MS/MS). With this method, two pairs of isomers (G1P/G6P and S6P/T6P) could be well separated on a HILIC column and sensitively detected by MS with limits of detection (LODs) ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 ng mL−1. The developed method was successfully applied to the detection of endogenous G1P, G6P, S6P and T6P in small amounts of plant tissues, such as 1 mg fresh weight of Oryza sativa shoot.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3aglucose 1-phosphate 3aglucose 6-phosphate 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3aisomers 3ametabolites 3aplant tissues 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aSugar phosphate 0aChemical derivatization 0aHydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography 0aMass spectrometry 0aOryza sativa 0aArabidopsis thaliana1 aCai, Bao-Dong1 aJiang, Han-Peng1 aXiao, Hua-Ming1 aYuan, Bi-Feng1 aFeng, Yu-Qi0 tJournal of chromatography.g2019 May 10, v. 1592 p.82-90dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2019.01.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03680naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002000167245007600187300001600263520148400279592002801763650002601791650001901817650001601836650002101852650001301873650001401886650001401900650001501914650001301929650001401942650001201956650003301968650002002001650001502021650001702036650001202053650007702065650002702142650003702169650005602206650002102262650004202283650000902325650002502334650003502359650004302394650001202437650003202449653002102481653001602502653001902518653001202537653003302549700002102582700002102603700002202624700002402646700002902670700002202699700002602721773013102747856008302878852000902961655001202970IND60114078420221118022201.0190318e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011407842DNAL7 a229022862pmid7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2012.07.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGava, Fábio N.10aDoxorubicin induced dilated cardiomyopathy in a rabbit model: An update  ap. 115-121.  aDilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by chamber dilation and cardiac dysfunction. Because of the poor prognosis, models are needed for the investigation of and development of new therapeutic approaches, as well as stem cell therapy. Doxorubicin (DOX), used as chemotherapeutic agent, is reported to be cumulative cardiotoxic causing DCM. The aim of the study was to investigate the onset of systolic dysfunction using echocardiography in rabbits receiving two different doses of DOX (1mg/kg twice a week and 2mg/kg once a week). Twenty rabbits were treated with doxorubicin in two different doses for 6weeks and compared with a control group treated with NaCl 0.9%. The effect of doxorubicin on the myocardium was investigated with histological analysis and scanning electron microscopy of left ventricle (LV), as well as in the interventricular septum (IVS) and right ventricle (RV). The results showed a high mortality rate for rabbits receiving 2mg/kg once a week. A significant reduction in systolic function was present in animals treated with DOX after 6weeks, with decreased ejection fraction and shortening fraction. Histology and electron microscopy revealed vacuolization, intracytoplasmic granulation, necrosis and interstitial fibrosis in LV, as well as in the IVS and RV. Doxorubicin induced changes are present in the LV, RV and IVS, and the administration at the dose of 1mg/kg twice a week for only 6weeks is safe and sufficient to induce DCM in rabbits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal disease models 3acardiomyopathy 3adoxorubicin 3aechocardiography 3afibrosis 3ahistology 3amortality 3amyocardium 3anecrosis 3aprognosis 3arabbits 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium chloride 3astem cells 3atherapeutics 2aAnimals 2aCardiomyopathy, Dilatedxchemically inducedxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDoxorubicinxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aEchocardiography 2aHeartxdrug effectsxphysiopathology. 2aMale 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aMyocardiumxpathologyxultrastructure. 2aRabbits 2aStroke Volumexdrug effects 0aEchocardiography 0aDoxorubicin 0aHistopathology 0aRabbits 0aScanning electron microscopy1 aZacché, Evandro1 aOrtiz, Edna M.G.1 aChampion, Tatiana1 aBandarra, Marcio B.1 aVasconcelos, Rosemeri O.1 aBarbosa, José C.1 aCamacho, Aparecido A.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2013 Feb., v. 94, no. 1 p.115-121dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.wJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2012.07.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03442naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003300135040001800168100001200186245008600198300001200284506007600296520139800372592002801770506003701798650001101835650001101846650002001857650001501877650001201892650001201904650001601916650002401932650001001956650001001966650002501976650001802001650002102019650002002040650002802060650001102088650002602099650001102125650005102136650001602187650002602203650003702229650002902266650001502295650001702310650002402327651001002351651002502361700002602386700001702412700001702429700001302446700001702459700002602476700001702502700001802519700001502537773009202552856007902644852000902723655001202732IND50062503920221207125110.0140728e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006250392DNAL7 a233116672pmid7 aPMC35487322pmcid7 a10.1186/1475-2891-12-102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Yu10aAnemia in relation to body mass index and waist circumference among chinese women  ap. 576.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the relationship of anemia and body mass index among adult women in Jiangsu Province, China. Data were collected in a sub-national cross-sectional survey, and 1,537 women aged 20 years and above were included in the analyses. Subjects were classified by body mass index (BMI) categories as underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese according to the Chinese standard. Central obesity was defined as a waist circumference ≥ 80 cm. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin concentration < 12 g/dl. Prevalence ratios (PRs) of the relationship between anemia and BMI or waist circumference were calculated using Poisson regression. FINDINGS: Overall, 31.1% of the Chinese women were anemic. The prevalence of overweight, obesity and central obesity was 34.2%, 5.8% and 36.2%, respectively. The obese group had the highest concentrations of hemoglobin compared with other BMI groups. After adjustment for confounders, overweight and obese women had a lower PR for anemia (PR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.62-0.89; PR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.43-0.79). Central obesity was inversely associated with anemia. CONCLUSION: In this Chinese population, women with overweight/obesity or central obesity were less likely to be anemic as compared to normal weight women. No measures are required currently to target anemia specifically for overweight and obese people in China.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aanemia 3abody mass index 3ahemoglobin 3aobesity 3asurveys 3aunderweight 3awaist circumference 3awomen 2aAdult 2aAnemiaxepidemiology 2aAsian People. 2aBody Composition 2aBody Mass Index 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aFemale 2aHemoglobinsxanalysis 2aHumans 2aIron, Dietaryxadministration & dosagexblood. 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxepidemiology 2aObesity, Abdominalxepidemiology 2aOverweightxepidemiology 2aPrevalence 2aRisk Factors 2aWaist Circumference 3aChina 0aChinaxepidemiology.1 aMelse-Boonstra, Alida1 aPan, Xiaoqun1 aYuan, Baojun1 aDai, Yue1 aZhao, Jinkou1 aZimmermann, Michael B1 aKok, Frans J1 aZhou, Minghao1 aShi, Zumin0 tNutrition journal.g2013 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.576-576dSpringer-Verlagx1475-28917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1475-2891-12-103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03136naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002500169245013900194300001800333520118600351592002801537650001501565650001501580650001201595650001301607650001101620650001201631650002001643650001701663650001901680650001101699650000701710650001701717650001601734650001101750650002301761650001801784650001601802650001501818650001501833650001101848650005101859650003501910650001701945650001501962650001201977650003501989650006902024650003202093650002202125653002002147653001302167653002802180653002402208700001502232700001902247700001802266773013002284856005102414852000902465655001202474IND50076407320221118060559.0140410e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007640732DNAL7 a220297022pmid7 a10.1080/10934529.2011.6094602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, A.

Macroporous polystyrene divinyl benzene based resins are known for their excellent surface characteristics for the effective adsorption of metals. In this paper, we propose an effective adsorption procedure for chromium (VI) using aliphatic primary amine as a guest in Amberlite XAD-4 polymeric sorbent as the host. The adsorption of chromium was quantitative at pH 2.5. The adsorption process was in accordance with pseudo second order kinetics and the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 75.93 mg g⁻¹ with good adherence to Langmuir isotherm model. The free energy change ΔG⁰ increased with temperature and the negative ΔH⁰ and ΔS⁰ values indicate the exothermic nature of adsorption and decreased randomness at the adsorbent-solution interface. In aqueous medium, the water molecules surround the hydrophobic host polymeric matrix and this cage effect is responsible for the reduction in entropy of the system. The regeneration of the adsorbent was effective in alkaline medium and the efficacy of the adsorbent was tested for the removal of chromium from tannery waste water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abenzene 3achromium 3aenergy 3aentropy 3aheat production 3aheavy metals 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3apH 3apolystyrenes 3aremediation 3aresins 3asorption isotherms 3atannery waste 3atemperature 3awastewater 2aAdsorption 2aAmines 2aChromiumxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aIon Exchange Resinsxchemistry 2aPolystyrenes 2aPolyvinyls 2aTanning 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aWater Purificationxmethods 2aX-Ray Diffraction 0aAmberlite XAD-4 0achromium 0aaliphatic primary amine 0atannery waste water1 aRajesh, N.1 aKalidhasan, S.1 aRajesh, Vidya0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2011 Nov. 1, v. 46, no. 13 p.1598-1610dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2011.609460  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245013900170520177500309592002802084650001002112650001202122650001302134650002102147650002102168650001102189650001602200650001902216650001602235650001302251650002302264650001102287650002402298650001902322653002402341653003102365653002502396700005602421700002302477700002102500700006202521773010702583856008702690852000902777655001202786IND60767249720221120043339.0220314e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076724972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2022.1189882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNojiri, Ryota10aVariations in gaseous nitric acid concentrations at Tottori, Japan: Long-range transport from the Asian continent and local production  aTo evaluate factors affecting variation in gaseous nitric acid (HNO₃) concentrations, including long-range transport from the Asian continent, we conducted continuous observations of HNO₃ and related species from April 2016 to October 2017 in a coastal region near Tottori, Japan. HNO₃ concentrations and concentration ratios of HNO₃ to total odd nitrogen species (HNO₃/NOy) during sea-breeze periods exhibited similar seasonal variations, with maximum concentrations during spring–summer and minimum concentrations during autumn–winter. The sea-breeze period concentrations were higher than those during land-breeze periods in spring–summer. Similar diurnal variations for HNO₃ concentrations and HNO₃/NOy with maximum values occurring during the daytime and minimum values during the nighttime were observed regardless of the season. These seasonal and diurnal variations were attributed to the reaction of NO₂ with OH radicals and/or the thermal decomposition of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) aerosols. In terms of long-range transport from the Asian continent, a thermal equilibrium of HNO₃ and gaseous ammonia (NH₃) with NH₄NO₃ can affect variation of the HNO₃ concentration. A chemical thermodynamics evaluation was conducted of the equilibrium of HNO₃ and gaseous ammonia with NH₄NO₃. The concentration of extra ammonium ions was determined by taking into consideration that required for full neutralization of non-sea-salt sulfate in formation of ammonium sulfate, and seasonal variation in the results was evaluated. The results suggested that a thermal equilibrium of HNO₃ and NH₃ with NH₄NO₃ transported from the Asian continent could contribute to concentration variations of HNO₃ in seasons other than summer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aammonia 3aammonium 3aammonium nitrate 3aammonium sulfate 3acoasts 3aenvironment 3aneutralization 3anitric acid 3anitrogen 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3athermal degradation 3athermodynamics 0aGaseous nitric acid 0aTotal odd nitrogen species 0aLong-range transport1 aOsada, Kazuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3100-58351 aKurosaki, Yasunori1 aMatsuoka, Masaya1 aSadanaga, Yasuhiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4993-86520 tAtmospheric environment.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 274 p.118988-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2022.1189883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02564naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245010100177300001600278520102000294592002801314650001701342650002001359650002301379650001301402650001801415650001501433650001901448650001901467650001701486650001201503650002101515653000801536653000801544653000801552653000801560653000801568653000801576653002401584653003201608653001501640653001901655653001201674653002201686653005101708700002401759700002601783700001701809773010001826856008701926852000902013655001202022IND60552326220221118085853.0190402e20170115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055232622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGregersen, Sandra B.10aImpact of triacylglycerol composition on shear-induced textural changes in highly saturated fats  ap. 438-446.  aThis study demonstrates a strong interaction between triacylglycerol (TAG) composition and effects of shear rate on the microstructure and texture of fats. Cocoa butter alternatives with similar saturated fat content, but different major TAGs (PPO-, PSO-, SSO-, POP- and SOS-rich blends) were evaluated. Results show how shear can create a harder texture in fat blends based on symmetric monounsaturated TAGs (up to ∼200%), primarily due to reduction in crystal size, whereas shear has little effect on hardness of asymmetric monounsaturated TAGs. Such differences could not be ascribed to differences in the degree of supercooling, but was found to be a consequence of differences in the crystallisation behaviour of different TAGs. The fractal dimension was evaluated by dimensional detrended fluctuation analysis and Fourier transformation of microscopy images. However, the concept of fractal patterns was found to be insufficient to describe microstructural changes of fat blends with high solid fat content.  aPublisher supplied data 3acocoa butter 3acrystallization 3afractal dimensions 3ahardness 3alipid content 3amicroscopy 3amicrostructure 3asaturated fats 3asupercooling 3atexture 3atriacylglycerols 0aPPO 0aPSO 0aSSO 0aPOP 0aSOS 0aTAG 0aFat crystallisation 0aTriacylglycerol composition 0aShear rate 0aMicrostructure 0aTexture 0aFractal dimension 0aTwo-dimensional detrended fluctuation analysis1 aAndersen, Morten D.1 aHammershøj, Marianne1 aWiking, Lars0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 215 p.438-446dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03057naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001400167245011800181300001600299520143300315592002801748650001501776650001201791650000901803650001401812650000901826650001501835650002001850650001201870650003601882650004501918650001101963650002601974650003402000650001402034650004102048650004902089653001102138653003502149653001402184653002402198653001402222700001802236700001402254700001602268700002002284773013102304856008302435852000902518655001202527IND60114078720221118022131.0190318e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011407872DNAL7 a229259352pmid7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2012.07.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraun, U.10aB-mode and colour Doppler ultrasonography of the milk vein and musculophrenic vein in eight cows during lactation  ap. 138-143.  aEight cows underwent Doppler sonographic examinations of the milk vein and musculophrenic vein from 9days prepartum to 300days postpartum. A 7.5-MHz linear transducer was used to determine the inner diameter of the veins and blood flow velocities and volumes on the left side in standing, non-sedated animals. Cows were weighed and milk yield measured at all examination times. The milk vein appeared as a vessel with an inner diameter of 2.01–2.30cm immediately beneath the skin. The maximum blood flow velocity ranged from 23.84 to 35.76cm/s before parturition, increased markedly on the day of calving (day 0), peaked at 61.14cm/s on day 1 and slowly decreased to 23.84cm/s by day 300. The profiles of the minimum and mean maximum flow velocities and flow volume were similar. The musculophrenic vein had an inner diameter of 0.76–1.07cm and its distance from the surface of the skin was 1.15–1.31cm. The profiles of the blood flow variables were irregular and did not resemble those of the milk vein. The maximum blood flow velocity ranged from 87.35 to 114.41cm/s, the minimum velocity from 5.47 to 7.60cm/s, the mean maximum velocity from 48.55 to 78.74cm/s and the blood flow volume from 1.02 to 2.44l/min. The milk vein had a larger diameter (2.16 versus 0.90cm; P<0.01), smaller maximum, minimum and mean maximum blood flow velocities (P<0.01) and a larger blood flow volume than the musculophrenic vein (P<0.01).  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood flow 3acalving 3acows 3alactation 3amilk 3amilk yield 3aultrasonography 2aAnimals 2aBlood Flow Velocityxveterinary 2aCattlexanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aLactationxphysiology 2aPostpartum Periodxphysiology 2aPregnancy 2aUltrasonography, Dopplerxveterinary 2aVeinsxanatomy & histologyxultrasonography. 0aCattle 0aColour Doppler ultrasonography 0aMilk vein 0aMusculophrenic vein 0aLactation1 aFörster, E.,1 aBleul, U.1 aHässig, M.1 aSchwarzwald, C.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2013 Feb., v. 94, no. 1 p.138-143dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.wJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2012.07.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03189naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001600169245015100185300001800336520139600354592002801750650001401778650001801792650001201810650001201822650001301834650001101847650002201858650001101880650001401891650000901905650000901914650001201923650001201935650001101947650001101958650001301969650001201982650001001994650000902004650000902013650002902022650006802051650001402119650002302133650002202156650002802178650000902206651002102215651001102236653001802247653001102265653001402276653002702290653001102317700002102328773013002349856005102479852000902530655001202539IND50076407520221118060547.0140410e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007640752DNAL7 a219926982pmid7 a10.1080/10978526.2011.6090752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGür, Filiz10aBiomonitoring of metals in the vicinity of Soma coal-fired power plant in western Anatolia, Turkey using the epiphytic lichen, Xanthoria parietina  ap. 1503-1511.  aIn this study, epiphytic lichen Xanthoria parietina was applied as the biomonitor of air pollution to determine the environmental influence in the vicinity of Soma coal-fired power plant. Thalli of lichen Xanthoria parietina growing on olive, oak and poplar trees were collected with their substrate in 2004–2006. They were taken from 44 different stations located in 3×3 km grids within an area of 30 km in diameter around the Soma power plant near the town of Soma. Lichen samples were analyzed by using the ICP-MS for As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Ni, Pb, Se, Th, U, V and Zn elements and their concentrations were mapped. The sample analyses results were evaluated by using the statistical software (SPSS 11). Average element contents of samples were, in descending order, Fe > Zn > V > Pb > Cr > Cu > Ni > As > Co > U > Th > Se > Cd > Hg. Results obtained in the current study were generally found to be higher than the data reported in literature although some lower values exist for Cd, Co, Hg, Ni, Pb elements. The most polluted areas were found to be those in the vicinity of the coal-fired power plant, particularly along the direction of predominant wind and in the corridor which runs from west to southeast direction due to topographic conditions. We believe that this research which is conducted around a coal-fired power plant will shed light on future research on pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXanthoria 3aair pollution 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acomputer software 3acopper 3aepiphytes 3airon 3alead 3alichens 3amercury 3anickel 3aolives 3aselenium 3athallus 3atrees 3awind 3azinc 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethodsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aGeography 2aLichensxchemistry 2aMass Spectrometry 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysis 2aWind 3aTurkey (country) 0aTurkey 0aBiomonitoring 0alichen 0apollution 0acoal-fired power plant 0aTurkey1 ayaprak, Günseli0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2011 Nov. 1, v. 46, no. 13 p.1503-1511dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10978526.2011.609075  aDNAL 7aarticle01995naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013100170300001200301500002200313520092900335592002801264650002401292650002301316650001001339651001601349651002501365700001601390700002001406700002101426773013101447856008201578852000901660655001201669IND60591963320221117040319.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059196332DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-018-1687-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdebayo, AbisolaA.10aCorrection to: Domestic ships as a potential pathway of nonindigenous species from the Saint Lawrence River to the Great Lakes  ap. 815.  aPublished Erratum  aThe article Domestic ships as a potential pathway of nonindigenous species from the Saint Lawrence River to the Great Lakes, written by Abisola A.

Scedosporiosis in dogs has often been associated with localized infection (i.e., nasal infection, eumycetoma, or keratomycosis) or, in rare cases, disseminated infections. CASE PRESENTATION: This case report describes the clinical and pathological features and the diagnostic process of a rare systemic and fatal fungal infection in a dog caused by Scedosporium apiospermum. A 10-month-old female Maremmano-Abruzzese sheepdog showing weakness, lethargy, lateral decubitus, miosis and muscular rigidity was presented. Rodenticide poisoning was clinically suspected for the differential diagnosis. However, postmortem examinations revealed the presence of a swollen and soft subcutaneous nodule located near the right inguinal breast, which was associated with massive enlargement of the inguinal lymph nodes and small disseminated, cream-colored nodules in the kidneys and mesentery. Multiple fungal pyogranulomas were observed upon histological examination. Fungal isolation from the kidneys, breast and inguinal lymph nodes was performed. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences from the fungal colony DNA were searched in BLAST in the NCBI GenBank for species identification. The sequences of the fungi isolated from the kidney and breast cultures showed 100% sequence identity with sequences from Scedosporium apiospermum. CONCLUSIONS: This report shows that Scedosporium apiospermum may act as a primary pathogen in young and apparently healthy dogs and represents an important pathogen that should be considered during the diagnostic process, particularly when a fungal infection is suspected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aScedosporium 3abreasts 3acase studies 3acolor 3adogs 3aexhibitions 3afemales 3afungi 3ahistology 3ainfection 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3akidneys 3alymph nodes 3amesentery 3anecropsy 3anose 3apathogens 3apoisoning 3aprevalence 3arodenticides 3asequence analysis 3aspecies identification 3aveterinary medicine1 aAveraimo, Daniela1 aPrimavera, Miria1 aSantoleri, Doriana1 aGiovannini, Giorgia1 aCocco, Antonio1 aDi Francesco, Gabriella1 aMalatesta, Daniela1 aDefourny, Sabrina1 aD’Alterio, Nicola1 aCurini, Valentina1 aDi Domenico, Marco1 aPetrini, Antonio0 tBMC veterinary research.g2020 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.372-372dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-020-02597-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03592naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245012700174300001600301520204500317592002802362650002202390650001702412650001702429650001202446650002002458650001502478650001502493650002202508650002002530650001502550650002002565650001902585650002202604650001602626650001702642650002702659651001102686653002602697653002702723653002902750653001602779653001702795653001602812700005502828773010702883856008702990852000903077655001203086IND60531706320221118203957.0190405e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053170632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jrurstud.2016.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWästfelt, Anders10aReclaiming localisation for revitalising agriculture: A case study of peri-urban agricultural change in Gothenburg, Sweden  ap. 172-185.  aAgriculture near urban landscapes has recently been re-appreciated with the recognition of its economic, social and environmental contributions. However, rapid urbanisation and global agricultural restructuring constituting complex processes across multiple scales tend to threaten the survival of peri-urban agriculture. Focusing on family farms near Gothenburg in Sweden, this paper intends to explore the relations between location and agriculture and how family farms have been able to continue farming in peri-urban areas. Unlike previous studies of peri-urban agriculture, mostly carried out by planners from an urban-centric perspective, this paper deploys a rural and place-based perspective by drawing on theories of agricultural location. Based on statistical and spatial analyses of land use change, and interviews with farmers and authorities, the processes and drivers of local agricultural change are analysed. The results identify four simultaneous processes that produce the diversity in forms of agriculture between farms: structural changes, loss of farmland to urban expansion, specialisation of on-farm activities and a niching trend of on-farm activities. The new findings which shed light on the theory of agricultural localisation are: 1) niche production greatly takes advantage of the peri-urban location; 2) a reverse von Thünen's transportation pattern is enabled by the proximity to urban consumers; 3) enhancing competitive advantage through saving labour costs is enabled by the direct relation to consumers at the peri-urban location; 4) multifunctional agriculture has potential but also raises conflicts between different types of land use in peri-urban areas; 5) a secured access to land for farmers enabled by the local governance which separates the increasing land value from land rent is fundamental for supporting continued peri-urban agriculture. Our recommendation is that policy makers need to shift to a location-sensitive governing praxis of agriculture in order to re-vitalise peri-urban areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3acase studies 3afamily farms 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3agovernance 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3alocation theory 3atransportation 3aurban agriculture 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3awages and remuneration 3aSweden 0aAgricultural location 0aPeri-urban agriculture 0aAgricultural transitions 0avon Thünen 0aFamily farms 0aLand tenure1 aZhang, Qian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8446-01830 tJournal of rural studies.g2016 Oct., v. 47 p.172-185dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl38039x0743-01677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2016.07.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03905naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001300188245006500201300001100266506007600277520205800353592002802411596007602439596007402515596007002589506003702659650001802696650001202714650002102726650001402747650002802761650002502789650002402814650002302838650001702861650001502878650001102893650001902904650000702923650002302930650001702953650001302970650001602983650001302999700001703012700001203029700001803041700001203059700001703071700001903088773011703107856008203224852000903306655001203315IND60548664020221207130411.0200912e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054866402DNAL7 a270066892pmid7 aPMC48028122pmcid7 a10.1186/s13068-016-0485-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Lei10aInhibition of lignin-derived phenolic compounds to cellulase  ap. 70.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Lignin-derived phenolic compounds are universal in the hydrolysate of pretreated lignocellulosic biomass. The phenolics reduce the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis and increase the cost of ethanol production. We investigated inhibition of phenolics on cellulase during enzymatic hydrolysis using vanillin as one of the typical lignin-derived phenolics and Avicel as cellulose substrate. RESULTS: As vanillin concentration increased from 0 to 10 mg/mL, cellulose conversion after 72-h enzymatic hydrolysis decreased from 53 to 26 %. Enzyme deactivation and precipitation were detected with the vanillin addition. The enzyme concentration and activity consecutively decreased during hydrolysis, but the inhibition degree, expressed as the ratio of the cellulose conversion without vanillin to the conversion with vanillin (A ₀ /A), was almost independent on hydrolysis time. Inhibition can be mitigated by increasing cellulose loading or cellulase concentration. The inhibition degree showed linear relationship with the vanillin concentration and exponential relationship with the cellulose loading and the cellulase concentration. The addition of calcium chloride, BSA, and Tween 80 did not release the inhibition of vanillin significantly. pH and temperature for hydrolysis also showed no significant impact on inhibition degree. The presence of hydroxyl group, carbonyl group, and methoxy group in phenolics affected the inhibition degree. CONCLUSION: Besides phenolics concentration, other factors such as cellulose loading, enzyme concentration, and phenolic structure also affect the inhibition of cellulose conversion. Lignin-blocking agents have little effect on the inhibition effect of soluble phenolics, indicating that the inhibition mechanism of phenolics to enzyme is likely different from insoluble lignin. The inhibition of soluble phenolics can hardly be entirely removed by increasing enzyme concentration or adding blocking proteins due to the dispersity and multiple binding sites of phenolics than insoluble lignin.  aPublisher supplied data  a"973"Program: 2013CB733601cMinistry of Science and Technology of China  aMajor program: 21390203cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a11ZCGHHZ00500cTianjin Municipal Science and Technology Committee0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abinding sites 3abiomass 3acalcium chloride 3acellulose 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzyme inactivation 3aethanol production 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3apH 3aphenolic compounds 3apolysorbates 3aproteins 3atemperature 3avanillin1 aLi, Wenzhao,1 aLiu, Li1 aZhu, Jia-Qing1 aLi, Xia1 aLi, Bing-Zhi1 aYuan, Ying-Jin0 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2016 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.70-70dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350543x1754-68347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13068-016-0485-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245015700170300001400327520117600341592002801517650003301545650003301578650002001611650001401631650002901645650002101674650002301695650001001718650001201728650002501740650003001765650001501795650001801810650001701828650001401845650002001859650002201879650001801901653002101919653001401940653001901954653002901973653001002002700001802012700003002030700005702060700002402117773008602141856008702227852000902314655001202323IND60633142020221119182443.0190516e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063314202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anaerobe.2019.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaglan, Neeru10aIsolation, characterization and conjugated linoleic acid production potential of bifidobacterial isolates from ruminal fluid samples of Murrah buffaloes  ap. 40-45.  aIn the present study, we investigated the potential of Bifidobacterium spp., isolated from ruminal fluid samples from buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) for conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) production. A total of 294 isolates were obtained from 86 ruminal fluid samples using Bifidus Selective Medium (BSM) medium, and based on phospoketolase assay, 24 isolates were presumptively confirmed to be Bifidobacterium species. Further, the isolates were confirmed morphologically, biochemically and by PCR assays for genus specific (16s rDNA) and transaldolase genes. All 24 strains were positive for conversion of linoleic acid (LA) to CLA by spectrophotometric screening. Gas chromatographic analysis showed that the strains produced cis9, trans11 and tran10, cis12 CLA isomers in LA-supplemented deMan-Rogosa-Sharpe (MRS) broth. The strains were identified as B. thermophilum (n = 21) and B. pseudolongum (n = 3) based on 16 rDNA sequence analysis. The study shows that Bifidobacterium spp., present in the rumens of buffaloes produce CLA from LA and the strains may have the potential to be used as probiotics to enhance the nutraceutical value of ruminant food products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium pseudolongum 3aBifidobacterium thermophilum 3aBubalus bubalis 3abuffaloes 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3afunctional foods 3agas chromatography 3agenes 3aisomers 3anucleotide sequences 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprobiotics 3aribosomal DNA 3arumen fluids 3ascreening 3aselective media 3asequence analysis 3atransaldolase 0aBiohydrogenation 0aBuffaloes 0aBifidobacteria 0aConjugated linoleic acid 0aRumen1 aKumar, Sachin1 aChoudhury, Prasanta Kumar1 aTyagi, Bhawna1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9564-36121 aTyagi, Amrish Kumar0 tAnaerobe.g2019 Apr., v. 56 p.40-45dElsevier LtdwJournal:12008x1075-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anaerobe.2019.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001800161245013200179300001400311500000900325520134200334592002801676650002201704650001401726650002001740650001401760650001301774650001501787650000901802700001601811773014601827856009601973852000902069655001202078IND60669662720221120160519.0191125e198101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066966272DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1981.03615995004500010003x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaverkamp, R.12aA Comparative Study of Three Forms of the Richard Equation Used for Predicting One-Dimensional Infiltration in Unsaturated Soil  ap. 13-20.  aepub  aThe performance of three finite difference models, each based on a different way of expressing the Richard transient water transfer equation are compared with regard to their precision, time consumption, and economical feasibility. The models are tested on both a quasi-analytical solution and experimental results for two different types of soil and for two upper boundary conditions (Dirichlet and Neumann). Two test criteria are chosen to cope with the individual experimental requirements. For both the maximum error criterion and the overall error criterion the model based on the Kirchhoff integral transformation leads to more accurate results than that founded on the local balance form of the Richard equation. The latter model is slightly influenced by the generation of weighting errors; on the other hand, the former model is more time consuming. The use of the model based on the decomposed form of the Richard equation is not recommended because this nonconservative model is strongly affected by weighting errors, and its range of operation is limited insofar as the choice of mesh ratio is concerned. From the results obtained, nomograms of considerable decision-making potential in helping to select the model most appropriate to a particular set of constraints in terms of accuracy and computer time can be constructed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomparative study 3acomputers 3adecision making 3aequations 3anomogram 3aprediction 3asoil1 aVauclin, M.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1981 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.13-20dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1981.03615995004500010003x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245013500166300001600301520153900317536035301856592002802209650002102237650001402258650002402272650002702296650002002323650001002343650001002353650001002363650001502373653002402388653001802412653001902430653000902449653002002458653002002478653002002498653001502518700001402533700001502547700001502562700001502577773010602592856008002698852000902778655001202787IND60615025020221123044810.0181003e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061502502DNAL7 a10.1177/03009858166887432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEtterlin, P.

Prevalence of OC is high in domestic pigs but is presumed to be low in wild boars. Postmortem and computed tomography (CT) examinations of the talus and distal tibia from 40 domestic pigs and 39 wild boars were evaluated for the locations and frequencies of OC, synovial fossae, and other articular indentations, and frequency distribution maps were made. All domestic pigs but only 5 wild boars (13%) had OC on the talus. In domestic pigs, OC consistently affected the axial aspect of the medial trochlea tali in 11 (28%) joints and the distomedial talus in 26 (65%) joints. In wild boars, all OC lesions consistently affected the distomedial talus. On the articular surface of the distal tibia, all domestic pigs and 34 wild boars (87%) had synovial fossae and 7 domestic pigs (18%) had superficial cartilage fibrillation opposite an OC lesion (kissing lesion). Other articular indentations occurred in the intertrochlear groove of the talus in all domestic pigs and 13 wild boars (33%) and were less common on the trochlea tali. The prevalence of tarsal OC in wild boars is low. In domestic pigs and wild boars, OC is typically localized to the distomedial talus and in domestic pigs also to the medial trochlea tali. Further investigations into the reasons for the low OC prevalence in wild boars may help in developing strategies to reduce OC incidence in domestic pigs.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This investigation was supported by grants from The Swedish Research Council FORMAS (Dnr. 221-2013-317).

However, the farmers in Bangladesh have limited access to the scientific cultivation of this crop, and yield and quality production of flower is low compared to other gladiolus growing countries in the world. Growth regulating chemicals have been reported to be very effective in manipulating growth and flowering of gladiolus. Therefore, an experiment was conducted at the Landscaping section of the Department of Horticulture, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh, during the period from October 2017 to April 2018 to study the effect of corm size and growth regulators on growth, flowering and quality of gladiolus (Gladiolus grandiflorus L.). The experiment consisted of two corm sizes viz., 3-4 and 4-5 cm, and two growth regulators viz., GA3 @ 250, 500 and 750 ppm, and NAA @ 100, 200 and 300 ppm along with water as control. The two-factor experiment was laid out in a randomised complete block design with three replications. The results revealed that the corm size and growth regulators at different concentrations significantly affected various growth, floral and quality traits of gladiolus. The highest plant height, maximum number of leaves per plant, longest leaf length, maximum number of florets per spike, longest spike and rachis length were observed in 4-5 cm sized corms and GA3 @ 750 ppm, compared to rest of the treatments. Earliness in flower initiation and maximum duration of flower was observed in 4-5 cm sized corms and GA3 @ 500 ppm. Significant variations among the treatment combinations were observed for all the parameters studied. The treatment combination of 4-5 cm sized corms and GA3 @ 750 ppm was found to be best in respect of growth, floral and quality characters of gladiolus.

Motility was recorded continuously during 24 h in 6 birds per line. Two stimuli, a meal distribution after a feed-deprivation period and lighting after a dark period, were tested during the recording period. A functional test with intravenous injection of serotonin performed at the end of the recording day often resulted in a sharp reduction in gizzard motility, without a significant difference between lines. Compared with D+ birds, gizzard activity in D– birds remained high during fasting or dark periods (P < 0.0006), which reduced the effects of stimuli in D– birds. So, coordination between bird activity and gizzard motility tended to be reduced in D– compared with D+ birds (P = 0.0018). This coordination was observed to be positively correlated (P = 0.011) with the relative weight (g/kg of BW) of the stomach (gizzard + proventriculus). This experiment pointed out differences in gizzard motility between D+ and D– chicken lines in terms of response to environmental stimuli, characterized by a failure in the gizzard relaxation process in D– birds during rest periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3achickens 3acorrelation 3adigestion 3agastrointestinal motility 3agizzard 3aintravenous injection 3aline differences 3aproventriculus 3aresting periods 3ascotophase 3aserotonin 3astomach 2aAnimals 2aChickensxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aDigestionxphysiology 2aGastrointestinal Motilityxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGizzard, Avianxphysiology.1 aMalbert, C.-H.1 aRideau, N.1 aCognié, J.1 aCarré, B.0 tPoultry science.g2012 Feb., v. 91, no. 2 p.460-467dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2011-014943Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle01503naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245012400156300001800280520034200298592002800640650001400668650002700682650002300709650001300732650001500745650001200760650001800772650001800790650001600808700001800824700001400842700001600856700001900872700001600891773012900907856007201036852000901108655001201117IND60658513820221118031924.0190817e20091028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065851382DNAL7 a10.1039/b915014e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yining10aFacile synthesis of Nafion-stabilized iridium nanoparticles and their direct use for fuel cells and water electrolyzers  ap. 6589-6591.  aUsing a quite small but suitable amount of Nafion as stabilizer, iridium colloids with well controlled particle size were synthesized and directly used for fuel cells or water electrolyzers without further removal or addition of Nafion, meanwhile, a strategy for fabrication of supported catalyst with high utilization was also proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3acolloids 3afuel cells 3airidium 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3astabilizers1 aZhang, Huamin1 aZhang, Yu1 aMa, Yuanwei1 aZhong, Hexiang1 aMa, Haipeng0 tChemical communications.g2009 Oct. 28, , no. 43 p.6589-6591dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b915014e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245008400173506010400257506007600361520143200437592002801869506003701897650001801934650001601952650001201968650002001980650002302000650001502023650001602038650002102054650001602075653002602091653001902117653001502136653001502151653002602166653002902192700002102221700002002242773009702262856008702359852000902446655001202455IND60776743820221207082238.0220620e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077674382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.1159282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnotters, Martin10aMapping water table depths in wetlands and polder areas by probability sampling  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInformation on water table depth (WTD) in polder areas and wetlands is important in, for example, estimating emissions of greenhouse gases, assessing the agricultural and ecological potential, and flood risk management. The seasonal variation of WTDs is summarized with averages of the yearly highest (shallowest) and lowest (deepest) water tables (MHW and MLW). These characteristics show short-distance variations within the fields in polder areas, which cannot be mapped using geostatistical interpolation techniques or physical modelling against reasonable costs or with acceptable accuracy. The within-field variations depend on soil type and water management. MHW and MLW were determined from auger hole measurements of WTDs at locations being selected following stratified simple random sampling in subareas classified by soil type and water management. Within these subareas, a further classification was made on the basis of distance to ditches. For each subarea spatial distribution functions of MHW and MLW were made, taking censored observations into account. Uncertainty was quantified by 10,000 bootstrap realisations of the spatial distribution functions. From these realisations maps depicting summary statistics for the spatial distribution of WTD-characteristics within the subareas were derived, as well as a map with probabilities of exceedance of a critical level that can serve as input for risk analysis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ageostatistics 3agreenhouses 3apolders 3arisk management 3aseasonal variation 3asoil types 3auncertainty 3awater management 3awater table 0aDesign-based approach 0aChoropleth map 0aRaster map 0aResolution 0aCensored observations 0aNonparametric regression1 aWalvoort, Dennis1 aGerritsen, Paul0 tGeoderma.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 422 p.115928-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.1159283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01634naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245005600174500002200230520057500252592002800827650001300855650002100868650002300889653005000912653002500962653003100987653003001018700006201048773011801110856008301228852000901311655001201320IND60655296620221120070756.0190801e20190724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065529662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csda.2019.1068202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJokiel-Rokita, Alicja10aEstimation of the ROC curve from the Lehmann family  aPre-press version  aA semiparametric model of the ROC curve based on the Lehmann family of distributions is an alternative to the popular binormal model.

Furthermore, structural equation modelling identified a strong interdependence between the natural and the enriched attributes, suggesting they are complementary rather than substitutes/alternatives in consumers' food choices. Indeed, preferences for natural and for enriched attributes are influenced by different motivations nonetheless share a common driver: the general interest for healthy food.  aPublisher supplied data 3achewing gum 3aconsumer preferences 3aenriched foods 3afood choices 3ahealthy diet 3alaboratory experimentation 3amastication 3amotivation 3astructural equation modeling 3awillingness to pay 0aNatural 0aEnriched 0aConsumer preferences 0aWillingness to pay 0aBDM mechanism 0aStructural equation modelling1 aVecchio, Riccardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2790-597X1 aLerro, Marco1 aMigliore, Giuseppina1 aSchifani, Giorgio1 aCembalo, Luigi0 tFood research international.g2019 Aug., v. 122 p.87-95dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2019.03.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01633naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245009400165300001600259520048400275592002800759650001400787650001200801650004400813650001000857653001900867653002600886653003100912653001800943700001900961700001500980700001600995700001801011700001601029773012001045856008501165852000901250655001201259IND60516944820221119042634.0160327e20160402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051694482DNAL7 a10.1080/10286020.2015.10802462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Dan10aTwo new 13,14:14,15-disecopregnane-type compounds from the roots of Cynanchum paniculatum  ap. 339-343.  aTwo new 13,14:14,15-disecopregnane-type compounds glaucogenin F (1), glaucogenin F 3- O -β- D -oleandropyranoside (2), together with three known compounds cynapanoside A (3), cynatratoside A (4), and neocynapanogenin F 3- O -β- D -oleandropyranoside (5) were isolated from the 95% ethanol extract of the roots of Cynanchum paniculatum.

As this species is susceptible to intensive frost, it is believed that climate change with mild winters is the responsible driver. Other factors can, however, be equally important including forest management, eutrophication, and browsing. We compared old (sampled 1955–1967) and recent (sampled 2000–2012) relevés as well as managed/unmanaged, fenced/unfenced, and fertilized (N, P and a combination of both)/unfertilized plots sampled in two beech forest communities of the Göttinger Wald (Lower Saxony, Germany), and addressed these potential drivers and their effect on H. helix. The H. helix abundance significantly increased in the last 50 years, accompanied by a general temperature increase and a reduction in severe frost events suggesting an influence of climate change. Inter-annual changes in H. helix cover correlated with climate variables reveal an interplay between low minimum temperatures and snow cover. The spread of H. helix, however, also goes along with higher nitrogen availability and a reduction in browsing pressure. A fertilization experiment underlines a positive impact of N and P on the H. helix abundance, whereas fencing and management reduced it by promoting a competing shrub layer. Thus, climate change could not be identified as the main driver of a H. helix spread in the Göttinger Wald. It is rather caused by a complex interaction of changing abiotic (climate change and eutrophication) and biotic (browsing, competition) conditions, that is not fully understood yet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica subsp. sylvatica 3aHedera helix 3abrowsing 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aeutrophication 3aforest communities 3aforest management 3aforests 3afrost 3alimestone 3amonitoring 3anitrogen 3ashrubs 3asnowpack 3atemperature 3aCentral European region 3aGermany1 aSchmidt, Wolfgang0 tPlant ecology.g2015 Jan., v. 216, no. 1 p.1-15dSpringer-Verlagx1385-02377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-014-0412-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01251naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245005200168300001800220520035300238592002800591650003100619650001500650650001800665650002500683650001400708650001300722700002400735773009800759856008300857852000900940655001200949IND60625802720221120045006.0190705e20181213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062580272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2018.11.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaanen, John B.10aNKG2A, a New Kid on the Immune Checkpoint Block  ap. 1720-1722.  aOne of the major breakthroughs of cancer immunotherapy has come from blocking immune checkpoint molecules on tumor-reactive T cells.

After these incidents, public concern regarding the use of chemicals in products (i.e., chemical phobia) increased. Frequent health risk assessments and stringent management of consumer products are, therefore, of paramount importance to reduce these serious occurrences. In this study, the irritative and respiratory health effects of deodorants were assessed in relation to dermal and inhalation exposure. In total, 64 deodorants were divided into 5 groups by application type, and health risk assessments were conducted on each group. In total, 26 fragrance ingredients and 27 biocidal ingredients were analyzed and assessed according to their risk to human health. Exposure assessment was performed in two steps. In the tiered 1 assessment (screening), the 95th exposure factor values were used to estimate exposure to assume the worst-case scenario. The maximum concentration in the deodorants was used without considering the application type. In the tiered 2 assessment (detail assessment), the 75th exposure factor values were used to estimate the assumed reasonable exposure to ingredients. In these assessments, the maximum concentration used in the exposure models was determined by the product purpose and application type. The values input into the exposure algorithms were developed via the exposure route. Of the selected fragrance and biocidal active ingredients, 18 fragrance and 13 biocidal ingredients were detected in the deodorants that were assessed. From the results of the tiered 1 assessment, it was necessary for tiered 2 risk assessments to be conducted for 6 ingredients for the inhalation route, and 13 ingredients for the dermal route. The inhalation margin of exposure of ingredients in deodorants of gel/trigger/spray types for home/car and fabric/air usage was above the target margin of exposure. The health risk of 6 evaluated ingredients was relatively low for the inhalation route of exposure.This study showed that the assessed ingredients have no health risks at their maximum concentrations in deodorants. The approach discussed in this study should be used to establish improved guidelines for specific ingredients in consumer products, and for setting limits for newly developed raw materials that may pose dermal and inhalation hazard.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aair 3aalgorithms 3abiocides 3abreathing 3adeodorants 3adermal exposure 3aexposure models 3aguidelines 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahuman health 3ahumidifiers 3ainhalation exposure 3alungs 3aodors 3araw materials 3arisk 3ascreening 3aKorean Peninsula 0aTiered 1 and 2 exposure assessment 0aHealth risk assessment 0aConsumer products 0aBiocidal active ingredients 0aFragrance ingredients1 aKim, Taksoo1 aYoon, Hyojung1 aJo, Areum1 aLee, Daeyeop1 aKim, Pilje1 aSeo, Jungkwan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6309-84340 tScience of the total environment.g2018 June 01, v. 625 p.1369-1379dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.2823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05178naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245007900159300001600238520387300254592002804127650001504155650001404170650003804184650001104222650001104233650002404244650001204268650001204280650001304292650003004305650001504335650001804350650001104368650001404379650001104393650001104404650001704415650001104432650001504443650001104458651001604469700002104485773011004506856007104616852000904687655001204696IND60518331920221121005546.0160412e198802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051833192DNAL7 a10.2307/19424642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Craig R.10aDiversity, Patterns of Adaptation, and Stability of Nova Scotian Kelp Beds  ap. 129-154.  aThere are two alternate community states in the rocky subtidal of the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, an unproductive sea urchin/coralline alga community, and highly productive kelp beds dominated by Laminaria longicruris. Disease—induced mortality of the sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) triggered a switch from the first state to the second and provided a unique opportunity to study (1) the ability of L. longicruris to recover its former dominant status, and (2) its stability when competing with other seaweeds and when perturbed by storms and grazers other than urchins. Rates of recolonization of L. longicruris depended on the proximity of a refugial source of spores. When reproductive plants were nearby, a closed canopy developed within 18 mo of urchin mortality. When a reproductive population was several kilometres away, there was sparse recolonization for 3 yr, then a massive recruitment occurred with closure of the canopy in the 4th yr. Laminaria is clearly the competitive dominant in the seaweed community. Manipulative experiments showed that the kelp limits the abundance of several understory species, but there was no evidence that the abundant annual seaweeds limited kelp recruitment. When sea urchins were rare, the density and growth rates of Laminaria were influenced mostly by intraspecific competition. When the canopy of adult plants was removed there was a dramatic increase in kelp recruitment, but the recruits that grew in dense patches in the clearings were significantly smaller than those of a similar age that grew more sparsely beneath the canopy. Once the kelp recovered from destructive grazing and formed a mature forest, it was able to maintain its dominance, even in habitats subject to severe nutrient stress for 8 mo of the year. For most of the year mortality and erosion of laminae outweighed the effects of recruitment and growth, and the canopy declined, especially during winter when storms were frequent. Erosion was exacerbated by grazing of the gastropod Lacuna vincta. However, in late winter and early spring, recruitment and rapid growth restored the canopy. When severe storm damage was simulated by completely removing Laminaria in patches, the kelp rapidly recolonized and soon outgrew other seaweeds. Unlike the competitive dominants in kelp bed systems in the northeast Pacific, L. longicruris in Nova Scotia manifests multiple patterns of adaptation that enable it to dominate early and late stages of succession in a range of habitats of different levels of nutrient stress and of disturbance from storms and grazers. The principal threat to the stability of the kelp beds is destructive grazing by sea urchins. We suggest that the considerable differences between the dynamics of kelp beds in Nova Scotia and those of the northeast Pacific, and the high degree of stability of L. longicruris stands in Nova Scotia, is attributable to the low diversity of kelps and therefore low levels of competition in Nova Scotia, and to the multiple adaptations of L. longicruris that enable it to tolerate several stresses and disturbances. We argue that the dynamics of community organization, and therefore the stability properties of this system are determined primarily by biological interactions and not by physical variables. This differs from the kelp communities in the northeast Pacific, in which both biological and physical factors influence dynamics significantly at a primary level. We offer a qualitative model of the dynamics of community structure in Nova Scotia that may be viewed as a set of deterministic "subroutines," in which each subroutine describes the outcome of a particular biological interaction. The subroutine(s) that predominate at one point in time and space are probably determined mostly by physical hydrographic variables that have a large stochastic component.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGastropoda 3aLaminaria 3aStrongylocentrotus droebachiensis 3acanopy 3acoasts 3acommunity structure 3aforests 3agrazing 3ahabitats 3aintraspecific competition 3amacroalgae 3amature plants 3amodels 3amortality 3aspores 3aspring 3astorm damage 3astorms 3aunderstory 3awinter 3aNova Scotia1 aMann, Kenneth H.0 tEcological monographs.g1988 Feb., v. 58, no. 2 p.129-154dEcological Society of Americax0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19424643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03833naa a2200925 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245011400178520154000292592002801832650002101860650002701881650002601908650002801934650002901962650000901991650001302000650001302013650001902026650001302045650001802058650001502076650001202091650001702103650001902120650001002139650002602149650000902175653000702184653000702191653000902198653000802207653000602215653000702221653000902228653000902237653000602246653000602252653000702258653000802265653000802273653000802281653000702289653000802296653000702304653000702311653000802318653000702326653000702333653000802340653000702348653000702355653000802362653000702370653000802377653000702385653000802392653000702400653001402407653001302421653000702434653001402441653001302455653000802468653003302476653001702509653001702526653000802543700002802551700002902579700005802608773013002666856009002796852000902886655001202895IND60655296820221120050738.0190807e20191002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065529682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2019.1082722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKashiri, Mahboobeh10aAntimicrobial packaging based on a LAE containing zein coating to control foodborne pathogens in chicken soup  aIn this study, zein coatings containing Lauroyl-l-arginine ethyl ester monohydrochloride (LAE) were developed to be applied on polypropylene films and manufacture an active food packaging. The concentration of LAE and the addition of a suitable plasticizer (glycerol or oleic acid (OA)) were the main variables considered. Active plasticized zein films, with glycerol or oleic acid were characterized in terms of release kinetics, mechanical, barrier, optical, and antimicrobial properties. Results showed that active agent concentration, (5 and 10%), had no-significant effect on mechanical and WVP properties of the plasticized films. Films plasticized with OA presented greater water resistance, UV-light opacity, and water barrier properties than glycerol-plasticized films. On the contrary, the latter had better antimicrobial properties. The analysis of LAE release kinetics from films to different food simulants revealed different behaviours, depending on both film formulation and food simulant. Despite the lower water resistance of coatings containing glycerol, bags based on polypropylene/glycerol plasticized zein containing 10% of LAE presented a great antimicrobial activity in tests with chicken soup (real food system) contaminated with pathogen bacteria, concretely, the films showed 3.21 Log reduction against Listeria monocytogenes and 3.07 log reductions against Escherichia coli. These results suggest a promising strategy on the use of LAE-containing zein in active food packaging to control foodborne pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aactive food packaging 3aantimicrobial packaging 3aantimicrobial properties 3abags 3achickens 3acoatings 3afood pathogens 3aglycerol 3amanufacturing 3aoleic acid 3aopacity 3aplasticizers 3apolypropylenes 3asoups 3aultraviolet radiation 3azein 0aa* 0ab* 0aCECT 0aCFU 0aD 0aEB 0aEVOH 0aHPLC 0aK 0aL 0aL* 0aLAE 0aLRV 0aLSD 0aOA 0aPLA 0aPP 0aRH 0aSEM 0aTS 0aUV 0av/v 0aVP 0aVS 0aw/w 0aWS 0aWVP 0aYM 0aZEO 0aZG 0aZG-10%LAE 0aZG-5%LAE 0aZO 0aZO-10%LAE 0aZO-5%LAE 0aΔE 0aAntimicrobial food packaging 0aZein coating 0aChicken soup 0aLAE1 aLópez-Carballo, Gracia1 aHernández-Muñoz, Pilar1 aGavara, Rafael1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6376-89390 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2019 Oct. 02, v. 306 p.108272-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2019.1082723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01957naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245014200165300001600307506002800323520091300351592002801264506003701292653002501329653002601354653001401380700001801394773016701412856007901579852000901658655001201667IND60773925620221207064352.0161229e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077392562DNAL7 a10.19113/sdufbed.962412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUZUNKAYA, Kutlan10aDinar Karakuyu Sulaması Sahası Tarımsal İşletmelerinin Doğrusal Programlama Yöntemi Kullanılarak Ürün Desenlerinin Planlanması  ap. 388-396.  aResource is Open Access  aBu araştırmanın ana amacı, Afyonkarahisar ilinde Dinar Karakuyu Sulama Rehabilitasyon projesi kapsamına giren köylerdeki bitkisel ürün yetiştiriciliği yapan işletmelerin optimum ürün planını ortaya koymaktır.

Increased spectral resolution is achieved through a novel jelly roll cell design, which allowed these studies to be performed for the first time under MAS conditions (MAS rate 10 kHz). The state of charge, metallic lithium plating and solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) formation was captured for the first charge/discharge cycle of a full electrochemical cell (LiCoO₂/graphite). This strategy can be used to monitor both anode and cathode electrodes concurrently, which is valuable for tracking the lithium distribution in a full cell in real time and may also enable identification of causes of capacity loss that are not readily available from bulk electrochemical analyses, or other post-mortem strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aspectral analysis 3astable isotopes1 aPauric, Allen D.1 aKrachkovskiy, Sergey A.1 aGoward, Gillian R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7489-33290 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Aug. 20, v. 141, no. 35 p.13758-13761dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b068853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011900168300001600287520129100303592002801594650001601622650002701638650001701665650001001682650003101692650002101723650002801744650001901772650001301791650001401804650000701818650002701825650001301852650001401865653003101879653001401910653001401924653001301938653002801951653002401979700005602003700006802059700001202127773011102139856008602250852000902336655001202345IND60635946920221119165631.0200221e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063594692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2019.03.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPei, Yaqiong10aComparison of structural and physicochemical properties of lysozyme/carboxymethylcellulose complexes and microgels  ap. 273-282.  aProteins and polysaccharides can be used to assemble colloidal delivery systems suitable for industrial applications, such as functional foods, supplements, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products. The purpose of this work was to compare the physicochemical and structural properties of colloidal delivery systems prepared from lysozyme and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) at different biopolymer ratios, pH values, and salt levels. Specifically, the performance of unheated (“complexes”) and heated (“microgels”) lysozyme-CMC systems were compared. Isothermal turbidity-pH titrations indicated that the critical pH value for complex formation was lower for microgels than for complexes. Complexes were prone to dissociation when the pH or ionic strength was altered due to weakening of electrostatic interactions between the CMC and lysozyme. Conversely, microgels remained intact when the pH or ionic strength was altered, exhibiting swelling or shrinkage rather than dissociation. These results have important implications for the selection of the most appropriate protein/polysaccharide systems to achieve specific functional requirements. Complexes may be more suitable for pH- or salt-based triggered release whereas microgels may be more suitable for sustained release.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3adissociation 3adrugs 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afunctional foods 3aindustrial applications 3aionic strength 3alysozyme 3amicrogels 3apH 3apersonal care products 3aproteins 3ashrinkage 0aElectrostatic interactions 0aComplexes 0aMicrogels 0aLysozyme 0aCarboxymethyl cellulose 0aStructural analysis1 aLi, Zhenshun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9847-50521 aMcClements, David Julian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9016-12911 aLi, Bin0 tFood research international.g2019 Aug., v. 122 p.273-282dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2019.03.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010500164300001600269520106700285592002801352650001501380650002201395650001401417650002301431650001301454650001901467650001801486650001101504650001801515650001101533653001601544653002401560653002901584653002301613653002301636700001401659700002001673700001701693700001701710700001501727700001401742700001601756773010201772856008301874852000901957655001201966IND60776744120221119214148.0220523e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077674412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2022.04.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Zhiquan12aA highly dispersed Ni3P/HZSM-5 catalyst for hydrodeoxygenation of phenolic compounds to cycloalkanes  ap. 294-306.  aA highly dispersed Ni₃P/HZSM-5 catalyst was prepared by deposition-precipitation of Ni species followed by electroless plating and thermal treatment, and characterized by means of XRD, ICP, N₂ physical adsorption, TEM, XPS, NH₃-TPD, and CO chemisorption. Electroless plating reaction takes place in an aqueous solution under mild conditions, facilitating the high dispersion of the formed Ni₃P particles. XRD measurements illustrated the lamellar nickel phyllosilicate was produced at the first step of deposition-precipitation, amorphous Ni-P was formed in the subsequent electroless plating, and highly dispersed Ni₃P crystallites were generated in thermal treatment.

Bifunctional Ni₃P/HZSM-5 was investigated in hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of phenolic compounds, including phenol, m-cresol, and guaiacol.

Among the 157 E. coli isolated from chicken meat produced by integrated broiler operations, 75 (47.8%) were observed to be ciprofloxacin resistant-E. coli. However, the prevalence varied from 25.0 to 75.0%, in chicken meat, indicating variation in ciprofloxacin resistant E. coli occurrence among the operations. Among the 75 ciprofloxacin resistant-E. coli isolates, 10 showed plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes, aac(6′)-Ib-cr, qnrS1 and qnrB4. Among the 10 PMQR-positive E. coli, a double amino-acid exchange in both gyrA and parC with ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentrations of ≥16 μg/mL was noted in 8 isolates, and 4 transconjugants (40.0%) expressed similar antimicrobial resistance patterns and revealed the presence of PMQR genes and β-lactamase genes. Our findings suggest that E. coli with resistance to ciprofloxacin can now be found in association with integrated broiler operations, thus highlighting the need for monitoring and prevention programs in integrated operations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aamino acids 3aantibiotic resistance 3abeta-lactamase 3abroiler chickens 3achicken meat 3aciprofloxacin 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amonitoring 3aplasmids 3aKorean Peninsula 0aIntegrated operation system 0aFluoroquinolones 0aPMQR1 aLee, Young Ju1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6108-28450 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2019 July 26,  p.108274-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2019.1082743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245011400160300002000274520112700294592002801421650000901449650001801458650002301476650001601499700001401515700001701529700005801546700005601604700005401660700005701714700005501771700001801826700002001844700001801864700005201882700006101934700005801995700005402053773014902107856007602256852000902332655001202341IND60662531320221116203251.0190904e20190812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066253132DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b069402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Jingjing10aCrystalline Liquid-like Behavior: Surface-Induced Secondary Grain Growth of Photovoltaic Perovskite Thin Film  ap. 13948-13953.  aSurface effects usually become negligible on the micrometer or sub-micrometer scale due to lower surface-to-bulk ratio compared to nanomaterials. In lead halide perovskites, however, their “soft” nature renders them highly responsive to the external field, allowing for extended depth scale affected by the surface. Herein, by taking advantage of this unique feature of perovskites we demonstrate a methodology for property manipulation of perovskite thin films based on secondary grain growth, where tuning of the surface induces the internal property evolution of the entire perovskite film. While in conventional microelectronic techniques secondary grain growth generally involves harsh conditions such as high temperature and straining, it is easily triggered in a perovskite thin film by a simple surface post-treatment, producing enlarged grain sizes of up to 4 μm. The resulting photovoltaic devices exhibit significantly enhanced power conversion efficiency and operational stability over a course of 1000 h and an ambient shelf stability of over 4000 h while maintaining over 90% of its original efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3alead 3ananomaterials 3aphotovoltaic cells 3atemperature1 aWang, Rui1 aWang, Kai-Li1 aWang, Zhao-Kui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1707-499X1 aYavuz, Ilhan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3268-62681 aWang, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2540-21991 aYang, Yingguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1749-27991 aGao, Xingyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1477-00921 aHuang, Tianyi1 aNuryyeva, Selbi1 aLee, Jin-Wook1 aDuan, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2155-71881 aLiao, Liang-Sheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2352-96661 aKaner, Richard1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0345-49241 aYang, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8833-76410 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Aug. 12, v. 141, no. 35 p.13948-13953dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b069403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245009200163300001600255506002800271520131800299592002801617506003701645650001601682650000901698650001201707650000901719653001701728653006901745700002801814773016701842856007902009852000902088655001202097IND60773925920221207062852.0170907e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077392592DNAL7 a10.19113/sdufbed.371412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYILDIZ, Metin 10aMoro Refleks Ölçümleri İçin Bilgisayar Tabanlı Sistem Tasarımı ve Test Edilmesi  ap. 319-325.  aResource is Open Access  aMoro refleks değerlendirmesi; yenidoğan beyin ve sinir sistemi gelişimi ile ilgili hastalıklara erken teşhis konulmasında yaygın olarak kullanılan bir yöntemdir.

Bu çalışmada; Moro refleksin nicel olarak ölçümlenebilmesini, hem bebeğin bileklerine bağlanan 3 eksenli ivmeölçerler hem de basit bir web kamerası ile sağlamak üzere geliştirilen bilgisayar tabanlı bir ölçüm sistemi tanıtılmıştır. Sistem geliştirilirken klinik ortamda kolay ve hızlı bir şekilde uygulanabilmesi ve tekrarlanabilir sonuçlar vermesi hedeflenmiştir. Moro refleks ölçümünün geliştirilen sistem vasıtası ile 4 dakika civarında bir sürede yapılabildiği tespit edilmiştir. Geliştirilen sistem kullanılarak farklı doktorlar tarafından ölçümlenen parametrelerden, Latency (moro gecikmesi) ölçümlerinin en fazla %2,9± 0,6, Toplam Moro refleks süresi ölçümlerinin %2,5±2,4 gibi küçük farklarla ölçümlenebildiği görülmüştür. Geliştirilen sistemin klinik testlerde kullanılmaya uygun olduğu sonucuna varılmıştır.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adurum wheat 3afens 3atesting 3awebs 0aMoro refleks 0aBilgisayar tabanlı ölçme sistemi; İvme ölçer; Video kamera1 aKILIÇ, Aslıhan Burcu 0 tSüleyman Demirel üniversitesi fen bilimleri enstitüsü dergisi.g2018 Apr., v. 22, no. 1 p.319-325dSuleyman Demirel UniversitywJournal:27744x1308-65297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.19113/sdufbed.371413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03587naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005700153245014300210300001600353520193300369592002802302650003002330650001102360650002102371650001702392650001202409650002202421650000902443650002002452650001002472650002202482650002502504650002902529650002102558650001102579650002002590650001602610650001302626650001002639651001402649653002102663653002102684653001702705653001202722653001002734653002002744700001802764700001502782700002002797773011902817856008802936852000903024655001203033IND60589521720221120023848.0190206e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058952172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.2862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArrieta, E.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6158-358310aGreenhouse gas emissions and energy efficiencies for soybeans and maize cultivated in different agronomic zones: A case study of Argentina  ap. 199-208.  aOf all human activities, agriculture has one of the highest environmental impacts, particularly related to Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, energy use and land use change. Soybean and maize are two of the most commercialized agricultural commodities worldwide. Argentina contributes significantly to this trade, being the third major producer of soybeans, the first exporter of soymeal and soybean oil, and the third exporter of maize. Despite the economic importance of these crops and the products derived, there are very few studies regarding GHG emissions, energy use and efficiencies associated to Argentinean soybean and maize production. Therefore, the aim of this work is to determine the carbon and energy footprint, as well as the carbon and energy efficiencies, of soybeans and maize produced in Argentina, by analyzing 18 agronomic zones covering an agricultural area of 1.53millionkm2. Our results show that, for both crops, the GHG and energy efficiencies at the Pampean region were significantly higher than those at the extra-Pampean region. The national average for production of soybeans in Argentina results in 6.06ton/ton CO2-eq emitted to the atmosphere, while 0.887ton of soybean were produced per GJ of energy used; and for maize 5.01ton/ton CO2-eq emitted to the atmosphere and 0.740ton of maize were produced per each GJ of energy used. We found that the large differences on yields, GHGs and energy efficiencies between agronomic regions for soybean and maize crop production are mainly driven by climate, particularly mean annual precipitation. This study contributes for the first time to understand the carbon and energy footprint of soybean and maize production throughout several agronomic zones in Argentina. The significant differences found in the productive efficiencies questions on the environmental viability of expanding the agricultural frontier to less suitable lands for crop production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acarbon 3acarbon footprint 3acase studies 3aclimate 3acommercialization 3acorn 3acrop production 3acrops 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironmental impact 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ahumans 3aland use change 3asoybean oil 3asoybeans 3atrade 3aArgentina 0aCarbon footprint 0aEnergy footprint 0aEfficiencies 0aSoybean 0aMaize 0aCrop production1 aCuchietti, A.1 aCabrol, D.1 aGonzález, A.D.0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 June 01, v. 625 p.199-208dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.2863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245016100176300001400337520150600351592002801857650002001885650000901905650001001914650001401924650001401938650002201952650002301974650001601997650001402013650002202027650001102049653001102060653001302071653002802084700001702112700001902129700001702148700002102165700001902186773009702205856009002302852000902392655001202401IND60532322520221119031142.0190318e20140720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053232252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.02.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlencross, Brett10aEffective use of microbial biomass products to facilitate the complete replacement of fishery resources in diets for the black tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon  ap. 12-19.  aA series of experiments were conducted with black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) juveniles to firstly determine the effects of reducing fishmeal inclusion in a diet and then to evaluate the potential for a microbial bioactive to support complete replacement of both fishmeal and fish oil in feeds when fed under clear-water and green-water conditions. The isoproteic and isoenergetic replacement of fishmeal resulted in a consistent decline in growth performance indicating that at every decrease in fishmeal below an inclusion level of 45% there was a decline in performance. In a subsequent trial undertaken in a clear-water tank system diets devoid of both fishmeal and fish oil fed to shrimp were demonstrated to produce poorer performance than a fishmeal and fish oil reference diet. However the addition of a microbial bioactive to the diet resulted in not only a compensation for the replacement of these ingredients but also additional growth. Replication of the clear-water trial in a green-water tank system not only produced similar results, but also showed that the green-water system largely compensated for the performance lost through replacement of fishmeal and fish oil. However it was also shown that the use of the microbial bioactive in the diets still resulted in improved growth performance of shrimp. This study has effectively demonstrated a viable strategy for not only a complete replacement of all fishery products in shrimp diets, but also an improved performance strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPenaeus monodon 3adiet 3afeeds 3afish meal 3afish oils 3afishery resources 3agrowth performance 3aingredients 3ajuveniles 3amicrobial biomass 3ashrimp 0aPrawns 0aFishmeal 0aAlternative ingredients1 aIrvin, Simon1 aArnold, Stuart1 aBlyth, David1 aBourne, Nicholas1 aPreston, Nigel0 tAquaculture.g2014 July 20, v. 431 p.12-19dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.02.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02112naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245015600180506002800336520088000364592002801244506003701272650001001309650002001319651001301339653000901352653001801361653001301379653003801392700002901430700003401459700001901493773015901512856008201671852000901753655001201762IND60775159720221207095118.0190122e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077515972DNAL7 a10.21068/bc.v14iSupl..3012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBermúdez-Vera, Julio César10aAvifau na en un área perturbada del bosque andino en el Parque Nacional Natural Farallones de Cali, corregimiento de Pance, Valle del Cauca (Colombia)  aResource is Open Access  aThis dataset in Darwin Core Archive format includes monitoring information about bird life in a disturbed area of the Farallones de Cali National Natural Park. Aiming to characterize and determine the composition and structure of bird life, visual censuses were carried out from August 2008 to July 2009 at both the El Pato and the El Topacio localities along line census of 2 km and from elevations between1550 to 1800 m a.s.l. A total of 2363 records were obtained of 157 species of 41 families and 19 orders. Twelve were new records for the area, 10 of which are common in open areas. Nine species previously recorded in 1978 at El Topacio were absent and considered locally extinct and vulnerable. This illustrates how the replacement of natural habitats with pasturelands, as well as fragmentation and border effect affect negatively bird communities in protected areas.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abirds 3adata collection 3aColombia 0aAves 0aBiodiversidad 0aHábitat 0aDistribución espacial y temporal1 aLópez, Sebastián Duque1 aMartínez, Manuel A.

The BFP in Juma is a validated REDD+ project emphasizing payments for ecosystem services. The analyses are based on interviews with about 25% of the households in Juma, local leaders and representatives of the organiser of the BFP — the Fundação Amazonas Sustentável (FAS). The strategy of FAS is to avoid deforestation by providing support to local communities to improve their livelihoods. The paper analyses the influence of the BFP and the rules of the reserve on people's livelihoods, the local perception of the programme and the interactions between FAS and the local communities. It appears that the BFP is more of a development programme than a standard payment for ecosystem services initiative. As such it seems to have good potential, while we note that the main environmental effects are expected to materialize mainly in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeforestation 3aecosystem services 3aforests 3ahouseholds 3ainterviews 3alivelihood 3apeople 3asustainable development 3aBrazil 0aBolsa Floresta programme 0adeforestation 0apayments for ecosystem services 0aREDD+ 0alivelihoods1 aGaribjana, A.1 aRojas, E.1 aVatn, A.0 tinternational forestry review.g2014, v. 16, no. 1 p.87-102dCommonwealth Forestry Associationx1465-54897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1505%2F1465548148110312603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01117naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245007500153300001800228520019800246592002800444650002700472650002300499650001200522650001100534700001400545700002100559700002600580773012800606856007200734852000900806655001200815IND60658514620221118032036.0190817e20091006xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065851462DNAL7 a10.1039/b915090k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Zhuo10aEnergetic polyazole polynitrobenzenes and their coordination complexes  ap. 6014-6016.  aNew energetic polyazole polynitrobenzenes exhibit high heats of formation and thermal stabilities, and react as useful ligands with silver dinitramide to give an energetic coordination complex.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3aligands 3asilver1 aGuo, Yong1 aTwamley, Brendan1 aShreeve, Jean’ne M.0 tChemical communications.g2009 Oct. 6, , no. 40 p.6014-6016dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b915090k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02484naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012400168300001400292520141300306592002801719650001701747650001601764650001201780650001601792650000901808650001101817650002201828650001001850651001301860700002201873700002501895700002501920773008701945856008102032852000902113655001202122IND60119917620221117224445.0150112e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011991762DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-014-0415-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAssis, Rafael L.10aEffects of hydroperiod and substrate properties on tree alpha diversity and composition in Amazonian floodplain forests  ap. 41-54.  aIt is well established that tree assemblage diversity and composition in Amazonian floodplain forest are influenced by substrate properties and hydroperiod. However, no study to date has tried to disentangle the individual effects of these variables on floodplain tree assemblages. In this study, we investigated the influence of several edaphic variables and hydroperiod on alpha diversity and individual tree species distribution. We carried out floristic inventories in 12 ha of floodplain forests across central-western Amazonia and sampled associated data on substrate properties and hydroperiod. Generalized linear mixed models were used to evaluate the importance of each predictor on the response variables. Flooding was the only variable significantly influencing alpha diversity and also significantly influenced the distribution of the highest number of tree species. Edaphic variables had a lesser effect, and a large number of tree species were not significantly influenced by any of the predictors tested. However, iron had a strong negative influence on several species. We conclude that floristic diversity and composition are more influenced by the hydroperiod than by substrate conditions, and substrate conditions become decreasingly important for increasingly flood-tolerant species. Many floodplain species are generalists occurring across the entire substrate and hydroperiod gradient.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3afloodplains 3aforests 3ainventories 3airon 3amodels 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3aAmazonia1 aWittmann, Florian1 aPiedade, Maria T.

The degree of perceived risk varies with the clinical indication for which the antimicrobial in question is used. In this study, four uses of antimicrobials are considered, including in acutely sick, chronically sick, at-risk, and high-risk cattle, contrasting the degree of risk among these uses. Using a random sample of 103 feedlot cattle veterinarians and variables drawn from the theory of planned behavior, we predict differences in risk perception by clinical indication with differences in perceived efficacy of antimicrobials, social pressures to use antimicrobials, and moral obligations to use antimicrobials. In most models, veterinarians who perceived that others in the feedlot industry (i.e., other feedlot veterinarians, nutritionists, feedlot clients, and retained owners of cattle) were more likely to expect them to use antimicrobials in one situation versus another, the less likely those veterinarians perceived the risk of antimicrobial risk to be greater in the former versus the latter situation. Only two of these contrasts contained influences outside the immediate feedlot relationships. This exception involves the ‘downstream’ public: meat packers, retailers, and consumers. Veterinarians who believe that using antimicrobials for acutely sick cattle is more beneficial than using antimicrobials for chronically sick cattle were more likely to believe that antimicrobial resistance was a less probable outcome in acutely sick cattle than in chronically sick cattle.  aPublisher supplied data 3asampling 3aantibiotic resistance 3ahumans 3anutritionists 3afeedlots 3acattle 3aindustry 3ameat 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3amodels 3afood availability 3arisk perception 3aanti-infective agents 3aveterinarians 2aAcute Disease 2aAdult 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdrug therapyxmicrobiology. 2aChronic Disease 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterial 2aFemale 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Testsxveterinary 2aMiddle Aged 2aPerception 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aRisk Assessment 2aRisk Factors 2aVeterinariansxpsychology 0afood supply 0aantimicrobial agents1 aMcIntosh, Wm.

Both species depend on resources derived from the decomposing insects captured by the pitchers. Experimentation revealed that midge larvae consumed resources at a greater rate than mites and that the densities of the two species are negatively correlated. These results indicate that M. edwardsi is a potential dominant competitor with S. darlingtoniae. Competition theory predicts that the presence of midge larvae should lead to the competitive exclusion of mites, yet these species coexist in field populations. This seeming paradox can be explained by temporal and spatial heterogeneity in resources. Midge larval density is generally associated with expected resource levels of pitchers, whereas mites are found in greatest abundance in pitchers whose resources differ from expected. This pattern suggests that the effects of competition vary and are strongest when actual resource levels equal expected resource levels. When resource levels are above expected levels, coexistence occurs. These results support Levins' (1979) model for coexistence of two species on a single resource. The implications of this study to the general debate over the role of interspecific competition in structuring communities are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDarlingtonia californica 3acompetitive exclusion 3ainsect larvae 3amidges 3amites 3amodels 3aspatial variation0 tEcological monographs.g1988 Feb., v. 58, no. 3 p.215-227dEcological Society of Americax0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/29370263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01330naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245013600154300001800290520013300308592002800441650002700469650002300496650000900519650001200528650001300540650001300553650001900566650001400585650002200599650001600621700001700637700001400654700001800668700001800686700001300704773013300717856007300850852000900923655001200932IND60658514820221118031835.0190826e20100216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065851482DNAL7 a10.1039/b915125g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Wenbo10aZwitterionic phosphorylcholine as a better ligand for gold nanorods cell uptake and selective photothermal ablation of cancer cells  ap. 1479-1481.  aThe conjugation of zwitterionic phosphorylcholine onto gold nanorods leads to enhanced and selective uptake within cancer cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3agold 3aligands 3ananogold 3ananorods 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aphosphorylcholine 3azwitterions1 aShao, Jinyan1 aJin, Qiao1 aWei, Qingshan1 aTang, Jianguo1 aJi, Jian0 tChemical communications.g2010 Feb. 16, v. 46, no. 9 p.1479-1481dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b915125g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03967naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245009900160300001600259520264200275592002802917650001502945650001402960650001402974650001302988650001103001650001003012650001203022650001503034650002603049650001903075650001703094650001503111650001003126650001103136650001403147650001403161650001403175650002503189650002903214650001603243651001403259700002203273773011003295856007103405852000903476655001203485IND60518332720221122131624.0160412e198802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051833272DNAL7 a10.2307/19425442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaunders, James F.10aDynamics and Control Mechanisms in a Tropical Zooplankton Community (Lake Valencia, Venezuela)  ap. 337-353.  aThe dynamics of zooplankton herbivores in Lake Valencia, Venezuela, were studied over a 5—yr interval. Lake Valencia is a large, warm—monomictic, eutrophic lake. Copepods were the dominant group; rotifers were more abundant than the cladocerans, which were not present in all years. Variation between years in herbivore biomass bore no statistical relationship to patterns in algal biomass. The average annual dry mass production of the herbivores was high (7.0 mg · L— ¹ · d— ¹), but less than expected given the high primary productivity of the lake. The annual ratios of production to biomass for individual species were well below the maxima expected for steady growth, and thus imply growth suppression. Feeding capacity of Chaoborus, the principal primary carnivore, exceeded herbivore production for 66% of the sampling dates. Annual overturn broke the coupling between predator and prey by causing extensive mortality in both herbivores and carnivores; herbivores recovered from this suppression more rapidly than carnivores. Herbivores followed three basic strategies for coexistence with their predators in Lake Valencia: (1) two Brachionus species were able to match predation losses by reproductive output; (2) the copepods, which experienced intense predation pressure as adults, were able to sustain the high losses because the adult stage was subsidized by recruitment from earlier, less vulnerable developmental stages; (3) Keratella and the cladocerans were opportunistic in that they became abundant only in response to a decline in the predator population. The opportunistic species were most abundant during the mixing season, which was the period of minimum abundance for Chaoborus. Predation strongly influenced the herbivore populations, but population data indicate that inadequate food resources also played a role. Growth suppression was the result of qualitative rather than quantitative inadequacy in the algal food base. The intensity of control by the two factors was strongly affected by abiotic factors associated with mixing events. Partial mixing provided brief respite from growth suppression for certain species (typically rotifers), but did not alter predation pressure. Annual overturn resulted in improvement of food quality, but because mortality of herbivores coincided with relaxation of predation, the herbivores were delayed in exploiting qualitative improvements in the food resources. Periods of simultaneous release from growth suppression and predation were infrequent and brief. Herbivores were thus controlled simultaneously by predation and quality of food resource.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrachionus 3aChaoborus 3aCladocera 3aCopepoda 3aadults 3aalgae 3abiomass 3acarnivores 3aenvironmental factors 3aeutrophication 3afood quality 3aherbivores 3alakes 3amixing 3amortality 3apredation 3apredators 3aprimary productivity 3areproductive performance 3azooplankton 3aVenezuela1 aLewis, William M.0 tEcological monographs.g1988 Feb., v. 58, no. 4 p.337-353dEcological Society of Americax0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19425443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03214naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012100169520153300290592002801823650002101851650003801872650002801910650001301938650002201951650002201973650001201995650001902007650002002026650001502046650001602061650002402077650002202101650002002123650001802143650001602161650001502177650003202192650001002224650001502234651000902249653003302258653002102291653001902312653002502331700002502356700001702381700002202398700002002420773012602440856008502566852000902651655001202660IND60655297720221120155508.0190807e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065529772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2019.1049292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBayat, Mahmoud10aApplication of artificial neural networks for predicting tree survival and mortality in the Hyrcanian forest of Iran  aTree survival and mortality play a critical role in forest ecosystems. Being able to predict the survival probability provides significant insights into forest management decision support. In this study, we employed an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict tree survival and mortality in an Oriental beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky) forest in northern Iran, using long-term data and wide range of biotic (average tree diameter increment, and basal area in larger trees (BAL)) and abiotic variables (slope, average solar radiation during the growing season, wind velocity and direction, height above the nearest drainage point, topographic wetness index, temperature, and relative humidity). The ANN model revealed that the greatest survival rates belong to the trees with diameter >20–100 cm. An increase in competition leads to reduced survival, and the Carpinus betulus species showed a slightly lower survival rate than the other species. Further, our findings demonstrated that BAL and diameter increment have a strong correlation with the probability of tree survival in the study area. The ANN performance was evaluated using the R2 and RMSE metrics and compared to a multiple logistic regression that demonstrated the capability of the ANN model for the prediction of survival probability (R2 = 0.92; RMSE = 0.985). From these results, we recommend the employment of ANN, and perhaps other machine learning methods, for the prediction of survival probability in many different ecosystems around the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarpinus betulus 3aFagus sylvatica subsp. orientalis 3aartificial intelligence 3adrainage 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest management 3aforests 3agrowing season 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3aprobability 3aregression analysis 3arelative humidity 3asolar radiation 3asurvival rate 3atemperature 3atopography 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3awind speed 3aIran 0aBiotic and abiotic variables 0aMachine learning 0aOriental beech 0aSurvival probability1 aGhorbanpour, Mansour1 aZare, Rozita1 aJaafari, Abolfazl1 aThai Pham, Binh0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2019 Sept., v. 164 p.104929-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2019.1049293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002700153245012100180500001900301520125900320592002801579650002601607650001101633650001901644650002501663650001901688650002401707650002601731650000701757650001301764650001201777651001601789653003101805653003001836653001101866653003001877653001801907700001801925700002301943700001801966700001701984700001802001773011002019856008802129852000902217655001202226IND60698527020221120164905.0200913e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069852702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marenvres.2020.1050502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorrero-Santiago, A.R.10aResponse of bacterial communities in Barents Sea sediments in case of a potential CO2 leakage from carbon reservoirs  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCarbon capture and storage sites in Barents Sea shelf are currently in progress as part of climate change mitigation activities. However environmental impacts of a possible CO₂ seepage on bacterial community are lacking knowledge. This work addressed potential consequences on bacterial communities from Snøvit region in Barents Sea sediments. Long-term experiment (92 days) was carried out mimicking realistic conditions of pressure (∼30 bars) using the unique hyperbaric chamber (Karl Erik TiTank). The experiment was divided in three stages: i) 21 days of no CO₂, ii) 50 days of simulation of carbon dioxide leakage (depletion of pH to 7.0) and iii) 14 days emulating a leakage cessation. Results suggested that bacterial communities can adapt to a CO₂ leakage in short term. However, bacteria showed negative effects in terms of activity, community structure, and number of cells after long term CO₂ exposure. After CO₂ leakage cessation, bacterial communities did not show a significant recovery. These findings highlighted that, even though marine bacteria showed adaptation to the new conditions (acidified environment), in case of a small but continuous CO₂ leakage marine bacteria might not be recovered upon pre-exposure status.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacterial communities 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3along term experiments 3apH 3aresearch 3aseepage 3aBarents Sea 0aCarbon capture and storage 0aClimate change mitigation 0aImpact 0aMicroorganism alterations 0aHigh pressure1 aRibicic, Deni1 aBonnail, Estefania1 aNetzer, Roman1 aKoseto, Deni1 aArdelan, M.V.0 tMarine environmental research.g2020 Sept., v. 160 p.105050-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1982x0141-11367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2020.1050503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010300171300001400274520164900288592002801937650001401965650001601979650001201995650001002007650001202017650001502029650001802044650002202062650001402084650001502098650001102113700002602124700002502150700002602175773008702201856008102288852000902369655001202378IND60119917920221117224433.0150112e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011991792DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-014-0418-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, Eliane R.10aDoes the phytotoxic shrub Heterothalamus psiadioides affect a plant community through allelopathy?  ap. 87-97.  aPhytotoxicity has often been proposed as evidence of allelopathy. However, few studies have investigated allelopathy in natural field conditions. In South Brazilian grasslands, Heterothalamus psiadioides, a shrub establishing in dense stands, has shown strong phytotoxicity in laboratory assays. We conducted a field study to evaluate if this species also negatively affects a plant community through allelopathy. At a shrubland site, we established a phytotoxicity gradient, consisting of plots with H. psiadioides, plots with Baccharis patens—a shrub with minimal phytotoxicity—and plots without shrubs (no phytotoxicity). We assessed plant species cover, biomass, number of seedlings, diversity, richness, and plant community characteristics. Our study did not show evidences of plant inhibition near the phytotoxic species. We observed higher plant richness and diversity in plots with H. psiadioides than in plots with B. patens and without shrubs. The highest diversity near H. psiadioides was associated with greater forb cover, due to lower cover of dominant grasses. Differences in light incidence accounted for vegetation patterns more than allelopathic activity. Therefore, our study showed that the allelopathic potential of the evaluated species was overestimated based only on laboratory studies. We emphasize the relevance of conducting allelopathy studies in field and of having a similar species with low phytotoxicity in this kind of study. Results based only on laboratory assays and visual evidence of patterns in field may be misleading and may lead to an overestimation of the role of allelopathy in plant communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBaccharis 3aallelopathy 3abiomass 3aforbs 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3aphytotoxicity 3aplant communities 3aseedlings 3ashrublands 3ashrubs1 aFerreira, Pedro M.

Immunocytochemical analyses on coelomocytes reveal localization of the AIF-1 protein in amoebocytes (perinuclear cytoplasmic zone) and red sphaerulocytes (inside granules), but not in vibratile cells and colorless sphaerula cells. The significant increase of AIF-1 expression (mRNA and protein) found in the coelomocytes of the sea urchin after Gram + bacterial challenge suggests the involvement of AIF-1 in the inflammatory response. Our analysis on P. lividus AIF-1 contributes to elucidate AIF-1 function along the evolutionary scale and consolidate the key evolutionary position of echinoderms throughout metazoans with respect to the common immune paths.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParacentrotus lividus 3aallografting 3agenes 3agranules 3ainflammation 3amessenger RNA 3aproteins 3avertebrates 0aAllograft inflammatory factor 1 0aParacentrotus lividus 0aCoelomocytes 0aAmoebocytes 0aRed cells 0aBacterial challenge1 aVacca, Francesca1 aVizioli, Jacopo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4310-80331 aDrago, Francesco1 aVetrugno, Carla1 aVerri, Tiziano1 aPagliara, Patrizia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8936-73670 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2017 Dec., v. 71 p.136-143dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2017.09.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02343naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245007900166506002800245520098500273592002801258506003701286650001001323650001101333650001901344650001701363650001101380650001601391650001601407650001501423650001401438650001001452650001701462653001101479653001701490653002001507653002401527653002001551653002101571653001901592700002001611700002001631773013401651856007901785852000901864655001201873IND60775160620221207092555.0161219e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077516062DNAL7 a10.15673/fst.v10i4.2552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aМriachenko, N.V.14aThe substantiation of development of mousses technology using wheat starch  aResource is Open Access  a<p>This work is dedicated to the substantiation of development of technology of fruit and vegetable mousses using wheat starch and surfactant – Tween 20.

Beneficial effects are associated with the inhibition of symphathetic nervous system hyperactivity, reduction of heart rate, and remodeling by blocking the mitogenic activity of catecholamines. A possible effect of β-blockers on substrate metabolism has also been suggested. The direct effects of β-blockers on mouse C2C12 cells were investigated in this study. C2C12 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and differentiated into myotubes in the same medium that contained 1% FBS. Palmitic acid oxidation and glycolysis were measured by using [9,10-³H]palmitate and [5-³H]glucose, respectively. The amount of ³H₂O was measured as an indicator of substrate usage. Carvedilol (100 µmol/L) inhibited palmitate oxidation and increased glycolysis by nearly 50%. Prazosin altered substrate metabolism in a similar fashion as carvedilol, whereas propranolol or bisoprolol were devoid of metabolic effects. When added to mimic sympathetic activation, epinephrine stimulated glycolysis but did not alter fatty acid oxidation. Based on these results, carvedilol appears to have direct effects on substrate metabolism that are related to the blockade of α1 adrenergic receptors.  aPublisher supplied data 0acarvedilol 0abisoprolol 0aβ-blockers 0aC2C12 0afatty acid oxidation 0aglycolysis1 aSuzmecelik, Elif1 aOzcelikay, A.

Deforestation, Rehabilitation and Conservation-with-Development in Central Kalimantan's Tropical Peatlands  ap. 405-420.  aSUMMARYTropical peat swamp forests (TPSF) in Indonesia have long faced competition between industrial demand for timber, the subsistence requirements of local communities and, more recently, global concern about the need to conserve tropical peat carbon stores, ecosystem services and biodiversity. This paper uses concepts of ecological distribution and environmental justice to investigate how tensions between conservation and livelihood goals have played out on the ground and examine who has gained and lost out from recent TPSF exploitation, conservation and rehabilitation initiatives. A central focus is how peat-based communities in Central Kalimantan have adapted their livelihoods to changing peatland conditions and management policies with particular emphasis on the livelihood impacts of conservation-with-development initiatives in the area. It is argued that despite recent emphasis on ‘win-win’ initiatives, the costs of environmental conservation are rarely distributed in proportion to their benefit.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acarbon sinks 3adeforestation 3aecosystem services 3aforests 3aissues and policy 3alivelihood 3apeat 3apeatlands 3asocial justice 3aswamps 3aBorneo 3aIndonesia 0aTropical peat swamp forest 0aIndonesia 0adeforestation 0aconservation-with-development 0aREDD1 aNasir, D.1 aPage, S.E.1 aRieley, J.O.1 aKhanal, K.0 tinternational forestry review.g2014 Sept., v. 16, no. 4 p.405-420dCommonwealth Forestry Associationx1465-54897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1505%2F1465548148134840863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245015400170520188900324592002802213650001502241650002102256650001902277650002202296650002302318650002402341650001002365653003202375653002902407653003802436653001302474700002402487700001902511773011402530856008502644852000902729655001202738IND60776745220221119213941.0220706e20220621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077674522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2022.4631132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJafari, Mostafa10aApplication of numerical simulation to solid phase-microextraction for decreasing of extraction time of pyrene and phthalate esters on solid coatings  aReynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach with the k-ε closure model is employed for the first time to simulate direct Solid-Phase Micro-Extraction (SPME) computationally. Simulations are performed by using COMSOL Multiphysics in order to examine methods to decrease the extraction time. Experiments are also conducted to support data obtained from the numerical framework. Di-n-Butyl Phthalate (DNBP) and etched steel wire are chosen as the analyte and the adsorbent, respectively. Stirring rate, fiber's location, stirrer magnet's size, and the method of sample rotation are examined to decrease the extraction time. In addition, the effects of adding a baffle to the vial and implementing a periodic function for stirring the sample are studied. Increasing the stirring rate from 700 to 3000 rpm reduces the extraction time from 50 to 36 minutes. Present results suggest that changing the fiber's location and implementing a periodic stirring pattern significantly decrease the extraction time of SPME. The optimum fiber's location is found at 7.5 mm far from the vial's center, which leads to a 51% decrease in the extraction time. Furthermore, using a periodic stirring pattern results in a 60% decrease in the extraction time compared to the traditional uniform stirring pattern. To examine the robustness and reliability of the presented framework, two additional analytes, namely pyrene and Dioctyl phthalate (DOP), are chosen with one additional fiber, Al₂O₃. In this regard, the additional materials are used in the framework to investigate the effects of fiber's location and stirring pattern. By optimizing the fiber's location, the extraction time is reduced by 36% and 40% for SPME of pyrene and DOP, respectively. On the other hand, by using a periodic stirring pattern, the extraction time is reduced by 42% and 46% for SPME of pyrene and DOP, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3achemical species 3achromatography 3adibutyl phthalate 3amagnetic materials 3amathematical models 3asteel 0aSolid phase microextraction 0aComputational simulation 0aReynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes 0aKinetics1 aJamshidian, Mostafa1 aHabibi, Shayan0 tJournal of chromatography.g2022 June 21, v. 1673 p.463113-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2022.4631133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03297naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001300181245012100194300001800315506007600333520170300409592002802112506003702140650001802177650002602195650001102221650002402232650001602256650004402272650002402316650001302340650001802353650001002371650002302381650001102404650001102415650003002426650002602456650001802482651001902500700001802519700001502537700001402552773013602566856008002702852000902782655001202791IND4469243720221207084232.0120326e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446924372DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.00294-112doi7 aPMC32091412pmcid7 a218734852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Anyi10aNiche Partitioning of Marine Group I Crenarchaeota in the Euphotic and Upper Mesopelagic Zones of the East China Sea  ap. 7469-7478.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMarine group I Crenarchaeota (MGI) represents a ubiquitous and numerically predominant microbial population in marine environments. An understanding of the spatial dynamics of MGI and its controlling mechanisms is essential for an understanding of the role of MGI in energy and element cycling in the ocean. In the present study, we investigated the diversity and abundance of MGI in the East China Sea (ECS) by analysis of crenarchaeal 16S rRNA gene, the ammonia monooxygenase gene amoA, and the biotin carboxylase gene accA. Quantitative PCR analyses revealed that these genes were higher in abundance in the mesopelagic than in the euphotic zone. In addition, the crenarchaeal amoA gene was positively correlated with the copy number of the MGI 16S rRNA gene, suggesting that most of the MGI in the ECS are nitrifiers. Furthermore, the ratios of crenarchaeal accA to amoA or to MGI 16S rRNA genes increased from the euphotic to the mesopelagic zone, suggesting that the role of MGI in carbon cycling may change from the epipelagic to the mesopelagic zones. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoretic profiling of the 16S rRNA genes revealed depth partitioning in MGI community structures. Clone libraries of the crenarchaeal amoA and accA genes showed both "shallow" and "deep" groups, and their relative abundances varied in the water column. Ecotype simulation analysis revealed that MGI in the upper ocean could diverge into special ecotypes associated with depth to adapt to the light gradient across the water column. Overall, our results showed niche partitioning of the MGI population and suggested a shift in their ecological functions between the euphotic and mesopelagic zones of the ECS.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCrenarchaeota 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aclones 3acommunity structure 3acorrelation 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aecological function 3aecotypes 3aeuphotic zone 3agenes 3amarine environment 3aniches 3aoceans 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aquantitative analysis 3aribosomal RNA 3aEast China Sea1 aJiao, Nianzhi1 aZhang, Rui1 aYang, Zao0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2011 Nov. 1, v. 77, no. 21 p.7469-7478dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00294-113Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245018500170300001400355520127900369592002801648650001601676650002101692650001301713650002201726650001901748650001601767650001301783650001101796650001701807650001501824650001401839650002001853650001601873650001401889650002001903650001501923650002201938773014401960856008002104852000902184655001202193IND60518156220221119191612.0160406e196607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051815622DNAL7 a10.7589/0090-3558-2.3.412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThrelfall, William,10aStudies on the Blood of Herring Gulls and Domestic Fowl with Some Observations on Changes Brought About by Infection with Cyathostoma lari Blanchard, 1849 (Nematoda; Strongyloidea)  ap. 41-51.  aA decline in parasitemia in herring gull chicks, noted just before fledging, was thought to have been due to an immunity to the parasites being developed by the birds. Since few investigations of the blood of wild birds had been done, a study of the blood of the gull was made to try to correlate changes in the blood with the decline in parasitemia. The serum protein levels were determined electrophoretically in birds infected with Cyathostoma lari and in uninfected birds, and leucocyte counts in infected and uninfected birds were compared.The albumin levels in the serums of the birds decreased with age, and a corresponding increase in the globulin level was observed. The serum globulin level also increased in birds inoculated once with C. lari. No changes in the globulin level in the serum of a bird infected 3 times with C. lari were observed. Counts of various types of cells in the blood of infected and uninfected herring gulls indicated that heterophilia and eosinophilia occurred approximately 3 weeks after inoculation. The changes in serum constituents and blood cell counts of domestic fowls were compared with those of the herring gull. The results suggested that a definite cellular and immune response developed in herring gulls infected with C. lari.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyathostoma 3aLarus argentatus 3aalbumins 3ablood cell counts 3ablood proteins 3ablood serum 3achickens 3achicks 3aeosinophilia 3afledglings 3aglobulins 3aimmune response 3aparasitemia 3aparasites 3aprotein content 3awild birds 3awildlife diseases0 tBulletin of the Wildlife Disease Association.g1966 July, v. 2, no. 3 p.41-51dWildlife Disease AssociationwJournal:23131x0098-373X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7589/0090-3558-2.3.413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01374naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245005800165300001600223520056400239592002800803650001900831650001400850650001200864650003100876650000900907773009000916856008101006852000901087655001201096IND60119918220221117224523.0150112e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011991822DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078140700942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsipov, V.

The aim of this study was to evaluate and validate the use of the GLIM criteria in patients with cancer.This multicenter cohort study compared the GLIM with the scored Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (sPG-SGA). The 1-y survival rate, multivariate Cox regression analysis, κ-value, sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and time-dependent ROC analysis were applied to identify the performance of the GLIM.Among the 3777 patients in the study, 50.9% versus 49.1% or 36.3% versus 63.7% of the patients were defined as well-nourished and malnourished by GLIM or sPG-SGA, respectively. GLIM presented moderate consistency (κ = 0.54, P < 0.001), fair sensitivity and specificity (70.5 and 88.3%) compared with sPG-SGA. There was no difference in the 1-y survival rate in malnourished patients (76.9 versus 76.4%, P = 0.711), but it was significantly different in well-nourished patients (85.8 versus 90.3%, P < 0.001) between GLIM and sPG-SGA. The above difference was eliminated after omitted nutritional risk screening (NRS)-2002 screening before GLIM (88.1 versus 90.3%, P = 0.078). Omitting NRS-2002 screening before GLIM did not change the 1-y survival rate in well-nourished or malnourished patients by GLIM with NRS-2002 screening (76.9 versus 78.9%, P = 0.099; 85.8% versus 88.1%, P = 0.092) although it significantly raised the rate of malnutrition to 72.5%. The combination of “weight loss and cancer” showed better performance than other combinations.GLIM could be a convenient alternative to sPG-SGA in nutrition assessment for patients with cancer. The combination of “weight loss and cancer” was better than other combinations. Considering the higher risk for malnutrition in patients with cancer, NRS-2002 screening may not be needed before GLIM.  aPublisher supplied data 3acohort studies 3aleadership 3amalnutrition 3anutrition assessment 3anutrition risk assessment 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asurvival rate 3aweight loss 0aGLIM criteria 0aScored PG-SGA 0aCancer 0aNRS-20021 aTang, Meng1 aFu, Zhen-Ming1 aZhang, Qi1 aZhang, Xi1 aGuo, Zeng-Qing1 aXu, Hong-Xia1 aSong, Chun-Hua1 aBraga, Marco1 aCederholm, Tommy1 aLi, Wei1 aBarazzoni, Rocco1 aShi, Han-Ping0 tNutrition.g2021 Nov.,  Dec., v. 91-92 p.111379-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2021.1113793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02264naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007600169300001600245520075400261592002801015650002201043650002101065650002801086650003401114650002701148650002601175650002901201650002501230650001901255650001401274650004401288650001401332650002201346653001901368653001801387653001801405653002501423700001801448700001301466700001901479700001801498700001901516700001801535773012301553856008501676852000901761655001201770IND60694118120221120221701.0200509e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069411812DNAL7 a10.1016/S1875-5364(20)30033-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWANG, Si-Xian10aNew meroterpenoid compounds from the culture of mushroom Panus lecomtei  ap. 268-272.  aTwo new meroterpenoid compounds (1 and 2) together with five known meroterpenoid derivatives (3–7) were isolated from solid culture of mushroom Panus lecomtei.

Mutant isolation is one of the effective ways to isolate and clone the target genes and analyze their functions. To find the various mutants in the same genetic background, seeds of Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare were treated with ethyl methane sulphonate (EMS). A total of 1056 mutants were screened for five categories in M2 generation with the seedling frequency of 26.29‰ at three-leaf stage, but only 264 mutants were verified in M3 generation with a frequency of 6.57‰. Among the mutants verified in M3 generation, the frequency of leaf mutation was the highest (2.22‰), followed by seedling height (1.74‰) and the abiotic stress tolerance mutant (1.47‰). Nineteen characteristic mutations, including a big group of abiotic stress tolerant mutants such as herbicide resistant, salt tolerant and drought tolerant were identified at this stage. By observation of rice growth characteristics at different developmental stages, another 220 mutants have been isolated and verified in the M3 generation with the mutant frequency of 53.9‰ covering about 28 mutant traits. Among those identified, the highest frequencies were obtained for appearance of brown rice mutant with 18.37‰, followed by panicle mutant with 13.47‰, and grain mutants with 9.06‰. All the mutants screened above were suitable for gene function analysis and for utilization in agronomy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aabiotic stress 3aagronomy 3abrown rice 3adrought tolerance 3aethyl methanesulfonate 3agenes 3agenetic background 3aherbicide resistance 3ainflorescences 3aleaves 3amutants 3amutation 3asalt tolerance 3ascreening 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3astress tolerance 0aOryza sativa cv.

A biomass-derived chemical with high potential as a platform intermediate, γ-valerolactone (GVL) can be readily synthesized by hydrogenation of levulinic acid (LA), itself a common biomass intermediate, using supported Ru catalysts. To date the literature on many novel biomass conversion processes such as the hydrogenation of LA to GVL has focused more on the process and less on the catalyst.The goal of this work was to derive fundamental synthesis–structure–function relationships of Ru catalysts for LA hydrogenation using carbon- and alumina-supported Ru nanoparticles that have been synthesized in a rational, repeatable, scalable way. We have demonstrated that the method of strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA) yields well-dispersed, homogeneously distributed Ru particles with tight particle size distributions over both types of supports. SEA synthesis of well-dispersed nanoparticles results in higher activity than commercial Ru catalysts with higher Ru loadings. The dramatic, beneficial effect of potassium doping is reported for the first time. The carbon support yields higher inherent activity than alumina. Activity as a function of particle size appears to go through a maximum at about 1.5nm for both supports and suggests hydrogenation of LA is structure sensitive to Ru particle size. Catalyst deactivation after 24h occurs to significant extents (8–58%) mainly by nanoparticle sintering, but also by minor amounts of K loss in K-doped samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaluminum oxide 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahydrogenation 3alevulinic acid 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3apetroleum 3apotassium 0aRu nanoparticles 0aStrong electrostatic adsorption 0aLA hydrogenation to GVL 0aStructure sensitive 0aPotassium promotion effect1 aMonnier, John R.1 aWilliams, Christopher T.1 aDiao, Weijian1 aRegalbuto, John R.0 tJournal of catalysis.g2015 June, v. 326 p.69-81dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2015.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03696naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005800153245013900211300001400350520234000364592002802704650001202732650002002744650002902764650001402793650002502807650001102832650001602843650001502859650002102874650001502895653002102910653003602931653003002967653005202997700001803049700001703067773010503084856008803189852000903277655001203286IND60538072620221121055438.0190319e20140310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053807262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2013.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJakoby, Oliver1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0787-153010aPattern-oriented parameterization of general models for ecological application: Towards realistic evaluations of management approaches  ap. 78-88.  aGeneral ecological models address classes of systems instead of focusing on specific systems. However, a major challenge when using general models for ecological applications is parameterization. This process involves a trade-off between analyzing the entire parameter space, which might be misleading because unrealistic parameter combinations are likely to be included, versus analyzing the model for a specific parameter set, which limits its generality. Here, we present a parameterization strategy that excludes unrealistic parameter combinations, without focusing on specific systems. This strategy adapts pattern-oriented modeling (POM) for general models. We employ a set of qualitative patterns that describe and thereby define the class of systems to be represented with the general model. Each pattern is employed to filter parameter sets that would lead to uncharacteristic model behavior. As an example, we use a general model of semi-arid rangelands that links vegetation biomass dynamics, livestock grazing, and management. The purpose of the model is to compare constant and adaptive stocking strategies. Through the pattern-oriented parameterization method, we narrow the parameter space significantly, from one billion to approximately 11,000 parameter sets. The remaining parameter sets reveal interrelationships between model parameters and processes. This increased our understanding of the model and is therefore useful for addressing applied management questions. Using the parameterized model, we found that adaptive stocking is beneficial for livestock production in all cases. Storage biomass dynamics appear to be the most important process for evaluating stocking strategies. Consequently, adaptive stocking is particularly beneficial in rangelands that are vulnerable to storage degradation by overgrazing. Our pattern-oriented parameterization provides a new way to use general models to support decision making, while avoiding the two pitfalls of employing either unrealistic parameter combinations or having an excessively narrow focus. Additionally, this approach supports systems analysis by revealing interactions and trade-offs between parameters and their corresponding processes. In summary, our approach allows the use of general models supporting a realistic evaluation of management approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3adecision making 3adecision support systems 3alivestock 3alivestock production 3amodels 3aovergrazing 3arangelands 3asystems analysis 3avegetation 0aInverse modeling 0aPattern-oriented modeling (POM) 0aSemi-arid rangeland model 0aConstant vs. opportunistic rangeland management1 aGrimm, Volker1 aFrank, Karin0 tEcological modelling.g2014 Mar. 10, v. 275 p.78-88dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2013.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245010100162300001600263520111700279592002801396650001401424650002201438650001601460650002401476650001201500650001201512650001901524650002801543650001301571650001801584653001301602653001201615653002001627653001701647653001901664700001801683700001801701700001801719700006001737700001901797700001801816773010101834856008201935852000902017655001202026IND60603009220221120172716.0180712e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060300922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2015.02.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Danni10aMolecular engineering of photosensitizers for fast and stable photocatalytic hydrogen generation  ap. 118-127.  aA family of iridium(III) complexes with a general structure, [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]PF6 (C^N is cyclometalating ligand and N^N is bipyridyl ligand), was synthesized and explored as photosensitizers (PSs) for photocatalytic hydrogen generation using a three-component system containing an electron donor, triethylamine (TEA), a colloidal platinum catalyst and water. The introduction of a novel fluorinated C^N ligand, 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-4-methylquinoline, leads to much faster electron transfer from TEA to the excited-state Ir-PSs, as confirmed from Stern–Volmer measurements. In combination with the employment of various N^N ligands attached with surface-adsorbing groups including vinyl, formyl, cyano, and pyridyl, the photocatalytic hydrogen-generation duration is significantly extended. This might be related to the fast quenching of the reduced state (Ir-PS⁻) resulting from the enhanced interaction between the Ir-PSs and the Pt catalyst. In photocatalytic reactions at relatively low Ir-PS concentrations, turnover numbers of over 10,000 for hydrogen generation can be attained using the formyl Ir-PS.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3aelectron transfer 3aengineering 3ahydrogen production 3airidium 3aligands 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotosensitizing agents 3aplatinum 3atriethylamine 0aHydrogen 0aIridium 0aPhotosensitizer 0aFormyl group 0aPhotochemistry1 aChu, Qianqian1 aWu, Zhuangzhi1 aChen, Qingyun1 aFan, Sheng-Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0251-22401 aYang, Guan-Jun1 aFang, Baizeng0 tJournal of catalysis.g2015 May, v. 325 p.118-127dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2015.02.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100003600142245017300178500001400351520121400365592002801579650001601607650001701623650001201640650001301652650002301665650001801688650001401706650001801720650002201738650001201760653001501772653001201787653001201799653001601811653001801827653001601845653001901861653002601880700002001906700001901926700001801945700003301963700002201996700003002018700002302048700002202071700001602093700002602109700002102135700001602156700002102172700002402193773011302217856007702330852000902407655001202416IND60727403320221116194122.0210308e20200114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072740332DNAL7 a10.3897/BDJ.8.e475022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalumbres-Olarte, J.q(Jagoba),10aStandardised inventories of spiders (Arachnida, Araneae) of Macaronesia II: The native forests and dry habitats of Madeira archipelago (Madeira and Porto Santo islands)  aNAL-light  aHere we present the data obtained from the samples collected as part of a large research project (MACDIV) which aims at understanding the drivers of spider (Araneae) community assembly in Macaronesian islands.

Previous studies have indicated the protective effect of ginseng and the regulatory potential of phenolic acid components from other plants on endothelial function. Therefore, this study investigated the protective effects of phenolic acid extract from ginseng (PG2) on endothelial cells against palmitate‐induced damage. We found that PG2 increases cell viability, inhibits the palmitate‐induced intracellular accumulation of lipids, and the overexpression of endothelin‐1 (ET‐1) through enhancing the phosphorylation of the phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase/Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (PI3K/Akt/eNOS) signaling pathway. The results of this study may be valuable for the development of PG2 to combat the endothelial cell damage caused by hyperlipidemia. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: We proved that phenolic acid extract from ginseng has a protective effect on free fatty acid‐induced endothelial dysfunction in vitro. This study provides experimental data for the application of ginseng‐derived phenolic acids in treating cardiovascular disease.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFC1702103cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a2017YFC1702106cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a2018YFC1704701cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a20180201075YYcScience and Technology Development Plan of Jilin Province, China  a20180101128JCcScience and Technology Development Plan of Jilin Province, China  a20190304095YYcScience and Technology Development Plan of Jilin Province, China  a20190101010JHcScience and Technology Development Plan of Jilin Province, China  aJJKH20180378KJcScience and Technology Development Plan of Jilin Province, China  a201731200cScience and Technology Development Plan of Jilin City and Changchun City, China  a18YJ013cScience and Technology Development Plan of Jilin City and Changchun City, China 3aPanax 3acardiovascular diseases 3acell viability 3aendothelial cells 3aendothelial nitric oxide synthase 3aendothelins 3afree fatty acids 3ahyperlipidemia 3alipids 3apalmitates 3apathophysiology 3aphenolic acids 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aphosphorylation 3aprotective effect 3asignal transduction1 aYao, Fan1 aSong, Jia1 aFu, Baoyu1 aSun, Guang1 aSong, Xinying1 aFu, Chunge1 aJiang, Rui1 aSun, Liwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4194-18890 tJournal of food science.g2020 Mar., v. 85, no. 3 p.576-581dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.150713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03274naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005900153245011800212300001200330520169100342592002802033650001602061650002402077650001202101650001702113650002002130650001702150650002202167650001102189650002102200651001202221651002502233651002102258651001002279651001002289653002402299653002502323653002202348653001602370653002502386653002502411700002902436700002102465700002702486700002502513700001802538773010302556856008802659852000902747655001202756IND60538072820221121055435.0190319e20140310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053807282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2013.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcevedo, Pelayo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3509-769610aGeneralizing and transferring spatial models: A case study to predict Eurasian badger abundance in Atlantic Spain  ap. 1-8.  aEven when spatially explicit models are published in accessible international journals, they are rarely reused by the scientific community. This is unfortunate, as these models contain useful information to develop further research and to support decision-making policies. In the absence of a major study on Eurasian badger (Meles meles) abundance in Atlantic Spain, and given the potential role of this species in Mycobacterium bovis epidemiology, we aimed to predict broad-scale badger abundance by generalizing published models for sett suitability within the UK (one calibrated for Northern Ireland and another one for England and Wales). The UK models used fine-resolution environmental predictors that were not available for Spain. Thus, we generalized the models using the outputs of the published models as response variables and calibrated new models using broad-scale environmental predictors. The new model derived from that for Northern Ireland accurately predicted the badger abundance (field data for 48 1km×1km squares in 12 localities) in Atlantic Spain, and indicated a high potential for the species in lowland pastoral areas. The mean density of badgers in the study area was 3.81adults/km2 (3.0±1.3adults/group), which is higher than in Mediterranean areas in Spain, but lower than in some areas in England where badgers contribute to M. bovis maintenance. We provide the first example of generalization of published spatial models, and confirm that this procedure allows for more efficient use of research funding, by generating new information of relevance, in this case study, for badger management and for understanding M. bovis epidemiology in Atlantic Spain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeles meles 3aMycobacterium bovis 3abadgers 3acase studies 3adecision making 3aepidemiology 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aresearch support 3aEngland 3aMediterranean region 3aNorthern Ireland 3aSpain 3aWales 0aBovine tuberculosis 0aEcological modelling 0aLandscape ecology 0aMeles meles 0aModel generalization 0aPopulation abundance1 aGonzález-Quirós, Pablo1 aPrieto, José M.1 aEtherington, Thomas R.1 aGortázar, Christian1 aBalseiro, Ana0 tEcological modelling.g2014 Mar. 10, v. 275 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2013.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009800167500001400265520081500279592002801094650002001122650001101142650001901153650002401172650001601196650001401212650001601226650001001242650003101252650001301283650001301296650001001309650001101319653001301330653002301343653002101366653000901387653000901396653000701405653000801412653000801420653000801428653000701436653000701443653000701450653000801457700001601465700001901481700002101500700002301521700002101544773010901565856008201674852000901756655001201765IND60715146320221122041527.0201223e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071514632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vas.2020.1001502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGascho, Dominic10aVirtopsy of a gravid Boa constrictor using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging  aNAL-light  aThis article presents radiologic examinations of a deeply sedated Boa constrictor with boid inclusion body disease (BIBD) as an adjunction to the subsequent necropsy.

This article illustrates the use of CT and MRI for the examination of a gravid Boa constrictor before necropsy and demonstrates the detection of “normal” postmortem findings leading to the confirmation of fetal death in situ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBoa constrictor 3aadults 3aanimal science 3acomputed tomography 3adegradation 3adetection 3afetal death 3afetus 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3anecropsy 3askeleton 3askull 3asnakes 0aVirtopsy 0aPostmortem imaging 0aVirtual necropsy 0aBIBD 0aRAVs 0aCT 0aMRI 0akVp 0amAs 0aTR 0aTE 0ams 0aIHC1 aHetzel, Udo1 aSchmid, Nicole1 aMartinez, Rosa M1 aThali, Michael J.,1 aRichter, Henning0 tVeterinary and Animal Science.g2020 Dec., v. 10 p.100150-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23501x2451-943X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vas.2020.1001503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02041naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009900164300001600263520091400279592002801193650002601221650001001247650001201257650001501269650000701284650001001291650001101301650002001312650001501332650001801347650001701365650001401382651001101396653002101407653001601428653001901444773007801463856008101541852000901622655001201631IND60519861520221118062829.0160511e20100610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051986152DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-010-0063-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpyra, Aneta10aEnvironmental factors influencing the occurrence of freshwater snails in woodland water bodies  ap. 697-703.  aStudies were carried out in eight woodland water bodies that are situated in an urbanised area of Southern Poland (Upper Silesia). The aim of this study was to determine the influence of auto- and allochthonous plant detritus and exposure to sunlight on the structure of snail communities in woodland ponds. Among some physico-chemical water parameters, pH influenced the occurrence of snails, whereas sunlight caused an increase in diversity of the snail communities. In the total snail collection, 72.1% of specimens were gathered in sun-exposed sites. By the same degree of insolation more preferred by snails were the sites with allochthonic detritus. The snail fauna of subsidence ponds located inside a forest area differs from those occurring in urban agglomerations. The most conspicuous difference is the high numbers in three woodland ponds of Hippeutis complanatus (L.), which is rare in this area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental factors 3afauna 3aforests 3afreshwater 3apH 3aponds 3asnails 3asolar radiation 3asubsidence 3asurface water 3aurbanization 3awoodlands 3aPoland 0asubsidence ponds 0aleaf litter 0aplant detritus0 tBiologia.g2010 June 10, v. 65, no. 4 p.697-703dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-010-0063-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245009200160300001800252500001900270520136200289592002801651650000801679650001401687650001701701650001101718650001401729650001801743650000901761650001501770650001501785700005901800700001401859700005601873700001501929700006701944700005602011773013902067856007902206852000902285655001202294IND60688074020221120161931.0200407e20200302xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068807402DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b045352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qun12aA Review of Microplastics in Table Salt, Drinking Water, and Air: Direct Human Exposure  ap. 3740-3751.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe ubiquity of microplastics in aquatic and terrestrial environments and related ecological impacts have gained global attention. Microplastics have been detected in table salt, drinking water, and air, posing inevitable human exposure risk. However, rigorous analytical methods for detection and characterization of microplastics remain scarce. Knowledge about the potential adverse effects on human health via dietary and respiratory exposures is also limited. To address these issues, we reviewed 46 publications concerning abundances, potential sources, and analytical methods of microplastics in table salt, drinking water, and air. We also summarized probable translocation and accumulation pathways of microplastics within human body. Human body burdens of microplastics through table salt, drinking water, and inhalation were estimated to be (0–7.3)×10⁴, (0–4.7)×10³, and (0–3.0)×10⁷ items per person per year, respectively. The intake of microplastics via inhalation, especially via indoor air, was much higher than those via other exposure routes. Moreover, microplastics in the air impose threats to both respiratory and digestive systems through breathing and ingestion. Given the lifetime inevitable exposure to microplastics, we urgently call for a better understanding of the potential hazards of microplastics to human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abreathing 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aingestion 3amicroplastics 3arisk 3atable salt 3atechnology1 aXu, Elvis Genbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4414-19781 aLi, Jiana1 aChen, Qiqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3247-78611 aMa, Liping1 aZeng, E.

Stem cell therapy has proven to be a promising approach for treating heart following myocardial infarction (MI). Adult stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells are possible cell types and have successfully shown to regenerate damaged myocardial tissue in pre-clinical and clinical studies. Current implications of using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) owing to their immunomodulatory functions and paracrine effects could serve as an effective alternative treatment option for rejuvenating the heart post MI. The major setback associated with the use of MSCs is reduced cell retention, engraftment and decreased effectiveness. With a few reports on understanding the role of inflammation and its dual effects on the structure and function of heart, this review focuses on these missing insights and further exemplifies the role of MSCs as an alternative therapy in treating the pathological consequences in myocardial infarction (MI).  aPublisher supplied data 3aclinical trials 3aembryonic stem cells 3aheart 3aheart failure 3aimmunomodulators 3ainduced pluripotent stem cells 3ainflammation 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3amyocardial infarction 3aneutralization 3atherapeutics 0aMyocardial infarction 0aInflammation 0aMesenchymal stem cells 0aImmunomodulation 0aRegeneration1 aVincent, Preethi1 aSekaran, Saravanan1 aVisaga Ambi, Senthil1 aMuralidar, Shibi1 aSelvaraj, Vimalraj1 aPalaniappan, Balamurugan1 aThirumalai, Diraviyam0 tLife sciences.g2020 June 01, v. 250 p.117582-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1175823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245006500161300001800226520135200244592002801596650001201624650001201636650001801648650001401666650002101680650001601701650001201717650001301729650001701742650001101759650001101770650001401781650001301795651001101808653000901819653001801828653001801846700002101864700001901885700002601904700001901930700002001949700002201969700002501991700001602016773012702032856007902159852000902238655001202247IND60749411320221117235032.0210908s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074941132DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2020-03532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuindon, Luc10aTrends in wildfire burn severity across Canada, 1985 to 2015  ap. 1230-1244.  aBurn severity is an important component of the fire regime that has not yet been fully characterized for the forests of Canada. The objectives of this study were to (i) create a Canada-wide geospatial database of burn severity for wildland fires across forested regions of Canada from 1985 to 2015, and (ii) use this database to evaluate seasonal and annual trends in burn severity across Canada and regionally using two different regional units (ecozones and Homogeneous Fire Regime zones). We developed the 30 m resolution geospatial Canadian Landsat Burn Severity (CanLaBS) product from Landsat imagery, using values of pre-fire to post-fire differences in normalized burn ratios (dNBRs) for nearly 60 Mha of area burned across Canada’s forests from 1985 to 2015, complemented with estimates of pre-fire forest composition, crown closure, and biomass. Our results suggest that burn severity is generally lower in spring fires than in summer ones nationally and in almost every regional unit. We found no consistent relationship between burn severity and annual area burned across ecozones. Finally, we observed a small but significant decrease in burn severity from 1985 to 2015 across Canada, although this is regionally variable. The CanLaBS database is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.23687/b1f61b7e-4ba6-4244-bc79-c1174f2f92cd.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3abiomass 3aburn severity 3adatabases 3aecological zones 3afire regime 3aforests 3aresearch 3aspatial data 3aspring 3asummer 3awildfires 3awildland 3aCanada 0adNBR 0afire database 0afire severity1 aGauthier, Sylvie1 aManka, Francis1 aParisien, Marc-André1 aWhitman, Ellen1 aBernier, Pierre1 aBeaudoin, André,1 aVillemaire, Philippe1 aSkakun, Rob0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2021, v. 51, no. 9 p.1230-1244dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl2003x1208-60377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2020-03533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03731naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245012800183300001600311500001400327520169900341592002802040650001402068650002402082650001602106650002202122650001702144650001202161650001802173650001302191650004802204650002102252650001602273650003402289650002202323650001902345650001902364650001202383650001302395650003102408650001402439650001802453650001402471651001002485653001302495653001402508653001302522653001202535700002102547700002002568700001902588700002402607700002202631700002802653700002102681700002002702700003202722700002502754700002402779700002202803773012602825856008502951852000903036655001203045IND60694467820221120140036.0200513e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069446782DNAL7 a10.1080/1828051X.2016.12455932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorrondo, María Patrocinio10aPrevalence and distribution of infectious and parasitic agents in roe deer from Spain and their possible role as reservoirs  ap. 266-274.  aNAL-light  aIn order to provide up-to-date information about the prevalence of infectious and parasitic agents in Spanish roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), samples from 93 animals hunted from January 2013 to April 2015 were collected and analysed by parasitological, serological and molecular techniques. Sampled animals came from four roe deer populations corresponding to Oceanic, Continental, Mediterranean and Mountainous ecosystems of Spain. Data regarding sex, age and year were also considered. A high percentage of roe deer (95.7%) resulted positive for at least one agent. Sarcocystis spp. was the most frequently diagnosed genus (88.8%), followed by gastrointestinal nematodes (62.9%) and Schmallenberg virus (53.5%). Varestrongylus capreoli (38%), Anaplasma phagocitophylum (34.2%), Eimeria spp. (29.2%), Toxoplasma gondii (25%) and Cephenemyia stimulator (23.8%) displayed medium prevalences and, finally low percentages were registered for Moniezia spp. (6.7%), Dictyocaulus noerneri (2.4%) and Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (1.5%). No infections by Neospora caninum, Bovine herpesvirus, pestivirus or Coxiella burnetii were found. Climate was significantly associated with the prevalence of T. gondii, C. stimulator and A. phagocitophylum, with higher prevalences in animals from Oceanic and Mediterranean areas. Our results suggest that infections affecting Spanish roe deer, especially those of parasitic aetiology, represent one of the causes of the descent in the abundance of this ungulate in the last years. Moreover, the high prevalence of zoonotic agents such as T. gondii and A. phagocitophylum could also have a great relevance in the environmental and/or Public Health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnaplasma 3aCapreolus capreolus 3aCephenemyia 3aCoxiella burnetii 3aDictyocaulus 3aEimeria 3aHerpesviridae 3aMoniezia 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3aNeospora caninum 3aSarcocystis 3aSchmallenberg orthobunyavirus 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aVarestrongylus 3aanimal science 3aclimate 3aetiology 3agastrointestinal nematodes 3amountains 3apublic health 3aungulates 3aSpain 0aBacteria 0aparasites 0aroe deer 0aviruses1 aPérez-Creo, Ana1 aPrieto, Alberto1 aCabanelas, Eva1 aDíaz-Cao, José M.1 aArias, María Sol1 aDíaz Fernández, Pablo1 aPajares, Gerardo1 aRemesar, Susana1 aLópez-Sández, Ceferino M.1 aFernández, Gonzalo,1 aDíez-Baños, Pablo1 aPanadero, Rosario0 tItalian journal of animal science.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 16, no. 2 p.266-274dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11638x1828-051X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1828051X.2016.12455933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03307naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245014400162300001600306520137100322536046401693592002802157650002202185650002102207650002002228650001302248650001102261650001002272650001302282650002502295650001402320650001902334651001402353651001202367653000902379653003802388653000902426653001302435653000902448653001202457700002302469700001402492700001502506700001602521700001502537700001602552700001402568773010602582856008002688852000902768655001202777IND60615022520221121020942.0181003e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061502252DNAL7 a10.1177/03009858166666082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNuradji, H.10aHighly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N1) Virus in FeathersbTropism and Pathology of Virus-Infected Feathers of Infected Ducks and Chickens  ap. 226-233.  aH5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus causes high mortality of infected birds, with infection in multiple organs, including in feathers. Feathers have been proposed as samples for diagnosis of HPAI infection in birds, and this study is part of a broader investigation validating the use of feathers for diagnostic purposes. To understand and characterize the morphological basis for feather infection, sections from 7 different skin tracts of ducks and chickens infected with 3 different clades of H5N1 HPAI virus from Indonesia and Vietnam were examined histologically. Results showed that in ducks, lesions and viral antigen were mainly detected in the epidermis of feathers and follicles, whereas in chickens, they were mostly found in the dermis of these structures. Abundant viral antigen was found in nearly all the feathers examined from chickens, and there was no apparent difference between virus isolates or skin tracts in the proportion of feathers that were antigen positive. By immunohistochemistry, the majority of feathers from most skin tracts from ducks infected with a Vietnamese H5N1 HPAI virus contained abundant levels of viral antigen, while few feathers were antigen positive from ducks infected with 2 Indonesian viruses. These results support and inform the use of feathers for diagnostic detection of H5N1 HPAI virus in birds.  aFunding The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was partially funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) (project AH/2004/040).

A newly developed tandem equilibrium isotope exchange (EIX) assay has now established that such “KR⁰” domains catalyze the biosynthetically essential epimerization of transient (2R)-2-methyl-3-ketoacyl-ACP intermediates to the corresponding (2S)-2-methyl-3-ketoacyl-ACP diastereomers. Incubation of [2-²H]-(2R,3S)-2-methyl-3-hydroxypentanoyl-SACP ([2-²H]-3b) with the EryKR3⁰ domain from module 3 of the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase, and the redox-active, nonepimerizing EryKR6 domain and NADP⁺ resulted in time- and cofactor-dependent washout of deuterium from 3b, as a result of EryKR3⁰-catalyzed epimerization of transiently generated [2-²H]-2-methyl-3-ketopentanoyl-ACP (4). Similar results were obtained with redox-inactive PicKR3⁰ from module 3 of the picromycin synthase. Four redox-inactive mutants of epimerase-active EryKR1 were engineered by mutagenesis of the NADPH binding site of this enzyme. Tandem EIX established that these EryKR1⁰ mutants retained the intrinsic epimerase activity of the parent EryKR1 domain. These results establish the intrinsic epimerase activity of redox-inactive KR⁰ domains, rule out any role for the NADPH cofactor in epimerization, and provide a general experimental basis for decoupling the epimerase and reductase activities of a large class of PKS domains.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3abinding sites 3adiastereomers 3aisotopes 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3apolyketide synthases1 aXie, Xinqiang1 aKeatinge-Clay, Adrian1 aKhosla, Chaitan1 aCane, David E.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 July 23, v. 136, no. 29 p.10190-10193dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja50569983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02020naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245010000164300001800264520081200282592002801094650002401122650000901146650001701155650002601172650001501198650001201213650002401225650002201249650001501271650001601286650001001302651001901312700002001331700001801351700002001369773014501389856007901534852000901613655001201622IND60312945420221117035742.0150714e20141212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031294542DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12572592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOllerton, Jeff10aExtinctions of aculeate pollinators in Britain and the role of large-scale agricultural changes  ap. 1360-1362.  aPollinators are fundamental to maintaining both biodiversity and agricultural productivity, but habitat destruction, loss of flower resources, and increased use of pesticides are causing declines in their abundance and diversity. Using historical records, we assessed the rate of extinction of bee and flower-visiting wasp species in Britain from the mid-19th century to the present. The most rapid phase of extinction appears to be related to changes in agricultural policy and practice beginning in the 1920s, before the agricultural intensification prompted by the Second World War, often cited as the most important driver of biodiversity loss in Britain. Slowing of the extinction rate from the 1960s onward may be due to prior loss of the most sensitive species and/or effective conservation programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural policy 3abees 3abiodiversity 3aconservation programs 3aextinction 3aflowers 3ahabitat destruction 3aintensive farming 3apesticides 3apollinators 3awasps 3aUnited Kingdom1 aErenler, Hilary1 aEdwards, Mike1 aCrockett, Robin0 tScience.g2014 Dec. 12, v. 346, no. 6215 p.1360-1362dAmerican Association for the Advancement of SciencewJournal:jnl44791x0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12572593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245007200160300002000232520118000252592002801432650003401460650002101494650001401515650002101529650001401550650001401564650001901578650002101597700002201618700002401640700001701664700001801681773013401699856007501833852000901908655001201917IND60539432720221118161322.0160816e20140723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053943272DNAL7 a10.1021/ja505734s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aResasco, Joaquin10aUniform Doping of Metal Oxide Nanowires Using Solid State Diffusion  ap. 10521-10526.  aThe synthesis of one-dimensional nanostructures with specific properties is often hindered by difficulty in tuning the material composition without sacrificing morphology and material quality. Here, we present a simple solid state diffusion method utilizing atomic layer deposition to controllably alter the composition of metal oxide nanowires. This compositional control allows for modification of the optical, electronic, and electrochemical properties of the semiconductor nanowires. Using this method and a novel process for manganese oxide atomic layer deposition, we produced manganese-doped rutile TiO₂ nanowires and investigated their structural and photoelectrochemical properties. A homogeneous incorporation of the Mn dopant into the rutile lattice was observed, and the local chemical environment of the Mn was determined using X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The doping process resulted in a tunable enhancement in the electrocatalytic activity for water oxidation, demonstrating that this simple and general method can be used to control the properties of one-dimensional nanostructures for use in a variety of applications including solar-to-fuel generation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3amanganese 3amanganese oxides 3ananowires 3aoxidation 3asemiconductors 3atitanium dioxide1 aDasgupta, Neil P.1 aRosell, Josep

This study aims to give a contribution to the milk quality assessment of the native goat during the two productive seasons, spring and summer, and to verify the relationships between some meteorological data and physiological and milk quality parameters. Individual milk samples were taken in the two seasons. Physiological parameters and meteorological data were also registered. All the milk samples were measured for volume and analysed for: dry matter, total nitrogen, casein, ash, lactose, fat, milk fatty acid (FA) composition, number and diameter of the fat globules, and rheological parameters. There were not differences in the average diameter of the milk fat globules (2.27 ± 0.28 μm) and in milk gross composition between the two seasons, except for lactose which was significantly lower in summer. During summer a significant increase in some long-chain FAs such as CLA c9,t11, C18:1 t11, C18:0, C18:3 n3, C20:0, C22:0, C22:2 was observed, whereas short-chain FAs (C6:0, C8:0, C10:0), which are responsible for the development of unpleasant aromas, as well as monounsaturated C16:1, C17:1 c9, C20:1, C22:1 and polyunsaturated FAs C20:2, C20:3 n3 decreased. The average PUFA n6/PUFA n3 ratio was 1.7 and the lowest values were recorded in summer. In summer a worsening of the clot, which was less firm, was found. Environmental parameters were found to be linked to the milk FAs, while heart rate and skin temperature were negatively linked to milk yield and lactose, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3acasein 3agoat milk 3agoats 3aheart rate 3alactose 3ameteorological data 3amilk 3amilk fatty acids 3amilk quality 3amilk yield 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3askin temperature 3aspring 3asummer 3atotal nitrogen 3aItaly 0aNative goats 0amilk composition 0aproductive season1 aAltomonte, Iolanda1 aRibeiro, Neila Lidiany1 aRibeiro, Maria Norma1 aBozzi, Riccardo1 aMartini, Mina0 tItalian journal of animal science.g2016 Oct. 1, v. 15, no. 4 p.568-575dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11638x1828-051X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1828051X.2016.12476583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03887naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003300166245009900199300001600298520183000314592002802144650001602172650002002188650002102208650001502229650001602244650002202260650002702282650001402309650001602323650000902339650001402348650001402362650001402376650001502390650004302405650005402448650001202502650003802514650003702552650001902589650004402608650000902652650003002661650005102691650004102742650004002783700003902823700003502862700003302897700002502930700003702955700004002992773011603032856008103148990002303229852000903252655001203261IND60093669320221118200209.0141103e20130925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009366932DNAL7 a238721522pmid7 a10.1016/j.cbi.2013.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRocha, Nayrton Flávio Moura10aSynergistic effect of the l-tryptophan and kynurenic acid with dipyrone or paracetamol in mice  ap. 148-156.  aPURPOSE: Our great interest in this work was study the synergism between l-tryptophan and dipyrone or paracetamol as well as the interaction of kynurenic acid (l-tryptophan metabolite) and these analgesics agents utilizing a robust methodology. METHODS: We performed the writhing test induced by acetic acid in mice to evaluate the antinociceptive effect of the treatments isolated and combined (p.o. and i.p.). Dose–response curves were constructed and the values of ED₅₀ for treatment alone and combined were statistically compared. In addition, isobolographic analysis was performed and the experimental values were compared with the theoretical values for simple additive effect. RESULTS: The combined treatment with l-tryptophan and dipyrone or paracetamol reduced significantly the ED₅₀ of these analgesics when compared to the isolated treatments. l-tryptophan alone has no antinociceptive effect. l-Tryptophan increases the central amount of 5-HT and the synergism with dipyrone is antagonized by the 5-HT depletion. The kyna has an antinociceptive dose-related effect and a synergistic interaction with dipyrone and paracetamol verified by isobolographic analyses and confirmed by experimental values of ED₅₀ of combined treatments were statistically lower than theoretical calculated values for simple additive effect. Melatonin antagonist receptor attenuates the antinociceptive synergism between l-tryptophan and dipyrone. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that the increased 5-HT amount on the central nervous system is not per se capable to induce antinociception. The l-tryptophan interacts synergistically with dipyrone and paracetamol both orally and by i.p. route. This effect is dependent on the biotransformation of l-tryptophan to 5-HT and involves kynurenic acid and melatonin receptors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aadditive effect 3aanalgesic effect 3aanalgesics 3aantagonists 3abiotransformation 3acentral nervous system 3amelatonin 3ametabolites 3amice 3areceptors 3aserotonin 3asynergism 3atryptophan 2aAcetaminophenxadministration & dosage 2aAnalgesics, Non-Narcoticxadministration & dosage 2aAnimals 2aDipyronexadministration & dosage 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrug Synergism 2aKynurenic Acidxadministration & dosage 2aMice 2aPain Measurementxmethods 2aReceptors, Melatoninxantagonists & inhibitors 2aTryptaminesxadministration & dosage 2aTryptophanxadministration & dosage1 aRios, Emiliano Ricardo Vasconcelos1 aCarvalho, Alyne Mara Rodrigues1 aFreire, Leonardo Vasconcelos1 aDias, Marília Leite1 ade França Fonteles, Marta Maria1 ade Sousa, Francisca Cléa Florenço0 tChemico-biological interactions.g2013 Sept. 25, v. 205, no. 2 p.148-156dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0009-27977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2013.07.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245013100176300001600307520059700323592002800920650002300948650002300971650001400994650002401008650002401032653003201056653003201088653003201120653003201152653003201184653003201216653003201248653003201280653003201312653003201344653003201376653003201408653003301440653001601473653001301489653001401502700002301516700002401539773008701563856008401650852000901734655001201743IND60561029720221119155246.0170610e20170222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056102972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2017.01.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Felicia Phei Lin10aHighly selective and efficient synthesis of 3-arylamino-substituted 5-aminopyrazole-4-carboxylates under microwave irradiation  ap. 775-778.  aAn improved microwave-assisted method was developed for the preparation of ethyl 5-aminopyrazole carboxylates from ethyl 2-cyano-3-methylthioacrylates and hydrazine.

A representative library of 3-arylamino-substituted 5-aminopyrazole-4-carboxylates was successfully prepared to assess the scope of the method.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3ahydrazine 3amicrowave radiation 3amicrowave treatment 0aXMIVVTMMJFGUOX-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aZBFOVGKCQWWYBQ-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aSJGVEQZOFJKHLF-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aWAFGNDISKQFCJU-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aUODDXJFGSVTWOP-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aYMLHDDAHEQZHJB-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aHLDRDAQKWXHMNR-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aKTPZDKGVNHMTDC-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aNKFQQDPPRXNIRC-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aIMYKBZYSCADVBC-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aCWHYXIQAQNRSBB-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aBSDSSWJJZKLJEX-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aMicrowave-assisted synthesis 0aSelectivity 0aPyrazole 0aHydrazine1 aGan, Rowena Xin Yi1 aDolzhenko, Anton V.0 tTetrahedron letters.g2017 Feb. 22, v. 58 p.775-778dElsevier Ltdx0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2017.01.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04110naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245023700210520180200447592002802249650001502277650001902292650001402311650001602325650001602341650003802357650001502395650001202410650002202422650002802444650001802472650001402490650001602504650001702520650001202537650002302549650002702572650001902599650001102618650001002629650001002639650001602649650001202665650001302677650001402690650001302704650002002717653001602737653001302753653001802766653002602784653002502810653001702835700006402852700003102916700003802947700002002985700003803005700001803043700002803061700003203089700002003121700001703141700002403158773010303182856008203285852000903367655001203376IND60743857020221120054351.0211114e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074385702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2021.1114032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelo, Bruno Pereira1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9201-812510aThirty days of combined consumption of a high-fat diet and fructose-rich beverages promotes insulin resistance and modulates inflammatory response and histomorphometry parameters of liver, pancreas, and adipose tissue in Wistar rats  aThe aim of this study was to verify the effects of consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) combined with fructose-rich beverages (FRT) in promoting metabolic and physiologic changes associated with insulin resistance.Thirty-two male Wistar rats (250 ± 10 g) were randomly allocated into four groups (n = 8) that received either a standard diet (CON), HFD, FRT, or HFD + FRT for 30 d. Insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance were evaluated using the insulin tolerance test (ITT) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Serum samples were used to analyze the metabolic parameters and hormone levels. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α assays were performed in the liver, pancreas, gastrocnemius muscle, and epididymal adipose tissue by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Histologic and morphometric analyses were performed on the liver, pancreas, and adipose tissues.Consumption of HFD + FRT promoted a significant increase (P < 0.05) in body weight, index adiposity, and in the area under the curve of ITT (P < 0.001) and OGTT (P < 0.001) when compared with the CON group. Consumption of FRT alone increased fasting glucose (P = 0.015), insulin (P = 0.035), and homeostasis model assessment index (P = 0.018), and these changes were of greater magnitude when FRT was combined with HFD. Moreover, the rats fed an HFD + FRT demonstrated a significant increase in lipid droplets in the liver (P < 0.001), an increase in adipocyte area, and an increase in inflammatory cytokines in the liver, pancreas, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue.Consumption of an HFD + FRT promotes insulin resistance, increases inflammatory cytokines, and modulates histomorphometric parameters of the liver, pancreas, and adipose tissue, typical of insulin resistance in humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3aadipose tissue 3aadiposity 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepididymis 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3aglucose tolerance tests 3ahigh fat diet 3ahistology 3ahomeostasis 3ainflammation 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3ainsulin tolerance test 3ainterleukin-10 3alipids 3aliver 3amales 3amorphometry 3amuscles 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3apancreas 3askeletal muscle 0aConsumption 0aFructose 0aHigh-fat diet 0aInflammatory response 0aRemaining metabolism 0aAnimal model1 aZacarias, Aline Cruz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2574-17751 aOliveira, Joyce Camilla C.1 ade Souza, Letícia Maria Cordeiro1 aSabino, Josiana1 aFerreira, Adaliene Versiani Matos1 aTonoli, Cajsa1 ados Santos, Mara Lívia1 ade Avelar, Gleide Fernandes1 aMeeusen, Romain1 aHeyman, Elsa1 aSoares, Danusa Dias0 tNutrition.g2021 Nov.,  Dec., v. 91-92 p.111403-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2021.1114033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005900145245017400204300001800378500001900396520145900415592002801874650002201902650000901924650001701933650000901950650001601959650002601975650001502001650003102016700002302047700002402070700001602094700002102110700001702131700002102148700002102169773013902190856007902329852000902408655001202417IND60688074420221120162034.0200407e20200226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068807442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b048982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSears, Clara G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5421-407710aLowering Urinary Phthalate Metabolite Concentrations among Children by Reducing Contaminated Dust in Housing Units: A Randomized Controlled Trial and Observational Study  ap. 4327-4335.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDust in homes can contain phthalates that may adversely affect child development, but whether residential interventions and dust removal can prevent children’s exposure to phthalates is unknown. We quantified the influence of a residential lead hazard intervention and dust control on children’s urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations. Between 2003 and 2006, The Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study randomized 355 pregnant women to receive an intervention to reduce either residential lead or injury hazards before delivery. We quantified eight urinary phthalate metabolites from 288 children at ages 1, 2, or 3 years (680 observations). During yearly home visits, we assessed dust accumulation in housing units. Children in the lead intervention group had 11–12% lower concentrations of the sum of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites, monocarboxyoctyl phthalate, and monocarboxynonyl phthalate compared to the injury intervention group. Monoethyl phthalate concentrations did not differ by group. In observational analyses, children living in housing units that appeared clean had 12–17% lower concentrations of these phthalate metabolites and monobenzyl phthalate, compared to children living in housing units with more dust accumulation. Features of this lead hazard intervention and measures to control dust may reduce children’s exposure to phthalates found in building materials and household furnishings.  aPublisher supplied data 3achild development 3adust 3adust control 3alead 3ametabolites 3aobservational studies 3aphthalates 3arandomized clinical trials1 aLanphear, Bruce P.1 aCalafat, Antonia M.1 aChen, Aimin1 aSkarha, Julianne1 aXu, Yingying1 aYolton, Kimberly1 aBraun, Joseph M.0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2020 Feb. 26, v. 54, no. 7 p.4327-4335dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b048983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001400166245007700180300001600257520134200273592002801615650002101643650001101664650001101675650002301686650001201709650002201721650002201743650002001765650001501785650003401800650003401834650004101868650003201909650005601941650004201997650004102039650001402080650002102094650003202115650002402147650003202171700002002203700002002223773011202243856008102355852000902436655001202445IND50089590020221122033846.0150215e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008959002DNAL7 a154901582pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-004-1736-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Hong10aReductive transformation of TNT by Escherichia coli: pathway description  ap. 397-404.  aThe reductive transformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) was studied using aerobically grown Escherichia coli cultures. In the absence of an external carbon or energy source, E. coli resting cells transformed TNT to hydroxylaminodinitrotoluenes (2HADNT, 4HADNT, with 4HADNT as the dominant isomer), aminodinitrotoluenes (4ADNT, with sporadic detection of 2ADNT), 2,4-di(hydroxylamino)-6-nitrotoluene (24D(HA)6NT), 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene (24DA6NT), and an additional compound which was tentatively identified as a (hydroxylamino)aminonitrotoluene isomer via gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy and spectral analysis. The resting cell assay, performed in an oxygen-free atmosphere, avoided formation of azoxy dimers and provided good mass balances. Significant preference for reduction in the para versus ortho position was detected. The formation of 24D(HA)6NT, but not ADNT, appeared inhibited by the presence of TNT. The rate and extent of TNT reduction were significantly enhanced at higher cell densities, or by supplying an exogenous reducing power source, revealing the importance of enzyme concentration and reducing power. Whether the oxygen-insensitive E. coli nitroreductases, encoded by nfsA and nfsB, directly catalyze the TNT reduction or account for the complete TNT transformation pathway, remains to be determined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3acarbon 3aenergy 3agas chromatography 3aisomers 3amass spectrometry 3aspectral analysis 3atrinitrotoluene 2aAerobiosis 2aAniline Compoundsxmetabolism 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aDinitrobenzenesxmetabolism 2aEscherichia colixgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aEscherichia coli Proteinsxmetabolism 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aIsomerism 2aModels, Chemical 2aNitroreductasesxmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aTrinitrotoluenexmetabolism1 aWood, Thomas K.1 aSmets, Barth F.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2005 May, v. 67, no. 3 p.397-404dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-004-1736-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245009700204300001800301520150800319592002801827650001901855650002401874650002001898650002001918650001101938650002201949650003001971650002302001650001502024650002002039650002102059650001002080650001702090650001902107650002802126650001602154651000902170700002102179773016302200856008102363852000902444655001202453IND60644462620221120204956.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064446262DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-018-1770-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehdipour, V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0094-075910aGround-level O3 sensitivity analysis using support vector machine with radial basis function  ap. 2745-2754.  aPrevious research studies have revealed human susceptibility to tropospheric ozone and consequently huge amount of investments allocating to monitor and research about this pollutant. High expenditures of monitoring the air contaminants and needing for spacious facilities can be decreased by applying the soft computing approaches and new technologies. In this paper, support vector machine, a powerful approach with reliable results in previous studies, is applied to predict the tropospheric ozone for Tehran, Iran, metropolitan area. Four photochemical precursors and three meteorological parameters are assumed as predictors. The impact of all parameters is scrutinized, and the best model of input combinations is depicted: RMSE = 0.0774 and R = 0.8459. Trying to find out each parameter impact, the datasets are divided into different groups and are used as input combinations where the outcomes depicted that particulate matters (PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀), ambient air temperature (T), CO and NO₂ are the most effective parameters on the O₃ value tolerances. Kernel trick as a crucial function for support vector machines is analyzed in the current study, and the radial basis function is illustrated as the best kernel trick for this study in comparison with polynomial, linear, multilayer perceptron tricks. Finally, to calibrate the measuring instruments, using the support vector machine with radial basis function can represent an acceptable result for the best input combination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aambient temperature 3acarbon monoxide 3adata collection 3ahumans 3ameasuring devices 3ameteorological parameters 3ametropolitan areas 3amonitoring 3aneural networks 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3aparticulates 3aphotochemistry 3asupport vector machines 3atroposphere 3aIran1 aMemarianfard, M.0 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2019 June, v. 16, no. 6 p.2745-2754dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2208x1735-14727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-018-1770-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245014800208520132300356592002801679650003001707650001601737650001801753650001001771650001501781650002201796650001501818650001401833650001501847650001601862650001001878650000901888650001301897650001101910650003701921653003001958653002101988653001602009653001302025653001602038653000802054653000702062653000702069653000702076653000602083653000802089653000902097700002602106700002002132700002302152700002002175773009202195856008502287852000902372655001202381IND60715146920221122052643.0211227e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071514692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rhisph.2020.1002542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCofré, Noelia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5696-659810aSoybean growth and foliar phosphorus concentration mediated by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi from soils under different no-till cropping systems  aSoil use and management modify mycorrhizal interactions, but how these changes affect the growth and nutrition of crops under different contexts has been poorly studied. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) spore communities belonging to two no-till cropping systems (soybean monoculture and soybean-maize rotation), and uncultivated grasslands replicated at four locations along a regional geographic gradient on soybean mycorrhizal colonization and performance. At a regional scale, AMF spore richness was higher in uncultivated grasslands, intermediate in crop rotations, and lower in monocultures. Arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization in soybean roots was also higher in uncultivated soils but did not differ between no-tillage systems. Soybean growth was positively affected by AMF from uncultivated grasslands in comparison to control without AMF. Instead, there were no significant effects of AMF from no-till cropping systems. Foliar P concentration was lower in monocultures irrespective of AMF. At the local scale, patterns were highly variable and differed between locations. These results highlight the importance of scales for management decisions in agriculture and add further support for the context-dependent nature of mycorrhizal interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aagriculture 3acrop rotation 3acrops 3agrasslands 3amycorrhizal fungi 3ano-tillage 3anutrition 3aphosphorus 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3asoil 3asoybeans 3aspores 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 0aCrop management practices 0aScale dependency 0aGlycine max 0aLand use 0aRhizosphere 0aAMF 0aUG 0aCR 0aMC 0aP 0aSLA 0aNMDS1 aBecerra, Alejandra G.1 aMarro, Nicolás1 aDomínguez, Laura,1 aUrcelay, Carlos0 tRhizosphere.g2020 Dec., v. 16 p.100254-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23357x2452-21987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rhisph.2020.1002543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03797naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002100094024001700115024003500132024001100167040001800178100002500196245025300221300001400474506017300488520153200661592002802193650001702221650001502238650001202253650002002265650002102285650002302306650002102329650001202350650002602362650001202388650001802400650001502418650003502433650003002468650003702498650002702535650002902562650001402591653003402605653002702639653003202666653005302698653002102751700002302772773010502795856011202900856008103012956009203093961001303185852000903198655001203207IND60085812220221214224427.0160901e20130103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008581222DNAL7 a10113/603002hdl7 a2842242aris7 a10.1016/j.aca.2012.10.0342doi8 ans6510  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSapozhnikova, Yelena10aMulti-class, multi-residue analysis of pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polybrominated diphenyl ethers and novel flame retardants in fish using fast, low-pressure gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 80-92.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aA multi-class, multi-residue method for the analysis of 13 novel flame retardants, 18 representative pesticides, 14 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and 7 polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners in catfish muscle was developed and evaluated using fast low pressure gas chromatography triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (LP-GC/MS–MS). The method was based on a QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, safe) extraction with acetonitrile and dispersive solid-phase extraction (d-SPE) clean-up with zirconium-based sorbent prior to LP-GC/MS–MS analysis. The developed method was evaluated at 4 spiking levels and further validated by analysis of NIST Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) 1974B and 1947. Sample preparation for a batch of 10 homogenized samples took about 1h/analyst, and LP-GC/MS–MS analysis provided fast separation of multiple analytes within 9min achieving high throughput. With the use of isotopically labeled internal standards, recoveries of all but one analyte were between 70 and 120% with relative standard deviations less than 20% (n=5). The measured values for both SRMs agreed with certified/reference values (72–119% accuracy) for the majority of analytes. The detection limits were 0.1–0.5ngg−1 for PCBs, 0.5–10ngg−1 for PBDEs, 0.5–5ngg−1 for select pesticides and PAHs and 1–10ngg−1 for flame retardants. The developed method was successfully applied for analysis of catfish samples from the market.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aadsorbents 3acatfish 3adetection limit 3aflame retardants 3agas chromatography 3aisotope labeling 3amarkets 3amultiresidue analysis 3amuscles 3anormal values 3apesticides 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asolid phase extraction 3atandem mass spectrometry 3azirconium 0aPersistent organic pollutants 0aNovel flame retardants 0aQuEChERS sample preparation 0aFast gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry 0aCatfish analysis1 aLehotay, Steven J.0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2013 Jan. 03, v. 758 p.80-92dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11651x0003-26707nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/603003Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2012.10.0343Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/284224Yelena.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245006600176520141600242592002801658650001601686650001301702650002001715650002501735650001201760650001401772650003201786650001701818650001001835651001301845651001301858651001101871653002401882653001401906653001601920700002501936700002401961700005901985700001602044700002102060700001702081700001202098773010202110856008202212852000902294655001202303IND60694119220221121045109.0210506e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069411922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gfs.2020.1003752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColverson, Kathleen Earl10aEvolution of a gender tool: WEAI, WELI and livestock research  aThe Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) has been in use since 2012 and is widely recognized as one of the most rigorous tools to measure women's empowerment as a direct or indirect result of interventions from development projects. Changes to the WEAI have been ongoing and recent adaptations include measuring effects of interventions to improve livestock value chains on women's empowerment, as well as livestock related research. A multidisciplinary team of researchers at ILRI and Emory University developed the Women's Empowerment in Livestock Index (WELI), a new index to assess the empowerment of women in the livestock sector. While the WELI has been piloted in both Honduras and Tanzania, this article provides details on the latter case only. Currently, the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Livestock Systems has employed the Abbreviated-Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (A-WEAI) to examine female decision-making in various projects from animal care knowledge and practices to feeding practices for children. Additionally, the development of the Project-Women Empowerment in Agriculture Index, currently in pilot testing, may allow for more insight into scaling existing projects. This article will discuss the adaptation and use of the WEAI for livestock research in Tanzania and Uganda, as well as future uses for contextually measuring women livestock producers' empowerment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal care 3achildren 3adecision making 3adevelopment projects 3afemales 3alivestock 3alivestock and meat industry 3asupply chain 3awomen 3aHonduras 3aTanzania 3aUganda 0aWomen's empowerment 0aLivestock 0aGender tool1 aHarris, Lacey Coble-1 aGalié, Alessandra,1 aMoore, Emily V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6504-056X1 aMunoz, Olga1 aMcKune, Sarah L.1 aSingh, Nitya1 aMo, Ran0 tGlobal food security.g2020 Sept., v. 26 p.100375-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21608x2211-91247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gfs.2020.1003753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003300150245011900183520158100302592002801883650002301911650001301934650000901947650001001956650002301966650002001989650001202009650001402021650001502035650004102050650001602091650002502107650001002132650001702142650001602159650002102175650001002196650001702206650001902223650001302242650001202255650001402267653001602281653001802297653001602315653001602331653001302347700002202360700002002382700002202402700006602424700003002490773009202520856008502612852000902697655001202706IND60715147020221122041520.0211227e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071514702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rhisph.2020.1002552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta-Gutierrez, Stefanie B.10aInoculation of Pseudomonas mutant strains can improve growth of soybean and corn plants in soils under salt stress  aIn the last decades, the applications of Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) as inoculants for enhancing crops yield under different stress conditions have reached enormous interest. Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is a well-known rhizobacteria capable of colonizing roots of agronomically important crops. This work aims to evaluate three P. putida KT2440 mutants (mus-20, mus-42, and EU206), which have non-biofilm producing and exopolysaccharide overproducing phenotypes, for their potential as PGPR on soybean and corn plants under saline stress. Experimental studies showed that KT2440 and its mutants were effective in three main PGPR properties: solubilization of phosphates and synthesis of indolic compounds and siderophores. Notably, indolic compounds synthesis increased in mus-20 and EU206 strains. Furthermore, all evaluated strains were tolerant to saline stress. Bacterial inoculation of soybean and corn seeds was effective both in vitro and in vivo tests, even at high salt concentrations (80 and 120 mM NaCl). Among mutant bacteria, EU206 strain seems to be the most efficient PGPR by significantly increasing seed germination, shoot and root lengths, and fresh and dry weights of plants compared to non-inoculated controls, in in vivo tests under saline condition, mainly in both corn plants. These results suggest that inoculation with the P. putida KT2440 mutant strains is an appropriate strategy to enhance the growth of soybean and corn plants, so they might be employed for promoting regional crops growth at field scale using natural saline soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas putida 3aZea mays 3acorn 3acrops 3aexopolysaccharides 3ain vivo studies 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aphosphates 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3arhizosphere 3arhizosphere bacteria 3aroots 3asaline soils 3asalt stress 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3asiderophores 3asolubilization 3asoybeans 3astrains 3asynthesis 0aRhizosphere 0aRhizobacteria 0aSalt stress 0aGlycine max 0aZea mays1 aRaimondo, Enzo E.1 aLami, María J.1 aVincent, Paula A.1 aEspinosa-Urgel, Manuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6862-06821 ade Cristóbal, Ricardo E.0 tRhizosphere.g2020 Dec., v. 16 p.100255-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23357x2452-21987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rhisph.2020.1002553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01861naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002000180245013200200300002000332506007600352520073500428592002801163506003701191650001401228650001401242650001401256650001901270700002801289773013401317856007501451852000901526655001201535IND60539433220221207142846.0160816e20140723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053943322DNAL7 a10.1021/ja506170g2doi7 aPMC42332082pmcid7 a250039922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeatty, Joel W.10aSynthesis of (−)-Pseudotabersonine, (−)-Pseudovincadifformine, and (+)-Coronaridine Enabled by Photoredox Catalysis in Flow  ap. 10270-10273.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNatural product modification with photoredox catalysis allows for mild, chemoselective access to a wide array of related structures in complex areas of chemical space, providing the possibility for novel structural motifs as well as useful quantities of less abundant congeners.

The spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been faster than any other coronaviruses that have succeeded in crossing the animal-human barrier. There is concern that this new virus will spread around the world as did the previous two HCoVs—Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)—each of which caused approximately 800 deaths in the years 2002 and 2012, respectively. Thus far, 11,268 deaths have been reported from the 258,842 confirmed infections in 168 countries.In this study, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the newly emerged coronavirus is modeled, validated, and then targeted using different anti-polymerase drugs currently on the market that have been approved for use against various viruses.The results suggest the effectiveness of Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir, and Tenofovir as potent drugs against SARS-CoV-2 since they tightly bind to its RdRp. In addition, the results suggest guanosine derivative (IDX-184), Setrobuvir, and YAK as top seeds for antiviral treatments with high potential to fight the SARS-CoV-2 strain specifically.The availability of FDA-approved anti-RdRp drugs can help treat patients and reduce the danger of the mysterious new viral infection COVID-19. The drugs mentioned above can tightly bind to the RdRp of the SARS-CoV-2 strain and thus may be used to treat the disease. No toxicity measurements are required for these drugs since they were previously tested prior to their approval by the FDA.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCoronavirinae 3aCoronavirus infections 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aanimal viruses 3acomputer simulation 3adrugs 3aguanosine 3amarkets 3apatients 3apneumonia 3aseeds 3aviruses 3aChina 0aCOVID-19 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aRdRp 0aMolecular docking 0aStructural bioinformatics 0aDrug repurposing0 tLife sciences.g2020 July 15, v. 253 p.117592-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1175923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245013300174520111800307592002801425650001001453650001601463650002101479650001101500650001701511650001101528650001301539650001601552650001601568650001001584650001501594650002301609650001001632650001801642653002301660653001601683653002201699653002501721653002201746700002401768700001801792773009201810856008501902852000901987655001201996IND60715147220221122032209.0211227e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071514722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rhisph.2020.1002572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmadi, Seyed Hamid10aModeling winter barley root distribution in flat and raised bed planting systems subject to full, deficit and rainfed irrigation  aIn this study, we developed two new depth-decaying and depth-cumulative models for root length density and root mass density of winter barley. The performance of the new models was compared with the several existing depth-decaying and depth-cumulative root distribution models. The experimental treatments were the combinations of full, deficit, and rainfed irrigations under the raised bed and conventional flat planting systems. The two new models showed good performance in comparison with the other existing models. Further analysis based on the cumulative specific root length approach revealed that full irrigation resulted in thicker and thinner roots in the shallow soil depths of the raised bed and flat planting systems, respectively. In contrast, under deficit and rainfed irrigations, thinner and thicker roots were respectively developed in the shallow soil depths of the raised bed and flat planting system. This shows that under suboptimal soil water content, the crops in the raised bed planting system might be able to seek water by developing a network of thin and long roots in the soil matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrops 3aexhibitions 3airrigation rates 3alength 3amass density 3amodels 3aplanting 3araised beds 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3asoil depth 3asoil water content 3awater 3awinter barley 0aHordeum vulgare L. 0aRhizosphere 0aRoot growth model 0aSpecific root length 0aRoot mass density1 aSepaskhah, Ali Reza1 aZarei, Mojgan0 tRhizosphere.g2020 Dec., v. 16 p.100257-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23357x2452-21987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rhisph.2020.1002573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011200158300001800270500002000288520130600308592002801614650001601642650001601658650002301674650000901697650002601706650001301732700001501745700001501760773013701775856007501912852000901987655001201996IND60759961820221119132609.0211216e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075996182DNAL7 a10.1111/jsap.134072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmökel, H.10aInfection rate treating radial and ulnar fractures using bone plate fixation without antibiotic prophylaxis  ap. 1079-1084.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and complication rate of a 1.5‐ and 2.0‐mm titanium locking plate for the treatment of radial and ulnar fractures in small dog breeds and cats without peri‐operative antibiotic prophylaxis in a prospective case series. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records and radiographs of closed radial and ulnar fractures treated using internal fixation with a 1.5‐ or 2.0‐mm titanium locking plate without antibiotic prophylaxis were collected prospectively. Patients were clinically followed up until radiographical fracture healing was complete. RESULTS: Thirty‐two fractures in small breed dogs and cats with an average bodyweight of 3.9 kg met the inclusion criteria. The follow‐up time radiographically and clinically was 4–35 weeks. All fractures showed radiographical fracture union, and all patients had a good clinical outcome. The superficial infection rate in this case series was 0%; the deep infection rate involving the implant/bone was 3.1%. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The novel 1.5‐ and 2.0‐mm titanium locking plate system was successfully used to treat simple closed radial and ulnar fractures in small breed dogs and cats without peri‐operative antibiotic prophylaxis, resulting in good clinical outcome and a low infection rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3abody weight 3adisease prevention 3adogs 3asmall animal practice 3atitanium1 aSkytte, D.1 aBarsch, M.0 tjournal of small animal practice.g2021 Dec., v. 62, no. 12 p.1079-1084dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl45484x0022-45107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jsap.134073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245008800162300001800250500001900268520150600287592002801793650001201821650002001833650001301853650002601866650001601892650001401908650001201922650001601934650000901950650001501959700001801974700001801992700002402010700006002034700005702094700002702151700001802178700006802196773013902264856007902403852000902482655001202491IND60688074920210804000000.0200407e20200317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068807492DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b056392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jiajia10aRedox Dependence of Thioarsenate Occurrence in Paddy Soils and the Rice Rhizosphere  ap. 3940-3950.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn flooded paddy soils, inorganic and methylated thioarsenates contribute substantially to arsenic speciation besides the much-better-investigated oxyarsenic species, and thioarsenate uptake into rice plants has recently been shown. To better understand their fate when soil redox conditions change, that is, from flooding to drainage to reflooding, batch incubations and unplanted microcosm experiments were conducted with two paddy soils covering redox potentials from EH −260 to +200 mV. Further, occurrence of thioarsenates in the oxygenated rice rhizosphere was investigated using planted rhizobox experiments. Soil flooding resulted in rapid formation of inorganic thioarsenates with a dominance of trithioarsenate. Maximum thiolation of inorganic oxyarsenic species was 57% at EH −130 mV and oxidation caused nearly complete dethiolation. Only monothioarsenate formed again upon reflooding and was the major inorganic thioarsenate detected in the rhizosphere. Maximum thiolation of mono- and dimethylated oxyarsenates was about 70% and 100%, respectively, below EH 0 mV. Dithiolated species dominated over monothiolated species below EH −100 mV. Among all thioarsenates, dimethylated monothioarsenate showed the least transformation upon prolonged oxidation. It also was the major thiolated arsenic species in the rhizosphere with concentrations comparable to its precursor dimethylated oxyarsenate, which is especially critical since dimethylated monothioarsenate is highly carcinogenic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3acarcinogenicity 3adrainage 3aenvironmental science 3amethylation 3aoxidation 3apaddies 3arhizosphere 3arice 3atechnology1 aHalder, Dipti1 aWegner, Laura1 aBrüggenwirth, Lena1 aSchaller, Jörg,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1996-01271 aMartin, Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1075-77391 aSaid-Pullicino, Daniel1 aRomani, Marco1 aPlaner-Friedrich, Britta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0656-42830 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2020 Mar. 17, v. 54, no. 7 p.3940-3950dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b056393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03830naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245015500181300001600336520189100352592002802243650003402271650000802305650001502313650002502328650001702353650001102370650001702381650002102398650001402419650000702433650001602440650001302456650005502469650003502524650002302559650001502582650003102597650002902628650003402657650002502691650007502716650003502791700002702826700002002853700002502873700001702898700001902915700002202934700002202956700002302978773011403001856008103115990002303196852000903219655001203228IND60093669820221118200929.0141103e20131005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009366982DNAL7 a238722552pmid7 a10.1016/j.cbi.2013.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVacek, Jan10aAntioxidant, metal-binding and DNA-damaging properties of flavonolignans: A joint experimental and computational highlight based on 7-O-galloylsilybin  ap. 173-180.  aBesides the well-known chemoprotective effects of polyphenols, their prooxidant activities via interactions with biomacromolecules as DNA and proteins are of the utmost importance. Current research focuses not only on natural polyphenols but also on synthetically prepared analogs with promising biological activities. In the present study, the antioxidant and prooxidant properties of a semi-synthetic flavonolignan 7-O-galloylsilybin (7-GSB) are described. The presence of the galloyl moiety significantly enhances the antioxidant capacity of 7-GSB compared to that of silybin (SB). These findings were supported by electrochemistry, DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) scavenging activity, total antioxidant capacity (CL-TAC) and DFT (density functional theory) calculations. A three-step oxidation mechanism of 7-GSB is proposed at pH 7.4, in which the galloyl moiety is first oxidized at Eₚ,₁=+0.20V (vs. Ag/AgCl₃M KCₗ) followed by oxidation of the 20-OH (Eₚ,₂=+0.55V) and most probably 5-OH (Eₚ,₃=+0.95V) group of SB moiety. The molecular orbital analysis and the calculation of O–H bond dissociation enthalpies (BDE) fully rationalize the electrooxidation processes. The metal (Cu²⁺) complexation of 7-GSB was studied, which appeared to involve both the galloyl moiety and the 5-OH group. The prooxidant effects of the metal-complexes were then studied according to their capacity to oxidatively induce DNA modification and cleavage. These results paved the way towards the conclusion that 7-O-galloyl substitution to SB concomitantly (i) enhances antioxidant (ROS scavenging) capacity and (ii) decreases prooxidant effect/DNA damage after Cu complexation. This multidisciplinary approach provides a comprehensive mechanistic picture of the antioxidant vs. metal-induced prooxidant effects of flavonolignans at the molecular level, under ex vivo conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acopper 3adissociation 3aelectrochemistry 3aoxidation 3apH 3apolyphenols 3aproteins 2aAntioxidantsxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aBiphenyl Compoundsxmetabolism 2aCopperxmetabolism 2aDNA Damage 2aElectrochemical Techniques 2aLuminescent Measurements 2aMolecular Dynamics Simulation 2aPicratesxmetabolism 2aSilymarinxanalogs & derivativesxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aSpectrophotometry, Ultraviolet1 aZatloukalová, Martina1 aDesmier, Thomas1 aNezhodová, Veronika1 aHrbáč, Jan1 aKubala, Martin1 aKřen, Vladimír,1 aUlrichová, Jitka1 aTrouillas, Patrick0 tChemico-biological interactions.g2013 Oct. 5, v. 205, no. 3 p.173-180dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0009-27977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2013.07.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002800146245007400174300001600248520113900264536022201403592002801625650001301653650001701666650002101683650001301704650001201717650003001729650001901759650001901778650001001797650001101807650001301818650001201831650001301843650001801856650001301874653001901887653002001906653000901926653001901935653001801954653001701972700002501989700002402014773010602038856008002144852000902224655001202233IND60615023420221123043217.0181003e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061502342DNAL7 a10.1177/03009858166713782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamírez-Hernández, C.10aLeft Ventricular Apical Aneurysm in a Cat With Primary Cardiomyopathy  ap. 254-257.  aA 13-year-old female Persian cat died suddenly after severe respiratory distress. At necropsy, the changes were compatible with congestive heart failure. The heart was enlarged with a flabby and puckered sac-like aneurysm at the apex of the left ventricle. The apical zone showed a thin muscular wall arising from the free wall of the left ventricle connected to a bulged saccular area through a wide communication. Microscopically, the wall of the aneurysm was composed of fibrous connective tissue with neovascularization and sparse atrophied myocardial cells at the margins. A few isolated cardiomyocytes in the lesion stained positively for desmin, and the inner lining of the aneurysm had immunoreactivity to von Willebrand factor and CD31. Mature fibrous connective tissue was interspersed with degenerated and disorganized cardiomyocytes elsewhere in the myocardium, and many small myocardial arteries were tortuous and thickened. In this case of sudden death, the diagnosis was primary cardiomyopathy, with formation of a left ventricular apical aneurysm within an area of marked myocardial fibrosis and cardiomyocyte atrophy.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: C.

We hypothesized that each hotspot type (e.g. enzyme activities in the rhizosphere, root exudation, localization of herbicide accumulation) is a result of local process driven by biotic and/or abiotic factors, and the process rates in the hotspots are much faster than those in the soil background. We further hypothesized that the background and hotspot activities in soil belong to different statistical distributions. Consequently, hotspot determination should be based on statistical separation of activities significantly higher than the background. We analyzed for the statistical distributions of grey values on three groups of published images: 1) ¹⁴C images of carbon input by roots into the rhizosphere, 2) ¹⁴C glyphosate accumulation in the plant, and 3) zymogram of leucine aminopeptidase activity in rooted soil. The two Gaussian distributions were fit (the first representing the background, the second the hotspots) to the distribution of grey values in the images, the parameters (means and standard deviations, SD) of the fitted distributions were calculated, and the background was removed. Thus, we identified hotspots as areas outside of the Mean+2SD image intensity (corresponding to the upper ~ 2.5% of activity, being over 97.5% of background values) and finally, visualized images of solely hotspot locations. Finally, these results were compared with previously used decisions on hotspot intensity thresholding (i.e. Top-25% and 17 standard thresholding approaches in ImageJ) and discussed the advantages of the Mean+2SD as well as Mean+3SD approaches. These advantages include: i) simple unification of the thresholding approach for several imaging methods with various principles of activity distribution, ii) identification of hotspots with various activity levels, iii) analysis of “time-specific” hotspots in temporal sequences of images. Compared with 17 standard thresholding methods, we concluded that objectively elucidating and separating the hotspots should be based on statistical distribution analysis, e.g. using the Mean+2SD or Mean+3SD approaches. This simple Mean+2SD approach delivered suitable results for three groups of images and so, helps to understand the processes responsible for the highest activities and elucidate hotspots.  aPublisher supplied data  cGreat Lakes Bioenergy Research Centerdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100015814  cMichigan State Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007709  cOffice of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006132  cRussian Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100006769  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUSDOEdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000015 3acarbon 3aenvironmental factors 3aenzyme activity 3aexudation 3aglyphosate 3aimage analysis 3aleucyl aminopeptidase 3anormal distribution 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3aseparation 3asoil 3aspatial distribution 3astandard deviation 0aRhizosphere 0aMicrobial hotspots quantification 0aStatistical analyses 0aVisualization approaches1 aKuzyakova, Irina1 aGuber, Andrey1 aRazavi, Bahar S.1 aKuzyakov, Yakov0 tRhizosphere.g2020 Dec., v. 16 p.100259-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:23357x2452-21987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rhisph.2020.1002593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245006200163300001600225520166600241536012201907592002802029650001402057650002102071650000902092650003102101650004002132650001102172650002502183650001202208650001202220650003502232650004902267650001202316650001202328653001102340653000902351653001602360653001202376653002402388653002902412700001902441700002002460700001402480700001502494700001302509700001702522700001402539773010602553856008002659852000902739655001202748IND60615023520221123043140.0181003e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061502352DNAL7 a10.1177/03009858166713792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvallone, G.10aTyrosine Kinase Receptor Expression in Canine Liposarcoma  ap. 212-217.  aThe expression of tyrosine kinase receptors is attracting major interest in human and veterinary oncological pathology because of their role as targets for adjuvant therapies. Little is known about tyrosine kinase receptor (TKR) expression in canine liposarcoma (LP), a soft tissue sarcoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of the TKRs fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor–β (PDGFRβ); their ligands, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGFB); and c-kit in canine LP. Immunohistochemical labeling was categorized as high or low expression and compared with the mitotic count and MIB-1–based proliferation index. Fifty canine LPs were examined, classified, and graded. Fourteen cases were classified as well differentiated, 7 as myxoid, 25 as pleomorphic, and 4 as dedifferentiated. Seventeen cases were grade 1, 26 were grade 2, and 7 were grade 3. A high expression of FGF2, FGFR1, PDGFB, and PDGFRβ was identified in 62% (31/50), 68% (34/50), 81.6% (40/49), and 70.8% (34/48) of the cases, respectively. c-kit was expressed in 12.5% (6/48) of the cases. Mitotic count negatively correlated with FGF2 (R = –0.41; P < .01), being lower in cases with high FGF2 expression, and positively correlated with PDGFRβ (R = 0.33; P < .01), being higher in cases with high PDGFRβ expression. No other statistically significant correlations were identified. These results suggest that the PDGFRβ-mediated pathway may have a role in the progression of canine LP and may thus represent a promising target for adjuvant cancer therapies.  aFunding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3aanimal pathology 3adogs 3afibroblast growth factor 2 3afibroblast growth factor receptor 1 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aligands 3amitosis 3aplatelet-derived growth factor 3aplatelet-derived growth factor receptor beta 3asarcoma 3atissues 0acanine 0aFGF2 0aliposarcoma 0aPDGFRβ 0asoft tissue sarcoma 0atyrosine kinase receptor1 aPellegrino, V.1 aRoccabianca, P.1 aLepri, E.1 aCrippa, L.1 aBeha, G.1 aDe Tolla, L.1 aSarli, G.0 tVeterinary pathology.g, v. 54, no. 2 p.212-217dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl13945x1544-22177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03009858166713793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02652naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100007200153245006900225520153200294592002801826650003601854650001101890650001401901650002301915650002401938650001201962653002701974653003102001653002402032700002602056700001502082773012002097856008802217852000902305655001202314IND60743857720221120054340.0210715e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074385772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.1056902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGodoy León, María Fernanda1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1073-175810aAnalysis of long-term statistical data of cobalt flows in the EU  aLong-term statistical data was explored, acquired, processed, and analysed in order to assess the historical domestic production and international trade of a number of cobalt-containing commodities in the EU. Different data sources were examined for data, such as the British Geological Survey (BGS), the US Geological Survey (USGS), and the Eurostat and UN Comtrade (UNC) databases, considering all EU-member states before and after they joined the EU. For the international trade, hidden flows related to data gaps such as data reported in monetary value or recorded as “special category” were identified and included in the analysis. In addition, data from the Finnish customs database (ULJAS) was used to complement flows reported by Eurostat and UNC. From UNC, data was obtained considering the member states as reporters or as partners of the trade, due to internal differences of the database.Based on the acquired data the domestic production and international trade of the commodities were reconstructed for the timeframes 1938–2018 and 1988–2018, respectively. Next to the analysis of the trend of the production and trade of the different commodities, the importance of including hidden flows was revealed, where hidden flows represented more than 50% of the flow of a year in some cases. In addition, it was identified that even from reliable data sources, strong differences (more than 100% in some cases) can be found in the reported data, which is crucial to consider when utilizing the data in research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Geological Survey 3acobalt 3adatabases 3aeconomic valuation 3ainternational trade 3asurveys 0aCritical raw materials 0aLong-term statistical data 0aDomestic production1 aBlengini, Gian Andrea1 aDewulf, Jo0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2021 Oct., v. 173 p.105690-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.1056903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245006400160500001400224520207100238592002802309650001402337650001702351650002002368650001002388650001302398650003002411650001802441650001402459650002202473650001202495650002002507650002702527651001102554653001502565653001102580653001402591653001702605653001402622653003102636653002602667700002902693700002102722700002702743773011302770856007702883852000902960655001202969IND60727404720221121110611.0210308e20200228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072740472DNAL7 a10.3897/BDJ.8.e494502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFavret, Colin14aThe Odonata of Quebec: Specimen data from seven collections  aNAL-light  aThe Odonata, dragonflies and damselflies, constitute one of the more charismatic and better-studied orders of insects. The approximately 6,000 extant species on Earth can be variously found on all continents, except Antarctica. A relatively stable taxonomy, a relative ease of species identification and an aquatic immature stage has made the Odonata a taxon of interest in documenting the symptoms of global environmental change, especially at higher latitudes. The Odonata fauna of the north-temperate Canadian province of Quebec includes 150 species, many of which are at the northern limits of their geographic distribution. Quebec hosts multiple entomological specimen depositories, including seven publicly-accessible research collections. One of these, the University of Montreal's Ouellet-Robert Entomological Collection, houses an exceptionally large collection of Odonata. An initial specimen data capture project for this collection gathered 31,595 Quebec Odonata occurrence records, but several Quebec species were missing and geographic coverage was biased towards the Montreal region. To complement this dataset, we undertook to digitise the Odonata records of six other public research collections. They are, in order of Quebec Odonata collection size, the Laval University Entomological Collection, McGill University's Lyman Entomological Museum, the Insectarium of Montreal Research Collection, the Quebec Government's Insect Collection, Bishop's University's Insect Collection and the Laurentian Forestry Centre's René-Martineau Insectarium. Of the 40,447 total specimen occurrence records, 36,951 are identified to the species level, including 137 of the 150 species officially-recorded in Quebec and 2 non-nominotypical subspecies. We here summarise the data and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the datasets. The complete dataset is available with this publication (Suppl. material 1), whereas the specimen data associated with each collection are available as Darwin Core archives at Canadensys.net and will be updated as appropriate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZygoptera 3abiodiversity 3adata collection 3afauna 3aforestry 3ageographical distribution 3aglobal change 3aimmatures 3ainsect collection 3amuseums 3apublic research 3aspecies identification 3aQuebec 0aAnisoptera 0aCanada 0adamselfly 0adistribution 0adragonfly 0anatural history collection 0aspecimen digitisation1 aMoisan-De Serres, Joseph1 aLarrivée, Maxim1 aLessard, Jean-Philippe0 tBiodiversity data journal.g2020 Feb. 28, v. 8 p.e49450-dPensoft PublisherswJournal:21364x1314-28287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.8.e494503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02460naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011100163300001400274500001500288520131500303592002801618650001001646650002901656650001601685650003001701650002301731650001601754653001001770653001101780700001701791700001801808700001801826700001501844700001701859700001401876773008201890856008101972852000902053655001202062IND60119914920221117224451.0150112e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011991492DNAL7 a10.1007/s10201-014-0435-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Lizhen10aDistribution of dissolved acidic polysaccharides (dAPS) during cyanobacteria blooms in northern Lake Taihu  ap. 21-29.  a2019-12-04  aConcentrations of dissolved acidic polysaccharides (dAPS) were investigated at four stations zones along Meiliang Bay from the river mouths, to the inner bay, to the outer bay, and further to the lake center in the northern Lake Taihu during the Microcystis blooming periods from June to October 2012. The concentrations of dAPS displayed a decreasing trend from the lakeshore to the open areas. Concentrations of dAPS along Meiliang Bay varied from 1.25 mg gum xanthan equivalents (Xeq)/L to 15.73 mg Xeq/L with an average value of 5.76 mg Xeq/L. High concentrations of dAPS were found at the river mouths [5.44 ± 2.32 mg Xeq/L (mean ± SD)]. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) was positively related to dAPS in the whole bay (including the river mouths, the inner bay, the outer bay) (p < 0.05), suggesting the algae were the major source of dAPS in the water column. Five-day biological oxygen demand (BOD₅) was inversely correlated with the quantities of dAPS, but the mechanism for that should be studied further. On average, dAPS accounted for 42.2 ± 20.3 % of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the whole bay, and 35.2 ± 14.6 % of DOC at the lake center. The abundance of dAPS proved that they were a significant pool of organic carbon in the lake and would further affect the aquatic ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3alakes 3adissolved organic carbon 3achlorophyll 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3aaquatic ecosystems 3axanthan gum 0aAlgae 0acarbon1 aQin, Boqiang1 aZhu, Guangwei1 aZhang, Yunlin1 aGao, Guang1 aGong, Zhijun1 aHuang, Qi0 tLimnology.g2015 Jan., v. 16, no. 1 p.21-29dSpringer-Verlagx1439-86217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-014-0435-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02407naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245006500158300001300223520148300236592002801719650002201747650001501769650001501784650002301799650001501822650002401837650002301861700002201884773010701906856007102013852000902084655001202093IND60518330020221120224733.0160412e198702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051833002DNAL7 a10.2307/19426362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeAngelis, D. L.10aEquilibrium and Nonequilibrium Concepts in Ecological Models  ap. 1-21.  aMathematical models and empirical studies have revealed two potentially disruptive influences on ecosystems; (1) instabilities caused by nonlinear feedbacks and time—lags in the interactions of biological species, and (2) stochastic forcings by a fluctuating environment. Because both of these phenomena can severely affect system survival, ecologists are confronted with the question of why complex ecosystems do, in fact, exist. Our study analyzes the basic themes of this research and identifies five general hypotheses that, in recent years, theoretical ecologists have built into models to increase their stability against disruptive feedback and stochasticity. To counter feedback instabilities, theoreticians have considered (1) functional interactions between species that act as stabilizers, (2) disturbance patterns that interrupt adverse feedback effects, and (3) the stabilizing effect of integrating small—spatial—scale systems into large landscapes. To decrease the influence of stochasticity, modelers have hypothesized (4) compensatory mechanisms operating at low population densities, and (5) the moderating effect of spatial extent and heterogeneity. We show that modeling based on these ideas can be organized in a systematic way. We also show that the stable equilibrium state should not be viewed as a fundamental property of ecological systems, but as a property that can emerge asymptotically from extrapolation to sufficiently large spatial scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological models 3aecologists 3aecosystems 3aempirical research 3alandscapes 3amathematical models 3apopulation density1 aWaterhouse, J.

It causes an uncomfortable situation inside one building without using mechanical controlling temperature equipment, such as air conditioner (AC). Therefore, there is an alternative to improve indoor amenity by using green panel construction which appropriate with green building concept. The terninology of green panel in this research was designated a panel made by an iron material, which as a function as secondary skin (second layer) that protect room inside from direct solar radiation, and also as an attempt for green building, or as a media for liana-plant growing. This research was conducted in Departemnr of Landscafe Architecture (DLA) Class Room and its Corridor (Wing 13, Level VI). As a comparison location was General Laboratory which is managed by Departement of Agronomy and Horticulture (DAH) located in the same wing and level, and DAH’s seminar room in the same level, but it antother wing. The effect of micro climate (T and RH) in DLA’s Class Room were showed from the value of Temperature Humidity Index (THI) around 25.7 to 30.6, with average 28.1 which is categorized as uncomfortable zone. The THI of DLA’s Class Room were about 25.7-27.1 (in the morning), 25.8-29.3 (in the afternoon) and 25.8-30.6 (in the evening). Amenity level (THI value) of DLA’s Class Room after green panel constructions were changed to 25.4 until 30.2 with average 27.7 which is still in uncomfortable category. However, THI value in the morning was in comportable category. If green panel coverage’s reach 100% the average THI value will decrease to comportable category (THI 21.0-27.0). The result of SBE test shows that the SBE value has positive correlation with green panel construction. Four photos with the highest SBE’s value were the photo after green panel constructed. This mean the construction of green panel could increase landscape beautification  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagronomy 3aair 3aair conditioning 3aambient temperature 3abeautification 3aclimate 3adirect solar radiation 3aequipment 3ahorticulture 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3arelative humidity 3aIndonesia 0agreen panel 0amicro climate 0aroom amenity 0ascenic beauty estimation (SBE) 0atemperature humidity index (THI)1 aKaswanto1 aHadi, Akhmad Arifin0 tJurnal Ilmu Pertanian Indonesia.g2008 Dec., v. 13, no. 3 p.204-212dBogor Agricultural UniversitywJournal:27739x2443-34627nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245015500179500002200334520131000356592002801666650001901694650001201713650002701725650002001752650001201772650002001784650001001804650001101814650001801825650002001843650001901863650003301882653002801915653001801943653002901961700002001990773011202010856008802122852000902210655001202219IND60655294920221120122443.0190807e20190731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065529492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2019.1047412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansen, Bjørn Gunnar10aFarmer welfare and animal welfare- Exploring the relationship between farmer’s occupational well-being and stress, farm expansion and animal welfare  aPre-press version  aThe aim of this paper is to explore whether and how dairy farmer’s occupational well-being and stress are associated with animal welfare and farm expansion. A web-administered questionnaire was used to collect 914 dairy farmer’s opinions on their quality of life, working situation and mental health. Factor analysis was used to describe farmer’s occupational well-being and stress, and farmers who expand their farming operations. A structural equation model (SEM) was used to explore the association of the occupational well-being and stress with animal welfare. Animal welfare was measured by an animal welfare indicator, based on variables listed in the international standard that was available in the Norwegian Animal Recording System.The findings show that high farmer occupational well-being and a low level of stress have a direct positive association with the animal welfare indicator. Contrary, low occupational well-being and high level of stress is negatively associated with the animal welfare indicator.

In this study farm expansion was positively associated with the animal welfare indicator.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3aanimals 3aattitudes and opinions 3afactor analysis 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3afarms 3aincome 3amental health 3aquality of life 3aquestionnaires 3astructural equation modeling 0aoccupational well-being 0adairy farming 0aanimal welfare indicator1 aØsterås, Olav0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2019 July 31,  p.104741-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2019.1047413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01209naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001100138245009900149300001800248520024000266592002800506650001400534650002700548650002300575650002300598650001000621700002000631700001600651700001600667773013000683856007300813852000900886655001200895IND60658512220221118031842.0190817e20090929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065851222DNAL7 a10.1039/b914805a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yi10aHighly enantioselective intramolecular Michael reactions by d-camphor-derived triazolium salts  ap. 5823-5825.  aCamphor-derived chiral triazolium salts have been found to be highly efficient for asymmetric intramolecular Michael reactions.

Amphibians are the oldest group of organisms in which both the B lymphocytes of some species undergo immunoglobulin (Ig) class switch recombination and also have a dedicated mucosal Ig isotype. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that frog IgX would be produced in response to oral immunization. In order to facilitate studies of humoral, and especially mucosal immunity, in this model species, we developed a gavage technique for oral immunization. The result of this oral administration of antigen to frogs was assayed by the induction of the mucosal antibody isotype, IgX, in plasma by enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA), and a significant IgX upregulation was detected compared to frogs receiving systemic immunization into the coelom. These data are consistent with the view that IgX is the functional analog of mammalian IgA and mandate further studies of the relationship between IgX and IgA. Additionally, the gavage technique should be adaptable for functional studies of gut-associated immunology in other small aquatic vertebrates.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aB-lymphocytes 3aXenopus laevis 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afrogs 3aimmunization 3aimmunoglobulin A 3amammals 3amucosal immunity 3aoral administration 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aImmunity, Mucosalximmunology 2aImmunizationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aImmunoglobulin Axanalysis 2aImmunoglobulin Isotypesxanalysisximmunology. 2aUp-Regulationxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aXenopus laevisximmunology1 aMashoof, Sara M.1 aCriscitiello, Michael F.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2012 Jan. 15, v. 145, no. 1-2 p.493-498dElsevier B.V.x0165-24277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.10.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02298naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245012400165300001400289520137600303592002801679650000801707650001301715650002001728650001801748700001401766700001401780700001301794773009401807856008601901852000901987655001201996IND60096605920221116150207.0141104e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009660592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2011.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, J.M.10aExperimental study on the performance of a novel fin-tube air heat exchanger with punched longitudinal vortex generator  ap. 42-48.  aTo enhance the heat transfer of fin-tube surface, two kinds of novel fin-tube surfaces with two rows of tubes in different diameter, arranged in staggered pattern are presented. Along the direction of air flow, the diameter of the first transverse row of tubes is smaller than that of the second. Delta winglet pairs working as longitudinal vortex generators are punched only around the first transverse row of tubes in reduced size, with either “common flow up” or “common flow down” orientation. The performances of two new types of air heat exchangers using the novel fin-tube surfaces (referred as SA and SB) and one traditional plain fin-tube heat exchanger (named BL) acting as baseline in contract are experimentally studied under dry-surface conditions. On the condition of the minimum cross velocity in heat exchanger uₘₐₓ=4.0m/s, air-side convective heat transfer coefficients of SA and SB increases by 16.5% and 28.2%, respectively, in comparison with that of BL. The air-side pressure drop decreases less than 10% for SA, and slightly decreases for SB, compared with the baseline heat exchanger. The present results show that one can achieve heat transfer enhancement accompanying with a reduction of pressure loss using the strategies of fin-tube surface, longitudinal vortex generator design and appropriate placement on the fin-tube surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair flow 3aheat exchangers 3aheat transfer1 aZhang, H.1 aYan, C.H.1 aWang, Y.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2012 May, v. 57 p.42-48dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2011.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03262naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245016900165520168600334592002802020650002102048650001502069650001502084650003102099650002802130650001302158650001402171650001902185650000702204650001302211650001402224650001602238650001702254650001302271653002202284653003202306653000902338653001702347653001502364700001602379700006702395700001702462700001602479700005902495773012002554856008502674852000902759655001202768IND60776742420221119213923.0220628e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077674242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2022.1134192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Gyuri10aSynthesis, performance, and mechanisms of strontium ferrite-incorporated zeolite imidazole framework (ZIF-8) for the simultaneous removal of Pb(II) and tetracycline  aIn this study, strontium ferrite (SF)-incorporated zeolite imidazole framework (ZIF-8) (SFZIF-8) that can simultaneously uptake Pb(II) and tetracycline (TC) in solution was synthesized and characterized. The physicochemical properties of the as-prepared SFZIF-8 were characterized by various functional groups, higher average pore diameter (3.414 nm), and stronger negative charge (−30.5 mV). Adsorption kinetics, isotherms, effect of various water conditions including solution pH and temperature, and reusability were studied to evaluate its adsorption performance. The adsorption capacity of SFZIF-8 was compared with that of commonly used adsorbents (powder and granular activated carbon). SFZIF-8 showed much higher adsorption performance (429.6 mg/g and 433.4 mg/g for Pb(II) and TC, respectively) than powder activated carbon (129.9 mg/g and 142.0 mg/g for Pb(II) and TC, respectively) and granular activated carbon (249.3 mg/g and 263.0 mg/g for Pb(II) and TC, respectively) in Pb(II) and TC binary solutions. The SFZIF-8 adsorption behaviors for the removal of Pb(II) and TC were explained by the pseudo-first-order and Langmuir models from the adsorption kinetics and isotherm experiments, respectively. The regenerated SFZIF-8 exhibited a competitive performance even after the third cycle. These results indicate that Pb(II) and TC can be removed with SFZIF-8 via electrostatic attraction, surface complexation, hydrogen bonding, and π–π interactions. Therefore, by exhibiting effective and efficient adsorption performance, SFZIF-8 nanocomposites can be utilized as alternative and promising adsorbents for the simultaneous removal of both Pb(II) and TC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aferrimagnetic materials 3ahydrogen 3aimidazole 3ananocomposites 3apH 3aresearch 3astrontium 3atemperature 3atetracycline 3azeolites 0aStrontium ferrite 0aZeolite imidazole framework 0aLead 0aTetracycline 0aAdsorption1 aYea, Yeonji1 aNjaramba, Lewis Kamande1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5496-57861 aYoon, Yeomin1 aKim, Sewoon1 aPark, Chang Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0541-03000 tEnvironmental research.g2022 Sept., v. 212 p.113419-dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.1134193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03434naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100004300149245017200192520196300364592002802327650004302355650001302398650000902411650001902420650000902439650001402448650003002462650001502492650001402507650002302521650002302544650002202567653002102589653002902610653002502639653001802664653001502682700001802697700001802715700001602733700001802749773011602767856008402883852000902967655001202976IND60655295120221120215200.0190801e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065529512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2019.1056792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Souza Figueiredo, Eduardo Eustaquio10aComparison of heating block and water bath methods to determine heat resistance in Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli with and without the locus of heat resistance  aThis study found variability in the time required for tubes of media in heating block wells to reach 60 °C, resulting in significant effects on heat resistance measurements. To determine the extent that methodology changed heat resistance measurements, we compared the heat resistance of Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains with and without the locus of heat resistance (LHR) using both heating block and water bath methods. A total of 34 strains of STEC were used along with a generic E. coli which has been identified as heat-resistant and used as a positive control. The E. coli strains were incubated in a water bath and a heating block set at 60 °C to determine come up time to 60 °C (T0) and for 6 additional minutes (T6) to calculate the D60 value. After incubation, the colony forming units (CFU) were enumerated and mean log CFU/mL from biological replicates was calculated. To compare reductions from T0 to T6, standard deviations among replicates within heating method and correlation of the D60 values generated across methods were determined using Mixed model and Correlation analyses. Our findings indicate that the method chosen to evaluate heat resistance of E. coli can dramatically influence results as there was not a significant correlation between D60 values for the same isolate determined by water bath and heating block methods. The water bath method generates more reliable and consistent heat resistance data and should be used in future evaluations of heat resistance in E. coli. Moreover, PCR screening for the LHR would only be moderately useful for predicting phenotypic heat-resistance of E. coli. Considering water bath data only, LHR-positive STEC isolates were either moderately heat-resistant (1 to 5 log reduction) or heat-sensitive (> 5 log reduction). As LHR-negative STEC were also moderately heat-resistant, prediction of phenotypic heat resistance from genotype requires further refinement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli 3agenotype 3aheat 3aheat tolerance 3aloci 3aphenotype 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprediction 3ascreening 3astandard deviation 3astatistical models 3athermosensitivity 0aEscherichia coli 0aLocus of heat resistance 0aThermal inactivation 0aHeating block 0aWater bath1 aYang, Xianqin1 aZhang, Peipei1 aReuter, Tim1 aStanford, Kim0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2019 Sept., v. 164 p.105679-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2019.1056793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245011100176300001600287520184200303592002802145650001202173650002002185650001202205650001102217650003602228650001302264650001702277650001902294650001602313651000902329773010802338856008502446852000902531655001202540IND60584232320221123021018.0190523e20180325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058423232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2017.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStone, Abigail Chipps10aFinding the ephemeral: Herding strategies and socio-economic organization in an urban West African context  ap. 160-174.  aIn this paper, I use zooarchaeological data to investigate the relationship between food production strategies, particularly herding practices, and socioeconomic configurations in the ancient city of Jenné-jeno (occupied ca. 250 BCE to 1400 CE) and in archaeological contexts (ca. 1400–1900 CE) from the modern city of Djenné, both located in Mali's Inland Niger Delta (IND). IND populations are notable for their system of subsistence specialization, wherein self-ascribed ethnic groups identify strongly with specific subsistence regimes. This organization is a successful response to the area's unpredictability and, as such, exerts strong influence on interpretations of many IND archaeological contexts. In particular, scholars have invoked subsistence specialization as a possible underlying explanation for the distinctive social and political organization found at Jenné-jeno, most notably in Rod McIntosh's Pulse Model. Data from osteometric and isotopic (87Sr/86Sr) analysis of domestic herd animals, however, suggest that subsistence regimes were much more diversified at Jenné-jeno and neighboring sites, and that ethnically-linked subsistence specialization may have emerged in this area only as part of a broad social, political, and settlement pattern reorganization coincident with Jenné-jeno's abandonment. I argue that despite facing broadly similar climatic uncertainty over the past two millennia, populations in and around Jenné-jeno adopted shifting social and economic strategies, with new approaches emerging in the face of specific environmental challenges and changing social contexts. This study joins others in showing the extent to which ancient urban centers are the product of their local environmental and sociopolitical settings, rather than conforming to expected models of urban configurations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3afood production 3aherding 3amodels 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3apolitics 3ariver deltas 3asocioeconomics 3auncertainty 3aMali0 tQuaternary international.g2018 Mar. 25, v. 471 p.160-174dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2017.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01332naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094024002200120024001900142040001800161100001700179245012800196300001800324506007600342520020100418592002800619506003700647650002700684650002300711650002300734650001300757700002400770773013000794856007300924852000900997655001201006IND60658512420221207120120.0190817e20090929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065851242DNAL7 a10.1039/b914843d2doi7 aPMC27567142pmcid7 a197871082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAng, Wee Han10aFunctional consequence of plasmid DNA modified site-specifically with 7-deaza-deoxyadenosine at a single, programmable site  ap. 5820-5822.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aReplacement of a single dA nucleotide positioned at a programmed site in a DNA plasmid with its 7-deaza-analog is described together with its complete resistance to restriction enzymatic cleavage.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achemical communication 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3aplasmids1 aLippard, Stephen J.0 tChemical communications.g2009 Sept. 29, , no. 39 p.5820-5822dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b914843d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245013000168506002800298520171500326592002802041506003702069650002202106650002002128650001802148650001302166650001602179650001402195650002102209700001702230700002002247773012702267856007802394852000902472655001202481IND60775156820221207094344.0180213e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077515682DNAL7 a10.25026/jtpc.v2i5.742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiregar, Vita Olivia10aAKTIVITAS IMUNOGLOBULIN M (IgM) EKSTRAK ETANOL KULIT BUAH KAKAO (Theobroma cacao L.)

Experiments were conducted to reveal the distribution of pyrolytic products under different pyrolysis temperatures (300–1000°C) and times (5–30s). During the fast pyrolysis process, the poplar wood started decomposition to form organic volatile products at the set temperature of 300°C, and reached the maximum volatile product yield at around 550°C. The products included various anhydrosugars, furans, phenolic compounds, linear carbonyls, linear acids, hydrocarbons, and so on. They exhibited different formation characteristics. Based on the experimental results, we discussed the possible pyrolytic pathways for the generation of the major products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3achromatography 3afurans 3ahydrocarbons 3amass spectrometry 3aphenolic compounds 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3avapors 3awood1 aZhang, Zhi-fei1 aLu, Qiang1 aYang, Yong-ping0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2012 May, v. 57 p.49-59dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2011.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002500110040001800135100001900153245009700172300001600269500002300285520187500308650001302183650003502196650001202231650006302243650004902306650004802355650000902403650003402412650002502446650000902471650002502480650003002505700001502535700001602550700002002566773011702586852000902703856007502712930003302787945001302820946001102833655001202844IND2057802020221121045024.0970618s1996    onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205780202DNAL7 a88838412pmid7 a10.1139/o96-0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonnelly, S.M.10aPrevention of early glomerulopathy with tolrestat in the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat  ap. 355-362.  aSummary in French.  aHyperglycemia is of central importance in the pathogenesis of the complications of diabetes mellitus. Glucose activation of the polyol pathway may lead to renal arteriolar smooth muscle and glomerular mesangial cell hypocontractility. In the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat, the effect of the aldose reductase inhibitor, tolrestat, in preventing glomerular hyperfiltration, renal hypertrophy, extracellular matrix accumulation, and mesangial cell hypocontractility was addressed. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were followed for 12 weeks and half received tolrestat (25 mg/kg per day). Increased glomerular filtration rate was prevented by tolrestat (3.1 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.8 +/- 0.2 mL/min, diabetes vs. diabetes + tolrestat, p < 0.01), in part by reduction of the filtration fraction (0.39 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.29 +/- 0.01, diabetes vs. diabetes + tolrestat, p < 0.01). Tolrestat prevented the raised albumin excretion rates (3594 +/- 1154 vs. 713 +/- 161 mg/24 h, diabetes vs. diabetes + tolrestat, p < 0.01). Endothelin-1-induced contraction of isolated glomeruli was normal in tolrestat-treated diabetic animals compared with the hypocontractile diabetic glomeruli. Tolrestat prevented glomerular hypertrophy (1.86 +/- 0.10 vs. 1.49 +/- 0.03 micrometer2 X 10(5), diabetes vs. diabetes + tolrestat, p < 0.001) and attenuated the accumulation of basement-membrane-like material (50.2 +/- 0.4% vs. 46.4 +/- 0.8%, diabetes vs. diabetes + tolrestat, p < 0.001). Fractional mesangial expansion was unchanged in tolrestat-treated diabetic rats compared with untreated animals. Tolrestat prevents the functional changes of glomerular hyperfiltration, mesangial cell hypocontractility, and increased glomerular permeability to albumin. Polyol accumulation may have differential effects on glomerular growth and extracellular matrix accumulation in early diabetic nephropathy. 3adiabetes 2aAmpholyte Mixturesxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxcomplicationsxpathology. 2aDiabetic Nephropathiesxprevention & control 2aKidney Glomerulusxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aMale 2aNaphthalenesxtherapeutic use 2aPolymersxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSciatic Nervexmetabolism1 aZhou, X.P.1 aHuang, J.T.1 aWhiteside, C.I.0 tBiochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire.g1996, v. 74, no. 3 p.355-362x0829-82117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/o96-0383Available from publisher's Web site  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02901naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002500110040001800135100001600153245008800169300001600257500002300273520110400296650002101400650001201421650003201433650003401465650003201499650004401531650003101575650003101606650001901637650002101656650002901677650003601706650003601742650003301778650003101811650002601842650001801868650003301886650003401919650002701953650000901980650001701989650003702006700001302043700002102056773011702077852000902194856007502203930003302278945001302311946001102324655001202335IND2057602620221121045056.0970610s1996    onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205760262DNAL7 a92134392pmid7 a10.1139/o96-0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUṣā, Sa.10aMitogenic stimulation of primary cultures of lung epithelial cells by linoleic acid  ap. 289-293.  aSummary in French.  aThe role of linoleic acid (18:2 n-6) in stimulating proliferation of normal lung epithelial cells in vitro is investigated. When 18:2 n-6 is present with insulin (I) and cholera toxin (CT), growth is stimulated synergistically. In the presence of indomethacin (10 micromolar), an inhibition of proliferation is observed in I, CT, and 18:2 n-6, which can be reversed by the addition of exogenous prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Incorporation of [14C] 18:2 n-6 with lipid-independent I,CT, and cortisol and lipid-dependent I,CT, and 18:2 n-6 conditions suggests differences in mobilization of 18:2 n-6 from the phospholipid (PL) fractions between 2 and 8 days. The decline of [14C] 18:2 n-6 in PL fractions with lipid-dependent condition suggests that free 18:2 n-6 may be available for metabolism by the cyclooxygenase pathway. In non-proliferative cultures, an accumulation of the label in the PL fraction is observed. Proliferation in lipid-dependent conditions appears to be due to the mobilization of 18:2 n-6 whereas proliferation in lipid-independent conditions appears to be independently controlled. 3alipid metabolism 2aAnimals 2aCell Divisionxdrug effects 2aCells, Culturedxdrug effects 2aCholera Toxinxpharmacology 2aCulture Media, Serum-Freexpharmacology 2aDietary Fatsxpharmacology 2aDinoprostonexpharmacology 2aDrug Synergism 2aEpithelial Cells 2aEpitheliumxdrug effects 2aGrowth Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aGrowth Substancesxpharmacology 2aHydrocortisonexpharmacology 2aIndomethacinxpharmacology 2aInsulinxpharmacology 2aLinoleic Acid 2aLinoleic Acidsxpharmacology 2aLungxcytologyxdrug effects. 2aMitogensxpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSpecific Pathogen-Free Organisms1 aMaya, A.1 aBalakrishnan, A.0 tBiochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire.g1996, v. 74, no. 2 p.289-293x0829-82117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/o96-0313Available from publisher's Web site  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle03420naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245005300147300001800200500001500218520164000233650001001873650001501883650002201898650002001920650000901940650001001949650001301959650001201972650001401984650001101998650001602009650001202025650001402037650002202051650001702073650001702090650001002107650002002117650000902137650002302146650002202169650003102191650001602222650004702238650001202285650001602297650002102313650001102334650001802345650000902363650002202372650001602394650003302410650002402443650002102467653002102488653001002509653001902519700001802538773008602556852000902642930003302651945001302684946001302697655001202710IND2332350820221120200145.0030501e200211  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233235082DNAL7 a124622472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrocker, A.W.10aGenetic and nutritional effects on swine excreta  ap. 2809-2816.  a2019-12-05  aThe objective of this study was to investigate genetic and nutritional effects on swine excreta. Two studies were used. Study I was a 3 x 2 x 2 factorial design with three genetic groups, two diets, and two sexes. Genetic groups were a maternal line (WL), paternal line (BL) and their F1 progeny. Corn-soybean meal diets with either 18 or 14% CP, differing only by substitution of soybean meal for corn, were used in both studies. Study II was a 2 x 2 factorial design with two genetic groups and two diets. High testosterone (D2) and low testosterone (D1) Duroc lines were used. Solid and liquid wastes were collected for 3 d. A total of 108 pens in Study I and 50 pens in Study II were sampled twice. Total excreta were measured and samples collected for chemical analysis of N, NH3N, P, Ca, Cu, K, Zn, and Fe. Measures were adjusted for pig weight and feed disappearance. Maternal-line pigs excreted significantly less P, Ca, Cu, Zn, and Fe than F1 or BL pigs and numerically smaller quantities of all nutrients than BL pigs. In study II, differences were found between lines of the same breed. Line D2 pigs had greater output of P, Ca, and Cu (P < 0.05) than D1 pigs and numerically larger quantities of all other nutrients except NH3N and Fe. Pigs fed 14% CP excreted less N, NH3N, and K (P < 0.01) in both studies and excreted significantly less P in Study I. Pigs on a 14% CP diet excreted numerically smaller amounts of all nutrients in both studies except Ca in Study II. In Study I, gilts excreted smaller (P < 0.05) amounts of all nutrients than barrows.

All animals were allocated to open sheds. In Exp. 1, one group of males was under natural photoperiod (CG; n = 7); the second group was submitted to 2.5 mo of long days followed by the insertion of two s.c. melatonin implants (LD+MEL; n = 7); the third group was subjected only to 2.5 mo of long days (LD; n = 7). Testicular weight was measured every 2 wk. Plasma testosterone concentrations were determined weekly. A treatment x time interaction was detected (P < 0.001) for testicular weight and plasma testosterone concentration. In the LD+MEL and LD groups, testicular size and plasma testosterone levels varied in a similar way, but differed from those observed in CG (P < 0.001). In this latter group, testicular weight displayed seasonal variations and peaked in June, whereas in treated groups this peak occurred in March. In CG, testosterone varied in a seasonal manner and plasma concentrations increased in June and remained elevated throughout the study. In experimental groups, testosterone increased in February and peaked in March. In Exp. 2, one group of males was left under natural photoperiod (CG, n = 5) and the other one was submitted to 2.5 mo of artificially long days (LD, n = 4). On March 16, two control and two treated males were put in contact with 20 and 19 females, respectively. Sexual behavior of the bucks was observed during the 5 d following male introduction. Progesterone assays and estrous behavior were used to determine ovarian and behavioral responses of the females to teasing. The anogenital sniffing, nudging, and mount instances registered in LD-treated males were greater than those observed in CG (P < 0.05). Of the does exposed to CG, none ovulated and only two of 20 females displayed estrous behavior. All does in contact with LD-treated males ovulated and showed at least one estrous behavior during the 15 d following joining (P < 0.001). These results indicate that the sexual activity of male goats from subtropical latitudes can be induced using only artificially long days. In addition, males treated in this way are capable of stimulating sexual activity in anovulatory females by the male effect. 3agoats 3aanestrus 3asexual behavior 3aphotoperiod 3amelatonin 3atestes 3ablood chemistry 3atestosterone 3aweight 3aduration 3aseasonal variation 3aprogesterone 3aestrus 3aovulation 3afemales 3amales 2aAnimals 2aAnovulationxtherapyxveterinary. 2aEstrusxphysiology 2aFemale 2aGoatsxphysiology 2aLactation 2aMale 2aMelatoninxpharmacology 2aOrgan Size 2aPhotoperiod 2aSeasons 2aSexual Behavior, Animal 2aTestisxanatomy & histology 2aTestosteronexblood1 aFlores, J.A.1 aVeliz, F.G.1 aHernandez, H.F.1 aDuarte, G.1 aVielma, J.1 aPoindron, P.1 aChemineau, P.1 aMalpaux, B.0 tJournal of animal science.g2002 Nov., v. 80, no. 11 p.2780-2786x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03745naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245009700148300001800245520209300263650001002356650001002366650002002376650001302396650001602409650002102425650002502446650002002471650001602491650002002507650001802527650001602545650001202561650004302573650002802616650003802644650004202682650004602724650002402770650002202794650002102816650001102837650002102848650002202869650000902891650002202900650005602922700001902978700001702997773008503014852000903099930003303108945001303141946001303154655001203167IND2331961020221120184557.0030414e200208  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233196102DNAL7 a122113782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVillalba, J.J.10aInfluence of macronutrients and activated charcoal on intake of sagebrush by sheep and goats  ap. 2099-2109.  aWe determined if supplemental macronutrients or activated charcoal influenced intake of sagebrush, a shrub that contains terpenes. Sheep (lambs 3 mo age, 33 kg) and goats (kids 5 mo age, 28 kg) were fed supplements high in energy, high in protein, or offered a choice between the two supplements before and after receiving sagebrush for 4 h/d. The effect of activated charcoal, a compound that reduces bioavailability of toxins, was assessed by offering charcoal mixed with a carrier or the carrier alone while animals consumed sagebrush for 4 h/d. The effects of supplemental macronutrients were tested before and after charcoal supplementation. Activated charcoal did not increase intake of sagebrush by sheep or goats (P > 0.05), but supplemental macronutrients influenced intake of sagebrush by both species (P < 0.05). Intake of sagebrush was markedly higher for animals fed the high-protein supplement than for animals fed the high-energy supplement (P < 0.05). Lambs (before and after charcoal supplementation) and kids (after charcoal supplementation) offered a choice between the two supplements used sagebrush at levels comparable to animals supplemented with protein. They consumed more CP than animals fed the high-energy supplement and more ME than lambs fed the high-protein supplement (P < 0.05). Thus, providing a choice between supplements enhanced intake of sagebrush and enabled animals to achieve a more balanced intake of macronutrients. Preference for supplement and sagebrush also depended on an animal's immediate past history with a supplement. Sheep and goats previously fed the high-energy or the high-protein supplement preferred, respectively, the high-protein or the high-energy supplement when given a choice (P < 0.05). The changes in preference for supplement caused a decreased intake of sagebrush by groups that preferred the energy concentrate, and an increased intake of sagebrush by groups that preferred the protein concentrate. Thus, supplements of different energy and protein densities consistently altered intake of sagebrush by sheep and goats. 3asheep 3agoats 3anutrient intake 3acharcoal 3afeed intake 3afeed supplements 3aArtemisia tridentata 3abioavailability 3aphytotoxins 3adietary protein 3aenergy intake 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aArtemisiaxadverse effectsxchemistry. 2aBiological Availability 2aCharcoalxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Supplements 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aFood Preferences 2aGoatsxphysiology 2aMale 2aSheepxphysiology 2aTerpenesxadministration & dosagexadverse effects.1 aProvenza, F.D.1 aBanner, R.E.0 tJournal of animal science.g2002 Aug., v. 80, no. 8 p.2099-2109x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03211naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245011100146300001800257500001500275520163500290650002201925650001601947650002401963650001701987650001602004650001902020650001802039650001202057650001702069650002202086650001202108650003102120650001302151650003402164650002102198650001102219650001102230650000902241650002002250650002002270650004502290650001002335653001702345653001602362653002402378700001602402700001602418700001702434700001702451773008502468852000902553930003302562945001302595946001302608655001202621IND2331961620221120184413.0030414e200208  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233196162DNAL7 a122113822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBidner, T.D.10aInfluence of Brahman-derivative breeds and Angus on carcass traits, physical composition, and palatability  ap. 2126-2133.  a2019-12-05  aSteers were generated from Angus (A), Beefmaster (BM), Brangus (BA), Gelbray (GB), and Simbrah (SB) sires mated to cows of their breed and to Brahman x Hereford F1 cows (except A) to characterize their carcass traits, composition, and palatability. The 290 steers (48 A, 48 BM, 36 BA, 31 GB, and 46 SB) were slaughtered at an equal fatness end point as determined by real-time ultrasound and visual evaluation. Angus steers had lighter (P < 0.01), more youthful (P < 0.01) carcasses with a higher (P < 0.05) quality grade, more (P < 0.01) fat thickness, and a larger (P < 0.01) longissimus area/100 kg than BM-, BA-, GB-, and SB-sired steers. Angus steers also had a lower (P < 0.01) specific gravity, a higher (P < 0.01) percentage fat and less (P < 0.05) lean in the 9th to 11th rib, and steaks aged for 10 d were more tender (P < 0.01) than steaks from Brahman-derivative sired steers. The BM- and BA-sired steers had lighter (P < 0.01), more youthful (P < 0.05) carcasses, and smaller (P < 0.01) longissimus area than GB- and SB-sired steers. The 9th to 11th rib section from the BM- and BA-sired steers had less lean and more bone (P < 0.01) than GB- and SB-sired steers. The BA-sired steers had more (P < 0.01) marbling and a higher (P < 0.05) quality grade than BM-sired steers. The SB-sired steers had heavier (P < 0.01) carcasses than the GB-sired steers. There were no differences in shear force for steaks aged for 3 d for any of the breed types, but with 10 d of aging, steaks from Angus steers were more tender, possibly indicating that steaks of Brahman-derivative breeds aged at a slower rate than those from Angus. 3abreed differences 3ameat grades 3adressing percentage 3abeef quality 3abeef cattle 3acarcass weight 3afat thickness 3aBrahman 3apalatability 2aAgingxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aBody Compositionxgenetics 2aBreeding 2aCattlexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMeatxstandards 2aModels, Genetic 2aMuscle, Skeletalxchemistryxphysiology. 2aTaste 0ameat quality 0abeef breeds 0acarcass composition1 aWyatt, W.E.1 aHumes, P.E.1 aFranke, D.E.1 aBlouin, D.C.0 tJournal of animal science.g2002 Aug., v. 80, no. 8 p.2126-2133x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03129naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245009600147300001800243520178400261650000902045650001402054650001102068650001402079650001302093650002302106650004702129650001202176650001402188650003702202650001102239650001602250650003602266650002502302650002902327650001102356650001402367650003502381650003902416653002302455700001602478773008502494852000902579930003302588945001302621946001302634655001202647IND2331962020221120184428.0030414e200208  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233196202DNAL7 a122113842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDourmad, J.Y.10aDietary lysine and threonine requirements of the pregnant sow estimated by nitrogen balance  ap. 2144-2150.  aTwo experiments were conducted to determine the lysine and threonine requirements of gestating sows. In the first experiment, four levels of lysine (0.34, 0.42, 0.48, and 0.56% crude lysine, and 0.24, 0.31, 0.38, and 0.45% standardized ileal digestible lysine) were compared in eight multiparous Large White sows. Each sow received successively the four diets according to a Latin-square experimental design. Nitrogen balance was measured over 11 d after a 10-d period of adaptation to the experimental diet. In the second experiment, four threonine/lysine ratios (0.63, 0.73, 0.80, and 0.89 on a crude basis and 0.61, 0.71, 0.77, and 0.87 on a standardized ileal digestible amino acid basis) were compared in 16 multiparous sows, according to a Latin-square experimental design. The standardized ileal digestibility of amino acids in the experimental diets was determined with ileo-rectal anastomized growing pigs. In the first experiment, nitrogen retention was affected by lysine supply (linear, P < 0.001; quadratic, P < 0.04). Nitrogen retention was lowest for treatment 1 (8.0 g/d) and highest for treatments 3 and 4 that did not differ. Nitrogen retention plateaued at 14.7 g/d in sows consuming 10.5 g/d of digestible lysine. The maintenance requirement for digestible lysine was calculated to be 27 mg/kg BW(0.75) with an efficiency of utilization of digestible lysine above maintenance at 59%. In the second experiment, nitrogen retention was affected (P < 0.03) by the threonine:lysine ratio. It was lower for the lowest threonine:lysine ratio (0.63) than for the other three treatments that did not differ among each other. These results indicate that the optimal standardized digestible threonine:lysine ratio appears to be about 0.71 for multiparous gestating sows. 3asows 3apregnancy 3alysine 3athreonine 3anitrogen 3adigestible protein 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aDigestion 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aLitter Size 2aLysinexadministration & dosage 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aNutritional Requirements 2aParity 2aPregnancy 2aSwinexmetabolismxphysiology. 2aThreoninexadministration & dosage 0anitrogen retention1 aEtienne, M.0 tJournal of animal science.g2002 Aug., v. 80, no. 8 p.2144-2150x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02434naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245005500147300001600202500002400218520104600242650001101288650002001299650001501319650001801334650001901352650002301371650002001394650001401414650001201428650001701440650001301457650005201470650002401522650002201546650005701568650006101625650004701686650002401733653001201757700001801769700001701787773006801804852000901872930003301881945001301914946001301927655001201940IND2048045420221120184448.0950929e199504  pau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204804542DNAL7 a76776632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWakenell, P.S.10aIn ovo pathogenicity of Mycoplasma iners strain Oz  ap. 390-397.  aSummary in Spanish.  aEmbryonating chicken eggs were inoculated with the type strain (PG30) of Mycoplasma iners and with an additional strain of this species designated Oz. Marked gross and histopathologic lesions were observed in the embryos inoculated with strain Oz but not in those infected with strain PG30. Gross lesions were manifested by an enlargement of one or more joints that often contained a caseous exudate, both in the joint space and periarticularly. In the order of frequency, the most common lesions were found in the following joints: tibiotarsal, distal humoral, proximal humoral, femoral, mandibular, tibiofemoral, and phalangial. Similar caseous foci were also seen in the liver and, rarely, in the heart. Histologically, the most prominent lesion found in the joints and viscera was a multifocal caseous necrosis accompanied by the formation of granulomas. Many joints had progression of the inflammatory cells outward from the joint spaces along the periosteal surfaces, and the articular cartilages contained erosions and focal necrosis. 3achicks 3aembryo (animal) 3aMycoplasma 3apathogenicity 3ahistopathology 3astrain differences 3ajoints (animal) 3amortality 2aAnimals 2aChick Embryo 2aChickens 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gelxveterinary 2aHindlimbxpathology 2aJointsxpathology 2aMycoplasmaxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aMycoplasma Infectionsxmortalityxpathologyxveterinary. 2aPoultry Diseasesxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aSpecies Specificity 0alesions1 aDaMassa, A.J.1 aYamamoto, R.0 tAvian diseases.g1995 , v. 39, no. 2 p.390-397x0005-20867nnas  aDNAL  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle03555naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245010300143300001400246500002400260500001500284520182500299650001002124650001902134650001002153650002702163650001002190650001202200650001002212650001102222650001202233650000902245650001302254650001002267650002202277650002502299650001202324650002402336650002502360650002402385650002402409650002402433650001102457650002402468650003602492650002402528650002102552650005102573650005302624650002502677650001702702653002702719700001602746700002102762773006602783852000902849930003302858945001302891946001302904655001202917IND2047685620221120184616.0950911e199501  pau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204768562DNAL7 a77941912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolt, P.S.10aMicrobiological analysis of the early Salmonella enteritidis infection in molted and unmolted hens  ap. 55-63.  aSummary in Spanish.  a2019-12-05  aA study was conducted in which the early kinetics (4 hr to 96 hr) of an infection by Salmonella enteritidis in older white leghorn hens was examined, and a molt was induced through withholding feed to determine its effect on the progression of this infection. Molted and unmolted hens were orally infected with 5-10 X 10(6) S. enteritidis on day 4 of the feed removal. At 4, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr postinfection, liver, spleen, ileum, colon, cecum, and feces were removed from six hens per group and sampled for the presence of the challenge organism. By 24 hr postinfection, S. enteritidis was most prevalent in the cecum and feces of unmolted hens, and this prevalence continued throughout the experimental period. In molted hens, however, S. enteritidis could be determined in a high percentage (90-100%) of colon, cecum, and feces samples at 24 to 96 hr postinfection and in 67% or more of ileum samples at 48 to 96 hr postinfection, indicating a much wider distribution of the S. enteritidis along the intestinal tract than in unmolted hens. The numbers of S. enteritidis recovered from these alimentary samples were also significantly higher in molted than unmolted hens. S. enteritidis could not be detected in livers or spleens of either treatment group at 4 or 24 hr postinfection. At 48, 72, and 96 hr postinfection, 50% or more of the livers and spleens in both the molted and unmolted hens were positive for the challenge organism, but significantly more S. enteritidis was recovered from the organs of the molted hens at these three sampling times. These results indicate that induced molting has a profound effect on both intestinal and extraintestinal infection by S. enteritidis, and these effects occur within 24 hr postinfection in the intestine and within 48 hr postinfection in the livers and spleens. 3aliver 3adisease course 3aileum 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3acecum 3afasting 3afeces 3aspleen 3amolting 3ahens 3abacteria 3acolon 2aAgingxphysiology 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aCecumxmicrobiology 2aChickensxphysiology 2aColonxmicrobiology 2aDisease Progression 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFemale 2aIleumxmicrobiology 2aIntestinal Mucosaxmicrobiology 2aLiverxmicrobiology 2aPoultry Diseases 2aSalmonella Infections, Animalxphysiopathology 2aSalmonella enteritidisxisolation & purification 2aSpleenxmicrobiology 2aTime Factors 0aSalmonella enteritidis1 aMacri, N.P.1 aPorter, R.E.

E592-E600.  aWe examined the effect of the long-chain fatty acid oxidation blocker methyl palmoxirate (methyl 2-tetradecyloxiranecarboxylate, McN-3716) on glucose metabolism in conscious rats. Fasted animals [5 h with or without hyperinsulinemia (100 mU/1) and 24 h] received methyl palmoxirate (30 or 100 mg/kg body wt po) or vehicle 30 min before a euglycemic glucose clamp. Whole body and tissue-specific glucose metabolism were calculated from 2-deoxy-[3h]-glucose kinetics and accumulation. Oxidative metabolism was assessed by respiratory gas exchange in 24-h fasted animals. Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activation was determined in selected tissues. Methyl palmoxirate suppressed whole body lipid oxidation by 40-50% in 24-h fasted animals, whereas carbohydrate oxidation was stimulated 8- to 10-fold. Whole body glucose utilization was not significantly affected by methyl palmoxirate under any conditions; hepatic glucose output was suppressed only in the predominantly gluconeogenic 24-h fasted animals. Methyl palmoxirate stimulated glucose uptake in heart in 24-h fasted animals [15 +/- 5 vs. 220 +/- 28 (SE) micromolar.100 g-1.min-1], with smaller effects in 5-h fasted animals with or without hyperinsulinemia. Methyl palmoxirate induced significant activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase in heart in the basal state, but not during hyperinsulinemia. In skeletal muscles, methyl palmoxirate suppressed glucose utilization in the basal state but had no effect during hyperinsulinemia; pyruvate dehydrogenase activation in skeletal muscle was not affected by methyl palmoxirate under any conditions. The responses in skeletal muscle are consistent with the operation of a mechanism similar to the Pasteur effect. The lack of effect of methyl palmoxirate on whole body glucose utilization was consistent with a sum of opposing effects in tissues behaving like heart and like skeletal muscles. 3ahyperinsulinemia 3afood deprivation 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3aglucose 3afatty acids 3aoxidation 3alipid metabolism 3apyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide) 3acarnitine palmitoyltransferase 3aenzyme inhibitors 3askeletal muscle 3aliver 3aheart 3aadipose tissue 0amethyl palmoxirate1 aStorlein, L.H.1 aCooney, G.J.1 aDenyer, G.S.1 aCaterson, I.D.1 aKraegen, E.W.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g1993 Oct., v. 265, no. 4:pt.1 p.E592-E600x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01929naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001600136245010900152300001800261520107400279650002001353650002601373700001501399700001301414700001701427700001901444773009601463852000901559930003301568945001301601946001301614655001201627IND2057402020221120164545.0970531e199610  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205740202DNAL7 ano direct match2pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSreenan, S.10aPrevention of hyperglycemia in the Zucker diabetic fatty rat by treatment with metformin or troglitazone  ap. E742-E747.  aTo determine whether metformin or troglitazone can delay the onset of diabetes in the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat, lean control, fatty, and ZDF rats received metformin, troglitazone, or no treatment from 6 to 12 wk of age. Glucose, insulin, triglyceride (TG), and free fatty acid (FFA) levels and glucose stimulated insulin secretion by the perfused pancreas were measured. Metformin-treated rats gained significantly less weight. Both drugs prevented hyperglycemia by 12 wk in diabetic rats and significantly reduced TG and FFA levels. Insulin secretion at low glucose was elevated in untreated fatty and diabetic animals, and the increment in diabetic animals produced by glucose perfusion was attenuated compared with lean and fatty rats. Both drugs reduced basal insulin secretion in fatty and diabetic rats and improved glucose responsiveness in diabetic rats. Metformin and troglitazone delay the onset of diabetes in the ZDF rat. The significantly improved insulin secretory response of the pancreas undoubtedly contributes to the improved glucose tolerance. 3ahuman nutrition 3adiet-related diseases1 aSturis, J.1 aPugh, W.1 aBurant, C.F.1 aPolonsky, K.S.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g1996 Oct., v. 271, no. 4:pt.1 p.E742-E747x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle01639naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001900154245008700173300001400260500002400274520060400298650002000902650001600922650001000938650001600948650001100964650001100975650002600986650001501012650002301027650001201050650002301062773013801085852000901223856005701232655001201289IND4456040520221120164446.0110408e196603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445604052DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1966.tb00979.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aORLOB, GERT B.14aTHE Role of subterranean aphids in the epidemiology of barley yellow dwarf virus¹  ap. 85-94.  aIncludes references  aSurvival and dispersal of three root aphid species under greenhouse conditions was greatly enhanced in the presence of Lasius neoniger Emery.

This paper presents an analysis of the economic and climatic implications of the large-scale use of CCS for reaching a stringent climate change control target, when geological CO₂ leakage is accounted for. The natural scientific uncertainties regarding the rates of possible leakage of CO₂ from geological reservoirs are likely to remain large for a long time to come. We present a qualitative description, a concise analytical inspection, as well as a more detailed integrated assessment model, proffering insight into the economics of geological CO₂ storage and leakage. Our model represents three main CO₂ emission reduction options: energy savings, a carbon to non-carbon energy transition and the use of CCS. We find CCS to remain a valuable option even with CO₂ leakage of a few percent per year, well above the maximum seepage rates that we think are likely from a geo-scientific point of view. 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3agreenhouse gases 3amodels 3aseepage 3auncertainty1 aGerlagh, Reyer0 tClimatic change.g2009 Apr., v. 93, no. 3-4 p.285-309dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-00097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-009-9558-6 7aarticle01568naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001600181245012600197300001600323500002400339506007600363520036700439506003700806650002600843650001200869650001900881650001200900650001500912700002300927773013100950852000901081856008001090856004801170655001201218IND4386505720221207053201.0061231e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438650572DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.01616-062doi7 aPMC17971122pmcid7 a170856952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSass, Peter10aLytic Activity of Recombinant Bacteriophage φ11 and φ12 Endolysins on Whole Cells and Biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus  ap. 347-352.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe recombinant φ11 endolysin hydrolyzed heat-killed staphylococci as well as staphylococcal biofilms.

Despite the significance of branching for plant fitness and productivity, there is little quantitative and mechanistic information concerning phytochrome control of branching responses in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Here, we show that in Arabidopsis, the negative effects of the phytochrome B mutation and of low red light:far-red light ratio on branching were largely due to reduced bud outgrowth capacity and an increased degree of correlative inhibition acting on the buds rather than due to a reduced number of leaves and buds available for branching. Phytochrome effects on the degree of correlative inhibition required functional BRANCHED1 (BRC1), BRC2, AXR1, MORE AXILLARY GROWTH2 (MAX2), and MAX4. The analysis of gene expression in selected buds indicated that BRC1 and BRC2 are part of different gene networks. The BRC1 network is linked to the growth capacity of specific buds, while the BRC2 network is associated with coordination of growth among branches. We conclude that the branching integrators BRC1 and BRC2 are necessary for responses to phytochrome, but they contribute differentially to these responses, likely acting through divergent pathways.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3abranches 3abranching 3abuds 3agene expression 3agenes 3aphytochrome 3aplant architecture 3ared light 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGenes, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPhytochrome Bxgeneticsxphysiology.1 aKrishnareddy, Srirama R.1 aKebrom, Tesfamichael H.1 aCasal, Jorge J.0 tPlant physiology.g2010 Apr., v. 152, no. 4 p.1914-1927dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.109.1488333Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02556naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245010400123300001600227500002400243520138700267650001901654650001201673650001601685650001401701650001801715650001001733650001101743650001501754650000901769650001701778650001101795650001501806650001101821650001801832650001501850650002301865650001401888650002001902650001601922650001801938650002101956700002101977773009101998852000902089655001202098IND2061131120221120104055.0980107e199708  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206113112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoto, B.10aSoil water balance as affected by throughfall in gorse (Ulex europaeus, L.) shrubland after burning  ap. 218-231.  aIncludes references  aThe role of fire in the hydrological behaviour of gorse shrub is studied from the point of view of its effects on vegetation cover and throughfall. In the first year after fire, throughfall represents about 88% of gross rainfall, whereas in unburnt areas it is 58%. Four years after fire, the throughfall coefficients are similar in burnt and unburnt plots (about 60%). The throughfall is not linearly related to vegetation cover because an increase in cover does not involve a proportional reduction in throughfall. The throughfall predicted by the two-parameter exponential model of Calder (1986, J. Hydrol., 88: 201-211) provides a good fit with the observed throughfall and the gamma value of the model reflects the evolution of throughfall rate. The soil moisture distribution is modified by fire owing to the increase of evaporation in the surface soil and the decrease of transpiration from deep soil layers. Nevertheless, the use of the old root system by sprouting vegetation leads to a soil water profile in which 20 months after the fire the soil water is similar in burnt and unburnt areas. Overall, soil moisture is higher in burnt plots than in unburnt plots. Surface runoff increases after a fire but does not entirely account for the increase in throughfall. Therefore the removal of vegetation cover in gorse scrub by fire mainly affects the subsurface water flows. 3aUlex europaeus 3aburning 3aevaporation 3aevolution 3afire behavior 3afires 3amodels 3aprediction 3arain 3aroot systems 3arunoff 3ashrublands 3ashrubs 3asoil profiles 3asoil water 3asoil water balance 3asprouting 3asubsurface flow 3athroughfall 3atranspiration 3avegetation cover1 aDiaz-Fierros, F.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1997 Aug., v. 195, no. 1/4 p.218-231dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245012700160300001600287520145900303650001701762650002601779650001501805650002201820650001301842650002101855650002201876650001201898650000901910650001001919650002101929653003101950653002601981653001702007700001802024700001702042700001902059773012602078852000902204856008502213930003302298946001102331655001202342IND4429096420221120083631.0091120e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442909642DNAL7 a10.1134/S10674136090700662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandi, M. 10aAbundance of orchids on calcareous grasslands in relation to community species, environmental, and vegetational conditions  ap. 486-494.  aThe abundance of Orchidaceae on three calcareous grasslands is studied in relation to floristic composition, environmental and vegetational factors and plant traits (ecological and life forms). The aims are: (i) to identify a group of species that is significantly correlated with the abundance of Orchidaceae or with individual species of orchids on calcareous grasslands; (ii) to study the relationship between traits associated with habitat specialisation, community life forms and the abundance of orchids; (iii) to identify the main environmental and vegetational predictors of the abundance of orchids. A shortlist of species is found to be significantly correlated with the abundance of total orchids, Orchis pauciflora and O. morio. The life forms of the community species do not show any correlation with the orchids, with the exception of Orchis pauciflora, which tends to increase in communities rich in hemicryptophytes and poor in annual species. Analyses of Orchis morio seem to suggest that it has a high level of ecological tolerance. The most important predictors of the abundance of orchids are the substrate reaction (basic) and arid grassland with low herbaceous vegetation cover (i.e. high soil reaction and luminosity values, positive correlation with the cover of lichens and rockiness, negative correlation with tree cover and herbaceous layer). The least favourable sites were the least basic and most superficial and arid sites. 3aOrchis morio 3abotanical composition 3agrasslands 3aground vegetation 3ahabitats 3ahemicryptophytes 3aherbaceous plants 3alichens 3asoil 3atrees 3avegetation cover 0aEllenberg indicator values 0afloristic composition 0aplant traits1 aFrignani, F. 1 aLazzeri, C. 1 aAngiolini, C. 0 tRussian journal of ecology.g2009 Dec., v. 40, no. 7 p.486-494dDordrecht : SP MAIK Nauka/Interperiodicax1067-41367nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10674136090700663Available from publisher's Web site  a20091121b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01579naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245014700167300001600314520040100330650002300731650001200754650001500766653002100781653001200802653001400814653001300828653002100841653001300862653001800875653002500893700002300918773012600941852000901067856008501076930003301161946001101194655001201205IND4429095920221120083644.0091120e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442909592DNAL7 a10.1134/S10674136090700172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShirokikh, P.

They represent a new frontier with both novel targets within the cell and novel modes of action. This includes the proposed pyrophosphorylation of a unique subset of proteins. We review recent insights into the structures of these molecules and the properties of the enzymes which regulate their concentration. These enzymes also act independently of their catalytic activity via protein-protein interactions. This unique combination of enzymes and products has an important role in diverse cellular processes including vesicle trafficking, endo- and exocytosis, apoptosis, telomere length regulation, chromatin hyperrecombination, the response to osmotic stress, and elements of nucleolar function. 3aapoptosis 3acatalytic activity 3achromatin 3aenzymes 3aenzymology 3aexocytosis 3amechanism of action 3amyo-inositol 3aosmotic stress 3aprotein-protein interactions 3apyrophosphates 3asignal transduction 3astereochemistry 3atelomeres1 aIllies, Christopher 1 aGaboardi, Gian Carlo 1 aBerggren, Per-Olof 0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2009 Dec., v. 66, no. 24 p.3851-3871dBasel : SP Birkhäuser Verlag Baselx1420-682X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-009-0115-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20091121b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04076naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002900161245014600190300001600336500002400352520217400376650001302550650001802563650002102581650000802602650001402610650002102624650001602645650002002661650001102681650001502692650000902707650001602716650001202732650001702744650001102761650003502772650002402807650001402831650001702845650001202862650002702874650000902901650001102910650003102921650003302952650004102985650001103026650006503037650003903102650002403141650002403165650004803189651001603237700002003253773011103273852000903384856004503393655001203438IND4401337320221120035104.0080210e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440133732DNAL7 a182465852pmid7 a10.1002/mnfr.2007002072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Leeuwen, Stefan P.J.10aBrominated flame retardants in fish and shellfish - levels and contribution of fish consumption to dietary exposure of Dutch citizens to HBCD  ap. 194-203.  aIncludes references  aIn order to determine the contamination with brominated flame retardants (BFR) in fish regularly consumed by Dutch citizens, 44 samples of freshwater fish, marine fish, and shellfish were analyzed for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBP-A) and its methylated derivative (me-TBBP-A), and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), including its α-, β- and γ-diastereomers. The highest BFR concentrations were found in pike-perch and eel from the highly industrialized and urbanized rivers Rhine and Meuse. The sum concentrations of BDE 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183, 209, and brominated biphenyl (BB) 153 and HBCD (selection based on The European Food Safety Authority monitoring recommendation) ranged from below quantification limits to 17 ng/g wet weight (ww) in marine fish and in freshwater fish from 0.6 ng/g ww in pike-perch to 380 ng/g ww in eel. The BDE congener profile in all fish and shellfish samples is dominated by BDE 47, followed by BDE 99, except for eel in which BDE 100 is higher than BDE 99. BDE 209 was detected in two mussel samples, most likely due to BDE 209 contaminated particulate matter in their intestines. Total-HBCD (as determined by GC/electron capture negative ion (ECNI)-MS) was detected in 22 out of the 44 samples in concentrations between 0.20 ng/g in marine fish and 230 ng/g ww in eel. Three HBCD diastereomers were determined by HPLC/ESI-MS/MS. α-HBCD was the prevalent congener in most fish samples, followed by γ-HBCD. β-HBCD, TBBP-A and me-TBBP-A were only detected in a few samples and at low concentrations. A considerable difference was found between HBCD results obtained from GC/ECNI-MS and HPLC/ESI-MS/MS: the GC/ECNI-MS results were 4.4 times higher, according to regression analysis. There is hardly any data on human dietary exposure to HBCD available. We have estimated the fish-related dietary exposure of HBCD for the average Dutch population. The medium bound intake was estimated at 8.3 ng/day for a 70-kg person (0.12 ng/kg bodyweight/day). For this estimation, we relied mostly on HPLC/ESI-MS/MS data as we argue that these results are more accurate than those obtained by GC/ECNI-MS. 3abiphenyl 3adiastereomers 3adietary exposure 3aeel 3aelectrons 3aflame retardants 3afood safety 3afreshwater fish 3ahumans 3aintestines 3aions 3amarine fish 3amussels 3aparticulates 3apeople 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3aregression analysis 3ashellfish 3aurbanization 2aAnimals 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aDiet 2aFishes 2aFlame Retardantsxanalysis 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aHumans 2aHydrocarbons, Brominatedxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aPolybrominated Biphenylsxanalysis 2aShellfishxanalysis 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization 0aNetherlands1 aBoer, Jacob de.0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2008 Feb., v. 52, no. 2 p.194-203dWiley-VCH Verlagx1613-41257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.200700207 7aarticle03186naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245015600169300001800325500002400343520186500367650001202232650001302244650001302257650001702270650001902287650001202306650001102318650001902329650001302348650002602361650002102387650001702408650001702425650001202442650001202454651001202466700002502478700002002503700002602523773012702549852000902676856005502685655001202740IND4398592320221117183056.0071209e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439859232DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4557.2007.00178.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhuang, Hong12aA survey of the quality of six retail brands of boneless, skinless chicken breast fillets obtained from retail supermarkets in the Athens, Georgia area  ap. 1068-1082.  aIncludes references  aTo assess the variation in quality of chicken breast fillets available from retail supermarkets, six brands of boneless, skinless fillets without additives were obtained from the fresh counter at grocery stores in Athens, GA, and the surrounding area during fall of 2005. The samples were stored at -20C and subsequently cooked using a Henny Penny MCS-6 combi oven (Henny Penny Corp., Eaton, OH). Quality parameters of the fillets were measured on the cooked chicken breast fillets including cook yield, descriptive sensory flavor and texture profiling, and Warner-Bratzler (WB) shear force. Our results show that the average cook yield ranged from 78.1 to 80.9%, the average intensity of individual descriptive sensory characteristics was less than 5.4 in a 0-15 universal scale, and WB shear force values were less than 5.2 kg. There were no significant differences in the intensity among brands of all flavor attributes and the texture characteristics associated with moisture. However, significant differences were found among the brands for cook yield, mechanical properties of texture (including springiness, cohesiveness, hardness and chewiness) and WB shear force values. The variation of WB shear force measurements (coefficient of variation) depended on brand. These results indicate that differences exist in the quality and shear force consistency among market brands of boneless, skinless chicken breast fillets available in Athens, GA, and the surrounding area. This study is the first survey reported to evaluate the quality of boneless, skinless chicken breast products without additives in U.S. retail market. This study supplies the evidence that the intensity of sensory quality is mild of cooked boneless, skinless chicken breast products and there are the differences in the quality among the different retail brands obtained by consumers. 3abreasts 3achickens 3acohesion 3acooked foods 3afillet quality 3afillets 3aflavor 3agrocery stores 3ahardness 3amechanical properties 3aretail marketing 3ashear stress 3asupermarkets 3asurveys 3atexture 3aGeorgia1 aSavage, Elizabeth M.1 aKays, Sandra E.1 aHimmelsbach, David S.0 tJournal of food quality.g2007 Dec., v. 30, no. 6 p.1068-1082dBlackwell Publishing IncwJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4557.2007.00178.x 7aarticle02430naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245007600142300001600218500002400234520084200258650001301100650003601113650001201149650001701161650001901178650001501197650001301212650003001225650001401255650001901269650001201288650003001300650005201330650002301382650005101405650005701456650002501513650003701538650004301575650002401618650002801642653002401670653002801694700001501722700001501737773006801752852000901820930003301829945001301862946001301875655001201888IND2047064320221117175406.0950731e199410  pau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204706432DNAL7 a77025182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInoue, M.10aThymic lesions in chicken infected with infectious bursal disease virus  ap. 839-846.  aSummary in Spanish.  aThymic lesions were investigated in specific-pathogen-free chickens infected with the highly virulent HPS-2 strain or virulent reference GBF-1 strain of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Both viruses induced follicular lymphoid necrosis and depletion in the bursa, as well as thymic lesions. However, cortical lymphocyte condensation and depletion in the thymus were more prominent in the HPS-2 group than in the GBF-1 group. Electron-microscopically, alterations of cortical lymphocytes were characterized by nuclear disintegration resembling apoptosis. Immunohistologically, the virus-antigen-positive epithelial reticular cells in the medulla were more extensive in the HPS-2 group. These results suggest that HPS-2 IBDV persists in the thymic medulla and that cortical lymphocyte depletion is caused by virus-induced apoptosis. 3achickens 3aInfectious bursal disease virus 3astrains 3athymus gland 3ahistopathology 3athymocytes 3anecrosis 3ainfectious bursal disease 3aapoptosis 3aviral antigens 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Viralxanalysis 2aBirnaviridae Infectionsxpathologyxveterinary. 2aChickensxvirology 2aInfectious bursal disease virusxpathogenicity 2aLymphatic Diseasesxpathologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aLymphocyte Depletion 2aMicroscopy, Electronxveterinary 2aPoultry Diseasesxpathologyxvirology. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aThymus Glandxpathology 0acell ultrastructure 0aexperimental infections1 aFukuda, M.1 aMiyano, K.0 tAvian diseases.g1994 , v. 38, no. 4 p.839-846x0005-20867nnas  aDNAL  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03262naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245013400145300001600279500002400295520135200319650001301671650002101684650001601705650001401721650002701735650002701762650001901789650002901808650003001837650002301867650002101890650002101911650001801932650002301950650003101973650004602004650002302050650001202073650003902085650004202124650003702166650002402203650003602227650003202263650001702295653002802312653002802340653002602368653001602394653002302410700002002433700001802453700001702471773006802488852000902556930003302565945001302598946001302611655001202624IND2047063820221117175423.0950731e199410  pau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204706382DNAL7 a77025172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrimes, J.E.10aElementary body agglutination for rapidly demonstrating chlamydial agglutinins in avian serum with emphasis on testing cockatiels  ap. 822-831.  aSummary in Spanish.  aThe development and use of a stained chlamydial elementary body agglutination (EBA) antigen for detecting antibody activity in avian sera is described. Examples of serologic results on serum samples from various types of birds indicate the usefulness of EBA, latex agglutination (LA), and direct complement fixation (DCF) in diagnosing avian chlamydiosis. Results of tests on 10 cockatiels examined in clinics indicate that a combination of serology, culture, and/or antigen-detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay may be helpful when testing this type of bird. Agreement between EBA, LA, and DCF was 81.8% when testing 407 serum samples from cockatiels of unknown health status. The relationship between positive (210 titer) antibody activity and known health status of 77 cockatiels revealed that agreement between the two criteria was only 59.7%. Of 13 Chlamydia-inoculated cockatiels, seven birds seroconverted from negative to positive by EBA; five seroconverted by DCF. Only the five birds that seroconverted by both EBA and DCF were culture-positive for chlamydiae. None of 15 sham-inoculated control cockatiels developed detectable antibody activity, and none of 10 cultured were positive. In tests with column-separated IgM and IgG, EBA detected only IgM activity, LA detected IgM and IgG activity, and DCF detected only IgG activity. 3abacteria 3aornamental birds 3aPsittacidae 3aChlamydia 3aChlamydophila psittaci 3ahemagglutination tests 3ahemagglutinins 3alatex agglutination test 3acomplement fixation tests 3aantibody formation 3aimmunoglobulin M 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aserodiagnosis 3abacterial antigens 3aantigen-antibody reactions 2aAgglutination Testsxmethodsxveterinary. 2aAgglutininsxblood 2aAnimals 2aChlamydophila psittaciximmunology 2aComplement Fixation Testsxveterinary 2aLatex Fixation Testsxveterinary 2aParrotsximmunology 2aPsittacosisxbloodximmunology. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aTime Factors 0aexperimental infections 0abacterial agglutination 0anymphicus hollandicus 0aeba antigen 0aavian chlamydiosis1 aTully, T.N.

The system was applied to tissue culture and to bursa of Fabricius from infected chickens; these latter samples had been frozen for as long as 4 years. From base homology analysis of published sequences of serotype 1 IBDV, two pairs of primers, targeted to amplify sequences from the VP2 and VP3 cistrons, were prepared. The two sets of primers could detect viruses of serotype 1. The primers directed to the cistrons could detect viral sequences from seven infected chickens. No reaction was detected with RNA extracted from bursal cells of healthy chickens or from uninfected cells. The sensitivity of the reaction was equivalent to 2.5 X 10(1) TCID50. 3achickens 3aInfectious bursal disease virus 3adetection 3abursa of Fabricius 3ainfectious bursal disease 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aRNA 3astructural genes 3anucleotide sequences 3adiagnostic techniques 3atissue culture 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBirnaviridae Infectionsxveterinaryxvirology. 2aChickensxvirology 2aInfectious bursal disease virusxisolation & purification 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aPoultry Diseasesxvirology 2aSensitivity and Specificity 0avp2 gene 0avp3 gene 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/m973461 aMeir, R.1 aMolad, T.1 aBlumenkranz, R.1 aMalinson, M.1 aWeisman, Y.0 tAvian diseases.g1994 , v. 38, no. 4 p.879-884x0005-20867nnas  aDNAL  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02347naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245010800145300001600253500002400269500001500293520098100308650002201289650002801311650002601339650001901365650001201384650001001396650003401406650005801440650007101498651001301569651002801582653001401610653001801624653002801642653001701670700001501687700002101702700001801723773006801741852000901809930003301818945001301851946001301864655001201877IND2047065020221117175426.0950731e199410  pau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204706502DNAL7 a77025232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanerjee, M.10aNeurotropic velogenic Newcastle disease in cormorants in Michigan: pathology and virus characterization  ap. 873-878.  aSummary in Spanish.  a2019-12-05  aExcessive unexplained mortality was observed in flocks of double-crested cormorants located at Snake Island in Green Bay, Michigan, in June 1992. Clinical signs included weakness, lethargy, diarrhea, respiratory distress, paralysis of the wings and legs, torticollis, and incoordination. The most significant and consistent gross lesions included edema of the eyelids and periocular tissues, pulmonary edema and congestion, marked splenomegaly, hepatic necrosis, and scattered hemorrhages in visceral organs. Histologically, the principal alterations were severe lymphocytic meningoencephalitis and myelitis, as well as splenic lymphoid necrosis with hemorrhage. A type 1 paramyxovirus was isolated from the affected birds and characterized as a velogenic neurotropic strain of Newcastle disease virus. Since the infection occurred in free -living migratory birds, there exists the potential for spread of the virus over a large area, thus posing a hazard to domestic poultry. 3aNewcastle disease 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3aPhalacrocorax auritus 3ahistopathology 2aAnimals 2aBirds 2aDisease Outbreaksxveterinary 2aNewcastle Diseasexepidemiologyxpathologyxvirology. 2aNewcastle disease virusxclassificationxisolation & purification. 3aMichigan 0aMichiganxepidemiology. 0aoutbreaks 0aPhalacrocorax 0aNewcastle disease virus 0asnake island1 aReed, W.M.1 aFitzgerald, S.D.1 aPanigrahy, B.0 tAvian diseases.g1994 , v. 38, no. 4 p.873-878x0005-20867nnas  aDNAL  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle01839naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245008300180300001600263500002400279520036600303650000800669650002600677650001200703650002400715650001200739650005000751650001300801650002300814650005600837650001400893650003000907650003000937650002900967650002500996650003201021650002701053650002301080653001401103653002301117653001001140700001601150700001901166773010301185852000901288856004801297655001201345IND4443643820221117165135.0101015e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444364382DNAL7 a205328182pmid7 a10.1007/s10482-010-9464-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLear, Gavin10aComparison of methods for the extraction of DNA from stream epilithic biofilms  ap. 567-571.  aIncludes references  aThis study compares how different DNA extraction methods influence the quantity and quality of DNA yields from stream epilithic biofilms.

The lower values (cut-offs) that define hypoglycemia are 137 mg/dl for the standard method and 60 mg/dl for the Chemstrip bG method. The upper cut-offs that define hyperglycemia were 363 mg/dl for the standard method and 280 mg/dl for the Chemstrip bG method. Results from these two tests are significantly (F= 110.9, df = 1/124, P < 0.00001) linear and highly correlated.

Hens were vaccinated at 14 and 18 weeks of age and challenged orally at 24 weeks of age with 10(6) or 10(3) cells of a homologous S. enteritidis strain. Pullets were vaccinated at 8 and 12 weeks of age and challenged with 10(9) cells. The O antibody titers of vaccinated hens rose quickly and were unchanged after challenge. S. enteritidis was isolated from cecal droppings of significantly fewer vaccinated hens than unvaccinated control hens for 6-21 days and 2-15 days after challenge with 10(6) and 10(3) cells, respectively. S. enteritidis was also isolated from livers and spleens of significantly fewer vaccinated pullets for 1 week. Vaccinated and control hens were equally affected by exposure to environmental stress, the result being that the shedding rate of S. enteritidis in cecal droppings increased equally in both groups. 3aliver 3aantibody formation 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3alive vaccines 3apoultry manure 3abacterial antigens 3aspleen 3avaccination 3ahens 0aexperimental infections 0aefficacy 0astress 0aSalmonella enteritidis1 aNagamine, N.1 aTakahashi, T.1 aSuzuki, S.1 aSato, S.0 tAvian diseases.g1994 , v. 38, no. 4 p.717-724x0005-20867nnas  aDNAL  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02961naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245009000147300001600237500002400253500001500277520166900292650001301961650002801974650002202002650002002024650001902044650002102063650001202084650001302096650001102109650000902120650005902129650002802188653002802216653002602244653002802270653002302298653001902321700001502340773006802355852000902423930003302432945001302465946001302478655001202491IND2047062020221117165104.0950731e199410  pau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204706202DNAL7 a77025042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitchell, B.W.10aEffect of negative air ionization on airborne transmission of Newcastle disease virus  ap. 725-732.  aSummary in Spanish.  a2019-12-05  aFour-week-old mixed-sex White Rock chickens were used in four experiments to determine the effect of negative air ion enrichment on airborne transmission of the Roakin strain of Newcastle disease virus (NDV). The experiments were conducted in specially constructed airborne disease transmission cabinets in which donor (upwind) chickens cannot contact susceptible (downwind) chickens because of physical separation by a "no man's land." Temperature and humidity were computer-controlled at 26.7 C and 50% relative humidity, and ventilation rates were manually adjusted from 0.34 to 1.36 m3/min (12 to 48 ft3/min). Donor chickens were inoculated with Roakin NDV by eyedrop and intranasal routes and placed in the upwind end of each cabinet. One day later, susceptible chickens were placed in the downwind end. Seroconversion (greater than or equal to 1:10 NDV hemagglutination-inhibition titer) was considered evidence of infection from inoculation (upwind) or airborne transmission (downwind). Commercial air ion generators were used either in the ends or in the "no man's land" of the treatment cabinets and operated at power supply voltages ranging from -8kV direct current to -15kV direct current. The use of negative air ion generators reduced airborne transmission an average of 6.6% to 27.7% compared with the control cabinets. Significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) reductions in transmission were obtained with some treatments. The greatest reduction in transmission was obtained with the higher power supply voltages (13.8% reduction) and when the ionizers were placed in the "no man's land" (27.7% reduction) between the upwind and downwind chickens. 3achickens 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3aNewcastle disease 3adisease control 2aAir Ionization 2aAir Microbiology 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aFemale 2aMale 2aNewcastle Diseasexprevention & controlxtransmission. 2aNewcastle disease virus 0aexperimental infections 0aenvironmental control 0aNewcastle disease virus 0aairborne infection 0aair ionization1 aKing, D.J.0 tAvian diseases.g1994 , v. 38, no. 4 p.725-732x0005-20867nnas  aDNAL  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02679naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245007700148300001600225500002400241520114900265650001001414650001201424650001801436650001401454650001501468650001701483650001801500650002301518650001201541650001801553650001001571650006701581650005601648650001301704650001501717650001001732650001001742650006501752650001001817650002401827651001201851651002701863700001701890700001601907700007801923773006802001852000902069930003302078945001302111946001302124655001202137IND2047687220221123034721.0950911e199501  pau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204768722DNAL7 a77941752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOyarzabal, O.A.10aIncidence of campylobacters in the intestine of avian species in Alabama  ap. 147-151.  aSummary in Spanish.  aAvian species necropsied at the C.S. Roberts Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, Auburn, Alabama, from December 1993 until May 1994 were examined for the incidence of intestinal campylobacters. Ninety-one intestinal swabs, representing 66 separate cases and 17 different avian species, were collected and placed into Cary-Blair transport medium. Selective enrichment and culture media were used for initial isolation of Campylobacter spp. Presumptive colonies were identified as Campylobacter spp. by phase-contrast microscopy and Gram stain, and they were confirmed by serological latex agglutination. Campylobacter spp. were isolated in 18 (19.7%) of the 66 cases. From the remainder of the cases, 13 (15%) yielded presumptive colonies on Campy-Cefex agar; however, they were not confirmed serologically as Campylobacter spp. Use of Cary-Blair transport medium held in refrigeration for up to 24 days did not hinder the determination of campylobacters in intestinal samples. A variety of avian species, including chicken, emu, hawk, ostrich, and parrot, harbored commensal campylobacters and therefore should be considered potential reservoirs. 3abirds 3apoultry 3aCampylobacter 3aincidence 3aintestines 3acell culture 3aculture media 3adisease reservoirs 2aAnimals 2aBird Diseases 2aBirds 2aCampylobacterxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aCampylobacter Infectionsxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aChickens 2aColumbidae 2aDucks 2aGeese 2aIntestinal Diseasesxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aQuail 2aSpecies Specificity 3aAlabama 0aAlabamaxepidemiology.1 aConner, D.E.1 aHoerr, F.J.1 aIncidence of campylobacters in the intestine of avian species in Alabama.0 tAvian diseases.g1995 , v. 39, no. 1 p.147-151x0005-20867nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle02099naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245004100144300001600185500002400201520082900225650001201054650002001066650001401086650001401100650001701114650001201131650002101143650003201164650003201196650002101228650000901249650002301258650001301281650004901294650002101343650003101364650001201395653001301407700001701420700001501437700001701452773006801469852000901537930003301546945001301579946001301592655001201605IND2047687520221123034757.0950911e199501  pau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204768752DNAL7 a77941772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWages, D.P.10aSalt toxicosis in commercial turkeys  ap. 158-161.  aSummary in Spanish.  aSalt toxicosis was confirmed in a flock of 20,000 thirteen-week-old tom turkeys experiencing an increase in mortality.

In leghorn chicks, neither F. oxysporum nor the known TD-inducing agents (F. equiseti, 4%; tetramethylthiuram disulfide [Thiram], 35 ppm) caused TD. However, F. oxysporum at high levels (50%) and the two known TD-inducing agents reduced interdigital cutaneous response to phytohemagglutinin-P challenge. In addition, Thiram also reduced body-weight gain by more than 17%. In female broiler chicks (Cornish Rock), F. oxysporum not only decreased cell-mediated cutaneous response to phytohemagglutinin-P but also increased TD incidence; these same effects were observed with F. equiseti and Thiram. Histological examinations revealed similar pathological changes among dyschondroplastic lesions induced by F. oxysporum, F. equiseti, and Thiram. Results of this experiment indicate that the isolate of F. oxysporum from the region in which Kaschin-Beck disease is endemic can induce TD in broiler chicks and that it is immunosuppressive. 3amycotoxicosis 3atibia 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aimmunosuppression 3abody weight 3acell-mediated immunity 3acorn 3adyschondroplasia 3achicks 3ahistopathology 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aChickens 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aFood Microbiology 2aFusarium 2aMycosesxcomplicationsxpathology. 2aOsteochondrodysplasiasxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aTibiaxpathology 2aZea mays 0aimmunosuppression (physiological)1 aWu, W.D.1 aCook, M.E.1 aSmalley, E.B.0 tAvian diseases.g1995 , v. 39, no. 1 p.100-107x0005-20867nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle02616naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245006000146300001600206500002400222520102700246650001301273650001801286650002201304650002701326650001901353650001701372650001201389650001801401650003601419650001301455650007401468650003201542650003701574650001601611650003401627650004101661650005201702650003401754651002501788651001401813653001301827653001401840700001701854700001901871700001701890700001901907773006801926852000901994930003302003945001302036946001302049655001202062IND2047688620221123034901.0950911e199501  pau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204768862DNAL7 a77941852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindsay, D.S.10aCentral nervous system toxoplasmosis in Roller canaries  ap. 204-207.  aSummary in Spanish.  aSeveral birds in a flock of 40 Roller canaries (Serinus canaria) from an outdoor aviary in Victoria, Australia, developed central nervous system signs that included blindness, nystagmus, ataxia, and head rotation. Four died, and four were euthanatized. Two euthanatized birds were submitted for microscopic examination of tissues. Brain lesions in both birds consisted of scattered foci of nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis with gliosis, mild to moderately extensive lymphocytic/plasmacytic perivascular cuffs, and a patchy increased prominence of cerebral blood vessels associated with hypertrophy of the vascular endothelium and/or thickening of their connective tissue walls. These lesions were associated with the presence of Toxoplasma gondii tissue cysts. Lesions in the eyes of both birds were bilateral and consisted of severe plasmacytic/granulomatous ophthalmitis. Surviving birds were treated with trimethoprim and sulfadiazine, no subsequent deaths occurred, and no new cases developed over an 8-month period. 3acanaries 3atoxoplasmosis 3aToxoplasma gondii 3acentral nervous system 3ahistopathology 3acase studies 2aAnimals 2aBird Diseases 2aBrainxparasitologyxpathology. 2aCanaries 2aCentral Nervous System Diseasesxdrug therapyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aCerebrovascular Circulation 2aEndothelium, Vascularxpathology 2aHypertrophy 2aSulfadiazinextherapeutic use 2aToxoplasmaxisolation & purification 2aToxoplasmosis, Animalxdrug therapyxpathology. 2aTrimethoprimxtherapeutic use 3aVictoria (Australia) 0aAustralia 0asymptoms 0aoutbreaks1 aGasser, R.B.1 aHarrigan, K.E.1 aMadill, D.N.1 aBlagburn, B.L.0 tAvian diseases.g1995 , v. 39, no. 1 p.204-207x0005-20867nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle01871naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245008800143300001600231500002400247520074600271650001001017650001901027650001201046650001501058650001701073650001201090650001801102650001001120650003401130650003001164650002301194650002601217653001001243653001301253700001801266700001701284773006801301852000901369930003301378945001301411946001301424655001201437IND2047688520221123034755.0950911e199501  pau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204768852DNAL7 a75408362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuette, M.10aEpicardial keratinaceous cyst in a tawny frogmouth (Podargus strigoides plumiferus)  ap. 201-203.  aSummary in Spanish.  aTissues from a tawny frogmouth that died acutely in a zoo collection were submitted for histopathologic examination.

The cyst was composed of gradually keratinizing, attenuated, stratified squamous epithelium, one to three cell layers in thickness. The cyst was filled with laminated keratin and a few keratinized epithelial cells. The cyst was separated from the myocardium by a thin layer of adipose tissue. Based on these observations, the structure was diagnosed as an epicardial keratinaceous cyst. 3aheart 3ahistopathology 3akeratin 3aepithelium 3acase studies 2aAnimals 2aBird Diseases 2aBirds 2aCystsxpathologyxveterinary. 2aDeath, Suddenxveterinary 2aKeratinsxanalysis 2aMyocardiumxpathology 0acysts 0apodargus1 aLatimer, K.S.1 aNorton, T.M.0 tAvian diseases.g1995 , v. 39, no. 1 p.201-203x0005-20867nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle03431naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245014000146300001600286500002400302520148000326650001301806650001801819650003601837650001601873650002301889650002301912650001601935650002301951650001901974650002001993650001202013650004902025650007502074650001602149650004802165650005002213650004802263650005402311650002402365650001702389650006302406650005702469651001002526653002402536653001302560653001102573700001702584700001502601700001202616700001302628700001302641700001502654773006802669852000902737930003302746945001302779946001302792655001202805IND2048037120221123034710.0950929e199504  pau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204803712DNAL7 a76776422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsukamoto, K.10aEfficacy of three live vaccines against highly virulent infectious bursal disease virus in chickens with or without maternal antibodies  ap. 218-229.  aSummary in Spanish.  aSince 1990, highly virulent infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), which induces high mortality, has been infecting even vaccinated flocks in Japan. We report the efficacy of three live vaccines that are available in Japan. Two mildly attenuated strains (A and B) and one intermediate strain (C) were each tested both in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens and in commercial chickens that have maternal antibodies against IBDV. Chickens were vaccinated at 20 days old and challenged with highly virulent IBDV 10 days post-vaccination. Protection was determined 7 days after challenge by measuring bursa/body weight ratios, histopathological lesions, and antibody responses to IBDV. All three live vaccines conferred protection to SPF chickens. However, only vaccine C protected 100% of vaccinated commercial chickens against highly virulent IBDV; Vaccines A and B respectively protected three-fourths and none of vaccinated commercial chickens from severe bursal lesions. Vaccines A, B, and C and highly virulent IBDV induced bursal lesions in 3%, 0%, 23%, and 61% of inoculated commercial chickens, respectively. These results suggest that serological determination of the optimum vaccination time for each Hock is required to effectively control highly virulent IBDV in the field. The optimum vaccination timing could be approximated by titrating the maternal IBDV antibodies of 1-day-old chicks by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or by an agar gel precipitin test. 3achickens 3alive vaccines 3aInfectious bursal disease virus 3avaccination 3astrain differences 3adisease prevention 3abody weight 3abursa of Fabricius 3ahistopathology 3aimmune response 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralxbiosynthesisximmunology. 2aBirnaviridae Infectionsximmunologyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aBody Weight 2aChickensxgrowth & developmentximmunology. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aInfectious bursal disease virusximmunology 2aPoultry Diseasesxprevention & controlxvirology. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTime Factors 2aVaccines, Attenuatedxadministration & dosageximmunology. 2aViral Vaccinesxadministration & dosageximmunology. 3aJapan 0amaternal antibodies 0aefficacy 0atiming1 aTanimura, N.1 aKakita, S.1 aOta, K.1 aMase, M.1 aImai, K.1 aHihara, H.0 tAvian diseases.g1995 , v. 39, no. 2 p.218-229x0005-20867nnas  aDNAL  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle02052naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245007100146300001600217500002400233520078400257650002501041650001101066650002101077650001801098650000901116650001001125650001701135650001201152650003401164650000901198650004101207650007801248650006101326650002601387651002401413653001601437700001701453773006801470852000901538930003301547945001301580946001301593655001201606IND2047066220221123034915.0950731e199410  pau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204706622DNAL7 a77025292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrampel, D.W.10aOutbreak of Mycoplasma iowae infection in commercial turkey poults  ap. 905-909.  aSummary in Spanish.  aIn September 1989, 17-day-old turkey poults were submitted to Iowa State University because of leg weakness and dehydration.

Possible reasons for this include alterations which may accompany hyperinsulinemia (i.e., alterations in lipoproteins; platelets; soluble clotting factors; prostacyclin-thromboxane balance; blood pressure regulation; arterial smooth muscle cell metabolism and proliferation). Hyperinsulinemia is increasingly considered as a risk factor for AS. Further study is needed to confirm that neither diabetes nor AS are single disorders. Association of diabetes with effects on endothelial injury (as related to the artery wall), lipoprotein alterations, and arterial wall metabolism are specifically considered. The different forms of diabetes may have different atherogenic effects. Further, a variety of processes can accelerate AS. It is becoming increasingly apparent that hyperinsulinemia may be more significant than hypoinsulinemia in the atherogenesis of diabetes.

A study assessed the relationship between MCR and serum glucose concentration in 10 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Glucose clamp studies were performed in each subject at the patient's fasting glucose concentration (mean, 280 mg/dl) and at euglycemia (mean glucose level, 85 mg/dl) in the presence of a maximally-effective steady-state serum insulin concentration (about 11,000 micro-U/ml). Six subjects also were studied at hyperglycemia and euglycemia at a steady-state insulin concentration of about 400 micro-U/ml. As expected, glucose disposal rates were significantly greater in the presence of hyperglycemia, as compared with euglycemia (415 versus 193 mg/square-meter/minute at the higher insulin level, and 377 versus 162 mg/square-meter/minute, at the lower insulin level). At hyperglycemia, the mean MCR fell 34% and 36% at the higher and lower insulin levels, respectively. When the individual data were analyzed, a highly significant positive relationship was found between the magnitude of the MCR value at euglycemia and the degree of fall in MCR at hyperglycemia. Thus, the greater the insulin resistance (lower MCR at euglycemia), the smaller the reduction in MCR at hyperglycemia. These results indicate that: MCR is not independent of changes in the serum glucose concentration (indicating that, even in the presence of maximally-effective insulin concentrations, glucose uptake by peripheral tissues is a saturable process); and as type II diabetic patients become less resistant, their glucose uptake mechanisms become more saturable.

The pregnant women were compared with a matched group of normal nonpregnant women undergoing gynecologic surgery. Insulin binding to adipocytes measured at tracer insulin concentration was reduced by 45% (P less than 0.01) in normal pregnant women and by 30% (P less than 0.02) in pregnant women with diabetes. In contrast, no changes were found between the three groups in insulin binding to pure monocytes and erythrocytes. The glucose transport system in fat cells from both groups of pregnant women was characterized by impaired maximal (P less than 0.05) and half-maximal (P less than 0.05) response to insulin. When fat cell glucose metabolism was studied, pregnant diabetic women exhibited decreased basal lipogenesis (P less than 0.05) and decreased maximal responses of lipogenesis and glucose oxidation to insulin stimulation (P less than 0.05). Similar but less pronounced abnormalities were seen in glucose metabolism of adipocytes from nondiabetic pregnant women. In conclusion, both in late normal and diabetic pregnancy, insulin binding to adipocytes is significantly reduced and accompanied by decreased insulin sensitivity and reduced maximal insulin responsiveness of glucose transport and by impaired basal and maximally insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism.(author) 3awomen 3ainsulin 3aadipocytes 3areceptors 2aAdipose Tissuexcytologyxmetabolism. 2aAdult 2aErythrocytesxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aHumans 2aLipidsxbiosynthesis 2aMonocytesxmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy in Diabeticsxmetabolism 2aReceptor, Insulinxmetabolism 0ainsulin-dependent diabetes 0adiabetes in pregnancy1 aPedersen, O.1 aEspersen, T.1 aKlebe, J.G.0 tDiabetes.g1986 May, v. 35, no. 5 p.598-603x0012-17977nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19870911c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle01906naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002200115245008000137300001400217300001900231520087500250650003101125650001701156650002401173650002801197653002401225653002601249653002501275653004301300711009101343773007101434852000901505939003301514945000801547946001301555655001201568991595412360742620221123014905.0830426e198111  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI830017152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahley, Robert W.10aCellular and molecular biology of lipoprotein metabolism in atherosclerosis  ap. 60-65.  ap. 60-65. ill.  aRecent advances have elucidated the important role of plasma lipoproteins in atherosclerosis (AS) and the role of dietary fat and cholesterol in altering plasma lipoprotein metabolism. Studies on animal models of AS, and alterations in high-density and low-density lipoproteins (HDL and LDL, respectively) are assessed. Diets high in fat and cholesterol are associated with accelerated AS, resulting in consistent lipoprotein changes (increase in the HDL with apoenzyme E (apo-E) and in LDL; a decrease in HDL without apo-E; and the occurrence of beta-very-low-density lipoprotein (BVLDL)). Certain of these changes occur with or without plasma cholesterol elevation, and suggest the importance of a prudent low-fat, low-cholesterol diet to reduce AS risk. Reasons for diet-induced HDL changes and mechanisms by which BVLDL and LDL may be atherogenic are discussed.

Patients required more insulin for breakfast than for an isocaloric lunch, or an isocaloric supper. To determine whether this insulin resistance at breakfast might be due to low basal insulin levels overnight, the insulin needs for breakfast were compared after an overnight fast (day 1) and after a midnoctural insulin infusion (day 2). Breakfast insulin requirements were similar on both days. Whereas nonobese diabetic patients required approximately 60% more insulin for breakfast than for others meals, obese diabetic patients in this study did not demonstrate insulin resistance at breakfast. These findings provide a basis for the common clinical practice of allocating more insulin for breakfast than for other meals. The absence of an increased insulin need at breakfast in our obese patients cautions against a similar algorithm for obese diabetic patients. We postulate that growth hormone may be a cause for morning insulin resistance.

Glucose elicited only a small increase in serum tryptophan ratio in diabetic rats compared to normal rats, and brain tryptophan increased slightly. No changes occurred in brain serotonin or 5-hydroxyindole. Similar effects were observed in diabetic rats following a single carbohydrate meal. Brain indoles did increase after carbohydrate ingestion in diabetic rats that received an insulin injection at the same time. Ingestion of protein by diabetic rats often lowered the serum tryptophan ratio which increased slightly in normal rats and brain tryptophan, but not brain 5-hydroxyindoles. The absence of an insulin-induced rise in serum tryptophan ratio leads indirectly to the absence of a carbohydrate-induced increment in brain indole levels. Since brain functions depend on serotonin, its lack in diabetic rats may lead to abnormalities. 3aanimal experimentation 3adiabetes mellitus 3abrain 3aglucose 3aamino acids 3ainsulin 2aAmino Acidsxblood 2aAnimals 2aBrainxmetabolism 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxbloodxmetabolism. 2aDietary Carbohydratesxmetabolism 2aDietary Proteinsxmetabolism 2aFasting 2aInsulinxpharmacology 2aMale 2aRats 2aSerotoninxmetabolism 2aTryptophanxmetabolism 0acarbohydrate-rich foods 0aProtein-high diets 0aProteins, tissue1 aFernstrom, John D.0 tDiabetes.g1980 June, v. 29, no. 6 p.460-466x0012-17977nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19801112c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03467naa a2200553 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245010300150300001600253300003000269520196000299650001302259650001202272650001202284650001302296650002102309650001202330650000802342650002802350650001002378650001802388650002102406650002402427650002702451650002502478650003402503650001102537650003202548650001902580650002302599650000902622650002402631650002402655650002402679650002202703650001602725700001702741773006702758852001302825930003302838945000802871946001302879852000902892655001202901991595410220742620221122224310.0870423e198510  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870007532DNAL7 a39303212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevlin, J.T.10aEffects of prior high-intensity exercise on glucose metabolism in normal and insulin-resistant men  ap. 973-979.  ap. 973-979. ill., charts.  aExtract: The effects of prior high-intensity cycle exercise (85 per cent VO2 max) to muscular exhaustion on basal and insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism were studied in obese, insulin-resistant, and normal subjects. Six obese (30.4 per cent fat) and six lean (14.5 per cent fat) adult males underwent two separate, two-level hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies (100-min infusions at 40 and 400 mU/m2/min), with and without exercise 12 h earlier. Carbohydrate oxidation was estimated by indirect calorimetry using a ventilated hood system, and endogenous glucose production by d-(3-3H)-glucose infusion. Glycogen content and glycogen synthase activity (GS per cent I) were measured in vastus lateralis muscle biopsies before and at the end of each insulin clamp procedure. After exercise, the obese and lean subjects had comparably low muscle glycogen concentrations (0.10 versus 0.08 mg/g protein, respectively), and equal activation of muscle GS activity (54.4 versus 45.3 GS per cent I, respectively). In the obese subjects, insulin-stimulated glucose disposal was increased significantly, but not totally corrected to normal. In both groups there was a comparable increase in nonoxidative glucose disposal (NOGD), whereas glucose oxidation was decreased and lipid oxidation was increased. Thus, the major effect of prior exercise was to increase insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in the obese subjects and to alter the pathways of glucose metabolism to favor NOGD and decrease glucose oxidation. No correlation was found between the exercise-induced increase in GS per cent I and NOGD, except in the normal subjects during maximal insulin stimulation. Thus, glycogen synthase activity does not appear to be rate-limiting for NOGD at physiologic insulin concentrations. Our findings suggest that a single bout of glycogen-depleting exercise can increase glucose disposal for at least 12-14 h in obese subjects with insulin resistance.(author) 3adiabetes 3aglucose 3ainsulin 3aexercise 3abasal metabolism 3aobesity 3amen 3acarbohydrate metabolism 2aAdult 2aBlood Glucose 2aC-Peptidexblood 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aGlycogenxmetabolism 2aGlycogen Synthasexmetabolism 2aHumans 2aHyperinsulinismxmetabolism 2aInsulinxblood 2aInsulin Resistance 2aMale 2aMusclesxmetabolism 2aObesityxmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPhysical Exertion 2aUreaxurine1 aHorton, E.S.0 tDiabetes.g1985 Oct., v. 34, no. 10 p.973-979x0012-17977nnas  aDNAL FNC  a20050114b00000000c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245011400162300001600276500002400292520148400316650004101800650003501841650002201876650001101898650001301909650002101922650001401943650000901957650001901966650001101985650000901996650001702005650001702022650001502039651001002054653002102064653000802085653003002093653001002123653002202133700001902155700002002174700001502194700001802209773012202227852000902349856004802358655001202406IND4405512520221122224337.0080509e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440551252DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-007-9894-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYue-Qing, Xu10aAdapting the RUSLE and GIS to model soil erosion risk in a mountains karst watershed, Guizhou Province, China  ap. 275-286.  aIncludes references  aSoil erosion is a serious environmental problem in Guizhou Province, which is located in the centre of the karst areas of southwestern China. Unfortunately, Guizhou Province suffers from a lack of financial resources to research, monitor and model soil erosion at large watershed. In order to assess the soil erosion risk, soil erosion modeling at the watershed scale are urgently needed to be undertaken. This study integrated the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) with a Geographic Information System (GIS) to estimate soil loss and identify the risk erosion areas in the Maotiao River watershed, which is a typical rural watershed in Guizhou Province. All factors used in the RUSLE were calculated for the watershed using local data. It was classified into five categories ranging from minimal risk to extreme erosion risk depending on the calculated soil erosion amount. The soil erosion map was linked to land use, elevation and slope maps to explore the relationship between soil erosion and environmental factors and identify the areas of soil erosion risk. The results can be used to advice the local government in prioritizing the areas of immediate erosion mitigation. The integrated approach allows for relatively easy, fast, and cost-effective estimation of spatially distributed soil erosion. It thus indicates that RUSLE-GIS model is a useful and efficient tool for evaluating and mapping soil erosion risk at a large watershed scale in Guizhou Province. 3aRevised Universal Soil Loss Equation 3ageographic information systems 3ahydrologic models 3akarsts 3aland use 3alocal government 3amountains 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3arivers 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3asoil surveys 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aGuizhou Province 0aGIS 0aMountains karst watershed 0aRUSLE 0aSoil erosion risk1 aXiao-Mei, Shao1 aXiang-Bin, Kong1 aJian, Peng1 aYun-Long, Cai0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2008 June, v. 141, no. 1-3 p.275-286dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-007-9894-9 7aarticle03739naa a2200589 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002300133245015800156300001600314300003000330500001500360520200600375650002202381650001202403650001202415650002002427650001702447650002202464650001102486650001002497650002802507650002102535650002102556650002802577650008302605650001102688650002402699650002702723650001102750650001902761650000902780650001602789650002302805650002202828653002802850653002402878700002002902700002202922700002102944700002202965700002102987773006603008852000903074930003303083945000803116946001303124655001203137991595409600742620221122203407.0841116e198404  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840059602DNAL7 a63682892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBogardus, Clifton.10aEffects of physical training and diet therapy on carbohydrate metabolism in patients with glucose intolerance and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus  ap. 311-318.  ap. 311-318. ill., charts.  a2019-12-05  aExtract: The effects of 12 weeks of physical training in addition to hypocaloric diet (DPT group, N = 10) on body composition, carbohydrate (CHO) tolerance, and insulin secretion and action were compared with the effects of diet therapy alone (D group, N = 8) in CHO-intolerant and non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects. Fat mass, fat-free mass (FFM), mean fasting plasma glucose, serum C-peptide, and insulin concentrations decreased similarly in both groups. The mean plasma glucose response to a mixed meal decreased approximately 20% in both treatment groups, and, after i.v. glucose, decreased 12% in the D group, but did not change in the DPT group (NS between groups). The acute serum insulin response (0-6 minutes) after IG increased significantly in the DPT group only (NS between groups). The mean basal endogenous glucose production (BEGP) decreased 17% in the DPT group and by 31% in the D group (NS between groups). Hepatic sensitivity to insulin, estimated by BEGP suppression during the euglycemic clamp, increased significantly by 25% in both groups. Total glucose disposal during the euglycemic clamp increased from 3.51 milligrams of glucose per kilogram of fat-free mass per minute (mg/kg-FFM/min) to 4.45 mg/kg-FFM/min in the DPT group, but no change occurred in the D group (NS between groups). Separation of total glucose disposal rates into CHO oxidative and nonoxidative rates using indirect calorimetry during the euglycemic clamp showed that the mean CHO oxidation rate increased in the D group, but not in the DPT group (NS between groups). There was, however, a significant difference in the mean CHO nonoxidative rate between the 2 groups, increasing in the DPT group but decreasing in the D group. In both groups, the improvements in fasting plasma glucose and meal tolerance appeared to be attributable mostly to decreased BEGP, with increased hepatic sensitivity to insulin. However, glucose disposal was accomplished by different mechanisms in the 2 groups.

They were infused with glucose, insulin and somatostatin for 150 minutes. Fasting insulin levels (adjusted for obesity, age, and sex) were similar in both groups, and similar levels were found in the 2 groups between obesity, fasting insulin levels, and insulin response to oral glucose. Steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) levels on infusion correlated significantly with obesity and fasting insulin levels in both groups; but SSPG levels were significantly higher in the Pimas, indicating Pimas reflect a resistance to insulin, and that a greater degree of insulin resistance occurs in nondiabetic Pimas than in similarly obese Caucasians.

The test group consisted of 160 healthy male and female patients who averaged 42% over ideal body weight. The statistical upper limit of normal for 2-h glucose was 260 mg/dl in women and 206 mg/dl in men. High insulin levels and delayed peak insulin were present in the majority of patients with normal GTT and absent in many of the most obese patients. The upper limits of normal GTT in the obese were much higher than the currently accepted criteria.

A number of studies have explored insulin action on hexose transport and its deactivation following the removal of insulin, membrane binding sites, the reactions of antibodies on cellular processes, and the effects of insulin on calcium dynamics. Extensive data have been developed on the role of ATP stores in muscle and fat cells. Other major areas of research include hexose transport properties in purified adipocyte plasma membranes, insulin receptors and the hexose transporter, transport mechanism studies on the natural peptide ionophores, and models of increased hexose transport activity. 3ainsulin 3acells 3aantibodies 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadipose tissue 3amuscles 3aphysiological transport 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aAdipose Tissuexcytologyxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aBinding Sites 2aBiological Transport 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aCells, Cultured 2aHexosesxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aInsulinximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aInsulin Antagonists 2aInsulin Antibodies 2aMusclesxmetabolism 2aRats 2aReceptor, Insulinxmetabolism 2aStimulation, Chemical 2aViscosity 0aBiochemical processes 0aCalcium utilization 0aTissues of the body0 tDiabetes.g1980 May, v. 29, no. 5 p.399-409x0012-17977nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19800926c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03041naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001500136245009800151300001800249500001500267520193300282650002502215650001702240650001102257650002702268650002202295650001902317650001202336650001902348650000902367653001202376653002602388653002002414653001602434700001702450773009602467852000902563930003302572945001302605946001302618655001202631IND2046415620221122140358.0950613e199504  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204641562DNAL7 ano direct match2pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKomers, R.10aAcute renal hemodynamic effects of ACE inhibition in diabetic hyperfiltration: role of kinins  ap. F588-F594.  a2019-12-05  aAngiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors not only reduce angiotensin II (ANG II) levels but also inhibit kinin degradation. The relative roles of ANG II and bradykinin in the acute action of ACE inhibitors on renal hemodynamic parameters in rats after 3 wk of diabetes were explored using antagonists of the ANG II type 1 (AT1) and the bradykinin B2 receptors. Conscious control and streptozotocin diabetic male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to receive vehicle, the ACE inhibitor, ramiprilat, the B2-receptor blocker, HOE-140, the AT1-receptor blocker, valsartan, or the combination of ramiprilat and HOE-140. Systolic blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), filtration fraction and urinary flow, and sodium excretion were assessed before and during treatment. Diabetic animals had higher GFR and a tendency toward increased RPF and filtration fraction compared with control animals. Acute ramiprilat infusion decreased GFR significantly in diabetic but not in control animals. Valsartan and the combination of ramiprilat and HOE-140 reduced blood pressure to a similar degree to ramiprilat alone, yet did not reduce GFR. No decrease in GFR was observed in any control rat groups. Ramiprilat decreased RPF in diabetic rats but increased RPF in control rats. No such effects on RPF were observed with valsartan. HOE-140 alone did not influence any renal parameter in the diabetic rats. Diabetic rats had increased urinary flow and sodium excretion, but these parameters were not influenced by any drug regimen. In summary, the effects of acute ACE inhibition in reducing diabetic hyperfiltration could be attenuated by concomitant bradykinin receptor blockade and could not be reproduced by the AT1-receptor blocker, valsartan. These findings suggest that kinins play an important role in mediating the acute renal hemodynamic effects of ACE inhibitors in for experimental diabetes. 3adiabetic nephropathy 3ahemodynamics 3akinins 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3aenzyme inhibitors 3arenal function 3akidneys 3aangiotensin II 3arats 0aenzymes 0aexperimental diabetes 0akidney diseases 0aangiotensin1 aCooper, M.E.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g1995 Apr., v. 268, no. 4:pt.2 p.F588-F594x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01579naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245014100164300001600305520055100321650001800872650001600890650003000906650001100936650001800947653002500965653001100990773012601001852000901127856008501136930003301221946001101254655001201265IND4429097820221122060640.0091120e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442909782DNAL7 a10.1134/S10674136090600582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKulesh, V.

Respiration of roots and mycorrhiza is another major source of carbon dioxide in soil CO₂ efflux. The partitioning of these two fluxes is essential for understanding the carbon balance of forest ecosystems and for modelling the carbon cycle within these ecosystems. In this study, we determined the carbon balance of three common tree species in boreal forest zone, Scots pine, Norway spruce, and Silver birch with gas exchange measurements conducted in laboratory in controlled temperature and light conditions. We also studied the allocation pattern of assimilated carbon with ¹⁴C pulse labelling experiment. The photosynthetic light responses of the tree species were substantially different. The maximum photosynthetic capacity (P max) was 2.21 μg CO₂ s⁻¹ g⁻¹ in Scots pine, 1.22 μg CO₂ s⁻¹ g⁻¹ in Norway spruce and 3.01 μg CO₂ s⁻¹ g⁻¹ in Silver birch seedlings. According to the pulse labelling experiments, 43-75% of the assimilated carbon remained in the aboveground parts of the seedlings. The amount of carbon allocated to root and rhizosphere respiration was about 9-26%, and the amount of carbon allocated to root and ectomycorrhizal biomass about 13-21% of the total assimilated CO₂. The ¹⁴CO₂ pulse reached the root system within few hours after the labelling and most of the pulse had passed the root system after 48 h. The transport rate of carbon from shoot to roots was fastest in Silver birch seedlings. 3aBetula pendula 3aPicea abies 3aPinus sylvestris 3aaerial parts 3aanimals 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiomass 3aboreal forests 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aectomycorrhizae 3aforest ecosystems 3agas exchange 3amodels 3aorganic matter 3aphotosynthesis 3arhizosphere 3aroot systems 3aroots 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3atemperature 3atrees1 aHeinonsalo, Jussi1 aRasilo, Terhi1 aHurme, Kaj-Roger1 aIlvesniemi, Hannu0 tTrees.g2009 June, v. 23, no. 3 p.611-621dSpringer-Verlagx0931-18907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-008-0306-8 7aarticle04296naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100001700182245012300199300001600322500002400338506007600362520180800438506003702246650002502283650001802308650000902326650001702335650000902352650001202361650001202373650002002385650001002405650001202415650001602427650001002443650001302453650001902466650002102485650001802506650002102524650002002545650000902565650002002574650002102594650002202615650001702637650003302654650005102687650006502738650004802803650004002851650003402891650005202925650001602977650003302993650004903026650005903075650003403134650001803168700002103186700001803207700002203225700002203247700002103269773011303290852000903403856008103412856003303493655001203526IND4387781420221207074953.0070211e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438778142DNAL7 a171893332pmid7 aPMC18037382pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.106.0841032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Pei-Chi10aEctopic Expression of ABSCISIC ACID 2/GLUCOSE INSENSITIVE 1 in Arabidopsis Promotes Seed Dormancy and Stress Tolerance  ap. 745-758.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAbscisic acid (ABA) is an important phytohormone that plays a critical role in seed development, dormancy, and stress tolerance. 9-cis-Epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase is the key enzyme controlling ABA biosynthesis and stress tolerance. In this study, we investigated the effect of ectopic expression of another ABA biosynthesis gene, ABA2 (or GLUCOSE INSENSITIVE 1 [GIN1]) encoding a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We show that ABA2-overexpressing transgenic plants with elevated ABA levels exhibited seed germination delay and more tolerance to salinity than wild type when grown on agar plates and/or in soil. However, the germination delay was abolished in transgenic plants showing ABA levels over 2-fold higher than that of wild type grown on 250 mM NaCl. The data suggest that there are distinct mechanisms underlying ABA-mediated inhibition of seed germination under diverse stress. The ABA-deficient mutant aba2, with a shorter primary root, can be restored to normal root growth by exogenous application of ABA, whereas transgenic plants overexpressing ABA2 showed normal root growth. The data reflect that the basal levels of ABA are essential for maintaining normal primary root elongation. Furthermore, analysis of ABA2 promoter activity with ABA2::β-glucuronidase transgenic plants revealed that the promoter activity was enhanced by multiple prolonged stresses, such as drought, salinity, cold, and flooding, but not by short-term stress treatments. Coincidently, prolonged drought stress treatment led to the up-regulation of ABA biosynthetic and sugar-related genes. Thus, the data support ABA2 as a late expression gene that might have a fine-tuning function in mediating ABA biosynthesis through primary metabolic changes in response to stress.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aabscisic acid 3aagar 3abiosynthesis 3acold 3adrought 3aenzymes 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglucose 3aroot growth 3aroots 3asalinity 3asalt tolerance 3aseed development 3aseed dormancy 3aseed germination 3asodium chloride 3asoil 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3atransgenic plants 3awater stress 2aAbscisic Acidxbiosynthesis. 2aAlcohol Oxidoreductasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCarbohydrate Metabolismxphysiology 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aGermination 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aSeedlingsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSeedsxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 2aUp-Regulation1 aHwang, San-Gwang1 aEndō, Akira.1 aOkamoto, Masanori1 aKoshiba, Tomokazu1 aCheng, Wan-Hsing0 tPlant physiology.g2007 Feb., v. 143, no. 2 p.745-758dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.106.0841033Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/ 7aarticle01724naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001600181245011400197300001800311500002400329506007600353520046300429506003700892650003900929650002000968650001700988650001501005650002001020700002301040700002001063700001901083700002201102773013701124852000901261856008001270655001201350IND4438098920221207080420.0100604e20100615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443809892DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.00577-102doi7 aPMC28934652pmcid7 a204184232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArima, Jiro14aThe Aminolysis Reaction of Streptomyces S9 Aminopeptidase Promotes the Synthesis of Diverse Prolyl Dipeptides  ap. 4109-4112.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProlyl dipeptide synthesis by S9 aminopeptidase from Streptomyces thermocyaneoviolaceus (S9AP-St) has been demonstrated.

Rodents are considered the primary reservoir host for CPXV. Cats can become infected by close contact with rodents and are the most important source of human infections. Recently, public awareness has also been drawn to CPXV infections by an outbreak of rat to human infections in central Europe. In dogs, CPXV infections are rare. Here we report a case of a 5-month-old Rottweiler with a focal nodule on the muzzle. The lesion was fully excised, and recovery was uneventful. The preliminary diagnosis of a CPXV infection was established by the characteristic inclusion bodies on histopathological examination. The diagnosis was confirmed by electron microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sequencing of the PCR product led to a 231 bp sequence of the orthopoxvirus HA gene that was identical to a CPXV strain previously isolated from a cat. This is the third documented case of a canine CPXV infection. 3aCowpox virus 3aRottweiler 3acase studies 3acats 3adisease reservoirs 3adogs 3aelectron microscopy 3ahumans 3ainclusion bodies 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arats 3askin diseases 2aAnimals 2aCowpoxxpathologyxveterinary. 2aDog Diseasesxpathologyxvirology. 2aDogs 2aEpithelial Cellsxultrastructurexvirology. 2aMale 2aSkinxcytologyxpathology.1 aMauldin, Elizabeth A.1 aBreuer, Wolfram1 aPfleghaar, Stephan1 aNitsche, Andreas0 tVeterinary dermatology.g2011 Feb., v. 22, no. 1 p.111-114dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0959-44937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3164.2010.00923.x 7aarticle01669naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010400128300001600232520067600248650001000924650001700934650001600951650002500967650001900992650002301011650003001034650001501064650002001079650001201099651000901111653001301120700001901133773007501152852000901227930003301236945001301269946001301282655001201295IND2058185620221117160847.0970703e199606  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205818562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuparko, R.L.10aNew potential for classical biological control of Eucallipterus tiliae (Homoptera: Drepanosiphidae)  ap. 407-408.  aBiological control efforts in California directed against the linden aphid (Eucallipterus tiliae) have been predicated on the basis that the aphid is native to Europe.

Genetic parameters of litter size at birth (LS) and litter weight at 21 days (LW21) were estimated using a DFREML procedure from records of 4883 litters (2,049 for LW21) of Iberian breed. Preliminary analysis showed negligible maternal genetic effects. The model for both traits included the fixed effects of farrowing period (86 levels), parity (6) and inbreeding coefficients of dam (Fd) and litter (F₁) as co-variables, and three random effects--additive genetic value, permanent environmental effect and residual on both traits. Heritability and repeatability estimates were 0.064 and 0.126 (LS) and 0.163 and 0.270 (LW21) respectively. Estimated genetic and phenotypic correlations were 0.214 and 0.043. The inbreeding depression per 10 % increase of Fd or F₁ was −0.150 or −0.170 in live piglets and −0.983 or −1.023 kg of litter weight. When the model for LW21 included the dam inbreeding and the number of suckling piglets as co-variables, the heritability and repeatability estimates were 0.243 and 0.431 respectively. A complementary analysis was carried out on individual records (weight at 21 days) of 26206 piglets farrowed by 1317 sows. The model included the fixed effects of sex, farrowing period, parity, and the inbreeding coefficients of dam and individual, as co-variables. A total of four random effects were also included: direct and maternal genetic effects, common environmental effects and residual. Estimates of heritability, maternal heritability and common environmental coefficient were, respectively, 0.019, 0.163 and 0.128, reinforcing the evidence of genetic variance for milk producing ability in Iberian sows. The estimated values of inbreeding depression for piglet weight at 21 days were −0.072 and −0.098 kg per 10 % increase in dam or litter inbreeding. 3aenvironmental impact 3afarrowing 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agenetic variance 3aheritability 3ainbreeding 3ainbreeding coefficient 3ainbreeding depression 3alitter size 3alitter weight 3amilk 3amilk yield 3amodels 3aphenotypic correlation 3apiglets 3aresidual effects 3asows1 aRodrigañez, J.1 aSilio, L.0 tJournal of animal breeding and genetics.g1994 Jan. 12, v. 111, no. 1-6 p.220-227dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl57793x0931-26687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0388.1994.tb00461.x 7aarticle02758naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001600135245008600151300001800237500002300255500001500278520149600293650001301789650001901802650001701821650001901838650002101857650002101878650002401899650001801923650001301941650001501954651001101969653001301980653002301993653001502016700001302031700001702044773009802061852000902159856007502168930003302243945001302276946001102289655001202300IND2199346720221122080722.0990617e199810  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219934672DNAL7 a10.1139/x98-1102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarveau, M.10aRiparian forest strips as habitat for snowshoe hare in a boreal balsam fir forest  ap. 1494-1500.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aRiparian forest strips are usually protected from logging for their buffer effect on aquatic habitats. However, their value to terrestrial wildlife species such as snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus Erxleben) is unknown. From 1990 to 1996, we compared habitat characteristics (shrubs and saplings 0.25-2.25 m high), hare browsing, and hare pellet densities in five types of experimental riparian forest strips (20, 40, 60, and >300 m wide intact strips, and 20 m wide thinned strips), in a humid boreal balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) landscape managed primarily for timber harvesting in Quebec. Based on coniferous and deciduous shrub densities, all riparian forest strips and adjacent clearcuts remained low-quality habitats for hare over 6 years following clear-cutting. Only 103 shrubs were browsed in a 1500-m2 area sampled over 3 years, of which only 33 had >20% of browsed stems. Nevertheless, pellet data revealed a low but sustained use of all strips each summer and winter, and there were no changes over 6 years (mean 280 pellets/ha per month; P > 0.05). Whether hare populations are cyclic or not in our region remains an open question. However, they show some fluctuations and timber harvesting coincided with "high" hare populations in our study area. Sampling in "low" years might show that fewer hares occupy the forest strips. Further work is required to determine the influence of regional and local perturbations on the use of riparian forest strips by snowshoe hares. 3abrowsing 3aboreal forests 3aclearcutting 3aAbies balsamea 3aLepus americanus 3ariparian forests 3awildlife management 3aplant density 3ahabitats 3aunderstory 3aQuebec 0aactivity 0apopulation density 0avegetation1 aHuot, J.1 aBelanger, L.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1998 Oct., v. 28, no. 10 p.1494-1500x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x98-1103Available from publisher's Web site  a19990802b19990812c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03756naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100002400179245007100203300001600274500002400290506007600314520214100390506003702531650002702568650004302595650002902638650002502667650001702692650002102709650001802730650001302748650000902761650002502770650001302795650001302808650005302821650003802874650001402912650002202926650001402948650002402962651001102986700002302997773009903020852000903119856007803128856003203206655001203238IND4384183420221207084703.0061007e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438418342DNAL7 a168680012pmid7 aPMC28061682pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcl1582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBACON, CHRISTINE D.10aTaxonomy and Conservation: A Case Study from Chamaedorea alternans  ap. 755-763.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: and Aims The establishment of justified recommendations in conservation biology requires robust taxonomic treatments for the group(s) being considered. Controversial or poorly developed taxonomies can have a negative impact on conservation assessments. One example of a taxonomically difficult and controversial species complex that is important in conservation involves two species of Mexican palms, Chamaedorea tepejilote and C. alternans. The goal of this study was to investigate whether C. alternans and C. tepejilote are genetically distinct within the Los Tuxtlas region of Veracruz. METHODS: Individuals corresponding to the morphology of C. alternans and C. tepejilote were collected from sympatric and allopatric regions within the Los Tuxtlas Biological Station. Eighty-eight samples were genotyped using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. Cluster and ordination analyses were used to investigate patterns of differentiation. Key Results UPGMA and PCO analyses of AFLP profiles recovered two divergent clusters corresponding to morphologically defined C. tepejilote and C. alternans. No intermediate genotypes were observed and five of the 45 loci were fixed for either the presence or absence between the species. The patterns of divergence observed do not identify a role for sympatric speciation. CONCLUSIONS: The observed patterns of differentiation support the recognition of C. alternans as distinct from C. tepejilote. A suite of vegetative and reproductive morphological features can be used to help distinguish these taxa in the field, but they can be difficult to differentiate from preserved material. Previous treatments of the variation found within the complex (C. alternans and C. tepejilote) as intraspecific variance is unjustified. Given that the Los Tuxtlas region has suffered from historical and ongoing deforestation and that Chamaedorea includes numerous endangered taxa, retaining conservation status for C. alternans serves to help safeguard individuals of the species as well as a region and larger taxonomic group all under considerable threat from human activities.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChamaedorea tepejilote 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aanthropogenic activities 3aasexual reproduction 3acase studies 3acluster analysis 3adeforestation 3agenotype 3aloci 3asympatric speciation 3ataxonomy 3avariance 2aArecaceaexclassificationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEcosystem 2aGenetic Variation 2aPhylogeny 2aSpecies Specificity 0aMexico1 aBAILEY, C.

Genetic age-age correlations for tracheid length and wood density were estimated in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and the efficiency of early selection for these traits was evaluated. Increment cores of 10-mm diameter were collected from trees of 106 full-sib families in a progeny trial located in southeastern Sweden and consisting of controlled matings between 30 parent trees. The additive genetic age-age correlations were consistently close to unity for all traits and ages studied. The additive genetic variance differed significantly from zero for all traits. The dominance variance was zero for tracheid length and small and insignificant for wood density. The heritabilities varied between 0.3 and 0.5. The genetic gain per year for both tracheid length and wood density was largest if selection was carried out at tree age 11, the lowest age studied, indicating that early tests for these traits will be efficient. 3aPinus sylvestris 3atracheids 3alength 3awood density 3atree age 3agenetic correlation 3aplant breeding 3aestimation 3aheritability 3agenetic improvement 3aselection criteria 3aearly selection 3aSweden 0aevaluation 0aefficiency 0agenerations1 aEkberg, I.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1998 Sept., v. 28, no. 9 p.1373-1379x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x98-1243Available from publisher's Web site  a19990901b19990909c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02899naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001700179245005100196300001600247500002400263506007600287520146100363506003701824650001101861650001701872650001801889650001301907650001801920650002101938650002701959650001701986650001002003650002602013650003402039650001302073650003702086650001302123650003302136700001902169700002402188700001802212773010002230852000902330856007802339655001202417IND4442872120221207075306.0100924e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444287212DNAL7 a206756562pmid7 aPMC29449722pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcq1482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAleza, Pablo10aPolyembryony in non-apomictic citrus genotypes  ap. 533-545.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Adventitious embryony from nucellar cells is the mechanism leading to apomixis in Citrus sp. However, singular cases of polyembryony have been reported in non-apomictic genotypes as a consequence of 2x x 4x hybridizations and in vitro culture of isolated nucelli. The origin of the plants arising from the aforementioned processes remains unclear. METHODS: The genetic structure (ploidy and allelic constitution with microsatellite markers) of plants obtained from polyembryonic seeds arising from 2x x 4x sexual hybridizations and those regenerated from nucellus culture in vitro was systematically analysed in different non-apomictic citrus genotypes. Histological studies were also conducted to try to identify the initiation process underlying polyembryony. KEY RESULTS: All plants obtained from the same undeveloped seed in 2x x 4x hybridizations resulted from cleavage of the original zygotic embryo. Also, the plants obtained from in vitro nucellus culture were recovered by somatic embryogenesis from cells that shared the same genotype as the zygotic embryos of the same seed. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that in non-apomictic citrus genotypes, proembryos or embryogenic cells are formed by cleavage of the zygotic embryos and that the development of these adventitious embryos, normally hampered, can take place in vivo or in vitro as a result of two different mechanisms that prevent the dominance of the initial zygotic embryo.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCitrus 3acase studies 3acell cleavage 3agenotype 3ahybridization 3ain vitro culture 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apolyembryony 3aseeds 3asomatic embryogenesis 2aCitrusxembryologyxgenetics. 2aGenotype 2aHybridization, Geneticxgenetics 2aPloidies 2aSeedsxembryologyxgenetics.1 aJuárez, José1 aOllitrault, Patrick1 aNavarro, Luis0 tAnnals of botany.g2010 Oct., v. 106, no. 4 p.533-545dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcq1483Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02714naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245008500182300001600267500002400283520106900307650001501376650002901391650001301420650001801433650001101451650001001462650003801472650003201510650001401542650004901556650002201605650003501627650004601662650002901708650003201737650001201769650000901781651001601790651001601806653002401822653001801846653002301864653002601887653001601913653002601929653003301955700001601988773009902004852000902103856004802112655001202160IND4448844520221122045906.0110204e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444884452DNAL7 a211536402pmid7 a10.1007/s00267-010-9580-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoulos, H.

We developed a decision support system for identifying locations in Connecticut, USA where trees have grown tall enough to make contact with transmission lines during storms. We used the Random Forest algorithm, danger tree presence/absence data, and 25 raster environmental datasets to develop (1) an understanding of the abiotic environmental settings that host danger trees and (2) a spatially explicit map of danger tree distributions across Connecticut power line corridors. Danger trees were prevalent in locations (1) with an infrequent history of storms; (2) forested and residential land uses; and (3) low to middle elevations. Products from this research can be transferred to adaptive right-of-way management because they present managers with key information on where danger trees are likely to occur, and the methods presented herein have great potential for future application to other regions managers seek to identify high priority areas for danger tree removal. 3aalgorithms 3adecision support systems 3amanagers 3arights of way 3astorms 3atrees 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aDecision Support Techniques 2aEcosystem 2aElectric Wiringxstatistics & numerical data 2aForestryxmethods 2aGeographic Information Systems 2aPower Plantsxstatistics & numerical data 2aRisk Managementxmethods 2aTreesxgrowth & development 2aWeather 2aWind 3aConnecticut 0aConnecticut 0aPower line corridor 0aRandom forest 0aPredictive mapping 0aVegetation management 0aDanger tree 0aUtility arboriculture 0aElectrical outage prevention1 aCamp, A.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether purinergic neurons are implicated in the response to nerve stimulation. The shape of the EFS-induced contractile response was different depending on stimulus frequency; low frequencies (0.5-2 Hz) induced fast monophasic contractions with a small subsequent relaxation; whereas higher frequencies (5-50 Hz) induced biphasic contractile response that comprised fast initial component (as in case of low frequency) and a slow delayed contractile component in addition to the relaxation that follows the fast contractile component. Prior application of atropine (10 micromolar) completely abolished the slow delayed component but significantly enhanced the fast initial contractile component. Physostigmine (1-10 micromolar) significantly enhanced the slow delayed component with an inhibitory effect on the initial fast component. The nonspecific purinergic receptor antagonist, suramin (100-500 micromolar) significantly inhibited the fast initial contractile component with no significant effect on the slow delayed one. Complete blockade of the fast component was achieved by prior application of a combination consisted of suramin (50 micromolar) and pyridoxicalphosphate-6-azophenyl 2',4'-disulphonic acid tetrasodium (PPADS; 10 micromolar). Exogenous applications of adenosine 5'-triphosphate and acetylcholine (10 micromolar each), produced contractile responses that mimicked those induced by EFS. These data suggest that ATP is the main noncholinergic excitatory transmitter controlling the contractile activity of the quail rectum; and that its action could be modulated by acetylcholine. 3asuramin 3aelectric field 3aneurophysiology 3amuscle contraction 3aneurons 3aphysiological regulation 3aacetylcholine 3amuscles 3aantagonists 3aphysostigmine 3aadenosine triphosphate 3arectum 3aatropine 3aCoturnix japonica 2aAcetylcholinexpharmacologyxphysiology. 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexphysiology 2aAnimals 2aAtropinexpharmacology 2aCholinesterase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aCoturnixxphysiology 2aElectric Stimulation 2aFemale 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aMale 2aMuscarinic Antagonistsxpharmacology 2aMuscle Contractionxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPhysostigminexpharmacology 2aPurinergic Antagonists 2aPyridoxal Phosphatexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aReceptors, Purinergicxphysiology 2aRectumxphysiology 2aSuraminxpharmacology 0aadenose 5'-phosphate 0aJapanese quails 0aimpedance1 aEl-Mahmoudy, A.1 aKhalifa, M.1 aDraid, M.1 aShimizu, Y.1 aTakewaki, T.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2007 Apr., v. 82, no. 2 p.246-251dHarcourtx0034-52887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2006.07.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20070919b20071002c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/08/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02484naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001400135245008600149300001600235500002300251500001500274520128800289650001101577650001101588650001701599650002601616650001801642650001401660650001401674650002301688650001201711651001501723653002201738653002201760653001501782700001701797773009501814852000901909856007501918930003301993945001302026946001102039655001202050IND2200135620221122050053.0990816e199904  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220013562DNAL7 a10.1139/x99-0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, D.G.10aReversal of human-induced vegetation changes in Sequoia National Park, California  ap. 399-412.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aWe resampled 76 permanent plots that had been established in the woodlands and forests of Sequoia National Park in 1969. Our objectives were to describe vegetation changes in the tree and shrub layers and determine the effects of prescribed burning that began in the 1960s. We compared changes in species importance and tree size class distributions between sample dates and between burned and unburned plots. Species composition had remained similar in all nine vegetation types sampled except in the ponderosa pine forest where Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P.& C. Laws, decreased in importance from 28 to 15% and Abies concolor (Gord. & Glend.) Lindl. increased from 18 to 31%. Structural changes were more common, as tree density decreased in the blue oak woodland (19%), and live oak woodlands (15%), as well as in ponderosa pine forest (41%), white fir forest (5%), giant sequoia groves (39%), and red fir forest (24%). Decreases in density were greater in burned plots but occurred in unburned plots as well, indicating that prescribed fire and self-thinning contributed to decreases in density. Tree density was unchanged in the lodgepole and subalpine forests, but increased in the Jeffrey pine forest (58%). The decreases in tree density represent a reversal of earlier trends. 3acanopy 3ashrubs 3afire ecology 3abotanical composition 3astand density 3amortality 3awoodlands 3aprescribed burning 3aforests 3aCalifornia 0aplant communities 0aspecies diversity 0avegetation1 aVankat, J.L.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1999 Apr., v. 29, no. 4 p.399-412x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x99-0073Available from publisher's Web site  a19991003b19991007c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle03251naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174100001900183245010600202300001600308500002400324500001500348520095900363650001801322650001601340650002201356650002701378650003001405650001401435650002901449650002001478650002201498650002701520650002201547650001701569650003101586650002001617650001001637650001201647650004201659650002401701650006601725650004401791650005201835650005201887650006401939650003002003650001002033650004202043653001702085653002302102700001302125700001302138700001802151700001802169700001802187700001502205700001902220700001602239773009802255852000902353856008602362930003302448945002502481946001102506655001202517IND4390099920221122045946.0070403e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439009992DNAL7 a170110022pmid7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2006.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL2001 aPedersen, L.G.10aIncreased expression of endothelin B receptor in static stretch exposed porcine mitral valve leaflets  ap. 232-238.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of mechanical stretch on the expression of ET-1 and ETA- and ETB-receptors in porcine mitral valve leaflets. Leaflet segments from 10 porcine mitral valves were exposed to a static stretch load of 1.5 N for 3.5 h in buffer at 37 °C together with matching control segments. Subsequently, the mRNA expression of ET-1, ETA-R and ETB-R was measured by real-time RT-PCR in the chordal insertion areas. The analyses showed an increased transcription of ETB-receptors in stretch-exposed leaflet segments compared to unstretched segments median 2.23 (quartiles 1.37 and 2.70) vs. median 1.56 (quartiles 1.38 and 2.17, P = 0.03) whereas the mRNA expression of ETA-receptors (P = 0.90) and ET-1 (P = 0.51) remained unchanged. Stretch increased the expression of ETB-receptors in porcine mitral valve leaflets. The finding could lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of myxomatous mitral valve disease. 3amessenger RNA 3aendothelium 3aendothelial cells 3avasoconstrictor agents 3apolymerase chain reaction 3areceptors 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3aanimal physiology 3aphysiological response 3amechanical stress 3aheart valves 3agene expression regulation 3aanimal genetics 3aswine 2aAnimals 2aEndothelin-1xbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aMitral Valve Insufficiencyxgeneticsxmetabolismxveterinary. 2aRNA, Messengerxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aReceptor, Endothelin Axbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aReceptor, Endothelin Bxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aStatistics, Nonparametric 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0amitral valve 0amolecular genetics1 aZhao, J.1 aYang, J.1 aThomsen, P.D.1 aGregersen, H.1 aHasekam, J.M.1 aSmerup, M.1 aPedersen, H.D.1 aOlsen, L.H.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2007 Apr., v. 82, no. 2 p.232-238dHarcourtx0034-52887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2006.07.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20070919b20071002c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/08/31  aNon-US 7aarticle03073naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001500135245009700150300001800247500002300265500001500288520142400303650001401727650002101741650001401762650002101776650001101797650001101808650002101819650001001840650001101850650002301861650002101884650002601905650002601931650001201957650001401969650002801983650001702011650001302028650002602041650003602067650002602103653001502129653001002144653000902154653001102163653002302174700001602197700001902213773009802232852000902330856007502339930003302414945001302447946001102460655001202471IND2199350720221122050041.0990617e199810  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219935072DNAL7 a10.1139/x98-1362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaw, T.M.10aRoot chemistry of Douglas-fir seedlings grown under different nitrogen and potassium regimes  ap. 1566-1573.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aRoot chemistry and biomass allocation of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Bessn.) Franco) seedlings under optimal and deficient levels of nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) were studied. Seedlings receiving high-N treatments were significantly larger and allocated more dry matter to their stems and less to their roots than those receiving the low-N treatments. The K treatments did not significantly affect total seedling biomass or root/shoot ratios. Root tip starch concentrations were significantly higher and root tip sugar concentrations were lower in plants receiving the low-N treatments. Seedlings receiving the high-N, low-K treatment had significantly lower concentrations of phenolics and tannins and lower ratios of these compounds to sugars in the root tips than seedlings receiving the high-K treatments. Samples taken from two locations on the root system show that concentrations of phenolics, tannins, sugars, and starches were substantially higher in the root collar than in the root tips. Because of lower within tissue variation, we recommend sampling at root tips to better detect treatment differences. This study shows that N levels affect starch concentrations in the roots, while K levels affect root phenolic and tannin concentrations. Possible relationships between low root phenolic and tannin concentrations and lessened resistance of Douglas-fir to root disease are discussed. 3aroot tips 3anutrient content 3aseedlings 3aapplication rate 3ashoots 3asugars 3anitrogen content 3astems 3astarch 3anutrient solutions 3aroot shoot ratio 3aquantitative analysis 3anutrient deficiencies 3atannins 3apotassium 3adry matter partitioning 3aroot systems 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3achemical constituents of plants 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 0adry matter 0aroots 0asize 0aratios 0aphenolic compounds1 aMoore, J.A.1 aMarshall, J.D.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1998 Oct., v. 28, no. 10 p.1566-1573x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x98-1363Available from publisher's Web site  a19990802b19990812c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02697naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001700135245011700152300001800269500002300287500001500310520142600325650001301751650001801764650002601782650001801808650002001826650002101846650001901867650002201886650001301908650002801921651001101949653001101960653001101971653001101982700001901993773009802012852000902110856007502119930003302194945001302227946001102240655001202251IND2199158020221122041212.0990607e199811  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219915802DNAL7 a10.1139/x98-1342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNewton, P.F.10aAboveground modular component responses to intraspecific competition within density-stressed black spruce stands  ap. 1587-1610.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aA broad range of measures of aboveground growth were used to assess whether competition occurs by processes of resource depletion or resource preemption within monospecific, even-aged, density-stressed, and spatially heterogeneous black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) stands. The assessments proceeded by evaluating the relationships between relative growth and partitioning indices of individual subject trees and directional-specific indices of cumulative competition. Significant directional-specific asymmetrical relationships between subject trees and their local competitors were found, indicating the occurrence of competition by resource preemption. All measures of growth, however, did not respond to directional-specific competition to the same degree. Larger responses, characterizing the response of black spruce trees to increasing competition from their larger neighbours, involved decreased branch production and changes in foliar morphology. Such adaptive, plastic responses in phenotype, combined with lesser responses of foliage production and nutrient concentrations, suggest a strategy used by black spruce to compete within density-stressed populations situated on nutrient-limiting sites: decreased allocation of resources to nonphotosynthetic components, maintenance of the photosynthetic apparatus through adjustments in foliage morphology, and nutrient conservation through foliage retention. 3atree age 3aPicea mariana 3anutrient availability 3astand density 3aconifer needles 3aplant morphology 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant competition 3abranches 3adry matter partitioning 3aCanada 0astress 0agrowth 0aleaves1 aJolliffe, P.A.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1998 Nov., v. 28, no. 11 p.1587-1610x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x98-1343Available from publisher's Web site  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle02553naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001800135245010200153300001800255500002300273520125400296650001701550650001801567650001301585650002601598650001401624650001501638650002401653650001001677650001101687650002201698650001401720650001301734651001001747653001001757653000901767653001501776653001101791700002001802700001101822773009701833852000901930856007501939930003302014945001302047946001102060655001202071IND2198369520221122041020.0990427e199808  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219836952DNAL7 a10.1139/x98-0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaguire, D.A.10aCrown structure and growth efficiency of red spruce in uneven-aged, mixed-species stands in Maine  ap. 1233-1240.  aSummary in French.  aSeveral hypotheses about the relationships among individual tree growth, tree leaf area, and relative tree size or position were tested with red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) growing in uneven-aged, mixed-species forests of south-central Maine, U.S.A. Based on data from 65 sample trees, predictive models were developed to (i) estimate the amount of foliage held by individual trees from sapwood cross-sectional area and (ii) define the relationship between stem volume growth and three variables: total foliage area, relative position in the stand, and the degree of past suppression. A model that included variables representing tree size (or relative social position) and degree of past suppression (live branch whorls per unit crown length) indicated that stem volume growth first increased but later decreased over leaf area when other variables were held constant. Growth efficiency declined with increasing tree leaf area, although greater height and diameter enhanced growth efficiency and greater past suppression diminished growth efficiency. The decline in growth efficiency with greater leaf area likely is attributable to one or several of the factors previously identified as contributing to growth declines in mature, even-aged stands. 3aPicea rubens 3amixed forests 3atree age 3astand characteristics 3aleaf area 3aprediction 3amathematical models 3astems 3avolume 3aplant competition 3astem form 3adiameter 3aMaine 0acrown 0asize 0aefficiency 0agrowth1 aBrissette, J.C.1 aGu, L.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1998 Aug., v. 28, no. 8 p.1233-1240x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x98-0933Available from publisher's Web site  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle02997naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174100001600183245008000199300001600279500002400295500001500319520108400334650002201418650001001440650001801450650001401468650001701482650002501499650002001524650001201544650001001556650001301566650002201579650001801601650001601619650001901635650001601654650001101670650002501681650003701706650001201743650003101755650003701786650003001823650003901853650003201892650002501924650000901949650004801958653001302006653001002019653001802029700001402047773009802061852000902159856008602168930003302254945002502287946001102312655001202323IND4390098320221122041210.0070403e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439009832DNAL7 a169973362pmid7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2006.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL4001 aStaszyk, C.10aPrimary culture of fibroblasts and cementoblasts of the equine periodontium  ap. 150-157.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFibroblasts and cementoblasts in the periodontal ligament (PDL) of equine cheek teeth were harvested, and monocultures were obtained by means of a “selective detachment” procedure. Cells were characterized by morphological criteria and by immunostaining for vimentin, FVIII, pan-cytokeratin, smooth muscle actin, and pro-collagen. Cementogenic potential of the cells was determined by immunostaining for osteopontin and by histochemical detection of alkaline phosphatase. Equine periodontal fibroblasts (EPF) were spindle-shaped and polygonal. Equine dental cementoblasts (EDC) grew in cobblestone-like clusters. Both EPF and EDC stained positive for vimentin. Only EPF contained smooth muscle actin, pro-collagen, and alkaline phosphatase. Few EDC stained positive for osteopontin. The phenotypes of EPF and EDC and their specific expression of proteins corresponded to PDL fibroblasts and dental cementoblasts of other species. These results indicate the potential use of EPF and EDC in an adequate in vitro model of equine cementogenesis and equine periodontal remodeling. 3aprotein synthesis 3ateeth 3amorphogenesis 3aligaments 3acell culture 3aimmunohistochemistry 3acell physiology 3akeratin 3aactin 3acollagen 3aanimal physiology 3acytochemistry 3afibroblasts 3aultrastructure 3aosteopontin 3ahorses 3aalkaline phosphatase 2aAlkaline Phosphatasexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aCementogenesisxphysiology 2aCoculture Techniquesxveterinary 2aDental Cementumxcytology 2aFibroblastsxcytologyxenzymology. 2aHorsesxanatomy & histology 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aMale 2aPeriodontal Ligamentxcytologyxenzymology. 0avimentin 0amouth 0acementoblasts1 aGasse, H.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2007 Apr., v. 82, no. 2 p.150-157dHarcourtx0034-52887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2006.07.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20070919b20071002c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/08/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02181naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245004300134300001400177300002200191520130400213650002101517650001901538650001201557650003201569653003201601653001401633653003101647700001801678773009801696852000901794939003301803945000801836946001101844655001201855991595369750742620221122041033.0841207e198404  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840060592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSitnick, Toby.10aSex role identity and anorexia nervosa  ap. 81-87.  ap. 81-87. charts.  aExtract: Much controversy surrounds the issue of sex role identity in anorexia nervosa. In this study, 16 inpatient and 13 nonhospitalized anorectic women were compared with each other on the Bem Sex Role Inventory and with 2 non-eating-disordered control groups of women, one consisting of 16 undergraduate students and the other of 16 students pursuing graduate degrees in social work. No significant differences in scores were found between the 2 groups of anorectic subjects, and both control group scores also showed no significant differences. However, while femininity item scores were similar in all 4 groups, both groups of anorectic subjects scored significantly lower on the masculinity items than both control groups. No significant correlations were found in the anorectic subjects between masculinity item score and percentage of ideal body weight, duration of illness, or extent of education. An interpretation of anorexia nervosa as primarily a rejection or a caricature of the feminine role is challenged by this study. Rather, the results suggest that 1 characteristic of those women vulnerable to developing this syndrome may be a failure to develop adequately those "masculine" traits that are also necessary for optimal adult female functioning in contemporary society.

Dougl. ex J. Forbes) was studied at two sites in British Columbia. Ten trees growing at varying elevations at each site were flagged and two or more cones were collected from each tree every 1 or 2 weeks. Following size measurements, cones were dissected and 20 ovules from each cone were sampled, fixed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained for anatomical study. Ovule, megagametophyte, and embryo size was measured and stage of ovule or seed and embryo was determined. At both sites the phenology and details of development were similar. The major causes of cone loss were frost at pollination and insect damage following pollination. The seed potential per cone was 359-408, but the filled seeds per cone based on cutting tests and X-raying was only 18-22%. The major causes of seed loss were insect damage (32-39%) during ovule and seed development and failure of ovules to be pollinated (26-31%). Although the amount of insect damage was similar at both sites, damage at Site 1 was primarily caused by Megastigmus sp. larvae in the seeds whereas at Site 2, damage was to seeds, scales, and the cone axis and due to Earomyia abietum larvae. Megagametophyte and embryo development is described and the time and causes of the seed loss are related to development. Anomalous types of development are described and possible causes discussed. 3aovules 3apollination 3aflowering 3ainsect pests 3aembryo (plant) 3aphenology 3afrost injury 3aAbies amabilis 3asexual reproduction 3aabnormal development 3aaltitude 3aembryogenesis 3aseed cones 3aseed development 3aBritish Columbia 0asize 0aseeds 0ainjuries 0aplant anatomy 0acones1 aMorris, S.J.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g1998 Aug., v. 28, no. 8 p.1146-1163wJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x98-0893Available from publisher's Web site  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle02723naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001600135245010500151300001800256500002300274500001500297520144200312650001501754650002401769650001701793650001301810650001101823650002601834650001101860650002101871650002101892650002001913650001501933651001201948653001501960653002601975653001102001700001502012773009702027852000902124856007502133930003302208945001302241946001102254655001202265IND2198334020221122031213.0990426e199808  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219833402DNAL7 a10.1139/x98-0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaltamo, M.10aMethods based on k-nearest neighbor regression in the prediction of basal area diameter distribution  ap. 1107-1115.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aIn the Finnish compartmentwise inventory systems, growing stock is described with means and sums of tree characteristics, such as mean height and basal area, by tree species. In the calculations, growing stock is described in a treewise manner using a diameter distribution predicted from stand variables. The treewise description is needed for several reasons, e.g., for predicting log volumes or stand growth and for analyzing the forest structure. In this study, methods for predicting the basal area diameter distribution based on the k-nearest neighbor (k-nn) regression are compared with methods based on parametric distributions. In the k-nn method, the predicted values for interesting variables are obtained as weighted averages of the values of neighboring observations. Using k-nn based methods, the basal area diameter distribution of a stand is predicted with a weighted average of the distributions of k-nearest neighbors. The methods tested in this study include weighted averages of (i) Weibull distributions of k-nearest neighbors, (ii) distributions of k-nearest neighbors smoothed with the kernel method, and (iii) empirical distributions of the k-nearest neighbors. These methods are compared for the accuracy of stand volume estimation, stand structure description, and stand growth prediction. Methods based on the k-nn regression proved to give a more accurate description of the stand than the parametric methods. 3aestimation 3amathematical models 3aforest trees 3adiameter 3avolume 3aplant characteristics 3aheight 3aforest inventory 3astand basal area 3astand structure 3aprediction 3aFinland 0abasal area 0astand characteristics 0agrowth1 aKangas, A.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1998 Aug., v. 28, no. 8 p.1107-1115x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x98-0853Available from publisher's Web site  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle02169naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001700135245013300152300001800285500034200303500002300645520071200668650002201380650002401402650002501426650001201451650002001463650002201483650001001505650001301515653002901528773009701557852000901654856007501663930003301738945001301771946001101784655001201795IND2198318720221122031208.0990423e199807  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219831872DNAL7 a10.1139/x98-0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurray, A.T.10aEcosystem management or infeasible guidelines?

(1997. Can. J. For. Res. 27: 1302-1310) from a harvest scheduling perspective incorporating adjacency, exclusion periods, and flow restrictions. This is a likely contribution to the debates questioning the usefulness and capabilities of these constraints in forest management models. This research note discusses an error in the mathematical model formulation presented in Carter et al. (1997). Such an error may impact the findings presented and perhaps alter conclusions. This is an increasingly important issue, given the ease of planning problem formulation and application using current optimization software packages. 3aforest management 3amathematical models 3astatistical analysis 3alogging 3adecision making 3acomputer software 3aroads 3aland use 0aletters (correspondence)0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1998 July, v. 28, no. 7 p.1093-1096x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x98-0813Available from publisher's Web site  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle01524naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002200115245008200137300001400219300001900233520073300252650001200985650001900997650002101016650001501037700002301052773009801075852000901173939003301182945000801215946001101223655001201234991595369230742620221122031202.0841128e198412  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840059982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVincent, Stephen.10aBulimia: Sign, symptom, or entity.

The questionnaire focused on such elements as etiology, diagnostic criteria, treatment procedures, and time spent with client. Although the 3 groups of clinicians had similar views on many facets of bulimia, 29 MANOVA comparisons were statistically significant. Approximately 75% of the respondents rejected the definition of bulimia found in DSM-III, but accepted many of its diagnostic criteria. It was concluded that bulimia has not been clearly conceptualized as a specific eating disorder and that this factor affects how the clinicians diagnose and treat the problem.

Throughout the year, the abundances of two different phycodnavirus polB gene fragments (LO1b-49 and LO1a-68) varied by more than two orders of magnitude, peaked during the autumn months, and were lowest during the summer. The seasonal abundance patterns of these two virus genes were similar and both were detected in almost every sample, but LO1b-49 was consistently an order of magnitude more abundant than LO1a-68. LO1b-49 reached a maximum abundance of 5413 ± 312 genes ml⁻¹, whereas LO1a-68's abundance peaked at only 881 ± 113 genes ml⁻¹. Another phycodnavirus polB fragment that was monitored (LO1b-16) was detected in only a few samples, but reached a higher maximum concentration (6771 ± 879 genes ml⁻¹) than either LO1b-49 or LO1a-68. The results of this year-long investigation of virus gene abundances suggests that Lake Ontario's phycodnavirus community is composed of persistent viruses detectable throughout the year and transient viruses present in only a few sporadic samples. The results also suggest that some persistent algal viruses are able to survive at relatively low abundances through several seasons. 3aPhycodnaviridae 3aautumn 3agenes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aquantitative analysis 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3aviruses 2aBiodiversity 2aDNA, Viralxanalysisxgenetics. 2aEukaryotaxvirology 2aFresh Waterxvirology 2aGenes, Viral 2aPhycodnaviridaexgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSeasons 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSpecies Specificity 2aWater Microbiology 3aCanada 3aLake Ontario 0aOntario1 aShort, Cindy M.0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2009 Oct., v. 11, no. 10 p.2639-2648dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01988.x 7aarticle04016naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171100001400180245015700194300001600351500002400367500001500391520244700406650002602853650001602879650001802895650001702913650001202930650001602942650003002958650001502988650002203003650002303025650001503048650002003063650002503083653002003108653003003128700002203158700001403180700001303194700001403207773009303221852000903314856009403323930003303417945002503450946001103475655001203486IND4390097920221122031304.0070403e20070406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439009792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2006.12.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aM001 0aM1201 aKvale, A.10aDevelopment and characterisation of some intestinal enzymes in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) and Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus L.) larvae  ap. 457-468.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo determine the status of development of the intestine, the activities of intestinal leucine-alanine peptidase (Leu-ala), brush border membrane (bbm)-bound alkaline phosphatase (AP) and bbm-bound leucine aminopeptidase N (LAP) were analysed from first feeding to passed weaning in Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus; 1-78 days post first feeding; dpff) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua; 0-72 dpff). Before conducting the ontogenetic studies, the enzyme assays used were optimised in relation to temperature and pH (only AP and LAP), and the Michaelis constant (KM; All enzymes) determined, in order to ensure valid data and to maximise the activity potentials. Leu-ala was used as a marker of intracellular digestion which was expected to decrease during the experimental periods. AP and LAP were used as markers of development of the bbm and achievement of an adult mode of digestion. In halibut, Leu-ala increased 11-folds (P = 0.0002) in specific activity (mU (mg protein)-1) from first feeding to 34 dpff and thereafter a small decrease (0.65-fold; P = 0.006) in activity was observed. In cod, the specific activity of Leu-ala varied randomly during the experiment. Distinct increases in specific activities of AP and LAP were observed from 29 to 52 dpff in halibut (fivefold; P < 0.002) and from 29 to 37 dpff in cod (two-threefold; P < 0.02). The bbm-bound activities of AP and LAP in percent of total intestinal activity of the respective enzyme increased from approximately 2 to 15% between 34 and 43 dpff in halibut (P < 0.0003), confirming the results of specific activities. In cod, a similar result with AP was found between 29 and 51 dpff (P = 0.0003). The increase in percentage of bbm-bound activity of LAP was later, increasing exponentially from constituting 5 to 31% of total individual activity between 37 and 72 dpff (P = 0.0003). The experiments indicated that the digestion in halibut had advanced towards the adult mode at 40 to 50 dpff, while time of reaching the same maturational level in cod was less certain due to the different activity profiles of AP and LAP. As AP is well recognised as a bbm differentiation marker, it can be assumed that the intestine in cod matured when AP activity had reached an elevated level at approximately 40 to 50 dpff, whereas LAP possibly was induced later. Ceasing of the larval mode of digestion, expected to be indicated by reduced activity of Leu-ala, was not detected. 3aleucyl aminopeptidase 3amarine fish 3aanimal growth 3aGadus morhua 3ahalibut 3afish larvae 3aHippoglossus hippoglossus 3aintestines 3adigestive enzymes 3aanimal development 3acod (fish) 3aenzyme activity 3aalkaline phosphatase 0aaminopeptidases 0aleucine-alanine peptidase1 aMangor-Jensen, A.1 aMoren, M.1 aEspe, M.1 aHamre, K.0 tAquaculture.g2007 Apr. 6, v. 264, no. 1-4 p.457-468dElsevier Pub.

Two models for expressing the relationship (simple power law or a cumulative negative exponential adjusted to account for rodent-repellent application and seedbed type) all showed that survivorship is highly dependent on seed mass. For a small seed, mineral soil and thin humus confer roughly equally high survivorship. Leaf litter is very poor, and undisturbed thick moss appears to be the worst possible organic seedbed on upland sites. An examination of 30 records of Picea glauca (Moench) Voss survivorship (3- to 6-year-old cohorts) on mineral soil revealed substantial intraspecific variation with only 50% of the values within twofold of the predicted value. 3amathematical models 3aforest trees 3amineral soils 3aforest litter 3astand density 3aPicea glauca 3acanopy gaps 3ashelterwood systems 3agenetic variation 3amosses and liverworts 3ahumus 3amortality 0aseed size 0asite factors 0asoil organic matter 0asowing rates1 aJohnson, E.A.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1998 Sept., v. 28, no. 9 p.1307-1316x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x98-1063Available from publisher's Web site  a19990901b19990909c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03177naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180100001800189245014600207300001600353500002400369520175900393650002502152650000902177650001602186650001602202650002002218650001502238650002102253650001502274650001702289650001702306650001602323650001502339650001202354700001702366700001602383700001902399773009302418852000902511856009402520930003302614945002502647946001102672655001202683IND4390097520221122031236.0070403e20070406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439009752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2006.09.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL300 0aL500 0aM001 0aM3101 aGeorgalas, V.10aSwimming activity and feeding behaviour of larval European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L): Effects of ontogeny and increasing food density  ap. 418-427.  aIncludes references  aThe behaviour of European sea bass larvae reared with the mesocosm technique was analysed in relation to ontogeny and increasing food density, with a particular focus on swimming and feeding activities. The behaviour of groups of larvae (20 animals each) belonging to three age classes (10, 20 and 30 days post-hatching) was video-recorded in experimental tanks under controlled laboratory conditions. In each replicate, three different food densities, in terms of number of naupliar Artemia/l, were obtained. The videotapes analysis allowed the identification of 6 behavioural units (larval MAPs) and their quantification in terms of either frequency (number/min), or duration (percent of time spent in that activity with respect to the total time of observation). Behavioural variation was analysed in relation both to age and food density. Results revealed that swimming activity increased significantly with age, especially between the 10 and the 20 days post-hatching, whereas resting activities decreased with age and, in some cases, also with food density. Frequency of feeding behaviours decreased with age if they were analysed singly, but when the association between aiming posture (Sigmoid-posture) and attacks was considered, results showed that these behaviours increased with both age and food density. Further, the increase of feeding efficiency with age was also confirmed by the increase in the number of Artemia nauplii/individual across the three age groups. Results are discussed in the light of both a comparative analysis conducted with the available data on the larval behaviour of other marine fish species, and their potential use for the assessment of the quality of the reared fish, also in relation to the rearing techniques. 3aDicentrarchus labrax 3abass 3amarine fish 3afish larvae 3aanimal behavior 3alocomotion 3afeeding behavior 3aanimal age 3afish feeding 3afish culture 3amariculture 3alive feeds 3aArtemia1 aMalavasi, S.1 aFranzoi, P.1 aTorricelli, P.0 tAquaculture.g2007 Apr. 6, v. 264, no. 1-4 p.418-427dElsevier Pub.

The most notable finding was that dropouts and completers did not markedly differ. The largest differences between the 2 groups was occupation, with the completers containing more women working in the home than the dropouts. Further research on the cognitive factors in weight control is recommended.

Five perspectives on the etiology of this malady are critiqued: environmental, maternal, and sensory deprivation, and psychosomatic and nutritional perspectives. The family role, family members, and mother-child interaction relative to this syndrome also are examined. Incidences of key family variables are determined across studies, where data are available. Therapeutic approaches attempt to ameliorate environmental deprivation. Follow-up studies include the effects of this malady on cognitive development.

Franco) natural regeneration in southwestern Argentina are unknown. We investigated (i) the germination responses of P. menziesii seeds to variations in the radiation and thermal environments imposed by canopy cover and litter, (ii) the effects of litter on seedling emergence, and (iii) the effects of understory vegetation on seedling performance and seed and seedling predation. Seed germination was high in darkness and under canopies. Under a combination of canopy types and litter covers, germination showed a negative correlation with temperature between 23 and 40 degrees C. Germination was not altered by changes in red/far-red ratio. These results suggest that the presence of an overstory canopy promotes P. menziesii seed germination compared with a no-canopy situation (e.g., a clearcut). Litter inhibited seedling emergence by reducing water availability and by acting as a mechanical barrier. Understory vegetation (established saplings) reduced seedling growth and survival. However, our results suggest that direct competition between seedlings and understory vegetation is not the principal force regulating regeneration; indirect effects appear to be of paramount importance because P. menziesii seed and seedling consumption (presumably by rodents) is greatly encouraged by the presence of dense vegetation patches in the understory. 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aunderstory 3avegetation 3aforest litter 3acanopy 3anatural regeneration 3aseed germination 3asolar radiation 3aambient temperature 3aseedling emergence 3amortality 3aseedling growth 3aplant competition 3apredation 3ahabitats 3aArgentina 0awater availability 0adark1 aBallare, C.L.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1998 May, v. 28, no. 5 p.683-692x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x98-0363Available from publisher's Web site  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle02613naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001800135245011400153300001600267500002300283520154400306650002001850650001301870650001101883650001801894650002201912650002901934651002101963653001701984700001402001773009502015852000902110856007502119930003302194945001302227946001102240655001202251IND2164062920221121232414.0980916e199804  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216406292DNAL7 a10.1139/x98-0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBinkley, C.S.10aImpact of timber-fee increases on British Columbia forest products companies: an economic and policy analysis  ap. 617-625.  aSummary in French.  aOn 14 April 1994, the British Columbia government announced a new stumpage formula that, at then-expected product prices, increased the average charge by about $ 12/m3 and more than doubled the rate at which stumpage fees change when lumber prices change. Most of the increased revenues are reinvested in the forest sector by a new organization, Forest Renewal British Columbia (FRBC), created specifically for that purpose. Using standard event-study methodologies, this paper documents the net effect of the fee increases and new policy direction on British Columbia forest products companies. After controlling for firm-specific risk and the decline in the Toronto Stock Exchange that occurred at about the same time, the new stumpage policy extracted about $ 1.0 billion from shareholders of the firms studied, and perhaps $2.4 billion from all licencees (an amount roughly equal to the capitalized after-tax cost of the higher fees). The impact on individual firms is highly correlated with the allowable annual cut (AAC) in replaceable licenses each holds, with an average impact of about $33.3/m3 of AAC. The market appears to have discounted both the good news about offsets in impending timber-supply reductions that the creation of FRBC implies and the reductions in earnings risk that the new stumpage system provides. When added to the increased regulatory costs associated with the new provincial Forest Practice Code, the timber-fee increases appear to have fully depleted the value of holding British Columbia timber quotas. 3aforest products 3astumpage 3aprices 3aforest policy 3aeconomic analysis 3aforest products industry 3aBritish Columbia 0areinvestment1 aZhang, D.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1998 Apr., v. 28, no. 4 p.617-625x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x98-0323Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle02198naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245006300131300001600194300002400210500001500234520114100249650001201390650003101402650002001433650001001453650001201463650000801475650003601483651001201519653001201531653002101543700004501564700001401609700001601623773009801639852000901737939003301746945000801779946001301787655001201800991595367230742620221121232431.0910530e199011  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910014372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDolan, B.M.10aFamily features associated with normal body weight bulimia  ap. 639-647.  ap. 639-647. charts.  a2019-12-05  aThis study compares family features of 50 bulimic women with those of 40 noneating-disordered women from the same defined catchment area. The parents of the patients were significantly older at the birth of the child and significantly more came from different ethnic backgrounds. Bulimics reported greater parental conflict despite similar divorce rates. The bulimics' reports of the emotion, attention, and interaction from their parents were significantly less positive than were those of the comparison group. We argue that these family features of disparate parental background and poor verbal communication between family members predispose the children to difficulties with the verbal expression of emotion and to bulimia as a nonverbal expression of distress and dysphoria. These findings are related, using systemic family theories, to the strikingly specific age range of onset of bulimia to propose a model of family contributions to the etiology of this condition. While these controlled self-report measures cannot prove or disprove such a hypothesis, they provide sufficient support to justify further testing of the model. 3abinging 3aparent-child relationships 3afamily problems 3awomen 3aparents 3aage 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aEngland 0abulimia 0afamily relations1 aLiberman, Śimḥah Bunem ben Berekhyah.1 aEvans, C.1 aLacey, J.H.0 tInternational journal of eating disorders.g1990 Nov., v. 9, no. 6 p.639-647x0276-34787nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01896naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245007300132300001600205300002400221500001500245520101100260650001201271650001001283653002301293653004701316653001701363653001201380700001701392773009801409852000901507939003301516945000801549946001301557655001201570991595367090742620221121232526.0910102e198911  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI900016882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacobson, R.10aSocial dependency and social support in bulimic and nonbulimic women  ap. 665-670.  ap. 665-670. charts.  a2019-12-05  aWe tested the hypotheses that bulimic women would be characterized by a high degree of social dependency and low levels of social support and that bulimic and nonbulimic women would differ in the interaction of these two variables. A secondary hypothesis, derived from Boskind-White and White's feminist account of bulimia, was that bulimic women are characterized in particular by social dependency on men and a lack of social support from men. A group of 23 normal-weight bulimic women were compared with 38 control subjects and were found to differ only in that they reported more social dependency. There was no evidence that bulimics were lacking in social support, compared with controls, nor was there any relation between bulimia and the interaction of social dependency with social support. Contrary to Boskind-White and White's theory, both bulimic and nonbulimic women reported more social dependency on men than on women, and the size of this discrepancy was found to be equal for both samples. 3abinging 3awomen 0asocial interaction 0ainventory of socially supportive behaviors 0asexual roles 0abulimia1 aRobins, C.J.0 tInternational journal of eating disorders.g1989 Nov., v. 8, no. 6 p.665-670x0276-34787nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01971naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002600115245007600141300001400217300002200231520098100253650001901234650002101253650002101274650001501295653003201310653002001342653003001362700002101392700002801413700002101441773009801462852000901560939003301569945000801602946001101610655001201621991595366390742620221121222412.0841207e198404  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840060552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPope, Harrison G.

Although none of the male respondents met DSM-III criteria for either disorder, 1.0% to 4.2% of women met DSM-III criteria for a history of anorexia nervosa (with or without a history of bulimia), and an additional 6.5% to 18.6% met DSM-III criteria for a history of bulimia alone. Even when allowance is made for the number of nonrespondents, possible false-positive questionnaire responses, and the limitations of the DSM-III criteria themselves, the prevalence rates appear substantial. Taking into account the mean ages of various samples, these results agree closely with 2 previous studies that each examined a single sample of students. These results augment the growing evidence that the eating disorders represent a serious public health problem.

The EDI is a 64 item, self-report, multiscale measure designed for the assessment of psychological and behavioral traits common in anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia. The EDI consists of eight subscales measuring: 1) Drive for Thinness, 2) Bulimia, 3) Body Dissatisfaction, 4) Ineffectiveness, 5) Perfectionism, 6) Interpersonal Distrust, 7) Interoceptive Awareness and 8) Maturity Fears. Reliability (internal consistency) is established for all subscales and several indices of validity are presented. First, AN patients (N=113) are differentiated from female comparison (FC) subjects (N=577) using a cross-validation procedure. Secondly, patient self-report subscale scores agree with clinician ratings of subscale traits. Thirdly, clinically recovered AN patients score similarly to FCs on all subscales. Finally, convergent and discriminant validity are established for subscales. The EDI was also administered to groups of normal weight bulimic women, obese, and normal weight but formerly obese women, as well as a male comparison group.

This report is a single-case study of a 26-year-old bulimic female in which these factors were hypothesized to be functional elements. The intervention used a self-reinforcement program to establish appropriate stimulus control over proper nutritional habits (Stimulus Narrowing). Stimulus Narrowing was successfully implemented utilizing self-reinforcement, but Stimulus Narrowing did not reduce bulimia. Self-control relaxation was then implemented and was followed by an apparent reduction in the frequency of bulimic episodes. The results suggest that the "treatment package" of stimulus narrowing, self-reinforcement and self-control relaxation may be useful in the treatment of bulimia. Methodological and clinical implications are discussed and recommendations for future experimental-clinical research are offered.

Vaccinium angustifolium fruit production was significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) reduced by both the single and multiple treatments in all 3 years of the study. Fruit production by V. myrtilloides was significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) reduced only by the multiple treatment. The significant reduction in berry production by V. angustifolium contributed to an overall drop in the availability of blueberries (both species combined) on sprayed clearcuts in 1995 and 1996. Single and multiple treatments also significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) reduced fresh mass and dry mass of total berries in 1995 and 1996. Compared with the controls, reductions in cover for both blueberry species were only significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) with the Vision treatments. In clearcuts where V. angustifolium forms a major component of the Vaccinium spp. cover, the short-term reduction in fruit availability in sprayed areas may be considerable. 3aVaccinium angustifolium 3aleaf area 3afruit set 3aglyphosate 3acanopy gaps 3aPinus banksiana 3adefoliation 3aforest plantations 3abiomass 3aOntario 0acanopy 0afruits 0adry matter 0aVaccinium 0athinning 0avaccinium myrtilloides 0aground cover 0agrowth1 aMallik, A.U.1 aLautenschlager, R.A.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1998 June, v. 28, no. 6 p.841-851x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x98-0463Available from publisher's Web site  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle02797naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001200135245019000147300001600337500002300353500001500376520139200391650002201783650001901805650001201824650002501836650002101861650002301882650001701905650001401922650001201936650001101948650001701959650001701976650001901993650002002012650001102032653002602043700002202069773009502091852000902186856007502195930003302270945001302303946001102316655001202327IND2196134720221121191324.0981223e199806  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219613472DNAL7 a10.1139/x98-0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, S.10aComparisons of gas exchange parameters and shoot water relations of interior spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss x Picea engelmannii Parry ex.

Seedlings were subjected to four cycles of progressive soil drought by withholding water. Changes in net photosynthesis (P(n)), stomatal conductance (g(wv)), and predawn water potentials (psi pd) were measured during and after each drought cycle. Shoot tissue water relations parameters were measured using pressure-volume analysis at the beginning and end of the fourth drought cycle. When comparing drought cycle 1 with drought cycle 4, clones G351, N366, and T703 showed significantly reduced P(n), but g(wv) of all clones was not affected. Net photosynthesis and g(wv) decreased with psi pd more rapidly in clone W460 than in the remaining clones. When rewatered after drought, clone T703 had the most rapid P(n) and g(wv) recovery whereas clone G351 had the slowest recovery of P(n) and g(wv). Over four drought cycles, all clones photosynthesized at progressively lower psi pd, but adjustments in tissue water relations parameters were marginal. These results implied that gas exchange parameters were more sensitive than shoot tissue water relations parameters in detecting clonal variation in the physiological response of interior spruce under simulated drought conditions. 3aPicea engelmannii 3acarbon dioxide 3ahybrids 3astomatal conductance 3aclonal variation 3asoil water content 3agas exchange 3aseedlings 3adrought 3aclones 3awater stress 3aPicea glauca 3aphotosynthesis 3awater potential 3ashoots 0aplant-water relations1 aGrossnickle, S.C.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1998 June, v. 28, no. 6 p.820-830x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x98-0523Available from publisher's Web site  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle02301naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002100115245004800136300001400184300002200198500001500220520129200235650001101527650001501538650002101553650001201574653002601586653002101612700002301633700002301656711011301679773009801792852000901890939003301899945000801932946001101940655001201951991595365400742620221121191410.0840130e198306  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840040032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarner, David M.10aDoes anorexia nervosa occur on a continuum?  ap. 11-20.  ap. 11-20. charts.  a2019-12-05  aExtract: Psychological traits of patients with anorexia nervosa were compared with those of weight-preoccupied women from samples of college and ballet students. Weight-preoccupied subjects were selected on the basis of extreme scores on the Drive for Thinness subscale on the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI). Results indicated that on the Ineffectiveness, Interpersonal Distrust, and lack of Interoceptive Awareness subscales, relatively few of the weight-preoccupied women from the nonclinical group scored above the anorexia nervosa median. Using cluster analysis procedures, the weight-preoccupied women were divided into 2 subgroups. Cluster 1 was characterized by elevated scores on all EDI subscales, indicating significant psychopathology. Cluster 2 had elevated scores only on Drive for Thinness, Body Dissatisfaction, and Perfectionism and could be described as "normal dieters." These findings were interpreted as indicating that although there are some highly weight-preoccupied females who display psychopathology quite similar to anorexia nervosa, others only superficially resemble patients suffering from serious eating disorders. These results underscore the importance of a multidimensional evaluation of psychopathology in those suspected of anorexia nervosa.

Data were subjected to correlational, factorial, regression and analysis of variance procedures. In general, results showed the eating disorder indices to be independent of smoking and drinking behaviour. Smoking status and alcohol consumption were significantly related in that nonsmokers consumed less alcohol and reported being drunk less often than either smokers or ex-smokers. Self-control scores showed the greatest association with a measure of social desirability, although there were weak links to eating disorder indices and level of alcohol use. Self-control also emerged as the sole predictor of eating disorder measures. Finally, sex-role ideology was found to be a weak moderator of alcohol consumption such that the more feminist the ideology, the lower the level of intake. 3aeating disorders 3abody weight 3asmoking (habit) 3aalcoholic beverages 3acollege students 3awomen 3aattitudes and opinions 0asocial status 0asexual roles 0aself management 0aconsumption1 aBoland, F.J.0 tInternational journal of eating disorders.g1990 July, v. 9, no. 4 p.425-433x0276-34787nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01404naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245008300131300001600214300002400230520051200254650002100766650001200787650001500799650002200814650002300836650000800859650001000867653001200877700001600889773009800905852000901003939003301012945000801045946001301053655001201066991595365190742620221121191354.0910620e199007  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910017442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChannon, S.14aThe effect of short-term fasting on processing of food cues in normal subjects  ap. 447-452.  ap. 447-452. charts.  aThe effect of food deprivation on the selective processing of food- and body-size-related information was investigated using a modified version of the Stroop task.

Therefore, the understanding of species habitat requirements and spatio-temporal dynamics in occurrence is needed. We examined patch occupancy patterns of the Siberian flying squirrel Pteromys volans in northern Finland across a seven year study period. Forest patches dominated by mature spruce (Picea abies) in a study area (375 km²) were surveyed to monitor the presence or absence of the flying squirrel. The patch occupancy pattern was dynamic: about half of the habitat patches were occupied at least once during the study period and more patches were colonised than were abandoned. Patches that were continuously occupied (i.e. occupied during all sample periods) were typically of high quality (based on habitat and landscape characteristics), continuously unoccupied patches were usually of low quality, and intermediate quality patches were occupied intermittently. The variables explaining patch occupancy were similar each year, and a statistical model based on data from the year 2000 also predicted occupancy in 2004 with similar accuracy. However, data from a single survey were inadequate for identifying patches used intermittently by flying squirrels. Despite inconsistent occupancy, these patches may be important for the local persistence of flying squirrels. The dynamic occupancy pattern may thus affect estimates of suitable habitat area and identification of functional patch networks for landscape planning.

The other two genes, sat2 and ssh1, encode As II and Sh I toxins from the sea anemones Anemonia sulcata and Stichodactyla helianthus, respectively, and have a sarcotoxin signal sequence from the flesh fly Sarcophaga peregrina. The synthetic genes were inserted into a nonessential site in the genome of the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus under the control of an enhanced polyhedrin promoter. In all cases, insect cells infected with recombinant viruses produced toxins, and larvae infected with the recombinant viruses died more quickly than larvae infected with wild-type virus. The relative efficacy of the mag4-expressing recombinant was most-dependent. In Trichoplusia ni, sat2 expression was most effective, providing a 38.4% a reduction in time to death compared to the wild-type virus, while in Spodoptera frugiperda, the mag4-expressing recombinant was most effective, exhibiting a 37% reduction in time to death. 3agenetic transformation 3agene transfer 3aviral insecticides 3aApis mellifera 3aTrichoplusia ni 3ainsecticidal properties 3aBaculoviridae 3aneurotoxins 3agene expression 3aAutographa californica 3asynthetic genes 3aSpodoptera frugiperda 3amortality 3aSarcophaga peregrina 3agenetic engineering 3aCnidaria 3agenetic vectors 3aAgelenopsis aperta 3abiological control 0aanemonia sulcata 0arecombinant baculovirus 0aNucleopolyhedrovirus 0akill time 0aefficacy 0astichodactyla heliathus 0atoxin genes 0achimeric genes1 aRobson, M.1 aWarmke, J.W.1 aCohen, C.J.1 aSmith, M.M.1 aWang, P.1 aWarren, V.1 aKaczorowski, G.1 aPloeg, L.H.T. van der.1 aMiller, L.K.0 tBiological control.g1996 Oct., v. 7, no. 2 p.236-244x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02039naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001900154245008200173300001600255500002400271520099100295650001801286650002401304650001101328650001601339650001001355650001501365650002301380650001301403650002201416650001401438700001301452700001501465700001501480773010401495852000901599856005701608655001201665IND4451879920221121160414.0110401e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445187992DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2109.1992.tb00786.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvnimelech, Y.10aControl and utilization of inorganic nitrogen in intensive fish culture ponds  ap. 421-430.  aIncludes references  aOne of the main obstacles toward the intensification of aquaculture systems is the accumulation of inorganic nitrogen in the water, A solution demonstrated in this work is to control inorganic nitrogen levels through the induction of microbial protein synthesis. This is achieved by adding a carbonaceous substrate, adjusted in a way so as to supply the needed carbon to immobilize all the non-utilized nitrogen. Inorganic nitrogen levels are reduced due to the resulting production of microbial protein. The in situ produced microbial protein is a substitute to the protein added with the feed. Fish growth in the treated ponds was higher than the growth in conventionally fed ponds. Protein utilization was doubled due to the recycling of nitrogen in the pond system, leading to diminution of the deleterious inorganic nitrogen accumulation. The price of feed was reduced to 50-67% of that common in conventional ponds, due both to replacement of protein and limited wash-out of feed. 3aanimal growth 3aaquaculture systems 3acarbon 3afeed prices 3afeeds 3afish ponds 3amicrobial proteins 3anitrogen 3aprotein synthesis 3arecycling1 aDIAB, S.1 aKOCHVA, M.1 aMOKADY, S.0 tAquaculture research.g1992 July, v. 23, no. 4 p.421-430dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.1992.tb00786.x 7aarticle03594naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245022700129300001600356500001500372520166400387650002802051650002002079650001702099650002702116650001302143650002302156650004102179650001602220650002102236650003002257650003002287650002802317650001702345650002602362650001602388650001602404650002002420650002002440650002302460650000902483650001602492650001202508651001002520653001902530653001202549653003302561653002702594653003302621653002702654653002102681700002402702700001302726700001902739700002202758700002102780773007502801852000902876930003302885945001302918946001302931655001202944IND2060893920221121160343.0971215e199610  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206089392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChatterjee, A.10aIsolation of ant mutants of Pseudomonas fluorescens strain Pf7-14 altered in antibiotic production, cloning of ant+ DNA, and evaluation of the role of antibiotic production in the control of blast and sheath blight of rice  ap. 185-195.  a2019-12-05  aPseudomonas fluorescens strain 7-14 (Pf7-14) isolated from the rice rhizosphere produces antibiotic(s) active against Pyricularia sp., Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium ultimum and Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici. Mutagenesis of Pf714 with ethyl methane sulfonate or (EMS) or transposon (mini-Tn5-Km) yielded antibiotic-defective mutants belonging to the following classes. Class I mutants, generated by EMS or mini-Tn5-Km, are totally deficient in antifungal antibiotics, i.e., are Ant-. Class II mutants were recovered following mutagenesis with mini-Tn5-Km; they produce reduced levels of antibiotics, i.e., are Antleaky. Class III mutants overproduce antibiotics; they were generated by EMS mutagenesis. Insertions of mini-Tn5-Km into at least four different chromosomal sites caused defects in C antibiotic production. To further analyze ant genes affecting antibiotic production, we isolated Ant+ plasmids from a genomic library of the strain Pf714. Of the several plasmids that appeared to carry ant loci, pAKC908 was unusual in that it restored antibiotic production in all of our Class I and Class II mutants. By mutagenesis of pAKC908 with Tn3HoHo1 we localized a DNA region required for antibiotic production. Southern hybridization data and the complementation pattern of the Ant+ plasmids indicated clustering of the ant genes in Pf714. Field trials with an Ant-deficient mutant carrying a single-site mini-Tn5-Km insertion a revealed that antibiotic production by Pf714 was required for the control of blast as well as sheath blight. The data also show that Pf714 was as effective as the fungicide tricyclazole in controlling these rice diseases. 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3arecombinant DNA 3aOryza sativa 3aethyl methanesulfonate 3aplasmids 3aMagnaporthe grisea 3aGaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici 3atransposons 3astructural genes 3abiological control agents 3afungal diseases of plants 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3atricyclazole 3aantifungal properties 3amutagenesis 3aPyricularia 3adisease control 3aPythium ultimum 3abiological control 3aloci 3aantibiotics 3amutants 3aIndia 0afungus control 0acloning 0aantibiotic defective mutants 0atransposon mutagenesis 0aplant diseases and disorders 0aantifungal antibiotics 0aantibiotic genes1 aValasubramanian, R.1 aMa, W.L.1 aVachhani, A.K.1 aGnanamanickam, S.1 aChatterjee, A.K.0 tBiological control.g1996 Oct., v. 7, no. 2 p.185-195x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02863naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245016000124300001600284500001500300520139500315650002801710650001701738650002601755650002201781650003001803650002001833650002201853650001401875650001701889650002401906650002801930650002401958650003201982650002302014653002402037653003002061653002802091653003102119653002602150653001702176700001802193700001502211773007502226852000902301930003302310945001302343946001302356655001202369IND2060893320221121160327.0971215e199610  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206089332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, L.10aEvaluating prey preference by several phytoseiid predators for Mononychellus tanajoa (Bondar) and M. caribbeanae McGregor (Acari: Tetranychidae) in cassava  ap. 179-184.  a2019-12-05  aFive phytoseiid predators from the dry regions of Colombia and Ecuador, which are candidate classical biological control agents of the cassava green mite, were evaluated for preference of the predominant indigenous prey, Mononychellus caribbeanae McGregor, and the target prey, Mononychellus tanajoa (Bondar). Preference by adult female phytoseiids was measured in two-choice, split-leaf-disk experiments using four parameters: consumption of prey eggs, consumption of prey immatures, location of phytoseiid eggs, and periodic observations of the location of the foraging adult female phytoseiid. None of the phytoseiid species showed any preference with respect to the consumption of prey tetranychid eggs. Galendromus helveolus Denmark, Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor), and Neoseiulus idaeus Denmark and Muma showed substantial preference for M. tanajoa. Typhlodromalus tenuiscutus McMurtry & Moraes was the only species that failed to show a preference for either tetranychid for any of the parameters. Typhlodromalus manihoti (Moraes) showed a preference only for M. tanajoa immatures. None of the phytoseiids exhibited a preference for M. caribbeanae in any of the assays, so they can all be considered suitable biological control candidates with respect to preference for these two prey species. The results are compared with results from previously published olfactometer studies. 3ainterspecific variation 3aTyphlodromus 3aMononychellus tanajoa 3aAmblyseius idaeus 3abiological control agents 3apredatory mites 3aManihot esculenta 3apredation 3amite control 3anontarget organisms 3aNeoseiulus californicus 3afeeding preferences 3apredator-prey relationships 3abiological control 0aspecies differences 0amononychellus caribbeanae 0atyphlodromalus manihoti 0atyphlodromalus tenuiscutus 0agalendromus helveolus 0aPhytoseiidae1 aCuellar, M.E.1 aMelo, E.L.0 tBiological control.g1996 Oct., v. 7, no. 2 p.179-184x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle01746naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245007700175300001800252520052400270592002800794650001300822650002600835650001600861650001200877650001700889653002800906653002900934653001600963653002100979700002101000700001701021700002001038700001801058700002101076700001901097700002201116773010501138856008401243852000901327655001201336IND60122268020221120215338.0150325e20141002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012226802DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2014.9308602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCiocarlan, Alexandru10aFormal synthesis of ( − )-pereniporin B and ( − )-cinnamosmolide  ap. 1619-1625.  aThe paper describes a new pathway for an efficient synthesis of natural and bioactive drimanic compounds (−)-pereniporin B (1) and (−)-cinnamosmolide (2) from ketodiol 7 , an intermediate obtained before from accessible labdane diterpenoid (+)-larixol (3).

The problem of those angle sensors was the complex mechanical structure which result in the difficulty of installation and maintenance. However, the gyroscope had the advantages of simple installation and long working life. But the gyroscope bias causes the error accumulates over time in automatic driving system. To solve this problem, a wheel steering angle measurement system based on double Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) antennas and two Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) gyroscopes was proposed. The double GNSS antennas system provided the speed, attitude angle, latitude and longitude of the vehicle. In addition, one MEMS gyroscope was mounted on the wheel and measured the steering rate and another MEMS gyroscope was mounted on the vehicle to measure the heading angular rate. Meanwhile, an adaptive Kalman filter using the above data was designed to correct the errors of integration of the gyroscope data. The adaptive filter could adjust the noise matrix according to the changes of system noise caused by road conditions and different tools. At the same time, the lever-arm compensation algorithm was used to solve the speed error caused by lever-arm. Experiment was carried out to verify the effectiveness of the system. The average error of the straight line experiment was 0.06 and the error variance was 0.215 and the curve line experiment’s mean error was 0.746 and the error variance was 0.908. The result of the experiments showed that this system could meet the request of automatic driving system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aglobal positioning systems 3alatitude 3alongitude 3aprecision agriculture 3avariance 0aDouble GNSS antennas 0aMEMS gyroscope 0aSteering angle 0aAdaptive Kalman filter 0aLever-arm1 aChu, Huanxin1 aCao, Juanjuan1 aSun, Zhihui1 aYi, Ranran0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2018 Oct., v. 153 p.196-201dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2018.08.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03148naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245016900164520175200333592002802085650002702113650002602140650001502166650002102181650001502202650001302217650002102230650002202251650001702273653001402290653002302304653001702327653003102344653001702375700001602392700001602408700001102424700001602435700005702451773011202508856008502620852000902705655001202714IND60782143120221118224432.0220824e20221015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078214312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2022.1207742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Lili10aNovel bifunctional fillers (ATP/P–CNOs) for sulfonated poly(aryl ether sulfone) matrix for improved power output and durability of H2/O2 fuel cell at low humidity  aThe preparation of novel composite proton exchange membranes (PEMs) with homogeneous structures and efficient proton-conducting sites is of great importance for the development of PEM fuel cells. In this work, a double-filler of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and phosphorylated carbon nano-onions (P–CNOs) is incorporated into sulfonated poly(aryl ether sulfone) (SPAES) by simple solution mixing to design a bionic proton-conduction pathways for high-performance PEMs. A series of uniformly distributed, dense and flexible SPAES/ATP/P–CNOs membranes are prepared and characterized for their membrane morphology, water uptake, dimensional stability, electrochemical properties and durability. Both the ATP and P–CNOs fillers can provide abundant proton conducting sites through hydrogen-bonding networks and acid-base pairs, thus improving the membrane stability and proton conductivity. Thanks to the formation of ionic interaction between ATP/P–CNOs and their interaction with SPAES substrates, the composite membranes demonstrate higher ATP retention, better dimensional-mechanical-chemical stability, higher proton conductivity and power output than the pristine and single-filler SPAES membranes. The SPAES/ATP/P–CNOs-2 membrane displays high proton conductivity (196 mS/cm at 90 °C in water and 33 mS/cm at 80 °C/51% relative humidity, RH) and power output (752 mW/cm² at 80 °C/100% RH and 302 mW/cm² at 80 °C/50% RH) in a H₂/O₂ fuel cell. It also experiences the minimal cell performance loss and lowest hydrogen crossover during 6 days of operation at 60% RH. The proposed ATP/P–CNOs channel approach can provide a reference for the development of multi-component composite high-efficiency PEMs for fuel cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3adimensional stability 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3afuel cells 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen bonding 3arelative humidity 3awater uptake 0aFuel cell 0aComposite membrane 0aATP/P–CNOs 0aElectrochemical durability 0aLow humidity1 aWang, Yuhao1 aLiu, Shouyi1 aLi, Na1 aHu, Zhaoxia1 aChen, Shouwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0607-65860 tJournal of membrane science.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 660 p.120774-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2022.1207743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011400170520158600284592002801870650000801898650001901906650001101925650001801936650002101954650002201975650001101997650002202008650001202030650001802042650001902060650001902079653002602098653002502124653003102149653001402180653002402194700001902218700002002237700002502257700002402282773012002306856008202426852000902508655001202517IND60782704120221119192818.0220921e20221015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078270412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2022.1677192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, Christal R.10aCharacterization of a Primordial Major Capsid-Scaffolding Protein Complex in Icosahedral Virus Shell Assembly  aCapsid assembly pathways are strongly conserved in the complex dsDNA viruses, where major capsid proteins (MCP) self-assemble into icosahedral procapsid shells, chaperoned by a scaffolding protein. Without a scaffold, the capsid proteins aggregate and form aberrant structures. This, coupled with the rapid co-polymerization of MCP and scaffolding proteins, has thwarted characterization of the earliest steps in shell assembly. Here we interrogate the structure and biophysical properties of a soluble, assembly-deficient phage lambda major capsid protein, MCP(W308A). The mutant protein is folded, soluble to high concentrations and binds to the scaffolding protein in an apparent SP₂:MCP(W308A)₁ stoichiometry but does not assemble beyond this initiating complex. The MCP(W308A) crystal structure was solved to 2.7 Å revealing the canonical HK97 fold in a “pre-assembly” conformation featuring the conserved N-arm and E-loops folded into the body of the protein. Structural, biophysical and computational analyses suggest that MCP(W308A) is thermodynamically trapped in this pre-assembly conformation precluding self-association interactions required for shell assembly. A model is described wherein dynamic interactions between MCP proteins play an essential role in high fidelity viral shell assembly. Scaffold-chaperoned MCP polymerization is a strongly conserved process in all the large dsDNA viruses and our results provide insight into this primordial complex in solution and have broad biological significance in our understanding of virus assembly mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abacteriophages 3acapsid 3acoat proteins 3acopolymerization 3acrystal structure 3amodels 3amolecular biology 3amutants 3astoichiometry 3athermodynamics 3avirus assembly 0avirus capsid assembly 0amajor capsid protein 0ashell nucleation complexes 0aHK97 fold 0ascaffolding protein1 aBackos, Donald1 aMorais, Marc C.1 aChurchill, Mair E.A.1 aCatalano, Carlos E.0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 434, no. 19 p.167719-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2022.1677193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03701naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008600167300001600253520205300269592002802322650001502350650001302365650002002378650000902398650001302407650002002420650001302440650002602453650001802479650001102497650004402508650002502552650001402577650001002591653001002601653003402611653003702645653002502682653001902707653000802726653000802734653000802742653000902750653001002759653000802769653000802777700001602785700001402801700001802815700001802833700001302851700001602864773012502880856008503005852000903090655001203099IND60611501220221121023549.0200503e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061150122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2018.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yaqian10aIdentification of maize haploid kernels based on hyperspectral imaging technology  ap. 188-195.  aHaploid breeding is a significant technology of maize breeding. Rapid and accurate haploid kernel identification method has great significance to accelerating the efficiency of haploid breeding. At present, detecting genetic markers on the embryo of kernels by machine vision and determining oil content of maize kernels by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) are widely used to automatically identify haploid maize kernel. However, the machine vision method can only identify the haploid through embryo side of kernels, and the NMR method cannot distinguish them when haploid and diploid have the overlap oil content. The study was aimed exploring a rapid and accurate method to identify haploid maize kernel using near-infrared hyperspectral imaging technology to overcome the limitations of current automated haploid identification and to achieve more accurate screening of haploid. In terms of two representative varieties of maize (Zhengdan 958 and Nongda 616), the study adopted spectral features of hyperspectral imaging to discuss the influence of embryonic orientation (embryo faces to or against light source) on haploid identification model. Meanwhile, the separability of embryo and non-embryo and identification accuracy of joint modeling of embryo and non-embryo were analyzed. The study showed that the greater difference between embryo and non-embryo of haploid and diploid, but hyperspectral imaging method could effectively distinguish haploid and diploid through embryo or non-embryo. At the same time, with the qualitative analysis method, two maize varieties could accurately distinguished haploid and diploid with overlapping oil content based on joint modeling. In this case, the test set of haploid and diploid achieved yielded higher correct acceptance rate (CAR) of 99% and the false acceptance rate (FAR) were both below 1%, with a high accuracy rate. The study showed that it is feasible to recognize maize haploid using hyperspectral imaging technology, which can provide a reference for the later haploid sorting systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3abreeding 3acomputer vision 3acorn 3adiploidy 3agenetic markers 3ahaploidy 3ahyperspectral imagery 3alipid content 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aqualitative analysis 3ascreening 3aseeds 0aMaize 0aHaploid kernel identification 0aHyperspectral imaging technology 0aQualitative analysis 0aJoint modeling 0aNMR 0aCAR 0aFAR 0aROIs 0aBULDP 0aBPR 0aPCA1 aLv, Yingjun1 aLiu, Huan1 aWei, Yaoguang1 aZhang, Junwen1 aAn, Dong1 aWu, Jianwei0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2018 Oct., v. 153 p.188-195dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2018.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04448naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245011400159300001800273520253000291592002802821650003702849650001502886650001602901650001602917650002402933650001302957650000902970650001202979650001002991650001103001650001603012650001403028650001003042650002003052650001103072650001603083650001203099650000903111650001603120650001503136650002103151650001703172650001903189651001103208651001403219651001103233651001103244651001003255651001003265651001003275653000903285653001603294653001503310653002203325700001703347700001703364700002003381700001403401700001503415700001703430700002403447700001303471773015403484856007903638852000903717655001203726IND60609486120221120133904.0200427e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060948612DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2017-140152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPulina, G.10aInvited review: Current production trends, farm structures, and economics of the dairy sheep and goat sectors  ap. 6715-6729.  aDairy small ruminants account for approximately 21% of all sheep and goats in the world, produce around 3.5% of the world's milk, and are mainly located in subtropical-temperate areas of Asia, Europe, and Africa. Dairy sheep are concentrated around the Mediterranean and Black Sea regions, where their dairy products are typical ingredients of the human diet. Dairy goats are concentrated in low-income, food-deficit countries of the Indian subcontinent, where their products are a key food source, but are also present in high-income, technologically developed countries. This review evaluates the status of the dairy sheep and goat sectors in the world, with special focus on the commercially and technically developed industries in France, Greece, Italy, and Spain (FGIS). Dairy small ruminants account for a minor part of the total agricultural output in France, Italy, and Spain (0.9 to 1.8%) and a larger part in Greece (8.8%). In FGIS, the dairy sheep industry is based on local breeds and crossbreeds raised under semi-intensive and intensive systems and is concentrated in a few regions in these countries. Average flock size varies from small to medium (140 to 333 ewes/farm), and milk yield from low to medium (85 to 216 L/ewe), showing substantial room for improvement. Most sheep milk is sold to industries and processed into traditional cheese types, many of which are Protected Denomination of Origin (PDO) cheeses for gourmet and export markets (e.g., Pecorino, Manchego, and Roquefort). By comparing break-even milk price among FGIS countries, we observed the following: (1) most Greek and French dairy sheep farms were unprofitable, with the exception of the intensive Chios farms of Greece; (2) milk price was aligned with cost of production in Italy; and (3) profitable farms coexisted with unprofitable farms in Spain. In FGIS, dairy goat production is based on local breeds raised under more extensive systems than sheep. Compared with sheep, average dairy goat herds are smaller (36 to 190 does/farm) but milk yield is greater (153 to 589 L/doe), showing room for improvement. Goat milk is mainly processed on-farm into dairy products for national markets, but some PDO goat milk cheeses (e.g., Murcia al Vino) are exported. Processed goat milk is sold for local human consumption or dehydrated for export. Mixed sheep-goat (e.g., Feta) and cow-sheep-goat milk cheeses are common in many countries. Strategies to improve the dairy sheep and goat sectors in these 4 countries are proposed and discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFederal Grain Inspection Service 3acrossbreds 3adairy goats 3adairy sheep 3adeveloped countries 3aewe milk 3aewes 3aexports 3afarms 3aflocks 3agoat cheese 3agoat milk 3aherds 3ahuman nutrition 3ahumans 3aingredients 3amarkets 3amilk 3amilk prices 3amilk yield 3aproduction costs 3asheep breeds 3asheep industry 3aAfrica 3aBlack Sea 3aFrance 3aGreece 3aIndia 3aItaly 3aSpain 0amilk 0adairy sheep 0adairy goat 0aproduction system1 aMilán, M.J.1 aLavín, M.P.1 aTheodoridis, A.1 aMorin, E.1 aCapote, J.1 aThomas, D.L.1 aFrancesconi, A.H.D.1 aCaja, G.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2018 Aug., v. 101, no. 8 p.6715-6729dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-140153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100004100138245013900179300001800318500002000336520151600356592002801872650002001900650002601920650002201946650002201968650001501990650001702005650002002022650001402042650001402056650001302070650001602083650001202099650001502111650002502126650001502151650002202166650001402188650001302202650001502215650002502230651001502255651001102270700003602281700003102317700003002348700003502378700002302413773012302436856007202559852000902631655001202640IND60584943020221120052718.0171028e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058494302DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.38752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández‐Guzmán, Félix Augusto10aTreated wastewater effluent as a source of pyrethroids and fipronil at todos santos bay, Mexico: Its impact on sediments and organisms  ap. 3057-3064.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPyrethroids are insecticides widely used to control pests and disease vectors in residential areas and agricultural lands. Pyrethroids are emerging pollutants, and their use is a growing concern because of their toxicity potential to aquatic organisms. Todos Santos Bay and the Punta Banda estuary, 2 coastal bodies located to the south of the Southern California Bight, were studied to establish a baseline of the current conditions of pollution by pyrethroids and fipronil. Eight pyrethroids, along with fipronil and its 2 metabolites, were determined in effluents from wastewater‐treatment plants (n = 3), surface sediments (n = 32), and 3 locations with mussels (Mytilus californianus, n = 9). Bifenthrin, permethrin, and cypermethrin were the most common pyrethroids found in the study areas and were widespread in sediments, mussels, and wastewater‐treated effluents. Fipronil and its metabolites were detected in mussels and wastewater‐treated effluents only. Total pyrethroid concentrations in sediments ranged from 0.04 to 1.95 ng/g dry weight in the Punta Banda estuary (n = 13) and from 0.07 to 6.62 ng/g dry weight in Todos Santos Bay (n = 19). Moreover, total pyrethroids in mussels ranged from 1.19 to 6.15 ng/g wet weight. Based on the toxic unit data calculated for pyrethroids and fipronil for Eohaustorius estuarius and Hyalella azteca, little to no impact is expected to the benthic population structure.

So far, however, little is known about its quality characteristics and bacterial community. The quality of Huanghua salt-fermented shrimp paste was evaluated in this work by determining the pH values, amino acid nitrogen (AAN), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitrite and biogenic amines (BAs). Moreover, the bacterial community of shrimp paste was analyzed by using the high-throughput sequencing technology. The results showed that the pH, AAN, MDA, nitrite and total BA content in shrimp paste were in ranges of 6.77–8.25, 0.16–0.35 g/100 g, 0.25–1.10 mg/kg, 0.18–0.49 mg/kg and 18.20–469.02 mg/kg, respectively. The main BAs were tryptamine, histamine and tyramine. Bacterial community analysis indicated that Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the most dominant phylum in all shrimp paste samples. Enterococcaceae, Pseudomonadaceae and Staphylococcaceae were the most predominant family. The major bacteria genera in shrimp paste were Tetragenococcus, Lactobacillus and Halanaerobium. The correlation between AAN, histamine and tyramine contents and Tetragenococcus were 0.71, 0.62 and 0.67 (R² values), respectively. These findings expand the understanding for Huanghua salt-fermented shrimp paste and provide a theoretical basis for improving the fermentation process of shrimp paste.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcaceae 3aHalanaerobium 3aLactobacillus 3aPseudomonadaceae 3aStaphylococcaceae 3aTetragenococcus 3aamino acids 3abacterial communities 3afermentation 3ahistamine 3amalondialdehyde 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3apH 3ashrimp 3atryptamine 3atyramine 3aChina 0aShrimp paste 0aBacterial community 0aQuality characteristics 0aBiogenic amines 0aHigh-throughput sequencing1 aLu, Haiqiang1 aHe, Zehe1 aSang, Yaxin1 aSun, Jilu0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 Jan., v. 136 p.110358-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1103583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245012300165300001600288520102300304592002801327650003301355650001601388650001301404650002601417650002401443650001301467650001101480650004401491653001201535653001401547653002401561653001201585653001301597700001501610700001301625700002301638700001601661700001501677700001801692773010601710856008701816852000901903655001201912IND60581264920221117200224.0190409e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058126492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.07.1612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yu10aAutoclaved sludge as the ideal seed to culture anammox bacteria: Reactor performance and microbial community diversity  ap. 391-399.  aReducing activity of commensal bacteria in inocula may enhance anammox bacteria proliferation and realization of anammox process. Fast start-up of anammox process in an UASB reactor was successfully achieved by using autoclaved sludge (anaerobic granular sludge pretreated by autoclaving) and 0.3% active anammox sludge as inoculum. Continuous experiments indicated that R2 (autoclaved sludge addition) could shorten the start-up period from 72days to 63days. The first 50days anammox population specific growth rates (μ) of R1 (the control) and R2 were determined to be 0.014d−1 and 0.045d−1 using q-PCR assays. Analysis of coefficient of variations of nitrogen removal performance during days 96–225 indicated that R2 was more stable than R1. The Illumina MiSeq sequencing showed that autoclaving could decrease microbial diversity of sludge and enhance the abundance of anammox bacteria. Furthermore, PICRUSt community functions forecast and c-di-GMP measure illuminated the result of higher stability in R2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3aautoclaving 3ainoculum 3amicrobial communities 3anitrifying bacteria 3anitrogen 3asludge 3aupflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor 0aAnammox 0aAutoclave 0aMicrobial community 0aPICRUSt 0ac-di-GMP1 aBu, Cui-Na1 aKang, Qi1 aAhmad, Hafiz Adeel1 aZhang, Jian1 aGao, Baoyu1 aNi, Shou-Qing0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Nov., v. 244 p.391-399dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.07.1613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03417naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245015900162300001800321520186200339592002802201650004802229650001102277650001602288650001502304650001602319650003802335650001002373650001402383650002102397650001402418650000902432650001102441650002102452650001902473650002302492653002102515653002002536653002302556653002702579700001702606700001902623700001802642700002102660773015402681856007902835852000902914655001202923IND60609486520221120133757.0200427e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060948652DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2017-137462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartins, E.G.10aAssociation of paratuberculosis sero-status with milk production and somatic cell counts across 5 lactations, using multilevel mixed models, in dairy cows  ap. 7638-7649.  aThe aim of this work was to investigate associations between individual cow Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) seropositivity, 305-d corrected milk production, and somatic cell count during 5 lactations lifespan in Portuguese dairy herds using multilevel mixed models. We used MAP serum ELISA (Idexx MAP Ac, Idexx Laboratories Inc., Westbrook, ME) results (n = 23,960) from all the 20,221 adult cows present in 329 farms and corresponding 47,586 lactation records from the National Dairy Improvement Association. Cows and farms were classified as positive or negative. Multilevel mixed models were used to investigate the association of cow MAP status with variation in milk production and somatic cell count. Cow MAP status, farm status, and lactation number were considered as independent variables. A quadratic function of lactation number was used to mimic the effect of lactation order on milk production. The models considered 3 levels: measurement occasion (level 1) within cow (level 2) and cow within farm (level 3). Four final models were produced, including all herds and cows, to address the effect of farm status (models 1 and 2) or the effect of cow status (models 3 and 4) on the outcome variables. Our results show that MAP status affects milk production. Losses are detectable from third lactation onward. During the first 5 lactations, positive cows accumulated an average loss of 1,284.8 kg of milk when compared with the negative cows. We also observed that somatic cell counts were higher in positive cows and a positive interaction occurs between cow status and lactation number, suggesting a positive association between MAP infection and increased somatic cell counts. Our results are in line with previous studies, suggesting a possible positive relation between cow milk production and susceptibility to MAP infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3aadults 3ablood serum 3adairy cows 3adairy herds 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afarms 3alactation 3alactation number 3alongevity 3amilk 3amodels 3aparatuberculosis 3aseroprevalence 3asomatic cell count 0aparatuberculosis 0amilk production 0asomatic cell count 0amultilevel mixed model1 aOliveira, P.1 aOliveira, B.M.1 aMendonça, D.1 aNiza-Ribeiro, J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2018 Aug., v. 101, no. 8 p.7638-7649dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-137463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01969naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245006600164300001800230520076400248592002801012650001501040650003401055650001901089650002501108650001701133650001801150650001101168650002201179650004401201650001301245653002301258653001201281653002101293653001701314700001301331700001601344773010601360856008401466852000901550655001201559IND60122268620221120214613.0150325e20141018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012226862DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2014.9342382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jie12aA new sesquiterpenoid from the rhizomes of Homalomena occulta  ap. 1669-1673.  aChemical constituents of EtOAc extract from the rhizomes of traditional Chinese medicine Qian-nian-jian (Homalomena occulta) have been studied, a new sesquiterpenoid, named euadesma-4-ene-1β,15-diol (1), and four related known compounds, polydactin B (2), oplodiol (3), 1β,4β,7α-trihydroxyeudesmane (4), and (–)1β,4β,6α-trihydroxy-eudesmane (5), were isolated.

Modulation of oocyte cAMP during IVM by using phosphodiesterase inhibitors has been shown to maintain elevated oocyte cAMP concentrations and control meiotic resumption of bovine and ovine oocytes. This study determined the effect of inclusion of isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) during collection and the first 12 hours of incubation of equine oocytes on cAMP concentration and glucose metabolism of cumulus–oocyte complexes (COCs). Abattoir-derived COCs were collected in aspiration medium with (Asp-IBMX) or without (Asp) IBMX. Cumulus–oocyte complexes were then incubated for 12 hours in IVM medium with (Mat-IBMX) or without (Mat) IBMX, followed by additional 24 hours in Mat medium. The cAMP concentration, glucose consumption, lactate production, and metaphase II rates of the COCs were assessed. Cumulus–oocyte complexes aspirated into Asp-IBMX (62.2 ± 2.6 fmol per COC) medium had higher cAMP concentration than Asp (31.8 ± 2.8 fmol per COC) control group (P < .05). Likewise, at 12 hours of IVM, Mat-IBMX group (33.2 ± 2.1 fmol per COC) had higher cAMP concentration than the Mat group (7.68 ± 0.5 fmol per COC; P < .05). Glucose consumption and lactate production were lower during the first 12 hours of incubation in COCs cultured in Mat-IBMX (P < .05). Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine prevented the rapid drop in cAMP concentration and altered metabolism of glucose by the COC. Preventing the sudden drop in cAMP prevents the premature nuclear maturation of in vitro–matured oocytes causing poor developmental competence.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle 3acyclic AMP 3aglucose 3ahorses 3alactic acid 3ameiosis 3ametabolism 3ametaphase 3aoocytes 3aovarian follicles 3asheep 3aveterinary medicine 0aNuclear maturation rates 0acAMP 0aEquine 0aIn vitro maturation 0aIBMX1 aKind, Karen1 aKelly, Jennifer1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3975-215X1 aKleemann, Dave1 aLen, Jose1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9993-90120 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2020 Aug., v. 91 p.103112-dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2020.1031123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245012800174520167600302592002801978650001202006650001202018650001902030650001402049650001602063650001102079650001602090650002202106653002002128653001302148653001002161653001002171653001902181700001502200773009502215856008902310852000902399655001202408IND60686878920221119234333.0220614e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068687892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.1045712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvashia, Vidhee10aImplications of land use transitions and climate change on local flooding in urban areas: An assessment of 42 Indian cities  aUrban development induced land transitions affect urban hydrology, resulting in increased flooding risks. Climate change-related precipitation changes are an added complexity to the flood risks of cities. This study examines the role of land use changes in determining the occurrence of urban flooding events across 42 Indian cities under current and future climate change scenarios. Landsat images for 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2017 have been processed using a hybrid classification technique to determine the land use shares for all cities. A typical event-count study using newspaper archives has been conducted to create a flooding event database. A multilevel model employing logistic mixed-effects approach was used. Future projections of the occurrence of flooding events for nine models under three climate change-related Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)—2.6, 4.5, and 8.5—and three urban development scenarios have been carried out. The results suggest that cities should preserve the land uses that act as a sponge—the green, open and blue spaces. As these spaces decrease, the projected flooding events increase. Under the RCP 2.6 scenario, the number of flooding events is significantly lower (95 % confidence) than under RCPs 4.5 and 8.5. The expected flooding occurrences between RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 are not significantly different (95 % confidence) for many scenarios, suggesting that Indian cities should aim for a world temperature increase of below 2 °C, or devastating consequences are imminent. This study highlights the need for Indian cities to undertake integrated spatial planning measures for a resilient, sustainable urban future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adatabases 3aland policy 3amodels 3atemperature 3aurban development 0aLand use change 0aFlooding 0aIndia 0aUrban 0aClimate change1 aGarg, Amit0 tLand use policy.g2020 June, v. 95 p.104571-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.1045713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01909naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245011700173300001800290520062100308592002800929650002300957650002300980650002101003650001101024650002901035650001401064650001401078700001901092700001701111700001501128700002701143700002501170700006101195700005501256773012001311856008301431852000901514655001201523IND60646414320221118000924.0190610e20190522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064641432DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b013952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhairnar, Pankaj V.13aAn Intramolecular Wittig Approach toward Heteroarenes: Synthesis of Pyrazoles, Isoxazoles, and Chromenone-oximes  ap. 4219-4223.  aα-Halohydrazones/ketoximes are transformed into trisubstituted pyrazoles/disubstituted isoxazoles by treatment with phosphine, acyl chloride, and a base.

To meet the environmental requirements, deep desulfurization of high sulfur-containing liquid fuels is necessary. In this paper, the combination of electrochemical oxidation and solvent extraction was proposed to reduce the sulfur content in condensate gasoline. FTIR and GC-FPD were utilized to analyze oxidation products and confirm the reaction process. The experimental results indicated that adding a supporting electrolyte such as sodium chloride can markedly promote the oxidative desulfurization process. The oxidation products with strong polarity can be extracted by polar solvents effectively. The optimal electrochemical oxidation conditions were as follows: supporting electrolyte, electrolysis temperature, electrolysis time, volume ratio of electrolyte solution to raw oil and stirring rate were 4mol L⁻¹ NaCl, 298 K, 50 min, 3.0, 500 rpm, respectively. After electrochemical oxidation and three-stage extraction, the sulfur content of the condensate gasoline decreased from 3478.4 μg g⁻¹ to 13.1 μg g⁻¹ and desulfurization efficiency reached 99.62%. Furthermore, the mechanism of electrochemical oxidation and solvent extraction desulfurization has been discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aair pollution 3acondensates 3adesulfurization 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolysis 3aelectrolytes 3agas chromatography 3agasoline 3aliquids 3amixing 3aoils 3aoxidation 3asodium chloride 3asolvents 3asulfides 3asulfur 3atemperature1 aNiuyuetaohua,1 aLi, Jing-jing1 aWang, Fang1 aQing, Da-yong0 tRSC advances.g2015 June 17, v. 5, no. 66 p.53455-53461dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra06851g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03625naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024003600133040001800169100006200187245013400249500001900383506007600402506003100478520162300509592002802132596004502160506003702205650002502242650001202267650001702279650001302296650001802309650001702327650001402344650001102358650001402369650001102383650001102394650002802405650000702433650002402440650002102464650001702485650001002502650002402512650002502536650001602561650000902577653001002586653001002596653001402606653001002620653001202630700002502642700002302667700006202690700002302752773012002775856008302895852000902978655001202987IND60696296420221207074102.0200719e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069629642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2020.1031272chorus7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2020.1031272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalpin, Michael Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5338-089010aEffects of Sodium Caseinate and Varying Protein Sources on In Vitro Fermentation of Forages by Mixed Equine Cecal Microorganisms  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aTo assess the impact of protein on fermentation by equine cecal microorganisms, cecal fluid from 4 cecally cannulated horses was used to inoculate fermentation bottles containing buffer, forage, and supplemental protein. In experiment 1, sodium caseinate (SC) provided 0, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, or 4% additional crude protein (CP) to bottles containing alfalfa or native warm-season prairie grass hay. Bottles were equipped with continuous gas pressure monitors and placed into a shaking incubator for 48 hours at 39°C. Cultures with alfalfa had greater (P < .0001) in vitro dry matter disappearance (IVDMD), neutral detergent fiber disappearance (NDFD), acid detergent fiber disappearance (ADFD), cumulative gas production, and total volatile fatty acid (VFA). Sodium caseinate increased gas production (P ≤ .05) and decreased pH (P < .003) in cultures with grass hay. Sodium caseinate at 1%, 2%, or 4% additional CP increased IVDMD, NDFD, and ADFD (P < .01), while 4% additional CP also increased total VFA (P < .01). For experiment 2, SC, fishmeal, soybean meal (SBM), whey, porcine blood plasma, and L-lysine hydrochloride were added to supply 2% additional CP to cultures with grass hay. All protein sources decreased pH and increased IVDMD, NDFD, and ADFD (P ≤ .01), with the largest effects elicited by SC, L-lysine, and whey (P ≤ .05). Total VFA (P ≤ .04) and gas (P ≤ .05) production increased with L-lysine, whey, SC, SBM, and fishmeal. While protein supplementation had minimal effects on cultures containing alfalfa, it altered fermentation of grass hay, more notably with more soluble protein sources.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacid detergent fiber 3aalfalfa 3ablood plasma 3acannulas 3acrude protein 3afermentation 3afish meal 3aforage 3agrass hay 3ahorses 3alysine 3aneutral detergent fiber 3apH 3aprotein supplements 3asodium caseinate 3asoybean meal 3aswine 3aveterinary medicine 3avolatile fatty acids 3awarm season 3awhey 0aCecum 0aHorse 0aIn vitro 0aFiber 0aProtein1 aDrouillard, James S.1 aFehlberg, Laura K.1 aDouthit, Teresa L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4081-59551 aLattimer, James M.0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2020 Aug., v. 91 p.103127-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2020.1031273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01722naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245006500166300001800231520063300249592002800882650002000910650001400930650001800944650002100962650002300983650002801006650002901034700006001063700006101123773012001184856008301304852000901387655001201396IND60646414420221118000824.0190610e20190522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064641442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b013972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJo, Young-In10aModular Syntheses of Phenanthroindolizidine Natural Products  ap. 4201-4204.  aA highly concise strategy for the total synthesis of phenanthroindolizidines was developed.

Among eight lactic acid bacteria, the strain with the greatest resistance to acid and bile salts, adhesion, α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, and fermentation performance was identified by principal component analysis. The adaptability of the screened strain to several varieties of apple juice was evaluated, and its growth curve in the most suitable substrate was determined. Lactobacillus fermentum 21828 demonstrated tolerance to pH 2.5 and bile salts, adhesion, α-glucosidase inhibitory activity (35.00%), and good fermentation performance, comparable to that of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (reference strain). Among seven apple cultivars, Aksu apple juice after fermentation by L. fermentum 21828 showed the highest viable count (3.40 × 10⁸ CFU/mL) and sensory score (84.33), and its α-glucosidase inhibition dose-dependently significantly increased compared to unfermented apple juice. Its growth plateaued after 20 h, when the viable count reached 3.40 × 10⁸ CFU/mL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus fermentum 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aadhesion 3aapple juice 3aapples 3abile 3acultivars 3afermentation 3aglycemic effect 3agrowth curves 3alactic acid 3apH 3aprincipal component analysis 0aLactic acid bacteria 0aHypoglycemic 0aα-Glucosidase inhibitory activity 0aApple juice1 aHan, Mengzhen1 aZhang, Meina1 aWang, Yu1 aRen, Yaopeng1 aYue, Tianli1 aGao, Zhenpeng0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 Jan., v. 136 p.110363-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1103633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03503naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245011800173506010400291506007600395520186000471592002802331506003702359650003002396650001702426650002202443650001302465650001302478650001502491650002202506650000902528650001802537653001602555653002902571653003102600653004302631653002102674653003302695700002402728700002202752700002102774700002602795773011602821856008702937852000903024655001203033IND60746603620221207144153.0220517e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074660362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1145672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCappugi, Lorenzo10aMachine learning-enabled prediction of wind turbine energy yield losses due to general blade leading edge erosion  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBlade leading edge erosion is acknowledged to significantly reduce the energy yield of wind turbines. The problem is particularly severe for offshore installations, due to faster erosion progression boosted by harsh environmental conditions. This study presents and demonstrates an experimentally validated simulation-based technology for rapidly and accurately estimating wind turbine energy yield losses due to general leading edge erosion. The technology combines the predictive accuracy of two- and three-dimensional Navier–Stokes computational fluid dynamics with the runtime reductions enabled by artificial neural networks and wind turbine engineering codes using the blade element momentum theory. The main demonstration is based on the assessment of the annual energy yield of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory 5 MW reference turbine affected by leading edge erosion damage of increasing severity, considering damages based on available laser scans and previous leading edge erosion analysis. Results also include sensitivity studies of the energy loss to the wind characteristics of the installation site. It is found that the annual energy loss varies between about 0.3 and 4%, depending on the damage severity and the site wind characteristics. The study also illustrates the necessity of resolving the geometry of eroded leading edges rather than accounting for the effects of erosion with surrogate models, since, after an initial increase of distributed surface roughness, erosion yields leading edge geometry alterations causing aerodynamic losses exceeding those due to the loss of boundary layer laminarity consequent to roughness-induced transition. The presented technology enables estimating in a few minutes the amount of energy lost to erosion for many-turbine wind farms, and offers a key tool for predictive maintenance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadministrative management 3aaerodynamics 3aenergy conversion 3ageometry 3amomentum 3aprediction 3asurface roughness 3awind 3awind turbines 0aWind energy 0aAnnual energy production 0aBlade leading edge erosion 0aInstallation site wind characteristics 0aMachine learning 0aComputational fluid dynamics1 aCastorrini, Alessio1 aBonfiglioli, Aldo1 aMinisci, Edmondo1 aCampobasso, M.

This was caused by intraperitoneal injection of sublethal doses of the bacterium Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida or the parasite Philasterides dicentrarchi (Ciliophora:Scuticociliatida). The LWD conditions were stressful for fish, causing increased levels of cortisol in plasma, decreased levels of glycogen in liver and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) and increased activities of G6Pase and GSase. The presence of bacteria or parasites in fish under NWD resulted in increased cortisol levels in plasma whereas in liver, changes were of minor importance including decreased levels of lactate and GSase activity. The simultaneous presence of bacteria and parasites in fish under NWD resulted a sharp increase in the levels of cortisol in plasma and decreased levels of glucose. Decreased levels of glycogen and lactate and activities of GSase and glutathione reductase (GR), as well as increased activities of glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), 6‐phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH) and levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) occurred in the same fish in liver. Finally, the presence of pathogens in S. maximus under stressful conditions elicited by LWD resulted in synergistic actions of both type of stressors in cortisol levels. In liver, the presence of bacteria or parasites induced a synergistic action on several variables such as decreased activities of G6Pase and GSase as well as increased levels of NADP and NADPH and increased activities of GPase, G6PDH and 6PGDH.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgrupación Estratégica Oceanografía‐ECIMAT  cSpanish Agencia Estatal de Investigación (AEI)  aAGL2016‐74857‐C3‐1‐RcEuropean Fund of Regional Development  aBES‐2014‐068040cAEI 3aAeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aScophthalmus maximus 3abacteria 3acortisol 3aglucose 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3aglycogen 3aintraperitoneal injection 3alactic acid 3aliver 3aparasites 3aphosphogluconate dehydrogenase 3astress response 3asynergism 3aturbot1 aOtero‐Rodiño, C.1 aSuárez, P.1 aNieto, T.

Prior studies found widespread incongruence between nuclear and plastid phylogenies, and this has prevented the construction of a unified phylogenetic hypothesis for the genus. In order to examine whether phylogenetic incongruence resulted from ancestral polyploidization events, we obtained DNA sequence data from two nuclear loci, phytoene desaturase (PDS) and transmembrane nine (TMN1), as well as the plastid trnT—trnF region. Multiple divergent copies of the nuclear genes were recovered from several species, and species with the most divergent copies were inferred to have originated through allopolyploidization. Our data support a scenario in which three groups of species descended from allopolyploidization events: a clade of North American species (N. aquatica and N. cordata), a clade of neotropical species (N. fallax, N. grayana, and N. humboldtiana), and the Australian species N. montana. Trees constructed using novel nuclear gene data also were incongruent with previously generated nuclear and plastid data, however we were able to combine data from four independently evolving regions (PDS, TMN1, nuclear internal transcribed spacer, and plastid) to generate a single species tree that received strong support at several nodes. Sources of incongruence on the species tree involved a relatively small subset of species. Overall, the increased data from nuclear loci have dramatically improved our understanding of the Nymphoides phylogeny.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aNorth Americans 3aNymphoides 3aallopolyploidy 3aaquatic plants 3adiploidy 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aloci 3aphylogeny 3aplant taxonomy 3atrees 0aAllopolyploidy 0afloating heart 0ahybridization 0aphytoene desaturase 0apolyploidy1 aSears, Nicole L.1 aZentner, Autumn B.1 aSivadas, Vignu0 tSystematic botany.g2018 Apr., v. 43, no. 1 p.117-129dAmerican Society of Plant ToxonomistswJournal:jnl7985x0363-64457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245010300174300001800277520105800295592002801353650001501381650001001396650001901406650002501425650001201450650001201462650001701474650001401491650001201505650001201517650001801529650002701547650001601574650001101590650001101601653002501612653001401637653001501651653001701666653002401683700001601707700002201723700001701745700002001762773010801782856008701890852000901977655001201986IND60581265320221117210220.0190409e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058126532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.07.1692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Quynh Anh10aDevelopment of an integrated process to produce d-mannose and bioethanol from coffee residue waste  ap. 1039-1048.  aA novel, integrated process for economical high-yield production of d-mannose and ethanol from coffee residue waste (CRW), which is abundant and widely available, was reported. The process involves pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation, color removal, and pervaporation, which can be performed using environmentally friendly technologies. The CRW was pretreated with ethanol at high temperature and then hydrolyzed with enzymes produced in-house to yield sugars. Key points of the process are: manipulations of the fermentation step that allowing bioethanol-producing yeasts to use almost glucose and galactose to produce ethanol, while retaining large amounts of d-mannose in the fermented broth; removal of colored compounds and other components from the fermented broth; and separation of ethanol and d-mannose through pervaporation. Under optimized conditions, approximately 15.7g dry weight (DW) of d-mannose (approximately 46% of the mannose) and approximately 11.3g DW of ethanol from 150g DW of ethanol-pretreated CRW, were recovered.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioethanol 3acolor 3adecolorization 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzymes 3aethanol 3afermentation 3agalactose 3aglucose 3amannose 3apervaporation 3asustainable technology 3atemperature 3awastes 3ayeasts 0aCoffee residue waste 0ad-Mannose 0aBioethanol 0aFermentation 0aIntegration process1 aCho, Eunjin1 aTrinh, Ly Thi Phi1 aJeong, Ji-su1 aBae, Hyeun-Jong0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Nov., v. 244 p.1039-1048dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.07.1693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245012500209520138000334592002801714650002301742650001501765650001901780650001601799650001101815650002301826653003001849653001601879653002701895653002301922653001301945700006001958700002402018773011202042856008502154852000902239655001202248IND60782144120221118224454.0220914e20221005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078214412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2022.1207852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohammadi, Aida1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8070-300X10aNew insights into the structure and chemical reduction of graphene oxide membranes for use in isotopic water separations  aReduced graphene oxide (rGO) membranes have huge potential for use in the separation of isotopic water mixtures due to the narrow interlayer spacing forming between the rGO sheets. Although there have been several studies on water purification using graphene oxide (GO) and rGO membranes, no experimental work has been performed towards understanding the role of rGO's oxygen-containing groups in the successful filtration of isotopes. The present work investigates key factors and functional groups that govern the separation performance of rGO membranes. The latter are produced by reducing GO membranes in hydroiodic acid vapor at low temperature (40 °C). The membranes are subsequently tested in filtration experiments using D₂O/H₂O mixtures and their selectivity and transmembrane flux are recorded as functions of time and temperature. Chemical characterization of the membranes reveals that the hydroxyl and epoxide groups are primarily responsible for the observed selective separation of isotopic water mixtures. Partially reduced GO membranes were found to provide a D₂O rejection efficiency that is comparable to their GO counterparts but exhibit higher mechanical robustness that permits longer filtration cycles. Experimental evidence provided herein proves that rGO membranes can be an effective and promising means of isotopic water mixture separation.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reduction 3afiltration 3agraphene oxide 3atemperature 3avapors 3awater purification 0aIsotopic water filtration 0aHeavy water 0aReduced graphene oxide 0aChemical reduction 0aMembrane1 aDaymond, Mark R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6242-74891 aDocoslis, Aristides0 tJournal of membrane science.g2022 Oct. 05, v. 659 p.120785-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2022.1207853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02387naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245012600183300001400309520092400323592002801247650001601275650001901291650001301310650001101323650001701334650000901351650001501360650001101375650001301386650000901399650003401408650004601442650000901488650001101497650005501508650002001563650002201583650003201605700001901637700001901656700001701675773012301692856008101815852000901896655001201905IND50090086320221119032113.0151123e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009008632DNAL7 a247975352pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-014-1286-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNam, In-Hyun10aBiodegradation of Biphenyl and 2-Chlorobiphenyl by a Pseudomonas sp.

We herein report that strain KM-04 can use biphenyl as a sole carbon source, and resting cells convert biphenyl to its corresponding metabolic intermediates. Incubation of KM-04 with autoclaved mining-contaminated soil for 10 days in a slurry system reduced the levels of biphenyl and 2-chlorobiphenyl by 98.5 % and 82.3 %, respectively. Furthermore, treatment of a mine-soil microcosm with strain KM-04 for 15 days in a composting system under laboratory conditions reduced the levels of biphenyl and 2-chlorobiphenyl by 87.1 % and 68.7 %, respectively. These results suggest that KM-04 is a potential candidate for the biological removal of biphenyl and its chlorinated derivatives from polychlorinated biphenyl-contaminated mining areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas 3abiodegradation 3abiphenyl 3acarbon 3achlorination 3acoal 3acomposting 3amining 3aslurries 3asoil 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiphenyl Compoundsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aCoal 2aMining 2aPseudomonasxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSoil Pollutantsxmetabolism1 aChon, Chul-Min1 aJung, Ka-Young1 aKim, Jae-Gon0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2014 July, v. 93, no. 1 p.89-94dSpringer USx0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-014-1286-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03930naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001700162245012100179300001800300520218500318592002802503650001302531650002302544650001602567650001102583650001102594650001802605650001702623650000902640650001802649650000802667650001802675650000902693650001402702650001802716650000902734650002602743650005902769650001202828650005602840650004602896650003102942650002302973650000902996650006703005700001803072700002003090700002103110700001603131700001903147773010003166856007703266852000903343655001203352IND60083427020221120205902.0141101e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008342702DNAL7 a228843372pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2011-50422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsorio, J.S.10aEffects of source of trace minerals and plane of nutrition on growth and health of transported neonatal dairy calves  ap. 5831-5844.  aThe aims of the experiment were to evaluate the effects of source of trace minerals (TM) and plane of nutrition (PN) early in life on growth and health of transported calves. Ninety male Holstein calves <1wk old were assigned to treatments in a 2×2 factorial arrangement of PN and TM source in a randomized complete block design. Calves assigned to low PN (LPN) received milk replacer [22% crude protein (CP), 20% fat, 568g of powder/d for wk 1 to 4, and 284 g of powder/d for wk 5] plus ad libitum access to starter [18% CP, dry matter (DM) basis, for wk 1 to 12] and a limited amount of hay (0.5kg/d as fed, for wk 10 to 12); LPN calves were weaned at 6 wk. During wk 13 to 20, LPN calves were fed 3.2kg/d of grower mix (16% CP, DM basis) plus chopped hay for ad libitum intake. Calves assigned to high PN (HPN) received variable amounts of milk replacer (28% CP; 20% fat; and 810, 1,136, and 568 g of powder/d for wk 1, 2 to 6, and 7, respectively) plus ad libitum access to starter (22% CP, DM basis, wk 1 to 12) and limited hay (0.5kg/d as fed, for wk 10 to 12); HPN calves were weaned at wk 7. Calves assigned to HPN were offered grower mix for ad libitum intake plus a limited amount of chopped hay (0.5kg/d, as-fed basis) from wk 13 to 20. Milk replacers were formulated to contain balanced amounts of either inorganic (I) or organic (O) TM (50, 50, 10, and 100mg/kg of Zn, Mn, Cu, and Fe, respectively), whereas respective ITM or OTM starters and growers contained Zn, Mn, Cu, and Co at 70, 55, 12, and 1mg/kg. The HPN treatments increased final body weight and stature measurements, average daily gain, and gain-to-feed ratio through wk 20. Starter intake was lower for calves fed HPN. The OTM increased growth when supplemented to HPN but not when supplemented to LPN. During the liquid-feeding period, fecal scores were more fluid for calves fed HPN but measures of health status did not differ among diets. Results indicated that an enhanced nutritional program during early life allowed calves to have greater overall growth and maintain a normal health status throughout the preweaning period. High PN and OTM were synergistic in increasing early growth of calves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aaverage daily gain 3abody weight 3acobalt 3acopper 3acrude protein 3adairy calves 3adiet 3afeeding level 3ahay 3ahealth status 3airon 3amanganese 3amilk replacer 3azinc 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomenaxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newbornxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aCattlexgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aDietxmethodsxveterinary. 2aEatingxphysiology 2aMale 2aTrace Elementsxadministration & dosagexanalysisxmetabolism.1 aWallace, R.L.1 aTomlinson, D.J.1 aEarleywine, T.J.1 aSocha, M.T.1 aDrackley, J.K.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2012 Oct., v. 95, no. 10 p.5831-5844dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2011-50423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03302naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002200135245013800157300001500295520181300310592002802123650002602151650000902177650001702186650001802203650001702221650002102238650001602259650001902275650001402294650001602308650001402324700002002338700002302358700002202381700002402403700002002427700002502447700001702472700002302489773015302512856007002665856010002735852000902835655001202844IND60767368020221122055849.0220216e20210908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076736802DNAL7 a10.3791/629032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRigaill, Josselin10aImproved enzyme protection assay to study Staphylococcus aureus internalization and intracellular efficacy of antimicrobial compounds  ap. e62903.  aStaphylococcus aureus expresses virulence factors to trigger its internalization into eukaryote cells and to survive inside different subcellular compartments. This paper describes an enzyme protection assay to study the extent of S. aureus internalization and its intracellular survival in adherent non-professional phagocytic cells (NPPCs) as well as the intracellular efficacy of antimicrobial compounds. NPPCs are grown in a multi-well plate until they reach 100% confluence. S. aureus cultures are grown overnight in cell culture medium. The bacterial suspension is diluted according to the number of cells per well to inoculate the cells at a controlled multiplicity of infection. Inoculated cells are incubated for 2 h to allow the bacteria to be internalized by the NPPCs, following which lysostaphin is added to the culture medium to selectively kill extracellular bacteria. Lysostaphin is present in the culture medium for the rest of the experiment. At this point, the infected cells could be incubated with antimicrobial compounds to assess their intracellular activities against S. aureus. Next, the cells are washed three times to remove the drugs, and intracellular S. aureus load is then quantified by culturing on agar plates. Alternatively, for studying staphylococcal virulence factors involved in intracellular survival and cell toxicity, lysostaphin could be inactivated with proteinase K to eliminate the need for washing steps. This tip improves the reliability of the intracellular bacterial load quantification, especially if cells tend to detach from the culture plate when they become heavily infected because of the multiplication of intracellular S. aureus. These protocols can be used with virtually all types of adherent NPPCs and with 3D cell culture models such as organoids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aagar 3acell culture 3aculture media 3acytotoxicity 3aeukaryotic cells 3alysostaphin 3amicrobial load 3aorganoids 3apeptidase K 3avirulence1 aAudoux, Estelle1 aRodriguez, Killian1 aPeyron, Aurélien1 aBerthelot, Philippe1 aJosse, Jérôme1 aLaurent, Frédéric,1 aCaire, Robin1 aVerhoeven, Paul O.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2021 Sept. 08, , no. 175 p.e62903-e62903dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/629033Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/62903/improved-enzyme-protection-assay-to-study-staphylococcus-aureus  aDNAL 7aarticle02140naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006800168300001800236520119900254592002801453650001201481650001401493650001201507650001101519700001801530700001601548700001701564700002201581773009801603856008101701990002301782852000901805655001201814IND60093891920221119043239.0141104e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009389192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2013.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHung, Shang-Chao10aEmbedded-Ge source and drain in InGaAs/GaAs dual channel MESFET  ap. 1577-1580.  aWe report the first demonstration of n-type III–V metal-semiconductor field-effect transistors (nMESFETs) with IV group material hetero-junction source and drain (S/D) technology. A selective epitaxial growth of germanium (Ge) in the recessed gallium arsenide (GaAs) S/D regions is successfully developed using ultra-high vacuum chemical vapor deposition (UHVCVD) system. The dual channel structure includes an additional 10-nm higher mobility n-In₀.₂Ga₀.₈As layer on n-GaAs channel and is introduced to further improve the device performance. The n-MESFET, combining embedded-Ge S/D with In₀.₂Ga₀.₈As/GaAs channel, exhibits good transfer properties with a drain current on/off ratio of approximately 10³. Due to the small barrier height of Ti/In₀.₂Ga₀.₈As Schottky contact, a lattice-matched wide bandgap In₀.₄₉Ga₀.₅₁P dielectric layer is also integrated into the device architecture to build a higher electron Schottky barrier height (SBH) for gate leakage current reduction. The Ti/In₀.₄₉Ga₀.₅₁P/n-In₀.₂Ga₀.₈As Schottky diode shows a comparable leakage level to Ti/n-GaAs with 2 × 10⁻² A/cm² at a gate voltage of −2.0 V.  aPublisher supplied data 3agallium 3agermanium 3aphysics 3avapors1 aLuan, Qiuping1 aLin, Hau-Yu1 aLi, Shuguang1 aChang, Shoou-Jinn0 tCurrent applied physics.g2013 Oct., v. 13, no. 8 p.1577-1580dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2013.05.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024003600133040001800169100006100187245008900248506007600337506003100413520131200444592002801756596004501784506003701829650005301866650001701919650002101936650001601957650002101973650003601994650002202030650001102052653001002063653001102073653003702084653001702121653001302138700006302151700002302214700006302237773012602300856008302426852000902509655001202518IND60743008720221207131242.0220606e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074300872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2021.1040632chorus7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2021.1040632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, Carrie L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2226-545110aUsual intakes of food pattern components by U.S. children: WWEIA, NHANES 2013–2016  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThis research estimates adherence to the recommended Healthy U.S.-Style Pattern in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA), 2015–2020 by U.S. children using national dietary intake data from WWEIA, NHANES, 2013–2016. The sample included 723 and 1685 children age 2−3 years and 4−8 years, respectively. The Food Patterns Equivalents Database and the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2013–2014 and 2015–2016 were used to determine the consumption of Food Pattern components and select nutrients. Usual intake estimates were produced using the National Cancer Institute Method and compared to the DGA energy-specific recommendations based on age, sex, and assuming the lowest physical activity level. Children age 2−3 years had significantly (p < 0.001) higher percentages meeting the DGA recommended intake than 4−8 years for fruits (62 % vs 36 %), vegetables (11 % vs 5%), dairy (55 % vs 28 %) and protein foods (68 % vs 42 %). For components to limit, children age 2−3 years had significantly (p < 0.001) higher percentages who did not exceed the recommended limit for added sugar (50 % vs 20 %) and sodium (20 % vs 10 %). While age was a factor in adherence to DGA recommendations among younger children, minimal differences were seen by race/ethnicity and family income.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aadded sugars 3afood composition 3afood intake 3ahousehold income 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aphysical activity 3asodium 0aWWEIA 0aNHANES 0aDietary Guidelines for Americans 0aUsual intake 0aChildren1 aSteinfeldt, Lois C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2844-08631 aGoldman, Joseph D.1 aMoshfegh, Alanna J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6806-20110 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2021 Sept., v. 102 p.104063-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2021.1040633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010100165300001600266520132100282592002801603650002001631650001901651650001301670650002201683650001801705650001101723650001301734650001701747650001901764650002301783653002301806653002601829653002601855653002701881653003201908653002501940700001701965700001501982700001501997773009002012856008502102852000902187655001202196IND60628529720221123022740.0200607e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062852972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.03.1732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chunxi10aSimulation on deacidification performance of waste incinerator flue gas by rotating spray drying  ap. 652-665.  aThe models describing the mass transfer and chemical reaction of flue-gas−slurry drops in the deacidification tower of waste incineration plants are established. The internal dynamics are simulated and the effects of flue-gas inlet velocity, stoichiometric ratio, drop size and water spray rate, on deacidification performance, are evaluated. Results show that simulated desulphurisation and dechlorination rates are 58.97% and 99.99% and the removal rate of HCl is greater than SO₂. A high-temperature zone is found in the upper part of central axis, whereas low-temperature zones are observed at the right wall and bottom. Flow field is characterized with complex recirculation zones, wherein the recirculation zone emerged on the upper-right entrains a small part of drops towards the right wall. Approximately 60% of the total removal amount of SO₂ and 90% of HCl are absorbed in the upper part. Slurry drops completely evaporate in 5 s after entering the deacidification tower. The deacidification performance is improved with the increase in stoichiometric ratio and water spray rate, as well as the decrease in inlet gas velocity and drop size. Excellent deacidification performance is expected under flue-gas inlet velocity of 7.1 m/s, drop size of 50–70 μm, and water spray rate of 600 L/h.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeacidification 3adechlorination 3aflue gas 3ahydrochloric acid 3amass transfer 3amodels 3aslurries 3aspray drying 3asulfur dioxide 3awaste incineration 0aWaste incineration 0aDeacidification tower 0aRotating spray drying 0aChemical kinetic model 0aDeacidification performance 0aNumerical simulation1 aJia, Zhennan1 aYe, Xuemin1 aYin, Shuie0 tEnergy.g2018 June 01, v. 152 p.652-665dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.03.1733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03582naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245008200181300001600263520189400279592002802173596012102201650001302322650002202335650002502357650002402382650002002406650001902426650002702445650001602472650002802488650002302516650002802539650001002567650002002577650001102597650001502608650001802623650002802641650001902669650001702688650001302705651001302718653001702731653003102748653001802779700002302797700002902820773009602849856008602945852000903031655001203040IND60688573920200616000000.0200429e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068857392DNAL7 a10.1080/08927936.2019.15502852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Souza, Pricila Fátima10aPerceptions and Attitudes of Urucum Settlement Residents about Local Wildlife  ap. 117-127.  aThis study aimed to evaluate perceptions and attitudes of local people about wild fauna and was carried out in the Urucum settlement, in the Brazilian Pantanal. We sought to: (1) identify which species of wild animals were most frequently chosen by residents of the Urucum settlement based on their familiarity; (2) identify the values associated with this fauna and the implications for conservation; and (3) test the effect of gender, age, and level of education of the residents on their attitudes. We used a structured questionnaire with open and closed questions to interview the residents. Distributions of responses about perceptions were analyzed using the chi-square test, and differences between the values associated with each species were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. The effect of gender, age, and level of education on attitudes toward the most chosen species was tested using generalized linear models (GLM). Among 61 residents interviewed, we found that the nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), toucan (Ramphastos toco), monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus), rhea (Rhea Americana), and rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus) were the most frequently chosen species. These species were followed by tropical freshwater fish (a fish of the genus Astyanax sp.) and the blue morpho butterfly (Morpho sp.), both chosen with equal frequency. Most perceptions and attitudes were positive apart from those for the rattlesnake. Attitudes toward the rattlesnake were associated with the age of respondents, and the most common value associated with conserving the selected animals was “Anthropocentric.” As demonstrated by other studies, contact with environmental education activities could help to promote tolerance to rattlesnakes. Likewise, this tool can also broaden our understanding of the ecological importance of wild species, facilitating their conservation.  aPublisher supplied data  aPNPD20132885cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superiordhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002322 3aAstyanax 3aCrotalus durissus 3aDasypus novemcinctus 3aMyiopsitta monachus 3aRamphastos toco 3aRhea americana 3aattitudes and opinions 3abutterflies 3achi-square distribution 3aeducational status 3aenvironmental education 3afauna 3afreshwater fish 3agender 3ainterviews 3alinear models 3aperceptions (cognitive) 3aquestionnaires 3awild animals 3awildlife 3aPantanal 0aconservation 0ahuman–animal interaction 0aUrucum Massif1 aPorfirio, Grasiela1 aHerrera, Heitor Miraglia0 tAnthrozoös.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 32, no. 1 p.117-127dRoutledgewJournal:2060x1753-03777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08927936.2019.15502853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03325naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245010200165300001600267520161900283592002801902650003401930650001801964650001501982650002101997650001402018650001802032650001802050650001902068650001902087650002402106650001502130650001602145650001702161650003302178650000902211650001402220650001702234650001502251650001002266653003302276653002502309653002402334653002602358700001902384700005302403700001902456700001702475700001302492773017402505856008302679852000902762655001202771IND60724719120221120202557.0210124e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072471912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtcms.2018.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiuli10aUrinary metabolomics study of Xiangdan submicron emulsions on a rat model of myocardial ischaemia  ap. 139-150.  aThe aim of this study was to discover the potential biomarkers changes on a rat model of isoproterenol (ISO) induced myocardial ischaemia before and after treatment with a Xiangdan submicron emulsion and to explore the unclearing mechanisms by urinary metabolomics.Three active traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) ingredients were formulated into a lyophilized submicron emulsion powder with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin encapsulation by high pressure homogenization technology. The three ingredients were given both separately and combined, and the corresponding effects of the three drugs were compared. Principal component analysis (PCA) and the HPLC-UV analytical method was applied to explore the change of composition of urine metabolites in a rat model of isoproterenol induced myocardial ischaemia.Analytical methods measuring the three active ingredients in urine samples were established. PCA score plots revealed that the therapeutic effect of the Xiangdan submicron emulsion was more significant than that of the Xiangdan injection. There was a synergistic effect among the three active ingredients. Furthermore, studies of rat metabolism changes and structure analysis of biological markers indicated that the mechanism of Xiangdan formulations was related to the inhibition of abnormal tryptophan metabolism.Xiangdan preparations had a confirmed effect in the treatment of coronary heart disease, especially with the novel Xiangdan submicron emulsion formulation. Urinary metabolomics methods to monitor special biomarker changes is an excellent method to reveal the mechanism of action of TCM drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aanimal models 3abiomarkers 3acoronary disease 3aemulsions 3aencapsulation 3afreeze drying 3ahomogenization 3aisoproterenols 3amechanism of action 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aprincipal component analysis 3arats 3asynergism 3atherapeutics 3atryptophan 3aurine 0aXiangdan submicron emulsions 0aUrinary metabolomics 0aBiomarker discovery 0aTryptophan derivative1 aZhang, Xiurong1 aGong, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9866-99111 aZhang, Zhirong1 aWeber, Laura1 aWei, Xin0 tJournal of traditional Chinese medical sciences.g2018 Apr., v. 5, no. 2 p.139-150dElsevier B.V.aBeijing University of Chinese MedicinewJournal:23382x2095-75487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcms.2018.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245009000179300001600269520143000285592002801715650002201743650001101765650001101776650001601787650001301803650001001816650001901826650001701845650001601862650001501878650003001893650001601923650002001939650002601959650001601985650001402001650001302015651001102028653001502039653000902054653001902063653000802082700003302090773012502123856008602248852000902334655001202343IND60595681520221118030649.0190321e20180403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059568152DNAL7 a10.1080/19440049.2017.14192862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, Nadia Regina10aOccurrence of glyphosate and AMPA residues in soy-based infant formula sold in Brazil  ap. 724-731.  aGlyphosate is an herbicide widely used in the world, being applied in several crops, among them soybeans. Recently, glyphosate and its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) have been identified as possible contributors to the emergence of various diseases such as autism, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, as well as cancer. The child population-consuming cereal-based foods is the most exposed to the effects of pesticides because of their developmental phase and they have a higher food intake per kilogram of body weight than adults. The presence of glyphosate and AMPA residues in soy-based infant formulas was evaluated during the years 2012–2017, totalising 105 analyses carried out on 10 commercial brands from different batches. Glyphosate and AMPA were determined by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection after derivatisation reaction. The method was validated and showed accuracy and precision with a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.02 mg kg⁻¹. Among those samples that contained levels above the LOQ, the variation of glyphosate residues was from 0.03 mg kg⁻¹ to 1.08 mg kg⁻¹ and for AMPA residues was from 0.02 mg kg⁻¹ to 0.17 mg kg⁻¹. This is the first scientific communication about glyphosate and AMPA contamination in soy-based infant formula in Brazil, The study was conducted under good laboratory practice (GLP) and supported by good scientific practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aadults 3aautism 3abody weight 3achildren 3acrops 3aderivatization 3afluorescence 3afood intake 3aglyphosate 3agood laboratory practices 3agrain foods 3ainfant formulas 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3aneoplasms 3asoybeans 3aBrazil 0aGlyphosate 0aAMPA 0ainfant formula 0asoy1 ade Souza, Ana Paula Ferreira0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2018 Apr. 3, v. 35, no. 4 p.724-731dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl35737x1944-00577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2017.14192863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245006900206300001400275520142900289592002801718650001401746650001901760650001801779650001701797650002601814650001801840650002401858650002901882653002801911653002101939653003201960653002201992653002002014653001702034700006002051773011602111856008602227852000902313655001202322IND60636658120221120155727.0190523e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063665812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2019.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Chanki1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2969-270110aOptimizing UAV-based radiation sensor systems for aerial surveys  ap. 76-85.  aIn this study, we qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based radiation sensor systems suitable for specific survey missions. We examined a variety of UAVs, radiation sensors, and radiological survey missions; after reviewing previous studies that developed and conducted field tests, we categorized them by mission and suggested suitable types of UAVs and radiation sensors for each mission. To quantitatively analyze various system designs previously suggested, we proposed a new figure of merit (FOM) formula that can explain the mutual effects of parameters of both radiation sensors and UAVs on system performance. After targeting a radiological survey mission, we selected UAV and radiation sensor types qualitatively. Then, the quantitative FOM formula can be employed to efficiently assess whether the system achieves the required minimum detectable activity (MDA) without field test, while keeping the error of the MDA values in the order of 100. After defining the constraints including the proposed FOM formula, we replicated a severe nuclear power plant accident scenario. We found that one fixed-wing UAV and multiple rotary-wing UAVs are the minimum number of UAVs, and thus the optimal system for timely achievement of a satisfactory MDA and estimation of the three-dimensional radiation distribution contributed by both ground radiation and an atmospheric radioactive plume.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3aaerial surveys 3anuclear power 3apower plants 3aquantitative analysis 3aradioactivity 3asystems engineering 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 0aUnmanned aerial vehicle 0aRadiation sensor 0aMinimum detectable activity 0aPower consumption 0aFigure of merit 0aOptimization1 aKim, Hee Reyoung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6786-31050 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2019 Aug., v. 204 p.76-85dElsevier LtdwJournal:2014x0265-931X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2019.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245011500155300001600270520168500286592002801971650001801999650002402017650001202041650002302053650002402076650001602100650001602116650001802132650002002150650002802170650001402198650001602212650000902228650001302237650001502250650002202265650002502287653002102312653001402333653003202347700001802379700001702397773013102414856007302545852000902618655001202627IND60777262720221119124241.0220515e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077726272DNAL7 a10.18805/LR-46712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGadade, G.D.10aYield enhancement of pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) millsp.] through drip irrigation and fertigation management  ap. 462-468.  aPigeonpea an indeterminate pulse crop with profuse branching responds well to both irrigation and fertilizer. Erratic rainfall distribution pattern exposes this crop to dry spell during its vegetative stage and terminal drought at reproductive stage and the poor crop nutrition further results in to low yield. Under such circumstances it is very difficult to sustain the yield of pigeonpea. Agronomic practices like precise and timely application of drip irrigation along with judicious use of nutrients play a vital role to boost the yield of any crop. Thus the attempts were made to explore the yield potential of pigeonpea under drip irrigation and fertigation management. The present study was conducted at the experimental farm of AICRP on Irrigation Water Management, VNMKV, Parbhani (MS) during kharif 2018 and 2019. The experiment was laid out in split plot design with main plots comprising of four drip irrigation levels viz. 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 ETc (crop evapotranspiration) and conventional method and sub plots were allotted to four fertigation levels viz. control (no fertilizer), 80% RDF, 100% RDF (25: 50: 25 NPK kg ha⁻¹) and 120% RDF. Drip irrigation at 0.8 ETc recorded higher seed yield, harvest index, water use efficiency, nutrient use efficiency and net returns of pigeonpea followed by 1.0 ETc except in case of water use efficiency. As regards to fertigation studies, higher values of seed yield, harvest index and water use efficiency were recorded with drip fertigation @ 25:50:25 NPK kg ha⁻¹ closely followed by 20:40:20 NPK kg ha⁻¹. However higher nutrient use efficiency and net returns were obtained in drip fertigation @ 20:40:20 NPK kg ha⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCajanus cajan 3ademonstration farms 3adrought 3aevapotranspiration 3aexperimental design 3afertigation 3afertilizers 3aharvest index 3amicroirrigation 3anutrient use efficiency 3anutrition 3apigeon peas 3arain 3aresearch 3aseed yield 3avegetative growth 3awater use efficiency 0aDrip fertigation 0aPigeonpea 0aPartial factor productivity1 aGokhale, D.N.1 aKadale, A.S.0 tLegume research.g2022 Apr., v. 45, no. 4 p.462-468dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:1999x0976-05717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18805/LR-46713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001500160245008400175300001800259500000900277520190700286592002802193650001602221650002302237650002202260650001402282650001402296650002002310650001902330650001302349650002002362650002602382650002502408650001302433650001302446700002002459773012402479852000902603856009602612655001202708IND9301248620221118013748.0191122e199211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930124862DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1992.00021962008400060022x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeorge, T.10aNitrogen Assimilation Traits and Dinitrogen Fixation in Soybean and Common Bean  ap. 1020-1028.  aepub  aNitrogen derived from symbiotic and mineral sources by a legume is determined by the interactions between mineral N supply, plant N demand, and N assimilation traits. These interactions need to be understood to maximize legume N, fixation and yield, and to identify plant traits supporting high N₂-fixation. These interactions were examined in inoculated soybean [Glycine max Merr. (L.)] and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) by varying N supply (9, 120, and 900 kg N ha⁻¹) at two field sites. Nitrogen fixation was measured by ¹⁵N dilution method. Plants were sampled at full bloom (R2), 21 to 25 d from R2, and physiological maturity (R7). Total N of both legumes at R7 was 25% greater with 900 than 9 kg N ha⁻¹. With 900 kg N ha⁻¹, soybean N accumulation at R7 (271 kg N ha⁻¹) was 42% more than common bean but was 22% less at R2 (78 kg N ha⁻¹). Applied N had the largest impact on N accumulation rates before R2 and from the second sampling to R7, both periods of minimal N₂ fixation. Rate of N accumulation by common bean (0.19 g N m⁻² d⁻¹) was more uniform over the growth cycle than by soybean (0.26 g N m⁻² d⁻¹) which peaked (0.58 g N m⁻² d⁻¹) between R₂ and the second sampling. This peak also coincided with maximum N₂ fixstion rate. Our ¹⁵N uptake and extractable soil N data indicate that common bean derived more N from the mineral source than soybean because of more efficient uptake. Greenhouse data indicated greater root weight and uptake of mineral N per unit root weight for common bean than soybean. Maximizing both N₂ fixation and yield might entail timing the mineral N supply during early vegetative and late reproductive phases. The limited N₂ fixation capacity of common bean might be due to N assimilation traits favoring mineral N uptake.

During 3 consecutive years (2013–2015), 142 fruit (apple or multi-fruit) juices were collected from the market and analysed using HPLC-UV. Patulin was found in 51.4% of juices with 0.7% of the samples in excess of the legal limit of 50 μg kg⁻¹ (mean 4.3 μg kg⁻¹). Apple juices showed significantly higher percentage of contaminated samples (74.0% vs 27.5%), as well as higher mean patulin content (6.4 vs 2.1 μg kg⁻¹) when compared with the multi-fruit ones. Bioaccessibility of patulin in fruit juices was studied using the standardised in vitro digestion method. A mean of 21.6% of the initial patulin amount reached the end of the intestinal phase showing a significant reduction of this toxin during the human digestion process. Risk assessment of patulin intake by Serbian children, adolescents and adults, conducted by deterministic and probabilistic approaches and including the bioaccessibility results, revealed no health concern. Although patulin alone does not represent risk, further research should consider its co-occurrence with other toxic substances in food and potential adverse effects of their mixtures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3aadults 3aadverse effects 3aapple juice 3aapples 3abioavailability 3achildren 3adigestion 3afruits 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3ain vitro digestion 3amarkets 3apatulin 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3aSerbia 0aPatulin 0afruit juice 0ain vitro digestion 0abioaccessibility 0arisk assessment1 aDimitrov, Nina1 aLopes, André1 aMartins, Carla1 aAlvito, Paula1 aAssunção, Ricardo0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2018 May 4, v. 35, no. 5 p.985-995dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl35737x1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2017.14195803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245015300169300001600322520140100338592002801739650000901767650001201776650002401788650002601812650001101838650001901849650002401868650002201892650001001914650001801924650001301942650001801955653003401973653000802007653001602015653002402031653000902055653001402064773010202078856008702180852000902267655001202276IND60537845920221116175551.0190405e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053784592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.09.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOulu, Martin14aThe unequal exchange of Dutch cheese and Kenyan roses: Introducing and testing an LCA-based methodology for estimating ecologically unequal exchange  ap. 372-383.  aThe theory of ecologically unequal exchange (EUE) posits that international trade is structurally organized in a manner that allows a net transfer of resources from peripheral developing to core industrialized countries. The consequence, it is argued, is under-development in the periphery and augmented productive capacity in the core. EUE thus challenges the neoliberal free-market argument that exchange at market prices is symmetric and fair. An LCA-based methodology for estimating EUE that holds constant the variable market price is introduced and tested on contemporary trade of Dutch cheese and Kenyan coffee and roses. Specifically, the exchange of embodied land, water, energy, global warming potential, and labor is assessed. The results confirm the theory's hypothesis. At a fixed market price, more embodied Kenyan resources are exchanged for less Dutch resources. However, Kenyan roses give different results from coffee. EUE between countries can only be conclusively determined by considering the total biophysical trade balance, but by calculating quantities of embodied resources per unit of exchange value, it is possible to detect unequal exchange even at the level of individual commodities. While integration of biophysical metrics alongside monetary valuation is recommended, ultimately, rethinking the structure, policies and politics of international trade is necessary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRosa 3acheeses 3adeveloped countries 3aeconomic productivity 3aenergy 3aglobal warming 3ainternational trade 3aissues and policy 3alabor 3amarket prices 3apolitics 3atrade balance 0aEcologically unequal exchange 0aLCA 0aFree-market 0aInternational trade 0aCore 0aPeriphery0 tEcological economics.g2015 Nov., v. 119 p.372-383dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.09.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245012000173520151300293592002801806650002201834650002501856650002101881651001001902653001401912653001801926653001401944653001401958653001501972700001401987700001302001773010202014856008702116852000902203655001202212IND60743009120221122152214.0210813e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074300912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2021.1071122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNieto-Romero, M.10aRe-building historical commons: How formal institutions affect participation in community forests in Galicia, Spain  aThere has been considerable research studying how the formal institutionalisation of community forests affects participation of local communities. This paper studies a historical commons in Galicia in order to provide insight into how formal institutions are enmeshed with a forestry logic and how this shapes community participation in historical commons in Europe. More specifically, we offer an alternative explanation for low levels of participation, which goes beyond the usual argument of the abandonment of traditional activities. We use an institutional bricolage framework to understand the causal mechanisms by which formal institutions shape participation patterns (both exclusion-inclusion dynamics and the type of participation, namely strategic or affective). Our results show that, during the first period of implementation, most powerful commoners aggregated exclusionary institutions to capture forestry benefits. Formal institutions incentivised the strategic engagement of commoners in exchange for a forestry ‘share’. Later, educated commoners accessed the governing board and aggregated more inclusive institutions that allowed affective engagement and higher levels of participation in the commons. This created new affective relations while creating new exclusions. We conclude by highlighting the responsibility of the State and regional government in installing a forestry profit-seeking and extractive mentality among commoners, which is problematic for an active participation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity service 3aecological economics 3alocal government 3aSpain 0aCommoning 0aParticipation 0aStrategic 0aAffective 0aCommonland1 aParra, C.1 aBock, B.0 tEcological economics.g2021 Oct., v. 188 p.107112-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2021.1071123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03389naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245015600154300001600310520168000326592002802006650002802034650002602062650001002088650002402098650002302122650002602145650001602171650001002187650001202197650001202209650001502221650001802236650002402254650002902278650000902307650001302316650001902329650001502348651001002363653001602373653002302389653001702412653001802429653002002447653000902467700001702476700001502493700001602508700001602524700002202540700002402562773013102586856007302717852000902790655001202799IND60777263020221119124205.0220515e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077726302DNAL7 a10.18805/LR-47372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeena, O.P.10aEffect of crop establishment methods and weed management practices on productivity and profitability of clusterbean under semi-arid region of Rajasthan  ap. 481-486.  aAdequate tillage checks and delays the emergence of weeds and provides a more favourable environment for early crop establishment. Slow growth of crop plant provides favourable environment for emergence of weeds. Cultural as well as mechanical practices such as hand weeding and intercultural are effective but unavailability of labour and continuous rainfall in rainy season does not permit for timely management of weeds Chemical weed control is effective weed management option which provides effective control of weeds. It is well known that weeds are ubiquitous but their presence in cropped area particularly in rainy season crops like clusterbean act as major limiting factor in achieving high potential yield. The current study aimed to study the impact of crop establishment methods and weed control practices on productivity and profitability of clusterbean. A field experiment was carried out to find out suitable method of crop establishment methods and weed management practices in clusterbean during kharif seasons of 2018, 2019 and 2020. The experiment was conducted in spilt plot design with three replications. The treatments were four crop establishment methods viz., conventional sowing, zero tillage sowing, broad bed sowing, zero tillage sowing with mulch as main plots and four weed control practices viz., weedy check, pendimethalin + imazethapyr 1000 g ha⁻¹, T₃- Imazethapyr 40 g ha⁻¹, T₄- Imazethapyr+imazamox 40 g ha⁻¹ as sub plot treatments. The broad bed sowing of clusterbean along with pre-emergence application of pendimethalin + imazethapyr 1000 g ha⁻¹ was found effective to achieve higher productivity and farm profitability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyamopsis tetragonoloba 3achemical weed control 3acrops 3aexperimental design 3afarm profitability 3afield experimentation 3aimazethapyr 3alabor 3alegumes 3amulches 3ano-tillage 3apendimethalin 3aplant establishment 3apreemergent weed control 3arain 3aresearch 3asemiarid zones 3awet season 3aIndia 0aClusterbean 0aCrop establishment 0aProductivity 0aProfitability 0aWeed management 0aWeed1 aKumar, Vipin1 aJain, S.K.1 aYadav, M.R.1 aMeena, B.R.1 aMeena, Ravi Kumar1 aYadav, Saroj Kumari0 tLegume research.g2022 Apr., v. 45, no. 4 p.481-486dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:1999x0976-05717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18805/LR-47373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02181naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245009600179520091200275592002801187650002001215650002501235650002501260650001101285650001801296650001401314650001801328650002001346653001501366653001701381653002001398653002301418653000801441653000801449653000801457653000801465653000801473700002901481700003901510773010201549856008701651852000901738655001201747IND60743009220221122152247.0210813e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074300922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2021.1071342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDanelon, André Felipe10aWater resource quality effects on water treatment costs: An analysis for the Brazilian case  aThe cost effects of water resource quality on water treatment are critical factors for firms' performance. However, few economic studies incorporate water quality parameters into cost functions. This study's main contribution was to combine data on Brazilian water treatment companies and surface water monitoring stations to produce a unique panel data set from 2003 to 2017, and then estimate the effects of water quality on water treatment costs. Based on a panel model with fixed effect approach, our findings show that disturbances on turbidity have significant effects on optimal costs. On average, one-percent increase in turbidity increases the costs in 0.1162%. Therefore, the results indicate that water treatment companies have incentives to improve water resource quality in the long run, which should be considered by regulatory agencies to connect economic incentives and landscape protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aecological economics 3alandscape management 3amodels 3asurface water 3aturbidity 3awater quality 3awater treatment 0aSanitation 0aProductivity 0aLand use change 0aEcosystem services 0aL95 0aO13 0aO44 0aQ25 0aQ531 aAugusto, Fernanda Gaudio1 aSpolador, Humberto Francisco Silva0 tEcological economics.g2021 Oct., v. 188 p.107134-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2021.1071343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01701naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002100136245005700157300001400214520082300228592002801051653001601079653002301095653002001118653002301138653001801161653001701179700002101196773010101217856007201318852000901390655001201399IND60127152220221120071948.0151110e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012715222DNAL7 a10.1554/04-3852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDegnan, James H.10aGene tree distributions under the coalescent process  ap. 24-37.  aUnder the coalescent model for population divergence, lineage sorting can cause considerable variability in gene trees generated from any given species tree.

Applications for gene tree distributions include determining exact probabilities of topological equivalence between gene trees and species trees and inferring species trees from multiple datasets. In addition, we examine the shapes of gene tree distributions and their sensitivity to changes in branch lengths, species tree shape, and tree size. The method for computing gene tree distributions is implemented in the computer program COAL.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCoalescence 0acoalescent history 0alineage sorting 0amaximum likelihood 0aphylogenetics 0aspecies tree1 aSalter, Laura A.0 tEvolution.g2005 Jan., v. 59, no. 1 p.24-37dSociety for the Study of Evolutionx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1554%2F04-3853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245010100172300001400273520143100287592002801718650002501746650001901771650000901790650002301799650002301822650001501845650001801860650001101878650001401889650001601903650001301919650001901932650001601951651001001967651001301977651001801990653003002008653001602038653002002054653002302074653002602097773010002123856008702223852000902310655001202319IND60537846220221116175512.0190405e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053784622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCardoso, Andrea10aBehind the life cycle of coal: Socio-environmental liabilities of coal mining in Cesar, Colombia  ap. 71-82.  aOpen-pit coal mining in Cesar, Colombia increased by 74% between 2000 and 2012, generating environmental and social damages unacknowledged by companies and the state. This study aims to identify and value socio-environmental liabilities from coal mining at different stages of the coal life cycle. Environmental liabilities can be operationalized under three types of responsibilities: moral, legal, and economic. The identification of environmental liabilities allocates moral responsibility; the legal responsibility is needed for effective reparation; and the economic valuation provides arguments to claim compensation, seek remediation, and mitigation of damages. To identify socio-environmental liabilities, interviews were conducted and environmental mining conflicts were analyzed. To estimate monetary values, data were linked to existing literature on costs associated with damages. Results show that the economic values of socio-environmental liabilities per ton of extracted and exported coal are higher than the market price of coal. The main socio-environmental liabilities arise from pollution, local health deterioration, water table depletion, land and ecosystem services losses, damages from transportation and shipping, and coal reserve loss. A comparison with studies in China and the United States indicates that values increase when other health impacts and climate change on a global scale are included.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aclimate change 3acoal 3aeconomic valuation 3aecosystem services 3ainterviews 3amarket prices 3amining 3apollution 3aremediation 3ashipping 3atransportation 3awater table 3aChina 3aColombia 3aUnited States 0aEnvironmental liabilities 0aCoal mining 0aCoal life cycle 0aEconomic valuation 0aEnvironmental justice0 tEcological economics.g2015 Dec., v. 120 p.71-82dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03135naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100006100141245013000202300001800332520167300350592002802023650001802051650002302069650001102092650001402103650001202117650001402129650001002143650002302153650001602176650002402192650001202216650002002228650001602248651001402264653002902278653001502307653002102322700002402343700002102367700002902388700002002417773014402437856007502581852000902656655001202665IND60747561220221122063032.0210815e20210311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074756122DNAL7 a10.1093/jme/tjab0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoetti, Verónica1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9465-540010aEffect of Parental Photoperiod on Body Size and Developmental Time of Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) in Buenos Aires City  ap. 1638-1642.  aMany insects use photoperiod as a signal to anticipate upcoming unfavorable conditions. Photoperiod sensitivity may be a relevant factor in Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (L.) populations at the cool margins of the species' range, where winter conditions have a strong effect on population dynamics. In this study, we evaluated the effect of parental photoperiod on preimaginal survival and developmental time, and on wing length for the first generation of Ae. aegypti from a temperate region (Buenos Aires City, Argentina). Our experiment started with eggs from parents exposed to short-day (SD; 10:14 [L:D]) or long-day (LD; 14:10 [L:D]) photoperiods during their entire life span. Eggs were stored under the same photoperiod (SD or LD) as their parents for 91 d, until immersion. After hatching, larvae were reared until adult emergence in thermal baths at one of two constant temperatures (17 or 23°C), at a photoperiod of 12:12 (L:D) h and fed ad libitum. Survival from larva I to adult emergence was not affected either by parental photoperiod or rearing temperature. At a rearing temperature of 23°C, female offspring from the SD parental photoperiod developed faster and had shorter wings compared with those from the LD parental photoperiod. No effect of parental photoperiod was observed on female offspring reared at 17°C. In male offspring, parental photoperiod had no effect on developmental time and wing length, independently of the rearing temperature. Results indicate that the parental photoperiod may affect some offspring traits. This effect may be a characteristic of Ae. aegypti populations in temperate regions to deal with the winter conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aad libitum feeding 3aadults 3abody size 3afemales 3alongevity 3amales 3amedical entomology 3aphotoperiod 3apopulation dynamics 3aprogeny 3atemperate zones 3atemperature 3aArgentina 0atransgenerational effect 0aadult size 0atemperate region1 aDe Majo, María Sol1 aCampos, Raúl E.1 aDi Battista, Cristian M.1 aFischer, Sylvia0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2021 Mar. 11, v. 58, no. 4 p.1638-1642dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl45776x0022-25857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjab0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002300136245014700159300001600306520182000322592002802142653002602170653002702196653001402223653002602237653002002263653002202283700002402305773010302329856007202432852000902504655001202513IND60127152320221120071914.0151110e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012715232DNAL7 a10.1554/04-3862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvans, Jonathan P.10aMale-by-female interactions influence fertilization success and mediate the benefits of polyandry in the sea urchin heliocidaris erythrogramma  ap. 106-112.  aNumerous studies have reported that females benefit from mating with multiple males (polyandry) by minimizing the probability of fertilization by genetically incompatible sperm. Few, however, have directly attributed variation in female reproductive success to the fertilizing capacity of sperm. In this study we report on two experiments that investigated the benefits of polyandry and the interacting effects of males and females at fertilization in the free-spawning Australian sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma. In the first experiment we used a paired (split clutch) experimental design and compared fertilization rates within female egg clutches under polyandry (eggs exposed to the sperm from two males simultaneously) and monandry (eggs from the same female exposed to sperm from each of the same two males separately). Our analysis revealed a significant fertilization benefit of polyandry and strong interacting effects of males and females at fertilization. Further analysis of these data strongly suggested that the higher rates of fertilization in the polyandry treatment were due to an overrepresentation of fertilizations due to the most compatible male. To further explore the interacting effects of males and females at fertilization we performed a second factorial experiment in which four males were crossed with two females (in all eight combinations). In addition to confirming that fertilization success is influenced by male ×× female interactions, this latter experiment revealed that both sexes contributed significant variance to the observed patterns of fertilization. Taken together, these findings highlight the importance of male ×× female interactions at fertilization and suggest that polyandry will enable females to reduce the cost of fertilization by incompatible gametes.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCryptic female choice 0aexternal fertilization 0afecundity 0agenetic compatibility 0amultiple mating 0asperm competition1 aMarshall, Dustin J.0 tEvolution.g2005 Jan., v. 59, no. 1 p.106-112dSociety for the Study of Evolutionx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1554%2F04-3863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245009100168300001800259520158600277592002801863650001401891650002301905650002801928650002101956650001901977650001101996650001902007650001502026650001602041650001602057700005802073773017002131856008102301852000902382655001202391IND60767369020220314000000.0220303e20220204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076736902DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c042442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCihanoğlu, Gizem10aCVD-Deposited Oxygen-Selective Fluorinated Siloxane Copolymers as Gas Diffusion Layers  ap. 2633-2642.  aCopolymer thin films of 2,4,6,8-tetramethyl-2,4,6,8-tetravinylcyclotetrasiloxane (V4D4), 2-(perfluorohexylethylacrylate) (PFHEA), and 2-(perfluoroalkylethylmethacrylate) (PFEMA) were synthesized via initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) as potential candidates for gas diffusion layers (GDLs) in gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) for aqueous metal–air batteries. Thin-film GDLs exhibited an average water vapor transmission rate of 7.5 g m–² day–¹ and enhanced oxygen diffusion with oxygen permeabilities as high as 3.53 × 10–¹⁵ mol m m–² s–¹ Pa–¹ (10.5 Barrer). The electrochemical performance of GDEs fabricated using commercial catalysts, current collectors, and synthesized GDLs was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and potentiodynamic polarization measurements. The fabricated GDEs exhibited higher oxygen reduction current densities (228.2 mA cm–²) compared to commercial GDEs (132.7 mA cm–²). Copolymer GLDs exhibited an order of magnitude higher oxygen diffusion (39.5 × 10–⁸ cm² s–¹) in GDEs compared to commercial counterparts (1.84 × 10–⁸ cm² s–¹). Due to the high oxygen solubility of V4D4 and excellent hydrophobic behavior of PFHEA and PFEMA, their copolymers can effectively promote the diffusion of oxygen and restrict moisture intake, making them ideal materials for GDLs. Combining well-balanced properties of siloxane and fluorinated polymer chemistries, the iCVD process is an excellent low-cost method for the fabrication of GDLs for metal–air battery applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acomposite polymers 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3ahydrophobicity 3aoxygen 3aprocess design 3asolubility 3avoltammetry 3awater vapor1 aEbil, Özgenç1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7458-42190 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 Feb. 04, v. 61, no. 6 p.2633-2642dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c042443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245011300154300001600267520136000283592002801643650001901671650001601690650001501706650001601721650001501737650001501752650001701767650001601784650001301800650001601813650001601829650001301845650001401858653001901872653002501891700001601916700002501932700002101957773013101978856007302109852000902182655001202191IND60777263520221119124236.0220515e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077726352DNAL7 a10.18805/LR-46392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKale, Nakul10aPotentials of lactic acid bacteria in enhancing nodulation of Bradyrhizobium daqingense and yield in soybean  ap. 507-513.  aThe ferments of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used since decades in agricultural practice to control diseases, to promote plant growth and also to improve soils. However the functional roles of LAB in phytomicrobiome need to be discovered, which would result in understanding of the symbiotic relationship between LAB and plants and that could be exploited to improve agricultural production. In this study, the scientific investigation was carried out for pot culture evaluation of six efficient LAB isolates from soybean rhizosphere, on nodulation and yield of soybean in green house condition, which were proven positive for IAA and GA production and PGPR traits. Among the eight different treatment combination with Bradyrhizobium daqingense the treatment which received consortium of all six LAB isolates had significant impact on plant growth characters viz. plant height, root length, number of branches and chlorophyll content at 30 and 60 DAS. The LAB consortia also showed significantly high nodule number (47.67), nodule dry weight (117 mg plant⁻¹) and leg haemoglobin content (6.27 mg g⁻¹ fresh nodule) at 30 DAS. The yield and yield related traits was also highest in consortium treated plants. The property of plant to produce more nodules and healthy root growth can be attributed to IAA producing ability of inoculated LAB isolates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBradyrhizobium 3achlorophyll 3ahemoglobin 3alactic acid 3anodulation 3aphytobiome 3aplant height 3apot culture 3aresearch 3arhizosphere 3aroot growth 3asoybeans 3asymbiosis 0aCo-inoculation 0aLactic acid bacteria1 aAshwini, M.1 aJahagirdar, Shamarao1 aShirnalli, Geeta0 tLegume research.g2022 Apr., v. 45, no. 4 p.507-513dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:1999x0976-05717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18805/LR-46393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03376naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245012500163300001600288520194100304592002802245650002502273650001302298650001302311650001502324650001002339650000902349650001602358650002502374650002502399650001102424653003602435653002902471653001102500700001902511700001202530700001702542700001702559700001502576700001702591700001802608700001402626773017402640856008302814852000902897655001202906IND60724720120221121095859.0210124e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072472012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtcms.2018.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, You,10aBiological mechanisms underlying the liver's regulation of emotions in women: A study using the Trier Social Stress Test  ap. 110-118.  aResearch on the biological mechanisms by which the liver controls dispersion and regulates emotion usually focuses on psychological stress. This study investigated the biological mechanisms underlying the liver's regulation of emotion using the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Differences in subjective stress, subjective emotion, and physiological responses were examined between healthy women (Group A) and depressed women with liver qi stagnation syndrome (Group B).Subjects were 72 women who met the inclusion criteria after physical examination. The EPQ-RSC, BAI, and BDI-21 were used to assess personality and emotion. Subjects completed a 5-point scale to measure subjective stress. Heart rate and heart rate variability were measured. To measure changes in activity of the locus coeruleus–norepinephrine (LC-NE)/autonomic nervous system and the HPA axis, saliva samples were collected at the end of the rest and preparation periods, and 5 time pionts after the TSST task. The PAD Emotion Scale was completed at 4 time points before and after the TSST task. Saliva cortisol was tested. These indexes were compared between the two groups.There were 33 subjects in Group A and 39 subjects in Group B. Subjects in Group B had lower levels of stress, pleasure, and dominance, but higher arousal (after the task: P < .05). They also had higher saliva cortisol levels, slower heart rate, higher BVP, and more stable RMSSD and SDNN.In relation to mood, the liver's regulation of emotion mainly affects negative emotional experience and the sense of control. Regarding the biological mechanisms underlying the liver's regulation of emotion, the activity of the LC-NE/autonomic nervous system in women is more obvious in response to psychological stress when the dispersion of the liver is normal. The activity of the HPA axis in women is more obvious in response to psychological stress when the dispersion of the liver is abnormal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclinical examination 3acortisol 3aemotions 3aheart rate 3aliver 3aloci 3apersonality 3apsychological stress 3apsychosocial factors 3asaliva 0aTrier Social Stress Test (TSST) 0aLiver regulates emotions 0aStress1 aWang, Tianfang1 aWu, Hao1 aHuang, Yamei1 aWu, Mengying1 aZheng, Min1 aZhou, Renlai1 aWang, Qingguo1 aZhao, Yan0 tJournal of traditional Chinese medical sciences.g2018 Apr., v. 5, no. 2 p.110-118dElsevier B.V.aBeijing University of Chinese MedicinewJournal:23382x2095-75487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcms.2018.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245016200181300001600343520111100359536018301470592002801653596009601681650001901777650002001796650000901816650001901825650001701844650004301861650001501904650003701919650002701956650002901983650001602012653004402028653004002072653001302112653000902125653001602134653001002150653001702160653001502177700001902192700002002211773012402231856008502355852000902440655001202449IND60595682320221118030450.0180605e20180504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059568232DNAL7 a10.1080/19440049.2018.14255532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad Kamal, Nor Hasyimah10aSimultaneous formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heterocyclic aromatic amines (HCAs) in gas-grilled beef satay at different temperatures  ap. 848-869.  aThis study investigated the simultaneous formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heterocyclic aromatic amines (HCAs) in gas-grilled beef satay at different temperatures (150, 200, 250, 300, and 350°C). Solid-phase extraction (SPE) was used for sample clean-up. Fifteen PAHs were determined using high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) and nine HCAs were quantified using liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with a gradient programme. The lowest significantly concentrations of PAHs and HCAs were generated at 150°C; the formation of PAHs and HCAs simultaneously increased with temperatures. Benzo[a]pyrene was detected in all samples and increased markedly at 300 and 350°C. The sums of 4 PAHs (PAH4) in marinated beef satay at 300 and 350°C exceeded the maximum level in Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1125. Significant reductions of polar and non-polar HCAs (except PhIP) were found in marinated beef satay across all temperatures. Overall, PAHs and HCAs showed opposite trends of formation in beef satay with marination.  aThis work was supported by the research grant of Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) [Grant Number 02-02-13-1351FR] from the Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia (MOHE).  aPublisher supplied data  aFRGS 5524432cMinistry of Higher Education, Malaysiadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003093 3aEuropean Union 3aaromatic amines 3abeef 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3afluorescence 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amarinating 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asolid phase extraction 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atemperature 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 0aheterocyclic aromatic amines (HCAs) 0agrilling 0abeef 0atemperature 0asatay 0agas-grilling 0amarination1 aSelamat, Jinap1 aSanny, Maimunah0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2018 May 4, v. 35, no. 5 p.848-869dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl35737x1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2018.14255533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003300139245021900172500001900391520132000410592002801730650001601758650001201774650001601786650001301802650002501815650002301840650001201863650001501875650001801890650001301908650000901921650001001930700002901940700002701969773011901996856007302115852000902188655001202197IND60724613620221118215424.0210122e20210107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072461362DNAL7 a10.3390/w130201192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira, Andréia  A.

Despite the considerable use of the method, there is no consensus related to the most suitable age of embryos and other experimental parameters. Non-exposed embryos were videotaped for tail-coiling activity from 18 to 54 h post-fertilization (hpf) and after exposure to positive control candidates (caffeine, fluoxetine, and tricaine (MS-222)) and organic solvents (acetone, dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO), and ethanol) from 26.0 to 28.5 hpf. Results demonstrated that embryos from 22 to 29 hpf presented a constant coiling activity, with no significant differences between the activity measurements. We also found that stimulant properties of caffeine and the anesthetic effects of MS-222 induced hyperactivity and hypoactivity, respectively. Finally, even using DMSO at 1%, it seems to be safer as a solvent for neurotoxicity evaluation by tail coiling assay. The period from 26.0 to 28.5 hpf was appropriate for a fast protocol of tail coiling assay. Caffeine and MS-222 were demonstrated to be promising positive control candidates, whereas DMSO was considered the most appropriate solvent choice for tail coiling assay.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aacetone 3aanesthetics 3acaffeine 3adevelopmental stages 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aethanol 3afluoxetine 3aneurotoxicity 3asolvents 3atail 3awater1 aBrigante, Tamires  A.

Of collected adult and nymphal ticks, 436 were from passive collections, 142 from systematic collections, and 1,270 from special collections.Tick species distribution status changed in 36 counties. Our data provide noteworthy updates to distribution maps for use by public health agencies to develop prevention and control strategies. Additionally, the program built a network of collaborations and partnerships to support future tick surveillance efforts within Illinois and highlighted how the combination of the three surveillance strategies can be used to determine geographic spread of ticks, pinpoint locations in need of more surveillance, and help with long-term efforts that support phenology studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIxodidae 3aadults 3ageographical distribution 3ainventories 3amedical entomology 3amonitoring 3aphenology 3apublic health 3aticks 3aIllinois 0atick 0adistribution 0aestablishment 0asurveillance1 aBrand, Mary E.1 aGronemeyer, Peg1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9033-32921 aMateus-Pinilla, Nohra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2732-73591 aO'Hara Ruiz, Marilyn1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3941-87331 aStone, Chris M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9535-25831 aTuten, Holly C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2333-56771 aSmith, Rebecca L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8343-794X0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 58, no. 4 p.1849-1864dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl45776x0022-25857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjab0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03038naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245006600168300001600234520158700250592002801837650002901865650001701894650001601911650001801927650001501945650002101960650002101981650001602002650002502018650001602043650001302059650001202072650001502084653001602099653001802115653001002133700005702143700005602200700002202256700001802278700006002296773012002356856008302476852000902559655001202568IND60743009820221122152236.0210729e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074300982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2021.06.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIrigoiti, Yanet14aThe use of propolis as a functional food ingredient: A review  ap. 297-306.  aPropolis is a resinous product collected by bees from different plant species that contains numerous compounds with biological activity like antibacterial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, among others. These properties make propolis the ideal candidate to be used as a functional ingredient in foods, beyond its known use as an additive.This article provides a review of the latest papers about the chemical composition (especially polyphenols, flavonoids and terpenes), antimicrobial activity and antioxidant properties of propolis as a functional food ingredient. Besides, this article also reviews the newest technologies developed to incorporate propolis in food systems keeping its antioxidant properties and masking its off-flavour.Key findings and conclusions: Despite the differences in the chemical composition of propolis from all over the world, all of them show antioxidant and pharmacological activity making propolis an attractive natural product to be included in foods as a functional ingredient. Many researchers have proposed the use of encapsulation techniques like spray drying, which allows transforming the ethanolic propolis extract into an easily-handled alcohol-free powder appropriate to be incorporated in food systems. The inclusion of propolis in nanoparticles, biopolymers films and sucrose matrix is also promising. Based on the papers reviewed, further studies are needed relating the incorporation of propolis in foodstuffs, the dose at which its antioxidant or biological properties are effective and the sensory properties of the final product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidants 3abiopolymers 3aencapsulation 3aflavonoids 3afood composition 3afunctional foods 3aingredients 3amedicinal properties 3apolyphenols 3apropolis 3asucrose 3aterpenoids 0aComposition 0aAntimicrobial 0aFoods1 aNavarro, Alba1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7180-35511 aYamul, Diego1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6287-414X1 aLibonatti, Carina1 aTabera, Anahi1 aBasualdo, Marina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6445-46240 tTrends in food science & technology.g2021 Sept., v. 115 p.297-306dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2021.06.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02303naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245006700162300001300229520101500242592002801257650003401285650001501319650001001334650001401344650002001358650001701378650001201395650002501407653002001432653002101452653001901473700001701492700001401509700001401523700001901537700001601556700001701572700001701589773017101606856008301777852000901860655001201869IND60724720420221121095940.0210124e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072472042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtcms.2018.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qi10aApplication of TCM constitution in lifetime health maintenance  ap. 6-15.  aHealthy full life cycle has become an important national strategy, which indicates that attention needs to be given to human health throughout the life course. The full life cycle includes the whole process of conception and birth, development, growth, aging, and death, which has been recorded in Yellow Emperor's Canon of Medicine. From the perspective of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) constitution theory, the TCM constitution focuses on the life process in a continuous evolution based on individual development at different phases or stages from infancy to senility. The development of TCM constitution is beneficial in accumulating the theoretical and practical experience for promoting the application of TCM constitution health service into the full life cycle, and providing theory, technique and method for TCM health service in the full life cycle, as well. Through this review, we've found that TCM constitution has being widely used for clinical practice, but still needs further improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aconception 3adeath 3aevolution 3ahealth services 3ahuman health 3ainfancy 3apersonal development 0aFull life cycle 0aTCM constitution 0aHealth service1 aBai, Minghua1 aYang, Yin1 aNong, Mu,1 aSun, Pengcheng1 aHan, Junwen1 aFan, Taiping1 aYuan, Chunsu0 tJournal of traditional Chinese medical sciences.g2018 Jan., v. 5, no. 1 p.6-15dElsevier B.V.aBeijing University of Chinese MedicinewJournal:23382x2095-75487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcms.2018.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03846naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245014700175300001600322520219700338592002802535650001902563650002702582650001002609650000902619650002302628650001802651650002402669650001402693650002502707650001402732650001802746650001802764650000902782650001902791650002202810650001202832650001802844650001302862650002402875651002102899653002202920653003102942653001702973653002602990700001903016700002003035700002103055700002403076773009703100856008603197852000903283655001203292IND60688575120200616000000.0200429e20190903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068857512DNAL7 a10.1080/08927936.2019.15794732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSherwood, Lauren J.10aPerceptions of Veterinarians in British Columbia of Cat Management Strategies to Reduce Cat Overpopulation and Impacts on Wildlife Populations  ap. 613-629.  aFree-roaming cats present a multidisciplinary challenge for wildlife conservation and feline welfare. Veterinary professionals are critical stake-holders in the issue of free-roaming cats, making it imperative that their attitudes and perspectives are well understood. In this study, we conducted an electronic survey of veterinarians practicing across British Columbia to evaluate their perceptions of 1) whether cat overpopulation is a concern, 2) the impacts of cats on wildlife, and 3) alternative management strategies for dealing with cat overpopulation. Of the 389 respondents, 56% agreed that cat overpopulation was a local problem, and 91% agreed that veterinarians play a role in reducing cat overpopulation. Veterinarians in rural communities had a greater involvement in cat overpopulation and perceived it as more problematic than their urban colleagues. The majority (70%) of veterinarians reported that they performed early-age sterilization, supported the principle of low-cost spay-neuter services (67%), and 65% of them were involved in these services. Just over half (54%) of respondents reported that they provide permanent identification to cats, typically offering both microchips and tattoos. Veterinarians were less cohesive on their perceptions of the impact of free-roaming cats on wildlife: 53% agreed that after habitat loss cats are one of the most significant, direct causes of bird and wildlife mortality, while 30% were neutral and 17% disagreed. Fifty-six percent of veterinarians felt that keeping cats indoors would be one of the most effective strategies to reduce cat impacts on wildlife, but they also felt that public education programs and low-cost spay-neuter programs would be effective and more popular with cat owners. Most veterinarians (79%) recommended against unsupervised outdoor access, citing safety and disease risks. Rodent control was the most common reason for not recommending an indoor lifestyle. Overall, our survey results suggest that veterinarians are committed participants in the prevention of cat overpopulation. Conservationists need to focus on increased engagement with veterinarians regarding the impact of cats on wildlife.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3aattitudes and opinions 3abirds 3acats 3aeducation programs 3aferal animals 3ahabitat destruction 3alifestyle 3amicrochip technology 3amortality 3apet ownership 3aprofessionals 3arisk 3arodent control 3arural communities 3asurveys 3aveterinarians 3awildlife 3awildlife management 3aBritish Columbia 0afree-roaming cats 0ahuman–animal interaction 0aveterinarian 0awildlife conservation1 aWilson, Amy G.1 aSouth, Cluny S.1 aRoche, Steven M.1 aLuszcz, Tanya M.

The properties of deposited thin films showed a significant dependence on the growth temperature. The preferential growth orientation of all the thin films was occurred along the ZnO (002) plane. The maximum crystallite size and the minimum average transmittance in the wavelength range of 450–1100 nm were observed for the EZO thin film deposited at 25 °C. A red shift of the optical band gap was observed in the growth temperature range of 25–300 °C. The highest figure of merit, an index for evaluating the performance of transparent conducting thin films, was obtained at 200 °C of growth temperature. These results indicated that the high-quality EZO film was obtained at a growth temperature of 200 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallites 3aglass 3atemperature 3atransmittance 3awavelengths 3azinc oxide0 tCurrent applied physics.g2013 Nov., v. 13, no. 9 p.1954-1959dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2013.08.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03288naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245012600170300001600296520153800312592002801850650001501878650001201893650002801905650002301933650002101956650001501977650001301992650002502005650002302030650002402053650001002077650002402087650003302111650001102144650001002155650001302165650001202178650001702190650001502207650003002222650002202252650001202274650001002286653002402296653002702320653002402347653001602371653001702387700001802404700002402422700002202446700001802468773010202486856008902588852000902677655001202686IND60532882120221119000802.0190410e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053288212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2014.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWari, David10aMolecular verification of dispersal of phytoseiid mites from groundcover plants to tree leaves in Japanese peach orchards  ap. 143-155.  aA population survey of phytoseiid mites and of spider mites on randomly selected trees and their groundcover plant Paederia foetida L. (Rubiaceae) was conducted in Japanese peach orchards that used different pesticide practices. An organic orchard with wild groundcover and no synthetic chemicals used for pest control and a conventionally managed orchard with bare ground had no trees on which spider mite density was beyond the control threshold density (one mite per leaf). On the other hand, spider mite densities in some trees at conventionally managed orchards with wild groundcover were temporary beyond the control threshold level. The phytoseiid mite species composition on peach leaves estimated by previously established method using quantitative sequencing changed during the survey period and varied among orchards. PCR amplification of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal genes of Tetranychus kanzawai Kishida and Panonychus mori Yokoyama from three phytoseiid mite species, Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor), Amblyseius eharai Amitai and Swirski, and Euseius sojaensis (Ehara), collected on peach leaves was conducted. Results showed that the feeding preference for the three phytoseiid mite species was greater for T. kanzawai than for P. mori in the field.

(Oxalidaceae) showed that phytoseiid mites move from groundcover plants to peach leaves, possibly through ambulatory and aerial dispersal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmblyseius 3aEuseius 3aNeoseiulus californicus 3aOxalis corniculata 3aPaederia foetida 3aPanonychus 3aPetrobia 3aTetranychus kanzawai 3abiological control 3afeeding preferences 3agenes 3aground cover plants 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaves 3amites 3aorchards 3apeaches 3apest control 3apesticides 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3atrees 0aGeneralist predator 0aGroundcover vegetation 0aSpecies composition 0aSpider mite 0aGut analysis1 aFunayama, Ken1 aKishimoto, Hidenari1 aToyama, Masatoshi1 aSonoda, Shoji0 tBiological control.g2015 Jan., v. 80 p.143-155dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2014.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03258naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245010400172300001600276520171200292592002802004650002402032650002302056650002702079650000902106650001102115650002302126650000902149650001402158650001202172650001602184650002302200650001602223650001402239650002202253650002002275650001602295650001502311653002002326653002802346653002102374653003802395653002202433700001502455700002402470700002002494700001402514773010202528856008902630852000902719655001202728IND60532882220221118235533.0190410e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053288222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2014.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalamanca, J.10aBehavioral responses of adult lacewings, Chrysoperla externa, to a rose–aphid–coriander complex  ap. 103-112.  aNatural enemy behavior is mediated by cues associated with the host-plant complex, such as volatiles emitted by damaged plants and the surrounding vegetation. We conducted studies to investigate whether: (a) adult attraction of green lacewing, Chrysoperla externa Hagen, to and oviposition on rose, Rosa×hybrida L., infested by the potato aphid, Macrosiphum euphorbiae Thomas, is affected by the presence of coriander, Coriandrum sativum L. (a potential companion plant); (b) the role of volatiles on female C. externa attraction to uninfested and aphid-infested rose, coriander, and from the rose–coriander complex; and, (c) whether M. euphorbiae feeding induces volatile emissions from rose plants. In the greenhouse, numbers of C. externa adults were higher on aphid-infested rose and on roses near coriander plants; however, there was no aphid×coriander interaction, indicating that attraction to aphid-infested rose was not influenced by the presence of coriander. Aphids increased the number of eggs laid by C. externa on rose but this was also not affected by the presence of coriander. In Y-tube studies, C. externa females showed attraction to volatiles from aphid-infested rose, coriander only, and the rose–coriander complex and were not attracted to rose volatiles; however, there was no difference in C. externa attraction between aphid-infested rose versus aphid-infested rose plus coriander. Headspace analysis revealed that aphid-infested rose emits greater quantities of methyl salicylate compared with uninfested rose. In conclusion, although C. externa adults were attracted to coriander, coriander did not increase attraction or oviposition of this predator to aphid-infested rose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysoperla externa 3aCoriandrum sativum 3aMacrosiphum euphorbiae 3aRosa 3aadults 3abiological control 3aeggs 3aemissions 3afemales 3agreenhouses 3aheadspace analysis 3ahost plants 3alacewings 3amethyl salicylate 3anatural enemies 3aoviposition 3avegetation 0aNatural enemies 0aTri-trophic interaction 0aCompanion plants 0aHerbivore-induced plant volatiles 0aMethyl salicylate1 aPareja, M.1 aRodriguez-Saona, C.1 aResende, A.L.S.1 aSouza, B.0 tBiological control.g2015 Jan., v. 80 p.103-112dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2014.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03374naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245008300177300001600260520156800276536006901844592002801913596004401941650002801985650001102013650001802024650001602042650001302058650000902071650002102080650002102101650002302122650001002145650001202155650001102167650001202178650001202190650001702202650001502219650000902234650002002243650001202263650001002275653001602285653002102301653002402322653003802346653001802384653002102402653002402423700002102447700002702468700002202495700002302517773012502540856008602665852000902751655001202760IND60595682720221118030748.0190321e20180403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059568272DNAL7 a10.1080/19440049.2018.14268892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVejdovszky, Katharina10aRisk assessment of dietary exposure to perchlorate for the Austrian population  ap. 624-632.  aPerchlorate is frequently found as contaminant in a variety of food. Based on analytical data of perchlorate occurrence in food products from the Austrian market, this study calculated dietary perchlorate exposure of the Austrian population for the three age classes of adults, children and infants. Furthermore, a detailed risk assessment was conducted based on the tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.3 µg/kg body weight/day, established by the European Food Safety Authority in 2014. Calculations of a scenario of average food consumption did not indicate elevated health risks by dietary perchlorate uptake. Exposure estimates reached only 12%, 26% and 24% of the TDI for adults, children and infants, respectively. However, in a scenario of high consumption, the TDI was exceeded by all age classes with 132%, 161% and 156%. The major cause for this exceedance is the comparatively high perchlorate contamination of spinach, but also other leaf vegetables, legumes and pineapples, leading to elevated exposure of high consumers. Our calculations reveal that the current provisional intra-Union trade reference level for perchlorate in spinach of 0.2 mg/kg, advocated by the European Commission, is not sufficient to protect high consumers against possible health risks. In order to reduce health risks to a tolerable level for all consumers, lowering of the regulatory maximum perchlorate concentrations is indicated. Moreover, a generally diversified diet can also counteract excessive exposure to perchlorate as well as to other harmful food contaminants.  aThis work was funded by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Health.  aPublisher supplied data  cthe Austrian Federal Ministry of Health 3aacceptable daily intake 3aadults 3aage structure 3abody weight 3achildren 3adiet 3adietary exposure 3afood consumption 3afood contamination 3afoods 3ainfants 3aleaves 3alegumes 3amarkets 3aperchlorates 3apineapples 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3aspinach 3atrade 0aPerchlorate 0afood contaminant 0aendocrine disruptor 0asodium iodide symporter inhibitor 0athyroid gland 0adietary exposure 0aexposure assessment1 aGrossgut, Roland1 aUnterluggauer, Hermann1 aInreiter, Norbert1 aSteinwider, Johann0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2018 Apr. 3, v. 35, no. 4 p.624-632dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl35737x1944-00577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2018.14268893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245020600179300001600385520100500401592002801406650004401434650002201478650002201500650001501522650001401537650002001551650002801571650001201599650001201611650001701623650003301640650001001673650002701683653001601710653003201726653002301758653001201781653001301793700002801806700002701834700002901861773010601890856008701996852000902083655001202092IND60581262320221117201024.0190409e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058126232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.07.1052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaresh Kumar, Manickam10aDevelopment of natural cellulase inhibitor mediated intensified biological pretreatment technology using Pleurotus florida for maximum recovery of cellulose from paddy straw under solid state condition  ap. 353-361.  aInhibitor mediated intensified bio-pretreatment (IMBP) technology using natural cellulase inhibitor (NCI) for maximum cellulose recovery from paddy straw was studied. Pretreatment was carried out under solid state condition. Supplementation of 8% NCI in pretreatment medium improves cellulose recovery and delignification by 1.2 and 1.5-fold respectively, compared to conventional bio-pretreatment due to inhibition of 61% of cellulase activity in IMBP. Further increase in NCI concentration showed negative effect on Pleurotus florida growth and suppress the laccase productivity by 1.1-fold. Laccase activity in IMBP was found to be 2.0U/mL on 19thday, which is higher than (1.5U/mL) conventional bio-pretreatment. Physico-chemical modifications in paddy straw before and after pretreatment were analysed by SEM, ATR-FTIR, XRD and TGA. According to these findings, the IMBP technology can be a viable eco-friendly technology for sustainable production of bioethanol with maximum cellulose recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPleurotus florida 3aX-ray diffraction 3abioethanol 3acellulose 3adelignification 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3alaccase 3apaddies 3apretreatment 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astraw 3asustainable technology 0aPaddy straw 0aNatural cellulase inhibitor 0aCellulose recovery 0aLaccase 0aATR-FTIR1 aRavikumar, Rajarathinam1 aThenmozhi, Senniyappan1 aKirupa Sankar, Muthuvelu0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Nov., v. 244 p.353-361dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.07.1053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003000152245019600182300001600378520101100394592002801405650002301433650001901456650001601475650001501491650001301506650001101519650001101530650002901541650001601570650002301586650004301609650001801652650001101670650001401681650004401695650001201739653002501751653001101776653002501787653002401812653001501836653002901851700002101880700003001901700002701931700003401958700003101992773010602023856008702129852000902216655001202225IND60581262420221117201003.0190409e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058126242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.07.1062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarros, Valciney Gomes de10aImproved methane production from sugarcane vinasse with filter cake in thermophilic UASB reactors, with predominance of Methanothermobacter and Methanosarcina archaea and Thermotogae bacteria  ap. 371-381.  aBiogas production from sugarcane vinasse has enormous economic, energy, and environmental management potential. However, methane production stability and biodigested vinasse quality remain key issues, requiring better nutrient and alkalinity availability, operational strategies, and knowledge of reactor microbiota. This study demonstrates increased methane production from vinasse through the use of sugarcane filter cake and improved effluent recirculation, with elevated organic loading rates (OLR) and good reactor stability. We used UASB reactors in a two-stage configuration, with OLRs up to 45gCODL−1d−1, and obtained methane production as high as 3LL−1d−1. Quantitative PCR indicated balanced amounts of bacteria and archaea in the sludge (109–1010copiesg−1VS), and of the predominant archaea orders, Methanobacteriales and Methanosarcinales (106–108copiesg−1VS). 16S rDNA sequencing also indicated the thermophilic Thermotogae as the most abundant class of bacteria in the sludge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethanobacteriales 3aMethanosarcina 3aThermotogae 3aalkalinity 3abacteria 3abiogas 3aenergy 3aenvironmental management 3afilter cake 3amethane production 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3asludge 3asugarcane 3aupflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor 3avinasse 0aMethanogenic archaea 0aBiogas 0aOrganic loading rate 0aMicrobial diversity 0aAlkalinity 0aNutrient supplementation1 aDuda, Rose Maria1 aVantini, Juliana da Silva1 aOmori, Wellington Pine1 aFerro, Maria Inês Tiraboschi1 aOliveira, Roberto Alves de0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Nov., v. 244 p.371-381dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.07.1063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245015900167520132600326592002801652650002001680650001101700650001501711650001201726650001101738650000901749650001801758650001601776651001001792653003801802653004401840653003101884653004301915653001801958700001501976700001301991700001702004700001802021700001702039773011702056856008602173852000902259655001202268IND60746600520221120202552.0211009e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074660052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconhyd.2021.1038632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Zhiwei10aRegional agricultural water resources management with respect to fuzzy return and energy constraint under uncertainty: An integrated optimization approach  aIn this study, an integrated framework is proposed for agricultural water and land resources management under uncertain circumstances and energy-water nexus. The framework has two components: the optimized interval solutions generation of unknown market quotation and environment situation through the novel interval fuzzy-expectation programming, and the post-optimization decision-making of the tradeoff between system risk and return through risk-explicit interval programming. An optimization model based on the framework was developed from a real description for agricultural water resources system of Guangdong province under considering various crop, multiple water sources, and the related energy consumption in irrigation and drainage. The impact of energy consumption and risk level control on water resources allocation among different crops and system benefits were analyzed. The results indicated that the preference for surface water resources as the main water sources can effectively reduce regional irrigation energy consumption, and the planting area of each crop would have different variations duo to resources endowment constraints. Risk tradeoff-based results can provide valuable information and additional concern for developing low carbon-oriented agricultural water resources management schemes.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aenergy 3airrigation 3amarkets 3amodels 3arisk 3asurface water 3auncertainty 3aChina 0aIntegrated optimization framework 0aAgricultural water resources management 0aEnergy-consumption control 0aInterval fuzzy-expectation programming 0aRisk analysis1 aXie, Yulei1 aJi, Ling1 aCai, Yanpeng1 aYang, Zhifeng1 aHuang, Guohe0 tJournal of contaminant hydrology.g2021 Oct., v. 242 p.103863-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl42311x0169-77227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconhyd.2021.1038633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245007600172300001600248520130000264592002801564650002301592650001601615650002201631650001401653650001101667650001101678650001401689650002601703650001001729650002701739653003401766653001901800653003201819653001901851653003401870653000801904653000801912653000801920653000801928700002901936700001701965700002201982773009002004856008502094852000902179655001202188IND60629972920221122222510.0190207e20180401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062997292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.01.1442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, Shaikh M.14aThe levelized costs of electricity generation by the CDM power projects  ap. 235-246.  aThis paper examines the costs of electricity generation by the power projects under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol. Using the CDM project-specific data, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for each project is calculated. Based on the calculated LCOEs, an electricity cost function is estimated and the average cost curves for different renewable technologies, project locations, and time are derived. The results show that LCOE decreases, at a decreasing rate, with the scale and duration of the projects while the degree of economies of scale and time significantly vary across different technologies and locations. Results further show that the distribution of power projects in the CDM energy portfolio or a given location does not quite follow the relative cost structure for different technologies. Also, the distribution of different types of projects across different regions or host countries does not strictly follow the relative average costs for different locations. As the power projects under the CDM earn additional revenues from the sales of Certified Emissions Reduction credits (CERs), the CDM enables renewable electricity to be more competitive which crucially depends on CER prices, costs of CER issuance, and the length of crediting period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomies of scale 3aelectricity 3aelectricity costs 3aemissions 3aincome 3aprices 3aprotocols 3arenewable electricity 3asales 3asustainable technology 0aLevelized cost of electricity 0aPower projects 0aClean development mechanism 0aKyoto protocol 0aCertified emission reductions 0aF53 0aQ54 0aQ56 0aQ581 aSpalding-Fecher, Randall1 aHaites, Erik1 aKirkman, Grant A.0 tEnergy.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 148 p.235-246dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.01.1443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02159naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009200167506010400259506007600363520068300439592002801122506003701150650001201187650001101199650001601210650001101226650002001237650001201257650001401269653002401283653002001307653002701327653003701354653002601391700002001417700006001437700005601497773009001553856008501643852000901728655001201737IND60782141020221207110051.0221004e20221015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078214102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1246972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Weiwei10aMobile energy recovery and storage: Multiple energy-powered EVs and refuelling stations  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIt is widely accepted that electrical vehicles (EVs) for goods and people have a crucial role to play in energy transition towards carbon neutrality. Despite significant progress in recent decades, challenges remain in charging times of EV batteries and range anxiety of drivers, compared with vehicles powered by liquid fuels which are several times more energy dense than Li-ion batteries. This perspective article examines two solutions that have the potential to address the challenges: the conversion of diverse forms of wasted energy into electricity (e.g. vibration) and the reduction of battery power for the provision of ancillary services (e.g. cabin thermal comfort).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanxiety 3acarbon 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy recovery 3aliquids 3avibration 0aElectrical vehicles 0aEnergy recovery 0aThermal energy storage 0aMulti-vector refuelling stations 0aFuture infrastructure1 aZhang, Tongtong1 aKildahl, Harriet1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6128-37321 aDing, Yulong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8490-53490 tEnergy.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 257 p.124697-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1246973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04559naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245011200173300001400285520308000299592002803379650002003407650001203427650001403439650000903453650000903462650002603471650000903497650001603506650001103522650001803533650001203551650001903563650002403582650001203606650000903618650001103627653001703638653001903655653001903674653001303693653001103706700001803717700002003735700006103755700001403816773011503830856008703945852000904032655001204041IND60611499520221122055807.0190318e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061149952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2018.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlint, Hannah E.10aEffect of training for dog fear identification on dog owner ratings of fear in familiar and unfamiliar dogs  ap. 66-74.  aScientific studies often assess aspects of dog behaviour, such as fear, via owner reports. More information on how accurate these ratings are for dogs displaying different levels of fear would be valuable. The current study assessed which fear behaviours dog owners are able to reliably recognize and whether provision of training on recognition of fear alters participant ratings of fear in familiar and unfamiliar dogs. Dog owners (n = 735) were asked to identify which dog fear behaviours were present/absent in a series of videos. This survey showed that owners were able to correctly identify the presence and absence of (Sensitivity and Specificity >0.75) lowered body posture, ears back, lowered tail, wagging tail, panting, lolling tongue, yawning, lip licking, avoiding eye contact, and attempts to hide/escape/retreat. These behaviours were used to make a training tool for recognizing fear in dogs. Next, an intervention study was conducted where dog owners (n = 1413) were surveyed and asked to complete the fear and anxiety section of the Canine Behavioural Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ) for their own dogs, and then either received training on recognizing fear in dogs (i.e., training), or did not (i.e., control). Both groups were then asked to rate the severity of fear in dogs in nine videos, with three examples each of no fear, mild/moderate fear, and high/extreme fear. Finally, owners were asked to complete the C-BARQ survey for their own dogs a second time to determine if training to recognize fear in dogs altered their responses. Owners were scored as either correct or incorrect in their rating of each video, and this was modelled as the outcome of a mixed logistic regression model with owner as a random intercept, in order to assess the effect of training on owners’ ability to correctly rate dog fear displayed in videos. While training was not associated with owners being more likely to correctly identify ‘no fear’ (OR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.86, 1.20; p = 0.881), it resulted in owners being more likely to correctly identify ‘mild/moderate fear’ (OR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.34, 1.91; p < 0.001) and ‘high/extreme fear’ (OR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.50, 2.54; p < 0.001). The effect of training on owner ratings of fear in their own dog were assessed using three mixed linear regression models aligning with three previously identified C-BARQ factors relating to fear (i.e., stranger-, dog- and non-social fear) as the outcomes and with owner as a random intercept. Training was not associated with the outcome in any of the three models, either independently or as part of an interaction with time. High ICC values were obtained for all three fear factors; this suggests excellent test-retest reliability when reassessment occurs in a short time frame (<20 min.). Before recommending the use of training to improve the use of the C-BARQ, further studies are needed to determine why training improves recognition of fear in videos of unfamiliar dogs, but does not alter the owners’ rating of their own dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal behavior 3aanxiety 3abreathing 3adogs 3aears 3aeducational materials 3aeyes 3afearfulness 3amodels 3apet ownership 3aposture 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 3atail 3atongue 0aDomestic dog 0aFear behaviour 0aIdentification 0aValidity 0aC-BARQ1 aCoe, Jason B.1 aPearl, David L.1 aSerpell, James A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2826-11871 aNiel, Lee0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2018 Nov., v. 208 p.66-74dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2018.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245014000175300001800315520088400333592002801217650002501245650001501270650001601285650001101301650001501312650001601327650001601343650001201359650002501371651001001396651001301406651001101419653001801430653001601448653002501464653002301489653002001512700002501532700002001557700002701577700001501604700002301619700002001642700002401662773010501686856008401791852000901875655001201884IND60122266220221120122932.0150325e20141002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012226622DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2014.9239992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalminen, Juha-Pekka10aRapid profiling of phenolic compounds of green and fermented Bergenia crassifolia L. leaves by UPLC-DAD-QqQ-MS and HPLC-DAD-ESI-QTOF-MS  ap. 1530-1533.  aBergenia crassifolia L., Saxifragaceae, is an evergreen perennial plant known in traditional medicine of Russia, Mongolia and China.

Juveniles were observed free‐swimming in a mesocosm untagged and with small and large external accelerometer packages that increased frontal cross‐sectional area of the animals and their submerged weight. Despite adhering to widely used standards for tag mass, the presence of an external telemetry package altered swimming kinematics, activity levels and swimming performance of juvenile N. brevirostris relative to untagged individuals, suggesting that tag mass is not a suitable standalone metric of device suitability. Changes in swimming performance could not be detected from tail‐beat frequency, which suggests that tail‐beat frequency is an unsuitable standalone metric of swimming performance for small N. brevirostris. Lastly, sharks experienced treatment‐specific changes in activity level and swimming kinematics from morning to afternoon observation. Therefore, the presence of external telemetry packages altered the kinematics, activity levels and swimming performance of small young‐of‐the‐year N. brevirostris and these data may therefore be relevant to other similar‐sized juveniles of other shark species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNegaprion brevirostris 3aaccelerometers 3ajuveniles 3akinematics 3alemons 3asharks 3atelemetry1 aSuski, C.

We identify the key factors driving energy consumption from seven frontier market economies in Africa. More specifically, the role of economic, financial, and trade integrations are explored as the source of overall energy demand. First, we establish cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity across countries. Second, the long-run elasticities of energy consumption reflect the key role of stock market indicators, along with industrialisation and trade openness while foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows have a reducing effect. In this respect, the long-run energy elasticities on individual countries show a considerable variation. Finally, the heterogeneous panel non-causality test confirms that the energy consumption has a feedback relationship with stock market indicators and industrialisation. Our findings reflect that the environmental planning should comprise development in financial and trade sectors in boosting economic growth and increasing energy demand for these countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic performance 3aelasticities 3aenergy 3aforeign direct investment 3aindustrialization 3amarket economy 3aplanning 3astock exchange 3atrade 3aAfrica 0aStock market development 0aEnergy consumption 0aAfrican frontier markets 0aCross-sectional dependence 0aC23 0aG18 0aQ40 0aQ41 0aQ481 aBhattacharya, Mita1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4483-21891 aOzturk, Ilhan1 aZakari, Abdulrasheed0 tEnergy.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 148 p.123-133dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.01.1463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011100162300001800273520143800291592002801729650001601757650001201773650002001785650001701805650001201822650002001834650001801854650001901872650003301891650001401924650002001938651001101958651001001969651002001979700001501999700001602014700001702030700001302047700001602060700001602076773010902092856008102201852000902282655001202291IND50090060120221122042440.0150215e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009006012DNAL7 a10.1007/s00606-014-0980-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Feifei10aMolecular phylogeny of Cotoneaster (Rosaceae) inferred from nuclear ITS and multiple chloroplast sequences  ap. 1533-1546.  aCotoneaster Medik. (Rosaceae, Maloideae) is distributed in Europe, North Africa, and temperate areas of Asia except Japan. Members of the genus exhibit considerable morphological variation. The infrageneric classification is also obscured by polyploidy, hybridization, and apomixis. In this study, phylogenetic analyses were conducted to test infrageneric classifications of this genus using DNA sequence data from the nuclear ITS (nrITS) region and three chloroplast intergenic spacer regions. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference analyses of both datasets agreed with the two sections/subgenera of Koehne’s classification system, and suggested that four subsections (Microphylli, Chaenopetalum, Adpressi, and Cotoneaster) and the series of Koehne’s classification system were non-monophyletic. The incongruence length difference test indicated that the nrITS and cpDNA datasets were significantly incongruent (P = 0.001), and the placement of 14 species was discordant in phylogenetic trees derived from the two datasets. Within Cotoneaster, hybridization was indicated to be an important factor contributing to the incongruence between the nrITS and cpDNA data. By mapping nine morphological characters onto the combined nrITS–cpDNA phylogenetic tree, we inferred that a deciduous habit, glabrous fruit, white anthers, erect and light pink petals, and white filaments are plesiomorphic character states in Cotoneaster.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCotoneaster 3aanthers 3achloroplast DNA 3achloroplasts 3acorolla 3adata collection 3ahybridization 3aintergenic DNA 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aphylogeny 3atemperate zones 3aEurope 3aJapan 3aNorthern Africa1 aFan, Qiang1 aLi, Qingyan1 aChen, Sufang1 aGuo, Wei1 aCui, Dafang1 aLiao, Wenbo0 tPlant systematics and evolution.g2014 June, v. 300, no. 6 p.1533-1546dSpringer-Verlagx0378-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00606-014-0980-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03372naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245007300159300001800232520194300250592002802193650001202221650000902233650001602242650002002258650002202278650001902300650000902319650001502328650001102343650001502354650001402369650002902383650002302412651001402435653001502449653002902464653002202493653002102515700001802536700001602554700002102570700002402591700002102615773015402636856007902790852000902869655001202878IND60609484520221120123354.0200427e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060948452DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2017-137962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRearte, R.10aEffect of milk production on reproductive performance in dairy herds  ap. 7575-7584.  aThe objective of the present study was to assess the relationship between individual cow milk yield and fertility, accounting for the contextual effect of the herd. A data set including 657,968 lactations from 677 dairy herds in Argentina from 2001 to 2012 was used. The odds of pregnancy by 100 d in milk (DIM) were assessed by a multilevel logistic model (with cow as the first and herd as the second hierarchical level), and time to pregnancy was assessed by a proportional hazards regression model. Multilevel logistic models included the fixed effects of milk yield by 80 DIM, parity, year, and calving season at cow level and quartiles of herd milk yield by 80 DIM as a contextual effect. The proportional hazards model included the effect of daily cow-level milk yield as time-dependent variable, with milk yield at herd level as the stratification variable. Cows producing 1 standard deviation over the mean milk yield of their herd had 1.3 percentage point lower pregnancy by 100 DIM (from 31.4 to 30.1%; odds ratio = 0.942) when in herds in the top quartile of milk yield, whereas they increased 0.5 percentage points (from 27.9 to 28.4%) when in herds in the lowest quartile of milk yield. Only 4% of the observed variation in pregnancy by 100 DIM was explained by the random effect of the herd. Similarly, cows producing 1 standard deviation (8 kg/d) greater than the herd mean daily milk had 1.3% lower hazard of pregnancy (hazard ratio = 0.987) at 63 DIM in herds in the top quartile of milk yield, whereas they had 14.8% higher hazard (hazard ratio = 1.148) in herds in the lowest quartile of milk yield. The magnitude of the negative association between the cow's daily milk yield and the hazard of pregnancy increased with DIM. In conclusion, the relationship between milk yield and reproductive performance is statistically significant, but the effect size is practically small and is modulated by herd production level.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalving 3acows 3adairy herds 3adata collection 3aherd productivity 3alogit analysis 3amilk 3amilk yield 3amodels 3aodds ratio 3apregnancy 3areproductive performance 3astandard deviation 3aArgentina 0amilk yield 0areproductive performance 0acontextual effect 0amultilevel model1 aLeBlanc, S.J.1 aCorva, S.G.1 ade la Sota, R.L.1 aLacau-Mengido, I.M.1 aGiuliodori, M.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2018 Aug., v. 101, no. 8 p.7575-7584dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-137963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01456naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245004200171300001800213520037000231592002800601650001600629650000900645650001300654650004400667650001400711653002200725653001300747653001500760653002400775700003000799700002200829700001800851700001500869773010500884856008400989852000901073655001201082IND60122266320221120122954.0150325e20141002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012226632DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2014.9240012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaud, Shaari Bin12aA new coumarin from Calophyllum hosei  ap. 1534-1538.  aA new coumarin, hoseimarin (1), together with four other xanthones, trapezifolizanthone (2), osajaxanthone (3), β-mangostin (4) and caloxanthone A (5), were isolated from the stem bark of Calophyllum hosei .

The results indicated that NOB was more sensitive to the FA anaerobic treatment than AOB. The FA anaerobic inhibition on nitrifier gradually heightened with the increase of FA concentration. Accompanied with FA concentration increase from 0 to 16.82mgNH3–N·L−1 (the highest concentration adopted in this study), the activity of AOB reduced by 15.9%, while NOB decreased by 29.2%. After FA anaerobic treatment, nitrite was accumulated during nitrification. However, the nitrite accumulation disappeared on the sixth cycle of activity recovery tests with excessive aeration. Based on this result, a novel strategy for achieving nitritation is proposed, which involves recirculating a portion of the activated sludge through a side-line sludge treatment unit, where the sludge is subjected to treatment with FA under anaerobic condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aaeration 3aammonia 3aanaerobic treatment 3abacteria 3anitrification 3anitrites 0aFree ammonia (FA) 0aAmmonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) 0aNitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) 0aNitritation 0aWastewater treatment1 aPeng, Yongzhen1 aLi, Xiyao1 aZhang, Qiong1 aMa, Bin0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Nov., v. 243 p.1247-1250dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.07.1193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02747naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245011400167300001400281520133800295592002801633650001501661650001601676650000901692650001601701650001501717650001101732650002301743650001201766650001001778650001301788650001201801650001501813650001401828650001201842650001301854651001401867653002401881653001601905653001301921653001101934653001501945653001601960700002001976700002301996773013702019856007602156852000902232655001202241IND60594704720221119105557.0180522e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059470472DNAL7 a10.2983/035.037.01062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNowland, Samantha J.10aEmbryonic, Larval, and Early Postlarval Development of the Tropical Black-Lip Rock Oyster Saccostrea echinata  ap. 73-77.  aThe black-lip rock oyster, Saccostrea echinata, has considerable potential for aquaculture in tropical Australia and the Indo-Pacific region because of its large size, rapid growth rates, and established market acceptance. This article is the first to report on embryonic and larval development of this species reared under hatchery conditions. Developmental biology was examined across three larval cultures over a 21-day period. Newly fertilized eggs had a mean (±SE) diameter of 50 ± 0.4 µm, and postfertilization, the first polar body formed within 20 min. The earliest actively swimming trochophore appeared from 12.5 h postfertiliszation (hpf) and D-stage larvae appeared by 18 hpf. Rapid shell growth resulted in the presence of early umbo larvae at 5–7 days post fertilization (dpf). Pediveliger larvae were present from 18 dpf and the larvae settled with induction by epinephrine bitartrate from 21 dpf when they had reached an anteroposterior shell measurement of approximately 280 µm and could be retained on a 200-µm nylon mesh screen. Despite minor differences, overall, the early ontogeny of S. echinata is consistent with that of other members of the genus. This study fills an important knowledge gap in the literature and will aid the advancement of hatchery protocols for this developing aquaculture species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccostrea 3aaquaculture 3aeggs 3aepinephrine 3ahatcheries 3alarvae 3alarval development 3amarkets 3anylon 3aontogeny 3aoysters 3apostlarvae 3aprotocols 3arearing 3aswimming 3aAustralia 0aSaccostrea echinata 0arock oyster 0atropical 0alarvae 0aembryology 0aaquaculture1 aO'Connor, Wayne1 aSouthgate, Paul C.0 tJournal of shellfish research.g2018 Apr., v. 37, no. 1 p.73-77dNational Shellfisheries AssociationwJournal:15036x0730-80007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2983/035.037.01063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011800162520141700280592002801697650001601725650001801741650001601759650001301775650002101788650001101809650001801820650001401838650002001852650001001872650003301882650001001915651001001925653001101935653002601946653003101972653003302003653003002036700001802066700002302084700005902107700001802166700001302184773012202197856008102319852000902400655001202409IND60713052520221121220322.0211030e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071305252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1103422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Wenrui10aInvestigation of microbial composition and functional characterization of Zangqu using high throughput sequencing  aZangqu is a saccharifying starter used in the production of highland barley wine, which is a traditional Chinese liquor. The objective of this study was to explore microbial composition and function of Zangqu. 16 Zangqu samples were collected from seven different locations in Tibet were analyzed microbial communities using high throughput sequencing technology. The sequenceing analysis revealed 1 340 734 fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) reads and 737 185 high quality bacterial 16S rDNA sequences, which were used for taxonomic classification. A total of four fungal and six bacterial phyla were predominantly present in Zangqu samples. Saccharomycopsis, Rhizopus, and Aspergillus were the most abundantly present fungal genera, and Lactobacillus and Leuconostoc were the most abundantly present bacterial genera. The saccharifying ability and protease activity are widely used to evaluate the quality of Zangqu. 57 strains were isolated from all samples using traditional culture medium screening method, as well as molecular biological analysis. Rhizopus oryzaeM12 had the highest saccharifying ability, which was 1382 ± 77.38 mg/g min.Bacillus amyloliquefaciensQ4 had the highest protease activity, which was 1035.56 ± 40.09 μg/g min.

A total of 98 survey responses were received from laboratories in 22 countries in Europe, North America, South America, Asia and Australia. There appears a clear and urgent need to identify the most humane methods of anaesthesia and euthanasia. Aversive responses to MS‐222 were widely observed raising concerns about the use of this anaesthetic for D. rerio. The use of anaesthesia in fin clipping for genetic identification is widely practised and there appears to be an opportunity to further develop less invasive methods and refine this process. Optimization (and potentially standardization) of feeding is an area for further investigation. Given that diet and body condition can have such profound effects on results of experiments, differences in practice could have significant scientific implications. Further research into transition between dark and light phases in the laboratory appears to represent an opportunity to establish best practice. Plants and gravel were not considered practical by many laboratories. The true value and benefits need to be established and communicated. Overproduction is a concern both from ethical and financial viewpoints. There is an opportunity to further reduce wastage of D. rerio. There are clear concerns and opportunities for the scientific community to work together to further improve the welfare of these important laboratory models.  aPublisher supplied data  cAstraZeneca Safety Health and Environment Research Programme 3aDanio rerio 3aanesthesia 3abody condition 3adiet 3aethics 3aeuthanasia 3afish 3agenetic testing 3agravel 3asurveys 3aAsia 3aAustralia 3aEurope 3aNorth America 3aSouth America1 aReadman, G.

In view of this, genic microsatellite markers were developed from the coding and non-coding sequences of calcium signaling and transport genes viz. calcium transporters (channels; ATPases and antiporters), calcium-binding proteins and calcium-regulated protein kinases available in rice and sorghum. In total, 146 genic "simple sequence repeat" (SSR) primers were designed and evaluated for cross-transferability across a panel of nine grass species including finger millet. The average transferability of genic SSR markers from sorghum to other grasses was highest (73.2 %) followed by rice (63.4 %) with an overall average of 68.3 % which establishes the importance of these major crops as a useful resource of genomic information for minor crops. The transfer rate of SSR markers was also correlated with the phylogenetic relationship (or genetic relatedness) of the species. Primers with successful amplification in finger millet were further used to screen for polymorphism across a set of high and low calcium containing genotypes. The results reveal a conserved behavior across the finger millet genotypes indicating that the mineral transport and the storage machinery largely remain conserved in plants and even SSR variations in them remain suppressed during the course of evolution. Single nucleotide polymorphism and differential expression patterns of candidate genes, therefore, might be a plausible reason to explain variations in grain calcium contents among finger millet genotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acalcium-binding proteins 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenetic relationships 3agenotype 3agrasses 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amillets 3aphylogeny 3aprotein kinases 3arice 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aspecialty crops 3atransporters1 aGaur, Vikram Singh1 aJaiswal, J.

In this study, the effects of freezing rate (−10 °C, −15 °C, −20 °C, and −40 °C/min) on gamete quality was examined, using Sybr-14 and propidium iodide to determine viability (sperm cell membrane integrity), ATP concentration using a luciferin-luciferase bioluminescence assay, and a CEROS computer-assisted sperm analysis system to characterize striped bass sperm motion. Adult male striped bass (N = 12) were sampled once a week for 5 weeks. Collected samples were extended, cryoprotected using a 7.5% (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide final concentration solution, and frozen using a Planer Kryosave controlled-rate freezer. Samples were stored in liquid nitrogen for 49 days, and sperm quality was re-evaluated after thaw (same methods). Sperm cryopreserved at −40 °C/min resulted in means for total motility (10.06%), progressive motility (7.14%), ATP concentration (0.86 pmol/106 cells), and sperm viability (56.5%) that were greater (P < 0.05) than those for slower cooling rates. Therefore, −40 °C/min was the optimal freezing rate (among those tested) for cryopreservation of striped bass sperm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMorone saxatilis 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadults 3abioluminescence 3acell membranes 3acooling 3acryopreservation 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3afreezing 3aiodides 3anitrogen 3aspermatozoa 3aviability 2aAnimals 2aAquaculturexmethods 2aBassxphysiology 2aCryopreservationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aMale 2aSemen Preservationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aSperm Motility 2aSpermatozoaxphysiology 2aTime Factors 0aSperm cryopreservation 0aFreezing rate 0aStriped bass 0aCASA1 aTheisen, D.D.1 aGuthrie, H.D.1 aWelch, G.R.1 aWoods, L.C.0 tTheriogenology.g2013 Apr. 01, v. 79, no. 6 p.940-945dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2013.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03000naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003600139245012700175300001600302500002000318520150600338592002801844596003801872596005501910596002001965650002301985650001302008650001702021650002002038650001102058650001502069650001902084650002502103650001302128650001702141700007002158700007102228700007702299773012002376856007302496852000902569655001202578IND60741779520221122221831.0210618e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074177952DNAL7 a10.1111/jpy.131382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhumada‐Fierro, Norma Valeria10aPhotosynthesis and photoprotection characteristics related to ROS production in three Chattonella (Raphidophyceae) species  ap. 941-954.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe toxic potential of Chattonella is associated with a high production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Chattonella species can tolerate high irradiance levels but seems not to be efficient in the induction of nonphotochemical chl a fluorescence (NPQ) under light stress conditions. Therefore, we postulated that high ROS production of this microalgal group is related to the lack of effective photoprotection mechanisms. We compared the NPQ induction, xanthophyll cycle interconversion (XC), and the production of the ion superoxide (O₂⁻) in Chattonella marina var. antiqua, Chattonella sp., and C. marina acclimated to 43 (LL) and 300 µmol photons · m² · s⁻¹ (HL). We also evaluated the photosynthetic characteristics of the three strains. Photosynthesis saturated at relative high irradiances (above 500 µmol photons · m² · s⁻¹) in LL and HL Chattonella strains. For the first time, we documented the conversion of diadinoxanthin into diatoxanthin in microalgae that have violaxanthin as the major XC carotenoid. The slow NPQ induction indicated that qE (fast component of NPQ) was not present, and this process was related to the interconversion of XC pigments. However, the quenching efficiency (QE) of deepoxidated xanthophylls was low in the three Chattonella strains. The strain with the lowest QE produced the highest amount of a O₂⁻. Therefore, ROS production in Chattonella seems to be related to a low expression of XC‐related thermal PSII dissipation.  aPublisher supplied data  a260040‐2015cFORDECYT—CONACyT  cRed Temática sobre Florecimientos Algales Nocivos  a260040cCONACyT 3aChattonella marina 3aalgology 3afluorescence 3alight intensity 3alutein 3amicroalgae 3aphotosystem II 3aradiation resistance 3atoxicity 3aviolaxanthin1 aGarcía‐Mendoza, Ernesto1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1738-74191 aSandoval‐Gil, Jose Miguel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8973-03061 aBand‐Schmidt, Christine Johanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8251-98200 tJournal of phycology.g2021 June, v. 57, no. 3 p.941-954dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl23523x0022-36467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpy.131383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010300169300001800272520105100290592002801341650001901369650003101388650002501419650001701444650002101461650001801482650001801500650001101518650002301529650001701552653001001569653000901579653001601588653001301604653001901617653001601636700002401652700002401676700002201700773010501722856008401827852000901911655001201920IND60122266720221120133345.0150325e20141002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012226672DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2014.9258932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaudonė, Lina10aQuality evaluation of different preparations of dry extracts of birch (Betula pendula Roth) leaves  ap. 1645-1648.  aQualitatively prepared dry extracts are advantaged over conventional fluid extracts. Extracts of Betula pendula Roth leaves possess mild diuretic effects and anti-inflammatory activity. In this work, the spray-drying and lyophilisation processes were evaluated for producing dry extracts of birch leaves. The purpose was to identify the best drying method that provides the highest content of phenolic compounds and possesses greatest antioxidant activity. Predominant compounds hyperoside and chlorogenic acid were chosen as markers for the quantitative control of phenolic compounds. Their determined amounts in hydroalcoholic birch leaf extract were 15.85 and 8.77 mg/g of dry residue, respectively. Insignificant differences were determined in spray- and freeze-dried extracts. In the antioxidant profile, hyperoside (28.9 μmol TE/g dw) and chlorogenic acid (22.8 μmol TE/g dw) possessed strongest ferric-reducing activity. Also, no significant differences of antioxidant activity were determined in the spray- and freeze-dried extracts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula pendula 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3achlorogenic acid 3afreeze drying 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3aphenolic compounds 3aspray drying 0abirch 0aFRAP 0aantioxidant 0aphenolic 0aBetula pendula 0adry extract1 aRaudonis, Raimondas1 aJanulis, Valdimaras1 aViškelis, Pranas0 tNatural product research.g2014 Oct. 2, v. 28, no. 19 p.1645-1648dTaylor & Francisx1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2014.9258933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03662naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245012800167300001600295520179100311592002802102650003002130650002602160650001102186650001702197650002102214650002602235650001502261650001202276650002502288650001502313650002902328650002502357650001602382653002602398653002202424653002702446653003202473653003202505653001702537700001502554700001702569700001702586700002002603700002002623700001802643700001702661700001802678700001802696700001602714700001702730700001602747700001702763700001502780700001802795773012702813856008702940852000903027655001203036IND50069678120221120044838.0190318e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006967812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2013.04.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhi10aTemperature and precipitation control of the spatial variation of terrestrial ecosystem carbon exchange in the Asian region  ap. 266-276.  aCarbon exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere is one of the most important processes in the global carbon cycle. Understanding the spatial variation and controlling factors of carbon exchange fluxes is helpful for accurately predicting and evaluating the global carbon budget. In this study, we quantified the carbon exchange fluxes of different terrestrial ecosystems in the Asian region, and analyzed their spatial variation and controlling factors based on long-term observation data from ChinaFLUX (19 sites) and published data from AsiaFlux (37 sites) and 32 other sites in Asia. The results indicated that the majority of Asian terrestrial ecosystems are currently large carbon sinks. The average net ecosystem production (NEP) values were 325±187, 274±207, 236±260, 89±134gCm−2yr−1 in cropland, forest, wetland and grassland ecosystems, respectively. The spatial variation of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Re) were mainly controlled by the mean annual temperature (MAT) and the mean annual precipitation (MAP) in the Asian region. There was a clear linear relationship between GPP and MAT, and a strong sigmoid relationship between GPP and MAP. Re was exponentially related to MAT and linearly related to MAP. Interestingly, those response modes were consistent across different ecosystem types. The different responses of GPP and Re to MAT and MAP determined the spatial variation of NEP. The combined effects of MAT and MAP contributed 85%, 81% and 36% to the spatial variations of GPP, Re and NEP, respectively. Our findings confirmed that the spatial variation of carbon exchange fluxes was mainly controlled by climatic factors, which further strongly supports the use of the climate-driven theory in the Asian region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aclimatic factors 3aecosystem respiration 3aecosystems 3aforests 3aglobal carbon budget 3agrasslands 3anet ecosystem production 3aprimary productivity 3atemperature 0aTerrestrial ecosystem 0aSpatial variation 0aCarbon exchange fluxes 0aClimate controlling factors 0aCarbon source/sink strength 0aAsian region1 aYu, Guirui1 aGe, Jianping1 aSun, Xiaomin1 aHirano, Takashi1 aSaigusa, Nobuko1 aWang, Qiufeng1 aZhu, Xianjin1 aZhang, Yiping1 aZhang, Junhui1 aYan, Junhua1 aWang, Huimin1 aZhao, Liang1 aWang, Yanfen1 aShi, Peili1 aZhao, Fenghua0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2013 Dec. 15, v. 182-183 p.266-276dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2013.04.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02854naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011900157300001800276500002000294520161600314592002801930596003801958650002101996650001802017650001402035650001202049650001302061650001002074650001502084650000902099650000902108650001502117650001202132650001602144650001302160650001302173650001102186700001602197773012402213856007402337852000902411655001202420IND60786981120221122084359.0220807e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078698112DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.133162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarter, K.

Some methods of euthanasia cause death through cessation of respiratory or cardiovascular systems, causing oxygen levels of blood and tissues to drop. For experiments where the goal is to measure the effects of environmental low oxygen (hypoxia), the choice of euthanasia technique, therefore, may confound the results. This study examined the effects of four euthanasia methods commonly used in fish biology (overdose of MS‐222, overdose of clove oil, rapid cooling and blunt trauma to the head) on variables known to be altered during hypoxia (haematocrit, plasma cortisol, blood lactate and blood glucose) or reflecting gill damage (trypan blue exclusion) and energetic status (ATP, ADP and ATP:ADP) in Gulf killifish Fundulus grandis after 24 h exposure to well‐aerated conditions (normoxia, 7·93 mg O₂ l⁻¹, c. 150 mm Hg or c. 20 kPa) or reduced oxygen levels (0·86 mg O₂ l⁻¹, c. 17 mm Hg or c. 2·2 kPa). Regardless of oxygen treatment, fish euthanized by an overdose of MS‐222 had higher haematocrit and lower gill ATP:ADP than fish euthanized by other methods. The effects of 24 h hypoxic exposure on these and other variables, however, were equivalent among methods of euthanasia (i.e. there were no significant interactions between euthanasia method and oxygen treatment). The choice of an appropriate euthanasia method, therefore, will depend upon the magnitude of the treatment effects (e.g. hypoxia) relative to potential artefacts caused by euthanasia on the variables of interest.  aPublisher supplied data  cDepartment of Biological Sciences 3aFundulus grandis 3ablood glucose 3aclove oil 3acooling 3acortisol 3adeath 3aeuthanasia 3afish 3ahead 3ahematocrit 3ahypoxia 3alactic acid 3anormoxia 3aoverdose 3aoxygen1 aRees, B.

This study proposes a novel and precise assessment of egg sorting using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a state-of-the-art computer vision method to perform classification tasks. To classify unwashed egg images, VGG16 architecture was modified by a global average pooling layer, dense layers, a batch normalization layer, and a dropout layer. The modified model was trained based on intact, bloody, and broken (breakage, crack, or hole on the eggshell) eggs, which were combined with being dirty. Performance evaluation of the CNN model through 5-fold cross-validation showed that it outperforms traditional machine vision-based models. The accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve were 96.55, 95.59, 94.92, 97.39, and 96.16%, respectively. The CNN model achieved an average overall accuracy of 94.84 by 5-fold cross-validation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer vision 3aegg quality 3aegg shell 3aeggs 3afood industry 0aEgg 0aIntact 0aDefect detection 0aDeep learning 0aVGG161 aOmid, Mahmoud1 aTaheri-Garavand, Amin0 tJournal of food engineering.g2020 Oct., v. 283 p.110036-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2020.1100363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02388naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245009000171500001900261520123800280592002801518650004401546650001701590650002701607650002201634650000901656650001501665650001801680653001201698653001501710653001301725653002601738700002201764700002001786773011101806856008801917852000902005655001202014IND60696293820221117185542.0201202e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069629382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.1103382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrant, Braden10aDiscrimination of automotive window tint using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and chemometrics  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAutomotive window tints are commonly applied to motor vehicles to reduce transmittance of light and heat into the interior. They may hence be encountered as physical evidence in criminal investigations, or in civil matters where a tint is suspected to originate from a different source than advertised. Establishing a tint’s provenance would be highly relevant in such cases. However, there are currently a lack of established guidelines for forensic tint analysis. This study used attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy with chemometrics to characterize automotive tints based on their adhesive composition. Minimal variability was observed within a single roll of tint, however substantial variability was observed between tints of different brands. Certain individual tint products were also found to possess highly distinctive spectra. Subsequent predictive models were able to associate unknown tint samples to their brand, and found to be robust to both adhesive curing and short-term environmental exposure over a five-month period. The use of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and chemometrics thus offers a rapid and objective approach to discriminating automotive tints for forensic purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3achemometrics 3aenvironmental exposure 3aforensic sciences 3aheat 3aprovenance 3atransmittance 0aPolymer 0aAutomotive 0aForensic 0aInfrared spectroscopy1 aSauzier, Georgina1 aLewis, Simon W.0 tForensic science international.g2020 Aug., v. 313 p.110338-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.1103383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02899naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245010500174520139500279592002801674650002201702650001301724650001201737650001701749650001101766650002501777650001401802650001001816650001801826650002301844650001101867650001301878650002601891650001401917650001901931650001301950650001401963650001401977653002201991653001402013653003002027653002502057700001602082700001802098700001702116700001402133700001502147773011002162856008802272852000902360655001202369IND60649469820221119070334.0200106e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064946982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marenvres.2019.1047542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRakotomalala, C.10aModelling the functioning of a coupled microphytobenthic-EPS-bacterial system in intertidal mudflats  aA mechanistic and biogeochemical model was developed to analyze the interactions between microphytobenthos (MPB), bacteria and nutrients in a tidal system. Behavioral vertical migration was hypothesized as being controlled by exogenous factors (tide and light) but also by endogenous factors (carbon and nitrogen requirements). The secretion of Extracellular Polymeric Substances (EPS) during photosynthesis (overflow metabolism) and migration of diatoms was also formulated. Similarities in MPB dynamics between observations and simulations support the assumption that carbon and nitrogen ratios are additional key processes behind the vertical migration of diatoms in the sediment. The model satisfactorily reproduced the three growth phases of the MPB development observed in a mesocosm (the lag phase, the logarithmic growth, and the plateau). Besides, nutrient availability, which could be induced by faunal bioturbation, significantly determined the extent of MPB biomass and development. The plateau phase observed in the last days of simulations appeared to be attributed to a nutrient depletion in the system, emphasizing the importance of nutrient availability. The model, although improvable especially on the formulation of the EPS excretion and bacteria development, already updated understanding of several aspects of benthic-system functioning during experimental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3abacteria 3abiomass 3abioturbation 3acarbon 3adevelopmental stages 3aexcretion 3afauna 3alittoral zone 3amigratory behavior 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3anutrients 3aphotosynthesis 3apolymers 3asecretion 3asediments 0aMicrophytobenthos 0aMigration 0aCarbon and nitrogen ratio 0aBiogeochemical model1 aGuizien, K.1 aGrangeré, K.1 aLefebvre, S.1 aDupuy, C.1 aOrvain, F.0 tMarine environmental research.g2019 Sept., v. 150 p.104754-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1982x0141-11367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2019.1047543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02386naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003300152245011600185300001600301520112200317592002801439650001001467650002001477650001301497650002501510650002101535650001501556650001101571653003601582653002801618653001401646700001301660700001601673700001801689700002001707700001901727700002801746773010601774856008701880852000901967655001201976IND60581263220221117200737.0190409e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058126322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.07.1342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, Johan Syafri Mahathir10aStability of algal-bacterial granules in continuous-flow reactors to treat varying strength domestic wastewater  ap. 225-233.  aStability of algal-bacterial granules was investigated in two continuous-flow systems to treat synthetic domestic wastewater using single (R1) and series (R2=R2-1+R2-2 with automatically internal recirculation) reactors by seeding 50% (w/w) algal-bacterial granules. Almost similar organics and phosphorus removal efficiencies were obtained from the two systems, with no significant difference found for each between the designed two operation stages. However, R2 exhibited superior performance on total nitrogen (TN) removal (76%). When double increased strength influent fed to R1, R1 achieved better denitrification with TN removal increased from 29% to 80%, possibly due to the increased influent organics concentration favored the denitrification process. Most importantly, the two systems well maintained their granular stability, and all granules became algal-bacterial ones with very little change detected in algae content in granules after 120days’ operation. At last, the mechanisms were proposed regarding the formation and enhanced stability of new algal-bacterial granules in continuous-flow reactors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3adenitrification 3agranules 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrogen content 3aphosphorus 3asowing 0aAlgal-bacterial granular sludge 0aContinuous-flow reactor 0aStability1 aCai, Wei1 aZhao, Ziwen1 aZhang, Zhenya1 aShimizu, Kazuya1 aLei, Zhongfang1 aLee, D.

Sterile cultures were initiated on modified Murashige and Skoog medium, and clones from individual donor plants were assigned to experimental conditions when approximately 100 shoots of each clone were available. The effects of temperature, light quality, and plant growth regulators on multiplication and survival were assessed. Four clones from which large greenhouse populations were obtained were selected for in-depth analysis. When shoots were cultured at 10°C and 16°C, multiplication ratios consistently >1 were observed from three of four clones and two of four clones, respectively, during the five-subculture cycles. None of the clones stably increased when cultured at 24°C, and plants from this treatment did not survive acclimatization in the greenhouse. Only one clone showed increased multiplication ratios in response to plant growth regulator treatments, with maximum multiplication when shoots were cultured with 9 μM benzyladenine and 0.5 μM naphthaleneacetic acid. Light quality in the laboratory did not affect multiplication ratio but did affect subsequent greenhouse survival. The size of plants derived from culture was most often equivalent (65% of 1,271) to 3-yr-old seed-derived plants. Although the growth of clones during acclimatization differed, plants derived from cultures incubated at 16°C had the best rates of overall greenhouse survival. Temperature and light treatments in vitro critical to long-term plant survival were demonstrated and will assist the establishment of a mass propagation system for V. californicum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVeratrum californicum 3aacclimation 3abenzyladenine 3aclones 3agreenhouses 3alight quality 3amicropropagation 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aplant response 3ashoots 3atemperature1 aNaylor-Adelberg, Jacqueline1 aWhite, Sarah A.1 aMann, David A.1 aAdelberg, Jeffrey0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2014 June, v. 50, no. 3 p.337-344dSpringer-Verlagx1054-54767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11627-014-9603-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02574naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008900169300001800258520109500276592002801371650002901399650001701428650001501445650004101460650002201501650001301523650001501536650001301551650003301564650003201597650002201629650001601651651001301667653002201680653000901702653000701711653000801718653001501726700002301741700001901764700002201783700001901805700002501824700002101849773010501870856008401975852000902059655001202068IND60122266920221120133330.0150325e20141002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012226692DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2014.9263552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaggi, Filippo10aIntra-population chemical polymorphism in Thymus pannonicus All. growing in Slovakia  ap. 1557-1566.  aSolid-phase microextraction technique coupled with gas chromatography–flame ionisation detector and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry was used to investigate the inter- and intra-population chemical polymorphism in volatile constituents of three populations of Thymus pannonicus growing in Slovakia. To have an idea on what really the plant emits under different environmental and physiological conditions, a total of 86 individuals were separately analysed using low extraction temperatures (30°C). Data were analysed using a chemometric approach such as the principal component analysis which revealed a significant intra-population variability with the existence of up to four chemotypes: the most abundant is the p -cymene/γ-terpinene chemotype, followed by the geraniol and linalool chemotypes, and, only in one population, by the γ-muurolene/(E)-caryophyllene chemotype. This differentiation of individual plants inside the populations allows better adaptation to ecological conditions of localities and is probably connected with intrinsic genetic diversity of the species.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical polymorphism 3achemometrics 3achemotypes 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agenetic variation 3ageraniol 3aionization 3alinalool 3aprincipal component analysis 3asolid phase microextraction 3aspecies diversity 3atemperature 3aSlovakia 0aThymus pannonicus 0aSPME 0aGC 0aPCA 0achemotypes1 aCaprioli, Giovanni1 aPapa, Fabrizio1 aSagratini, Gianni1 aVittori, Sauro1 aKolarčik, Vladislav1 aMártonfi, Pavol0 tNatural product research.g2014 Oct. 2, v. 28, no. 19 p.1557-1566dTaylor & Francisx1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2014.9263553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04325naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245006800176500001900244520253700263592002802800650001602828650002002844650001002864650001802874650001202892650001802904650001002922650001302932650002202945650001102967650001102978650001402989650002103003650001303024650001403037650002503051651001203076651001203088651001203100651001103112651001103123653002003134653002203154653001903176653002003195653001503215653003103230700001603261700001803277700002203295700002203317700001903339700001903358700001403377700002503391700002103416700001803437773011103455856008803566852000903654655001203663IND60696294220221117185543.0201202e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069629422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.1103432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimonsen, K. Wiese10aFatal poisoning in drug addicts in the Nordic countries in 2017  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study is the seventh report on fatal poisonings among drug addicts in the Nordic countries. In this report, we analyse data from the five Nordic countries: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Data on gender, number of deaths, places of deaths, age, main intoxicants and substances detected in blood were recorded to obtain national and comparable Nordic data, and to allow comparison with earlier studies conducted in 1984, 1991, 1997, 2002, 2007 and 2012.The death rate (number of deaths per 100,000 inhabitants) was highest in Iceland (6.58) followed closely by Sweden (6.46) and then lowest in Denmark (4.29). The death rate increased in Finland (5.84), Iceland and Sweden and decreased in Denmark compared to earlier studies. The death rate in Norway, which has decreased since 2002, has stabilised around 5.7 as of 2017. Women accounted for 7–23% of the fatal poisonings. The percentage was lowest in Iceland and highest in Finland and Norway. The age range was 14–70 years. The median age (41 years) was highest in Denmark and Norway. The other countries had a median age between 33 and 35 years.Opioids were the main cause of death. Methadone remained the main intoxicant in Denmark, while heroin/morphine was still the main intoxicant in Norway, as was buprenorphine in Finland. However, the picture has changed in Sweden compared to 2012, where heroin/morphine caused most deaths in 2017. Sweden also experienced the highest number of deaths from fentanyl analogues (67 deaths) and buprenorphine (61 deaths). Deaths from fentanyl analogues also occurred in Denmark, Finland and Norway, but to a smaller extent. Over the years, the proportion of opioid deaths has decreased in all countries except Sweden, which has experienced an increase. This decline has been replaced by deaths from CNS stimulants like cocaine, amphetamine and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). Cocaine deaths have occurred in all countries but most frequently in Denmark. MDMA deaths have increased in all countries but mostly in Finland.Poly-drug use was widespread, as seen in the earlier studies. The median number of detected drugs per case varied from 4–6. Heroin/morphine, methadone, buprenorphine, cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and benzodiazepines were frequently detected. Pregabalin and gabapentin were detected in all countries, especially pregabalin, which was detected in 42% of the Finnish cases. New psychoactive substances (NPS) occurred in all countries except Iceland.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamphetamine 3abenzodiazepines 3ablood 3abuprenorphine 3acocaine 3adata analysis 3adeath 3afentanyl 3aforensic sciences 3agender 3aheroin 3amethadone 3amethamphetamines 3amorphine 3amortality 3atetrahydrocannabinol 3aDenmark 3aFinland 3aIceland 3aNorway 3aSweden 0aFatal poisoning 0aDrug addict death 0aNordic country 0aMain intoxicant 0aDrug abuse 0aNew psychoactive substance1 aKriikku, P.1 aThelander, G.1 aEdvardsen, H.M.E.1 aThordardottir, S.1 aAndersen, C.U.1 aJönsson, A.K.1 aFrost, J.1 aChristoffersen, D.J.1 aDelaveris, G.J.M1 aOjanperä, I.0 tForensic science international.g2020 Aug., v. 313 p.110343-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.1103433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245015200169300001600321520169300337592002802030650000902058650001202067650002102079650002202100650001402122650001402136650002702150650001902177650001802196700002502214700001802239700001902257700001802276700001702294773011602311856008102427852000902508655001202517IND50090068520221120154806.0150215e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009006852DNAL7 a10.1007/s11627-014-9606-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgrawal, Anuradha10aPhenotypic and molecular studies for genetic stability assessment of cryopreserved banana meristems derived from field and in vitro explant sources  ap. 345-356.  aExplants used for cryopreservation of banana (Musa L. spp.) are mainly sourced from tissue culture. Here, we demonstrate the successful use of sucker meristems (SM) obtained from field-raised plants for cryopreservation of Indian Musa ABB cv. ‘Karpura Chakkarakeli’. In addition, the genetic stability of plants recovered from cryopreserved and regenerated meristems after hardening and transfer to field conditions was studied using 11 phenotypic (biometric) characters and 21 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The regenerative potential of cryopreserved SM was compared with two types of routinely employed explants of banana germplasm: in vitro-raised single-shoot meristems (IVM) and proliferating meristems (PM). The regeneration frequency of SM was high (60.0 ± 11.5%) and statistically comparable to PM (68.3 ± 4.4%) and IVM (55.6 ± 11.1%) after using the droplet vitrification cryopreservation technique. The total time required for cryopreserving plants from SM (∼2 mo) was substantially less than that for PM (14 mo) and IVM (8 mo). The SSR profiles of plants recovered from cryopreserved PM, IVM, and SM and compared with control plants had a similarity coefficient of 0.92. Data on phenotypic traits revealed that cryopreserved plants were statistically comparable to the mother plants raised from suckers for all important growth and yield parameters. This study broadens the possibilities to cryopreserve Musa germplasm, by applying the droplet vitrification method to a new type of explant, the SM. The results presented in this paper show that Musa meristems can be effectively cryopreserved for storage and regeneration of true-to-type plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMusa 3abananas 3acryopreservation 3agenetic stability 3agermplasm 3ameristems 3amicrosatellite repeats 3atissue culture 3avitrification1 aSanayaima, Rajkumari1 aSingh, Rakesh1 aTandon, Rajesh1 aVerma, Smriti1 aTyagi, R.

In total, 1,429 Holstein cows from 3 commercial herds in Ontario, Canada, were enrolled over 1 yr in a randomized controlled trial. At each farm, primiparous and multiparous animals were housed in separate pens. At the pen level, cows were assigned to reproductive management primarily using an AAM system based on monitoring activity levels (Heatime, SCR Engineers Ltd., Netanya, Israel) or a timed artificial insemination (TAI) program. A crossover occurred after 6mo of the trial to avoid confounding treatment with parity. Insemination based on additional detection of estrus by visual observation was practiced in all pens. At the individual cow level, time to pregnancy throughout the study (n=1,985 cow-6mo periods), time to first service, and time to second service were analyzed with a Cox proportional hazards models accounting for herd, and did not differ overall between the AAM and TAI treatment groups. However, we observed an interaction between herd and breeding program, such that association of AAM- or TAI-based program with these outcomes differed between farms. Time to pregnancy was not different in herd A [median=151 and 136 d; hazard ratio (HR) = 0.93] and herd C (median=99 and 124, HR = 1.24), whereas herd B had a median time to pregnancy of 119d and 146d (HR = 1.3) in the AAM and TAI groups, respectively. Under conditions in which 19 to 32% of artificial inseminations in both groups were based on visually detected estrus, herd pregnancy rate and cow-level time to pregnancy did not differ overall between TAI- and AAM-based programs, but the effect of reproductive management approach depended on herd. Considering 924 cow-6mo periods with artificial inseminations only by the assigned program, we also found an interaction between herd and breeding program. Stratified analysis showed no difference in time to pregnancy in herd A (HR = 1.3), whereas in herds B (HR = 1.7) and C (HR = 2.8), cows in the AAM treatment group became pregnant sooner compared with those in the TAI group. Factors that influence the variability in relative performance of these management systems between herds require further investigation. Our study used one commercial activity monitoring system and the results cannot necessarily be generalized to other systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aartificial insemination 3acows 3aengineers 3aestrus 3aestrus detection 3afarms 3aherds 3ainsemination 3amanagement systems 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apregnancy rate 3arandomized clinical trials 3areproductive performance 2aAnimals 2aBreedingxmethods 2aCattle 2aDairyingxmethods 2aFemale 2aInsemination, Artificialxmethodsxveterinary. 2aParity 2aPregnancy 2aTime Factors 3aIsrael 3aOntario1 aLeslie, K.E.1 aWalton, J.S.1 aLeBlanc, S.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2012 Oct., v. 95, no. 10 p.5683-5693dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2011-52643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01713naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245011100153300001800264500002000282520045300302592002800755596017500783650001900958650002000977650001400997650002001011650001501031650001201046650001601058700001501074700001401089700001501103700001401118773012401132856007401256852000901330655001201339IND60786981420221122114921.0220807e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078698142DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.133282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíez, G.10aDigestive activity and stomach temperature in farmed bluefin tuna Thunnus thynnus measured by acoustic tag  ap. 2504-2511.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEight farmed Atlantic bluefin tuna Thunnus thynnus were tagged with temperature and depth transmitters inserted in chub mackerels Scomber colias to characterize their digestive activity, feeding physiology and behaviour in captivity.

Imidacloprid use for suppressing hemlock woolly adelgid, Adelges tsugae (Annand) (Hemiptera: Adelgidae), in forests offers a rare opportunity to assess potential impacts on aquatic macroinvertebrates in relatively pristine landscapes. Aquatic macroinvertebrate communities were assessed in 9 streams in Great Smoky Mountains National Park (southern Appalachian Mountains, USA). The streams flow through hemlock conservation areas where imidacloprid soil drench treatments were applied for hemlock woolly adelgid suppression. Sites were located upstream and downstream of the imidacloprid treatments. Baseline species presence data (pre‐imidacloprid treatment) were available from previous sample collections at downstream sites. Downstream and upstream sites did not vary in numerous community measures. Although comparisons of paired upstream and downstream sites showed differences in diversity in 7 streams, higher diversity was found more often in downstream sites. Macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups and life habits were similar between downstream and upstream sites. Downstream and baseline stream samples were similar. While some functional feeding group and life habit species richness categories varied, variations did not indicate poorer quality downstream communities. Imidacloprid treatments applied according to US Environmental Protection Agency federal restrictions did not result in negative effects to aquatic macroinvertebrate communities, which indicates that risks of imidacloprid use in forest settings are low.

In recent years, many economic studies have attempted to assess the benefits of glyphosate use in European arable farming. Among impact on fuel consumption, labour costs and other agronomic factors, yield effects of glyphosate play a central role in economic calculations. So far, these yield effects have been based generally on estimates. To determine whether existing research gives evidence for yield effects in European cropping systems, we reviewed articles by combining bibliometric and meta-analysis approaches. We searched 11,900 peer-reviewed journals for glyphosate-related studies to get an overview of glyphosate research in general and of studies on glyphosate yield effects in non-GMO arable farming in particular. In all, we located 6,841 articles that address glyphosate topics. A cluster analysis showed that a large part of the research is related to glyphosate-resistant cropping systems and toxicological topics. However, information on glyphosate yield effects in non-GMO cropping systems is also available—albeit rarely. Sixty-seven papers address the yield and/or weed control effects of either postharvest, presowing or preharvest treatment, while only 42 address yield effects and of these, four studies were carried out in Europe. Considering the highly diverse glyphosate application patterns, after presenting and discussing the results of all 65 articles, we conclude that there is no scientific basis for published economic calculations on glyphosate yield benefits. To cover current cropping systems adequately, future studies need to be adapted to Europe-specific arable farming conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acluster analysis 3acropping systems 3aenergy use and consumption 3afarming systems 3aglyphosate 3aglyphosate resistance 3ameta-analysis 3anon-genetically modified foods 3apreharvest treatment 3atoxicology 3awages and remuneration 3aweed control 3aEurope 0aBibliometric analysis 0aReview 0aTillage 0aYield1 aSteinmann, Horst-Henning0 tCrop protection.g2020 Aug., v. 134 p.105148-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2020.1051483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03235naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245013700159300001800296500002000314520178700334592002802121650002902149650002402178650002602202650002002228650000902248650002502257650002202282650001602304650001302320650001802333650001502351650001602366650001602382650001502398650000902413650001402422650001802436650001302454651001202467700001602479700001702495700002502512773012302537856007202660852000902732655001202741IND60584942220221120032448.0171028e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058494222DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.38982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPulster, Erin L.10aSpecies‐specific metabolism of naphthalene and phenanthrene in 3 species of marine teleosts exposed to Deepwater Horizon crude oil  ap. 3168-3176.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe 2 most abundant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) measured in Deepwater Horizon crude oil, naphthalene and phenanthrene, and their associated homologs have both been shown to be acutely toxic in fish. Although fish have a relatively high metabolic capacity for PAHs, hydroxylated PAH (OH‐PAH) derivatives formed during the initial metabolic response can negatively impact the health of fish. Species‐specific metabolism of naphthalene and phenanthrene was evaluated in 3 marine teleosts, red drum (Scianops ocellatus), Florida pompano (Trachinotus carolinus), and southern flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma). Fish were exposed to Deepwater Horizon crude oil by intraperitoneal injections at time 0 and 48 h, with bile sampling events at 24 and 72 h post injection. The data suggested metabolic induction in Florida pompano and red drum, whereas southern flounder may have demonstrated metabolic fatigue. By 24 h post injection, overall profiles of red drum and southern flounder were dominated by hydroxylated phenanthrene metabolites; conversely, the Florida pompano profiles were dominated by monohydroxylated naphthalenes. In addition, Florida pompano had faster overall relative biotransformation rates, suggesting their potential decreased susceptibility to adverse effects. Red drum and southern flounder had much lower relative biotransformation rates, indicating their probable susceptibility to adverse outcomes after naphthalene and phenanthrene exposures. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to investigate monohydroxylated PAHs in fish exposed to Deepwater Horizon oil. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:3168–3176. © 2017 © 2017 The Authors.

The prepared cotton fabrics were then characterized by Four-point Probes Resistivity Measurement, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Vertical Burning Test and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). The results of SEM and FTIR tests indicated that pyrrole was successfully polymerized on the cotton fabrics. The EDS measurements showed that the phosphorus increased with increasing phytic acid concentration. The results of four-point probes resistivity measurement, vertical burning test and TGA test exhibited that both the electrical conductivity and the Limit Oxygen Index (LOI) of the treated fabrics increase with increasing phytic acid concentration. The LOI of the cotton fabric increased from 18% to 37.6% after the cotton fabric was deposited with polypyrrole and doped with phytic acid. The conductivity of the treated cotton fabrics is mainly affected by the pyrrole concentration and can reach about 0.28 S cm−1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aburning 3acotton fabric 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aflame retardants 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aphosphorus 3aphytic acid 3apolymerization 3apyrroles 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermogravimetry 0aConductivity 0aFlame retardancy 0aCotton fabric 0aPolypyrrole 0aPhytic acid1 aShang, Songmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6812-76521 aChiu, Ka-lok1 aJiang, Shouxiang1 aDai, Fangyin0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2019 Sept., v. 167 p.277-282dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2019.06.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04051naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245014600165300001600311520227200327592002802599650002302627650001202650650001602662650001302678650000902691650002102700650002002721650001002741650001402751650002002765650001802785650000902803650001902812650001402831650001902845650001202864650002902876650001702905650001802922650001102940650002202951651002002973653001202993653002303005653001503028653001503043653002703058653001303085653002503098700002303123700002403146700002003170700002303190773013903213856007603352852000903428655001203437IND60594705720221119105646.0180522e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059470572DNAL7 a10.2983/035.037.01162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomson, Nicole L.10aImpact of Vitamin K1 on Tissue Vitamin K Levels, Immunity, and Survival of Greenlip Abalone, Haliotis laevigata, at Summer Water Temperatures  ap. 181-190.  aSummer mortality impacts the productivity of greenlip abalone, Haliotis laevigata, on land-based farms in South Australia. It is associated with high water temperature (greater than 23°C), low dissolved oxygen levels, increased bacterial loads, and immune system suppression during summer months. This study aimed to alleviate mortality rates of greenlip abalone by dietary intervention using vitamin K₁ to support the innate immune system and oxidative status. Dietary vitamin K₁ at 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 mg kg⁻¹ was added to a commercially formulated diet mash. An additional diet containing 0.5 mg kg⁻¹ of K₃ was also used for comparison. Diets were fed to 3-y-old abalone (71.51 g; 79.91 mm) at 22 and 25°C water temperatures for 39 days. No mortalities were observed at 22°C; however, high mortalities were observed in all dietary treatments at the water temperature of 25°C. Compared with the negative control diet (0.0 mg additional inclusion ofK₁ or K₃ kg⁻¹) at 25°C, the inclusion of vitaminK₁ orK₃ did not improve survival of greenlip abalone (P > 0.05). VitaminK₁ inclusion level resulted in significant increases in vitamin K₁ concentration of visceral organ and muscle tissues (P < 0.05). Steady-state levels of vitamin K₁ were not reached. Steady-state levels of K₂-MK-4 in visceral organ and muscle were reached when analyzed levels of dietary vitamin K₁ reached 0.02 mg kg⁻¹. This was also true for K₂-MK-7, but in the visceral organ only. Vitamin K₁ inclusion level did not significantly affect total hemocyte count, phagocytic activity, or phagocytic index (P > 0.05). Increasing water temperature to 25°C resulted in significant increases in serum catalase activity (22 < 25°C) and vitaminK₁ concentration in muscle tissue (22 < 25°C). Comparison of vitamin K₁ or K₃ at 0.5 mg kg⁻¹ resulted in significant changes to serum catalase activity (K₁ > K₃) and vitamin K₁ concentration in visceral organ (K₁ >K₃). In conclusion, vitaminK₁ at the doses tested, resulted in significant increases in vitaminK₁ concentration in visceral organ and muscle tissues, but failed to improve immune function, oxidative status, or survival of greenlip abalone at high summer water temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaliotis laevigata 3aabalone 3ablood serum 3acatalase 3adiet 3adissolved oxygen 3aenzyme activity 3afarms 3ahemocytes 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3amash 3amicrobial load 3amortality 3amuscle tissues 3amuscles 3anutritional intervention 3aphagocytosis 3aphylloquinone 3asummer 3awater temperature 3aSouth Australia 0aabalone 0aHaliotis laevigata 0avitamin K1 0avitamin K3 0ahigh water temperature 0asurvival 0atissue concentration1 aHowarth, Gordon S.1 aCurrie, Krishna-Lee1 aDuong, Duong N.1 aStone, David A.

Shoots were induced from leaf segments cultured on a shoot induction medium containing 2–3 mg L⁻¹thidiazuron, depending on genotype, and 0.5 mg L⁻¹indole-3-butyric acid. Shoot tips (3 mm in length) containing six leaf primordia excised from 11-wk-old adventitious shoots were encapsulated and precultured with 0.5 M sucrose for 5 d, followed by air-drying for 6 h prior to direct immersion in liquid nitrogen. With our protocol, we obtained a mean organogenesis rate of 100%, a mean of 4.5 adventitious shoots per explant (leaf segment), and a mean shoot recovery of 57.0% from cryopreserved shoot tips in four Malus species. Inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) analysis did not reveal any polymorphic bands in regenerants recovered from either leaf segments or cryopreserved shoot tips of ‘Gala’. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on cryopreservation of Malus shoot tips using adventitious shoots derived from leaf segments and is the most widely applicable protocol so far reported for cryopreservation of Malus. Establishment of this protocol provides an alternative means for cryopreservation of Malus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalus 3aadventitious shoots 3aapples 3acryopreservation 3agenotype 3aindole butyric acid 3aleaf primordia 3amicrosatellite repeats 3anitrogen 3asucrose 3athidiazuron1 aFeng, Chao-Hong1 aHu, Ling-Yun1 aWang, Min-Rui1 aChen, Long1 aWang, Qiao-Chun0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2014 June, v. 50, no. 3 p.357-368dSpringer-Verlagx1054-54767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11627-014-9616-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04501naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024003800135040001800173100001500191245013300206506007600339506003100415520220700446592002802653596004502681596006302726506003702789650001902826650001702845650001802862650002102880650001902901650002502920650002602945650001702971650001602988650002103004650001503025650002003040650001603060650001303076650001503089650001603104650001003120650001103130650002603141650001303167650002103180650001503201650001703216650002003233650001703253650001503270650002703285650002303312650001003335651001403345653001603359653001803375653002703393653002903420653001403449700001703463700001803480700001803498700001803516700001603534773009903550856008503649852000903734655001203743IND60686877720221207092608.0200503e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068687772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2020.1051502chorus7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2020.1051502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStaver, C.10aLong-term response of groundcover components to organic and conventional weed control in shaded and open-sun coffee in Nicaragua  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe weed-free period is employed to evaluate the effectiveness of practices to reduce crop loss to weeds. To orient sustainable cropping system approaches in perennial crops such as coffee which are often grown with trees, orchard floor or groundcover management has been proposed to address not only crop loss, but also soil protection, plant nutrition, habitat for beneficial organisms and labor and input costs. The results of a long-term experiment in Masatepe, Nicaragua, comparing two intensities of organic and conventional coffee management under four combinations of deciduous and evergreen trees either leguminous (Inga laurina and Samanea saman) and non-leguminous (Simarouba glauca and Tabebuia rosea) and full sun concluded that with selective weed management under trees, soil is protected with both low-growing, shallow-rooted cover vegetation and tree leaf litter without yield loss, while also reducing herbicide and labor use. Over 11 years, treatments with trees compared to full sun coffee showed near absence of bare soil (P < .001) and increasing presence of leaf litter (P < .001) and cover vegetation (P < .001), especially in the first 8 years. Selective control, either herbicide or manual, resulted in minimal bare soil, a declining area covered by weeds and increased area, from 40 to 70%, under cover vegetation. Selective control with herbicides had less weedy vegetation than manual selective control. Trees compared to full sun showed increased accumulation of whole leaf and fractionated leaf layers measured in the dry season with treatments including Inga laurina greater than other tree treatments. Labor and herbicide costs declined with increasing time under trees (P < .001), while selective control reduced herbicide use with higher labor costs. A regression of groundcover components on coffee berry yields explained less than 10% of variability. Two research priorities are identified to increase the contribution of groundcover components to sustainable coffee systems – 1) cover vegetation species and management in water conservation and use and 2) the role of tree species and their litter on water, soil biology dynamics and O horizon formation.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUniversity of Marylanddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000085100 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCoffea arabica 3aInga laurina 3aSamanea saman 3aSimarouba glauca 3aTabebuia rosea 3abeneficial organisms 3achemical weed control 3acoffee beans 3acrop losses 3acropping systems 3adry season 3aevergreen trees 3afruit yield 3ahabitats 3aherbicides 3ainput costs 3alabor 3aleaves 3along term experiments 3aorchards 3aorganic horizons 3aperennials 3aplant litter 3aplant nutrition 3asoil biology 3avegetation 3awages and remuneration 3awater conservation 3aweeds 3aNicaragua 0aLeaf litter 0aHerbicide use 0aSelective weed control 0aOrchard floor management 0aO horizon1 aJuventia, S.1 aNavarrete, E.1 aNavarrete, L.1 aSepulveda, N.1 aBarrios, M.0 tCrop protection.g2020 July, v. 133 p.105150-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2020.1051503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01858naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245013000165300001800295520064800313592002800961650001500989650003601004650002101040650001301061650002201074650001201096700001501108700005201123700005301175700001701228700005101245773012001296856008301416852000901499655001201508IND60646413120221118000806.0190610e20190524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064641312DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b013332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Guoxun10aChemodivergent Couplings of N-Arylureas and Methyleneoxetanones via Rh(III)-Catalyzed and Solvent-Controlled C–H Activation  ap. 4143-4147.  aThe efficient couplings of diverse N-arylureas and methyleneoxetanones have been realized via Rh(III)-catalyzed and solvent-controlled chemoselective C–H functionalization, which involved the tunable β-H elimination and β-O elimination processes, thereby giving divergent access to quinolin-2(1H)-ones and ortho-allylated N-arylureas with broad substrate compatibility and good functional group tolerance. the divergent synthetic utilities of the transformations have also been exemplified by subsequently tandem C–H allylation, unsymmetrical C–H functionalization, alternative reaction mode, as well as removal of the carbamoyl group.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallylation 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3achemoselectivity 3amoieties 3aorganic compounds 3arhodium1 aShi, Wendi1 aGao, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8736-44851 aZhou, Zhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6521-89461 aSong, Huacan1 aYi, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7936-93260 tOrganic letters.g2019 May 24, v. 21, no. 11 p.4143-4147dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19216x1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.9b013333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03316naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100001700181245009600198300001600294500002400310500001500334520165500349650002302004650002402027650002302051650002902074650002102103650002302124650002102147650000902168650001802177650001502195650002502210650001802235651001902253653004602272653001202318653001602330700002002346700002002366700001602386700001402402700001802416700001902434773012202453852000902575856008502584930003302669945002502702946001102727655001202738IND4385902920221119163232.0061210e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438590292DNAL7 a10.1007/s10705-006-9026-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aJ100 0aW000 0aB2001 aHyde, B.

Nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions from agricultural soils account for 38% of this total. A 2-year study was conducted, using the chamber technique on a fertilized and grazed grassland to quantify the effect of fertilizer application rate, soil and meteorological variables on N₂O emissions. Three N fertilizer regimes (0, 225 & 390 kg N ha-¹) were imposed with three replicates of each treatment. Nitrogen fertilizer was applied as urea (46% N) in spring with calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN-26% N) applied in the summer (June-September). Rotational grazing was practiced using steers. Nitrous oxide emissions arising from the unfertilized plots (0 N) were consistently low. Emissions from the N-fertilized plots (225 & 390 kg N ha-¹) were concentrated in relatively short periods (1-2 weeks) following fertilizer applications and grazing, with marked differences between treatments, relative patterns and magnitudes of emissions at different times of the year and between years. Variation in N₂O emissions throughout both years was pronounced with mean coefficients of variation of 116% in year 1 and 101% in year 2. The study encompassed two climatologically contrasting years. As a result the N₂O-N loss, as a percent of the N applied in the cooler and wetter 2002 (0.2-2.0%), were similar to those used for N-fertilized grasslands under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) N₂O emission inventory calculation methodology (1.25% ± 1). In contrast, the percentage losses in the warmer and drier 2003 (3.5-7.2%) were substantially higher. 3atemporal variation 3amathematical models 3aagricultural soils 3acalcium ammonium nitrate 3afertilizer rates 3arotational grazing 3aclimatic factors 3aurea 3agas emissions 3agrasslands 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrous oxide 3aIrish Republic 0aIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 0agrazing 0afertilizers1 aHawkins, M.

Gridded historical time series of monthly temperature and precipitation were used to characterise the meteorologic conditions at the sampling sites. Climate parameters were tested against height growth in period 1950-2000, and needle N content was tested against height growth for the periods where N measurements were available by means of graphical comparison, as well as simple and multiple regression analyses with the aim to get evidence for causes of possible growth acceleration. Trends of referenced height increment of six out of nine Scots pine stands in Germany were positive during the observation period, and improved N nutrition appeared to be the most important driving factor for this growth acceleration. The variation of precipitation--exhibiting no consistent and uniform long-term temporal trend during the observation period--in contrast seems to be mainly responsible for the interannual fluctuation of height growth. We were not able to detect any general statistical influence of temperature parameters on height growth, although they generally increased. The referenced height growth of three Finnish pine stands slightly decreased during the observation period and there was no indication of a significant improvement of their N supply. Among four Norway spruce stands investigated in Germany and Austria, referenced height increment also increased in three cases; there was again some evidence that improved N nutrition was the stimulating factor. At three study sites in Finland, however, referenced height growth of this species decreased at least from 1985 onwards, whereas mostly no significant trends in N nutrition or precipitation were identified. These differences observed between species and regions are discussed in detail. 3aPicea abies 3aPinus sylvestris 3aair temperature 3aatmospheric precipitation 3agrowth factors 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrient availability 3anutrition 3aregression analysis 3atime series analysis 3aAustria 3aCentral European region 3aFinland 3aGermany1 aPrietzel, Jörg1 aStraussberger, Ralf1 aRehfuess, Karl Eugen1 aKahle, Hans-Peter.1 aPérez, Pedro.1 aSpiecker, Heinrich0 tEuropean journal of forest research.g2008 Oct., v. 127, no. 6 p.507-524dSpringer-Verlagx1612-46697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10342-008-0233-7 7aarticle02037naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245006700165300001600232520103100248653001601279653002801295653004201323653003501365700002601400700001801426700002401444773011601468852000901584856008601593930003301679946001101712655001201723IND4391050820221119163244.0070506e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439105082DNAL7 a10.1007/s00254-006-0512-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanar, Müfide.10aChoosing a municipal landfill site by analytic network process  ap. 747-751.  aIn this study, analytic network process (ANP), one of the multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) tools has been used to choose one of the four alternative landfill sites for the city of Eskisehir, Turkey. For this purpose, Super Decision Software has been used and benefit opportunity cost and risk (BOCR) analysis has been done to apply ANP. In BOCR analysis, each alternative site has been evaluated in terms of its benefits, costs and risks; the opportunity cluster has been examined under the benefit cluster. In this context, technical, economical and social assessments have been done for the site selection of sanitary landfill. Also, results have been compared with analytic hierarchy process (AHP) which is another MCDM technique used in the study conducted before. Finally, the current site has been determined as the most appropriate site in both methods. These methods have not been commonly used in the discipline of environmental engineering but it is believed to be an important contribution for decision makers. 0aSolid waste 0aLandfill site selection 0aMulti-criteria decision making (MCDM) 0aAnalytic network process (ANP)1 aKose, Barbaros Murat 1 aOzkan, Aysun 1 aPoyraz Acar, Ilgin 0 tEnvironmental geology.g2007 Apr., v. 52, no. 4 p.747-751dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0943-01057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-006-0512-x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02395naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002200110040001800132100001600150245008600166300001400252500001500266520129000281650002101571650002001592650004401612650003701656650002701693650002401720651001801744651001801762653003001780653001401810653001801824653001301842653001301855773007401868852000901942939003301951946001301984655001201997IND9003820620221119163118.0900809e198501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900382062DNAL7 a39183232pmid7 aPMC14247132pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHammond, J.10aAnalysis of county-level data concerning the use of medicare home health benefits  ap. 48-55.  a2019-12-06  aA multiple regression analysis was undertaken of variables identified in the literature as underlying the relationship between community characteristics and the availability and use of home health services. The literature on social science and health care administration was reviewed to identify the variables that theoretically underlie different rates of home health care use among communities. County statistics then were used to quantify many of those variables that, when considered in combination, should explain much of the use of home health services. Three categories of variables--general community characteristics, health sector characteristics, and service availability--contribute roughly equal amounts to the total explained variance of 25 percent. Viewed from the opposite perspective, 75 percent of the use of Medicare home health benefits remains unexplained despite the purported strong association between the variables employed in this analysis and the use of home health services. These findings abase the long-held belief that substitution of inpatient services for home care is commonplace, and they suggest the potential effectiveness of community-level strategies to promote the use of home health services, particularly efforts to increase their availability. 3anational surveys 3ahealth services 2aCommunity Health Servicesxutilization. 2aHome Care Servicesxutilization. 2aMedicarexutilization. 2aStatistics as Topic 3aUnited States 0aUnited States 0acommunity health services 0ahome care 0aparticipation 0acounties 0amedicare0 tPublic health reports.g1985 , v. 100, no. 1 p.48-55x0033-35397nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02510naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245008300164300001800247520150900265650001901774653002001793653002301813653002201836700001801858700001701876700001801893700001701911773011801928852000902046856008502055930003302140946001102173655001202184IND4399901620221119162725.0080113e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439990162DNAL7 a10.1007/s00254-007-0755-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChangchun, Xu 10aPotential impact of climate change on snow cover area in the Tarim River basin  ap. 1465-1474.  aTwo data sets, annual temperature and precipitation time series from 19 observation stations in the Tarim River basin covering 1958 through 2002, were investigated by non-parametric tests to detect the trend and features of climate change and variability. Based on these data, the snow cover area (SCA) in situ for the period 1982-2001 was further analyzed to examine the effect of climate change on snow. The results showed that both the temperature and precipitation had a jump in the mid 1980s and significantly increased in winter and summer, respectively. The SCA of the entire basin showed a slowly increasing trend. Responses of the SCA to temperature and precipitation in the northern, western and southern regions showed that the effect of precipitation on SCA is larger than that of temperature. In vertical direction, the SCA in the zone below 2,500 m a.s.l. kept a slow increase, but that in the zone above 2,500 m a.s.l. was inching down. Comparatively, the lower altitude zone was apt to be affected by precipitation, while the higher altitude zone tended to be influenced by temperature. The mid zone from 2,500 to 5,000 m was the area most sensitive to and affected by climate change. Compared with that in the 1980s, both the snowing and melting rates were higher in the 1990s. Correlation analysis implied that the SCA change in the cold season was positively correlated with the contemporary precipitation change, but had no strong correlation with the contemporary temperature change. 3aclimate change 0aSnow cover area 0aNonparametric test 0aTarim River basin1 aYaning, Chen 1 aWeihong, Li 1 aYapeng, Chen 1 aHongtao, Ge 0 tEnvironmental geology.g2008 Feb., v. 53, no. 7 p.1465-1474dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0943-01057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-007-0755-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20080113b20080202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02416naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245011900165300001800284520141100302650001201713650001501725653001801740653001701758653001301775653001601788653001001804700001901814773011801833852000901951856008601960930003302046946001102079655001202090IND4391536920221119162821.0070522e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439153692DNAL7 a10.1007/s00254-006-0558-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Ch'an-hŭi.10aWeathering damage evaluation of rock properties in the Bunhwangsa temple stone pagoda, Gyeongju, Republic of Korea  ap. 1193-1205.  aThe stone pagoda of the Bunhwangsa temple in Republic of Korea was made of piling small brick-shaped stones. The majority of stone bricks are andesitic rocks with variable geneses. Rock properties of the pagoda roof suffer partial significant deterioration, such as multiple peel-offs, exfoliation, onion-peel-like decomposition, cracks forming round lines and falling-off stone pieces. The stylobates and tabernacles at the four corners are composed of granitic rocks, which are heavily contaminated by lichens and mosses. Some of these contamination marks show dark black or yellowish brown colors by inorganic secondary hydrates. The four tabernacles and northern face of the pagoda body have been exposed to relatively high humidity, which causes light gray efflorescence as stalactites between the northern and western sides of the body. The efflorescences are composed of calcite, gypsum and clay minerals. The stone lion statues at the southeast and northeast corners are made of alkali granite, while the others are lithic tuff. Total rock properties of the pagoda consist of 9,708 stone bricks. Among them, 11.0% are fractured, 6.7% are fallen off, and 7.0% show considerable surface efflorescence, which shows that the pagoda has been highly deteriorated by physical, chemical and biological weathering. The authors strongly suggest long-term monitoring and comprehensive conservation researches. 3agranite 3aweathering 0acontamination 0aStone pagoda 0aAndesite 0aLithic tuff 0aKorea1 aYi, Jeong Eun 0 tEnvironmental geology.g2007 June, v. 52, no. 6 p.1193-1205dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0943-01057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-006-0558-93Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070522b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02568naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072001700166072001700183100001700200245009200217300001600309520135400325650001001679650001601689650001801705650002001723650001801743650002101761650001901782653001301801653003601814700001401850700001401864700001601878700001401894700002001908773007201928852000902000856008702009945002502096946001302121655001202134IND4362120420221119162729.0040416e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436212042DNAL7 a189438272pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO.2004.94.1.1112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This study was initiated to examine ultrastructural virus-virus interactions of mixed viral infections. Mixed infections were induced using potyviruses and viruses from other plant virus families. Novel ultrastructural paracrystalline arrays composed of co-infecting viruses, referred to as mixed virus particle aggregates (MVPAs), were noted in the majority of the mixed infections studied. When the flexuous rod-shaped potyvirus particles involved in MVPAs were sectioned transversely, specific geometrical patterns were noted within some doubly infected cells. Although similar geometrical patterns were associated with MVPAs of various virus combinations, unique characteristics within patterns were consistent in each mixed infection virus pair. Centrally located virus particles within some MVPAs appeared swollen (Southern bean mosaic virus mixed with Blackeye cowpea mosaic virus, Cucumber mosaic virus mixed with Blackeye cowpea mosaic virus, and Sunn hemp mosaic virus mixed with Soybean mosaic virus). This ultrastructural study complements molecular studies of mixed infections of plant viruses by adding the additional dimension of visualizing the interactions between the co-infecting viruses. 3acrops 3aPotyviridae 3aplant viruses 3amixed infection 3apathogenicity 3ainclusion bodies 3aultrastructure 0asymptoms 0amixed virus particle aggregates1 aCho, J.D.1 aKim, J.S.1 aGoeke, S.C.1 aKim, K.S.1 aGergerich, R.C.0 tPhytopathology.g2004 Jan., v. 94, no. 1 p.111-119x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO.2004.94.1.1113Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdMKSe2004/04/29  aOther US 7aarticle02480naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008200127300001600209500001500225520135800240650001601598650001801614650001701632650001001649650001601659650001101675650002601686650000901712650002201721650002101743650002001764653002601784653003101810653002001841700002001861700002201881700001801903773008401921852000902005939003302014946001102047655001202058IND9204174720221119162813.0920701e19920315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920417472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGitlin, J.D.10aMechanisms of caeruloplasmin biosynthesis in normal and copper-deficient rats  ap. 835-839.  a2019-12-04  aTo examine the mechanisms of holo-caeruloplasmin biosynthesis, we measured the serum caeruloplasmin concentration and oxidase activity, hepatic caeruloplasmin mRNA content and hepatocyte caeruloplasmin biosynthesis and secretion in normal and copper-deficient rats. Copper deficiency resulted in a near-complete loss of serum caeruloplasmin oxidase activity, yet only a 60% reduction in serum caeruloplasmin concentration and no change in the abundance of hepatic caeruloplasmin mRNA or the rate of caeruloplasmin biosynthesis. Both interleukin-1 alpha and lipopolysaccharide increased hepatic caeruloplasmin mRNA content and caeruloplasmin biosynthesis in normal and copper-deficient animals, but neither mediator increased caeruloplasmin oxidase activity in the copper-deficient group. Pulse-chase studies in primary hepatocytes from normal and copper-deficient rats revealed that the secretory rates for newly synthesized caeruloplasmin were identical, despite little or no holo-caeruloplasmin synthesis in hepatocytes of copper-deficient rats. We conclude that hepatocyte copper content has no effect on hepatic caeruloplasmin-gene expression or caeruloplasmin biosynthesis and that the incorporation of copper into newly synthesized caeruloplasmin is not a rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis or secretion of the apoprotein from rat hepatocytes. 3ahepatocytes 3amessenger RNA 3abiosynthesis 3aliver 3aferroxidase 3acopper 3anutrient deficiencies 3arats 3aprotein secretion 3adietary minerals 3aenzyme activity 0aceruloplasmin oxidase 0atrace element deficiencies 0aoxidoreductases1 aSchroeder, J.J.1 aLee-Ambrose, L.M.1 aCousins, R.J.0 tBiochemical journal.g1992 Mar. 15, v. 282, no. pt.3 p.835-839x0264-60217nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02425naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245016200161300001400323500002400337520112500361650002101486650002701507650001101534650001501545650001401560650001601574650000901590650001001599650002801609650001401637650001001651650001101661650001101672653002401683653004401707653001401751653001301765653003701778700001401815773009301829852000901922856004801931655001201979IND4449154720221119162519.0110211e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444915472DNAL7 a10.1007/s10452-010-9324-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Nichun12aA study on the effects of food quantity and quality on glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity and growth rate parameters of Daphnia carinata varying in age  ap. 63-73.  aIncludes references  aThe adverse influences of insufficient food and toxins on Daphnia carinata's body growth, reproduction and tolerance were investigated in the laboratory. Different concentrations of Scendesmus obliquus and a mixture of S. obliquus and microcystin (MC)-containing Microcystis aeruginosa PCC7820 were used to feed D. carinata. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity towards five chemical compounds (substrates) was measured and used as an indicator of their tolerance. Body growth rate and clutch size of D. carinata decreased with declined concentration or decreased proportion of S. obliquus in the diet. GST activity decreased with ageing in D. carinata. However, GST activity to several chemical compounds increased when food quantity or food quality decreased. Adult D. carinata had a lower GST activity towards p-nitrophenenzyl chloride (PNBC) than juveniles and exhibited a sharp decline (P < 0.001) in GST activity towards PNBC as the animals aged. It is suggested that the age-specific decrease in GST activity is a possible mechanism for the high morality of adult D. carinata in the summer of eutrophic lakes. 3aDaphnia carinata 3aMicrocystis aeruginosa 3aadults 3aanimal age 3achlorides 3aclutch size 3adiet 3afoods 3aglutathione transferase 3ajuveniles 3alakes 3asummer 3atoxins 0aScendesmus obliquus 0aMicrocystin (MC)-containing Microcystis 0aTolerance 0aMorality 0ap-Nitrophenenzyl chloride (PNBC)1 aXie, Ping0 tAquatic ecology.g2011 Mar., v. 45, no. 1 p.63-73dSpringer Netherlandsx1386-25887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-010-9324-x 7aarticle01710naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002900145245006100174300001600235500002400251520069900275650001600974650001100990650001101001650001101012650002301023650001201046650002001058650001001078650003601088700002101124700002001145700002201165773010401187852000901291856004801300655001201348IND4457345420221119162440.0110429e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445734542DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-010-0323-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandes, Fabiano A.

The term exotic includes a number of tropical fruits that are not yet commonly found in global markets but do have the potential to do so in view of their appearance, taste, and textural and nutritional quality parameters. As the consumer is seeking diverse tastes and flavors without compromising on quality, it is logical to expect the market for dried exotic fruits to increase over the next decade. This review covers diverse drying techniques, drying kinetics, and key quality parameters of dried fruits. 3adried fruit 3adrying 3aflavor 3afruits 3aintroduced species 3amarkets 3anutritive value 3ataste 3atropical and subtropical fruits1 aRodrigues, Sueli1 aLaw, Chung-Lim.1 aMujumdar, Arun S.0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2011 Feb., v. 4, no. 2 p.163-185dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-010-0323-7 7aarticle03161naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245016600125300001600291500001500307520188400322650001002206650003902216650001202255650002102267650002502288650001702313650001502330650001602345650001702361650003402378650001202412650001302424650002502437650000902462653001202471700001402483700001302497700001102510700002302521700002202544773008402566852000902650939003302659946001102692655001202703IND9204174520221119162456.0920701e19920315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920417452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, O.J.10aMechanisms of fructose-induced hypertriglyceridaemia in the rat.

The effects of purified diets containing 70% glucose or 70% fructose on the activation state of hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHa), activity of mitochondrial PDH kinase, plasma triacylglycerols (TG) and hepatic lipogenesis de novo in rats were measured. 2. Plasma TG were significantly increased in the fructose-fed compared with the glucose-fed group (125 +/- 45 mg/dl versus 57 +/- 19 mg/dl; P < 0.002) after 3-5 weeks on the diet despite less daily food intake. 3. Hepatic PDHa in fructose-fed rats was 144% of the value in glucose-fed rats (15.4 +/- 1.2% versus 10.7 +/- 0.5%; P < 0.002), whereas cardiac muscle PDHa was not different (45.5 +/- 6.6% versus 41.0 +/- 7.8%). 4. Intrinsic hepatic PDH kinase activity was decreased to 34% of glucose-fed values by fructose feeding (-k = 3.56 +/- 0.39 versus 10.41 +/- 1.85 per min; P < 0.005). 5. The fractional contribution to very-low-density-lipoprotein palmitate from hepatic lipogenesis de novo, measured by a stable-isotope mass-spectrometric method, was 10.49 +/- 2.42% (n = 8) in fructose-fed rats versus 5.55 +/- 1.38% (n = 9) in glucose-fed rats (P < 0.05), and 2.66 +/- 2.39% (n = 3) in chow-fed rats (P < 0.05 versus fructose-fed group). The absolute contribution to circulating TG from lipogenesis de novo was also significantly higher in the fructose-fed than in the glucose-fed group (14.9 +/- 5.1 mg/dl versus 2.9 +/- 0.6 mg/dl; P < 0.05) 6. Portal insulin concentrations were significantly higher in the fructose-fed rats (206 +/- 49 micro-units/ml versus 81 +/- 15 micro-units/ml; P < 0.05). 7. In conclusion, dietary fructose appears to have a specific activating effect on hepatic PDH, mediated at least in part by inhibition of PDH kinase. These results are consistent with increased flux through hepatic PDH and synthesis of new fat, not just increased re-esterification of non-esterified fatty acids. 3aliver 3apyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide) 3aglucose 3atriacylglycerols 3adietary carbohydrate 3ablood plasma 3amyocardium 3alipogenesis 3amitochondria 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3ainsulin 3afructose 3ahypertriglyceridemia 3arats 0akinases1 aCesar, D.1 aFaix, D.1 aWu, K.1 aShackleton, C.H.L.1 aHellerstein, M.K.0 tBiochemical journal.g1992 Mar. 15, v. 282, no. pt.3 p.753-757x0264-60217nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04024naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072001700166072001700183100001500200245006600215300001600281500001500297520207500312650003002387650001002417650002702427650001602454650001402470650002302484650001702507650002302524650001202547650002002559650002002579650001802599650002002617650003302637650001302670650004502683650002202728650001502750650001602765650001102781650001602792650001802808650001102826650000902837650001602846650002702862650002502889653002502914653002802939653002502967653002602992700001903018700001903037700001603056700001703072700001903089773007203108852000903180856008703189945002503276946001303301655001203314IND4362110920221119162408.0040415e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436211092DNAL7 a189435422pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO.2004.94.2.1842doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGent, D.H.10aPolyphasic characterization of Xanthomonas strains from onion  ap. 184-195.  a2019-12-04  aXanthomonas leaf blight has become an increasingly important disease of onion, but the diversity among Xanthomonas strains isolated from onion is unknown, as is their relationship to other species and pathovars of Xanthomonas. Forty-nine Xanthomonas strains isolated from onion over 27 years from 10 diverse geographic regions were characterized by pathogenicity to onion and dry bean, fatty acid profiles, substrate utilization patterns (Biolog), bactericide resistance, repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction fingerprinting, rDNA internally transcribed spacer (ITS) region, and hrp b6 gene sequencing. Multiplication of onion Xanthomonas strain R-O177 was not different from X. axonopodis pv. phaseoli in dry bean, but typical common bacterial blight disease symptoms were absent in dry bean. Populations from each geographical region were uniformly sensitive to 100 microgram of CuSO(4), 100 microgram of ZnSO(4), and 100 microgram of streptomycin sulfate per ml. Biolog substrate utilization and fatty acid profiles revealed close phenoltypic relatedness between onion strains of Xanthomonas and X. axonopodis pv. dieffenbachiae (57% of strains) and X. arboricola pv. poinsettiicola (37% of strains), respectively. A logistic regression model based on fatty acid composition and substrate utilization classified 69% of strains into their geographical region of origin. Sequencing of a portion of the hrp B6 gene from 24 strains and ITS region from 25 strains revealed greater than 97% sequence similarity among strains. DNA fingerprinting revealed five genotype groups within onion strains of Xanthomonas and a high degree of genetic diversity among geographical regions of origin. Based on pathogenicity to onion, carbon substrate utilization, fatty acid profiles, rDNA genetic diversity, and genomic fingerprints, we conclude that the strains examined in this study are pathovar X. axonopodis pv. allii. Implications of genetic and phenotypic diversity within X. axonopodis pv. allii are discussed in relation to an integrated pest management program. 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3abeans 3afatty acid composition 3aleaf blight 3aphylogeny 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3astreptomycin 3aDNA fingerprinting 3apeppers 3adrug resistance 3aCapsicum annuum 3aribosomal DNA 3avegetable crops 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3agenotype 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asequence analysis 3ahost range 3aXanthomonas 3acopper 3ahost plants 3apathogenicity 3aonions 3azinc 3aAllium cepa 3ageographical variation 3arepetitive sequences 0aantimicrobial agents 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0aanti-infective agents1 aSchwartz, H.F.1 aIshimaru, C.A.1 aLouws, F.J.1 aCramer, R.A.1 aLawrence, C.B.0 tPhytopathology.g2004 Feb., v. 94, no. 2 p.184-195x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO.2004.94.2.1843Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdRSCe2004/04/16  aOther US 7aarticle02793naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245011600193300001800309500002400327520125700351650002001608650001801628650001301646650002501659650001801684650002001702650002201722650002501744650002401769650001401793650001001807650002301817650004201840650001201882650002701894650003201921650004001953650002101993651001802014651001102032651001802043700002802061700002202089773011202111852000902223856005502232655001202287IND4394797920221119162511.0070906e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439479792DNAL7 a178037822pmid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01376.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRabouille, Sophie10aModelling the vertical distribution of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus in the North Pacific Subtropical Ocean  ap. 2588-2602.  aIncludes references  aA simple model was developed to examine the vertical distribution of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus ecotypes in the water column, based on their adaptation to light intensity. Model simulations were compared with a 14-year time series of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus cell abundances at Station ALOHA in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Data were analysed to examine spatial and temporal patterns in abundances and their ranges of variability in the euphotic zone, the surface mixed layer and the layer in the euphotic zone but below the base of the mixed layer. Model simulations show that the apparent occupation of the whole euphotic zone by a genus can be the result of a co-occurrence of different ecotypes that segregate vertically. The segregation of ecotypes can result simply from differences in light response. A sensitivity analysis of the model, performed on the parameter α (initial slope of the light-response curve) and the DIN concentration in the upper water column, demonstrates that the model successfully reproduces the observed range of vertical distributions. Results support the idea that intermittent mixing events may have important ecological and geochemical impacts on the phytoplankton community at Station ALOHA. 3aProchlorococcus 3aSynechococcus 3aecotypes 3aenvironmental impact 3aeuphotic zone 3alight intensity 3asimulation models 3atime series analysis 2aCell Countxmethods 2aEcosystem 2aLight 2aModels, Biological 2aProchlorococcusxgrowth & development 2aSeasons 2aSeawaterxmicrobiology 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSynechococcusxgrowth & development 2aTropical Climate 3aPacific Ocean 0aHawaii 0aPacific Ocean1 aEdwards, Christopher A.1 aZehr, Jonathan P.0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2007 Oct., v. 9, no. 10 p.2588-2602dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01376.x 7aarticle02070naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002900145245012900174300001600303520096800319650001701287651001001304653001501314653002301329653001501352653001701367700002101384700002001405700001401425700002701439773011601466852000901582856008501591930003301676946001101709655001201720IND4397149220221119162416.0071028e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439714922DNAL7 a10.1007/s00254-007-0664-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Quiñones, V. 10aApplication of the FAO quantitative and SINDI methods to assess the quality of different soils in Castilla-La Mancha (Spain)  ap. 527-531.  aIn the region of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain), over half of the soils are under cropping. This vast agricultural activity, combined with other anthropological uses, has led to a deterioration of the soil quality and virtual degradation. Therefore, it was deemed to assess the quality of these soils, which was achieved by applying two different methods. Three soils, representative of typical conditions in this community, were sampled and diverse properties were analysed in order to apply two different approaches. The first soil evaluation was carried out by a traditional method developed by FAO using a productivity index, whereas the second method consisted of the application of a new method called SINDI, developed in New Zealand. Both approaches make an evaluation based on a number of indicators that differs in each case. These differences explain why each method ranked the soils studied in different order reaching diverse conclusions on their quality. 3asoil quality 3aSpain 0aIndicators 0aCastilla-La Mancha 0aFAO method 0aSINDI method1 ade la Torre, A. 1 aGarcía, M.

We summarized information from 1008 N₂O and 189 NO emission measurements for agricultural fields, and 207 N₂O and 210 NO measurements for soils under natural vegetation. The factors that significantly influence agricultural N₂O emissions were N application rate, crop type, fertilizer type, soil organic C content, soil pH and texture, and those for NO emissions include N application rate, soil N content and climate. Compared to an earlier analysis the 20% increase in the number of N₂O measurements for agriculture did not yield more insight or reduced uncertainty, because the representation of environmental and management conditions in agro-ecosystems did not improve, while for NO emissions the additional measurements in agricultural systems did yield a considerable improvement. N₂O emissions from soils under natural vegetation are significantly influenced by vegetation type, soil organic C content, soil pH, bulk density and drainage, while vegetation type and soil C content are major factors for NO emissions. Statistical models of these factors were used to calculate global annual emissions from fertilized cropland (3.3 Tg N₂O-N and 1.4 Tg NO-N) and grassland (0.8 Tg N₂O-N and 0.4 Tg NO-N). Global emissions were not calculated for soils under natural vegetation due to lack of data for many vegetation types. 3agreenhouse gases 3aagricultural soils 3agas emissions 3asimulation models 3anitric oxide 3afields 3asoil organic carbon 3afertilizer rates 3asoil pH 3ameta-analysis 3acrops 3adata analysis 3asoil texture 3anatural regeneration 3aclimatic factors 3avegetation 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrous oxide 0amathematical models1 aBouwman, A.

The survey identified 224 State health department epidemiologists (estimated U.S. ratio 1.1 per million population). A State health department epidemiologist was most often male (80 percent), frequently (57 percent) was a physician, had an average age of 41 years, and had worked as an epidemiologist for 9 years. Participation in public health programs (either by supervising or providing consultation) by the State Epidemiologists and their staffs focused mainly on general epidemiology and communicable disease programs; fewer than half had participated in programs relating to the health of women and children, chronic diseases, injuries, or in other programs directed towards preventing premature mortality. Recently, the State Epidemiologists have been trying to broaden their activities into these areas; however, the demands created by the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) will mostly likely slow this process. Based on the overall findings and collective experience, it was concluded that State health departments have too few epidemiologists to address the wide variety of important public health problems facing our communities. It was proposed that each State health department have at least four epidemiologists (including one or more physician epidemiologists) and at least one master's level biostatistician and that the epidemiologists-per-population ratio not be less than 1 per million. 3astate government 3aepidemiology 3apublic health 3aprogram evaluation 3anational surveys 2aAdult 2aCommunicable Disease Control 2aData Collection 2aEpidemiologyxeducationxmanpower. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPublic Health 2aState Health Plansxeconomicsxorganization & administration. 3aUnited States 0aUnited States 0ahealth programs1 aWhite, M.C.1 aMiller, G.B.

This method requires a minimum of 12 to 24 weeks in greenhouse testing to up to 2 years in field testing. In this paper, the development of a single tube AmpliDet RNA system for the rapid gel-free detection of ASPV in apple tree tissues is described. The system relies on the specific amplification of the viral RNA by nucleic acid sequence-based amplification and the simultaneous fluorescent detection of the amplification product through molecular beacons. A sensitivity of a minimum of 100 molecules of transcript RNA was obtained by the ASPV-specific AmpliDet RNA. All biologically characterized ASPV isolates from a field trial and 12 of 14 isolates from a plant virus collection were readily detected with this AmpliDet RNA system. In addition, the efficiency of this method for detecting ASPV in 'Golden Delicious' and 'Gravenstein' apple trees was compared throughout the year with mechanical inoculation onto Nicotiana occidentalis 37B, a candidate indicator for ASPV. This revealed that only AmpliDet RNA consistently detected the virus in bark tissue, irrespective of the season. Season-specific tissues such as buds, petals, and fruits, but not leaves, also were reliable sources for detection of ASPV by the AmpliDet RNA system. 3adiagnostic techniques 3amessenger RNA 3aApple stem pitting virus 3acertification 3afluorescence 3anucleotide sequences 3aMalus domestica 3adetection 3adisease diagnosis 0amolecular sequence data 0aRNA1 aLeone, G.1 aLindner, J.L.1 aSchoen, C.D.1 aHeuvel, J.F.J.M. van den.0 tPhytopathology.g2001 Nov., v. 91, no. 11 p.1085-1091wJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO.2001.91.11.10853Available from publisher's Web site  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03177naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100001600168245012600184300001800310500001500328520171200343650002002055650001702075650003102092650002502123650002002148650002202168650001502190650002402205650004002229650004302269653001102312653002402323653003002347653002102377700001702398700001702415700001702432700001402449773007502463852000902538856008902547930003302636945001302669946001302682655001202695IND2327428520221119162809.0020606e200112  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232742852DNAL7 a189433292pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO.2001.91.12.11492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhnishi, J.10aReplication of tomato spotted wilt virus after ingestion by adult Thrips setosus is restricted to midgut epithelial cells  ap. 1149-1155.  a2019-12-04  aIf acquisition access feeding (AAF) is first given after adult eclosion, none of the nine thrips species able to serve as tospovirus vectors can become infective. The previous cellular investigations of this phenomenon, carried out only in Frankliniella occidentalis, suggested that infectivity was prevented because the type member of the tospoviruses, Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), was unable to enter the midgut of adult thrips. The present study extends a cellular view of tospovirus-thrips interactions to a species other than the western flower thrips, F. occidentalis. Our findings show that TSWV enters and replicates within the midgut of adult Thrips setosus, but does not infect cells beyond the midgut epithelia. After AAF as adult, TSWV replicated in T. setosus midgut cells as indicated by significant increases in nucleocapsid (N) protein detected by double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the presence of inclusions containing the S RNA-encoded nonstructural and N proteins revealed by microscopic observations. Electron microscopic observations of adult insects showed that no infection occurred in cells beyond the midgut epithelia, and insects subsampled from the same cohorts could not transmit TSWV. In contrast, electron microscopy observations of larval T. setosus revealed that TSWV infected the midgut and muscle cells, and adult insects developing from these cohorts had infected salivary glands and were able to transmit TSWV. Mature virions were observed only in the salivary glands of adults developing from infected larvae. Our findings suggest that the barrier to infectivity in T. setosus adults differs from that shown for F. occidentalis adults. 3adisease vectors 3ainsect pests 3aFrankliniella occidentalis 3adisease transmission 3asalivary glands 3avirus replication 3aepithelium 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aTomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0athrips 0acell ultrastructure 0aTomato spotted wilt virus 0adigestive system1 aKnight, L.M.1 aHosokawa, D.1 aFujisawa, I.1 aTsuda, S.0 tPhytopathology.g2001 Dec., v. 91, no. 12 p.1149-1155x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO.2001.91.12.11493Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdPNN  aOther US 7aarticle02429naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001900172245008600191300001800277500002400295520109500319650001701414650001801431650002101449650002401470650001401494650001801508650001201526650002001538650001801558650003001576650001001606651001801616653003101634653002001665700002001685773010701705852000901812856006901821930003301890945002501923946001101948655001201959IND4385905820221119162645.0061210e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438590582DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-005-5228-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF900 0aM001 0aF2001 aThum, Ryan A. 10aIs Hybridization Responsible for Invasive Growth of Non-indigenous Water-milfoils  ap. 1061-1066.  aIncludes references  aHeterosis, or hybrid vigor, has recently been proposed as a factor promoting invasive growth of some non-indigenous aquatic plant species, particularly those capable of spreading rapidly within and among lakes through clonal reproduction. We tested this hypothesis for variable-leaf water milfoil (Myriophyllum heterophyllum), a non-indigenous aquatic plant that has become a major management and conservation concern in New England. Using nuclear ribosomal DNA, we looked for F₁ hybrid populations of invasive M. heterophyllum in 25 New Hampshire (NH) lakes. In contrast to a previous study that found F₁ hybrid lineages of invasive M. heterophyllum in Connecticut, we did not find hybrids in our study lakes. This result has two implications: (1) pure lineages of M. heterophyllum are also capable of invasive growth, and (2) the distribution of invasive M. heterophyllum lineages (hybrid vs. pure) may be spatially structured across New England. We stress the importance of more detailed distributional and ecological studies for understanding the invasive potential of this species. 3aMyriophyllum 3aaquatic weeds 3ainvasive species 3aecological invasion 3aheterosis 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3agenetic markers 3aribosomal DNA 3ageographical distribution 3alakes 3aNew Hampshire 0aMyriophyllum heterophyllum 0arange expansion1 aLennon, Jay T. 0 tBiological invasions.g2006 July, v. 8, no. 5 p.1061-1066dKluwer Academic Publishersx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-005-5228-43electronic resource  a20061214b20070102c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/12/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03034naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164100001700181245013800198300001600336520125100352650001001603650001001613650001501623650001501638650002001653650003701673650001501710650000801725650001701733650001001750650003001760650001201790650003101802650001601833650001601849650002701865650002901892650007001921650003001991650002402021650001102045650003002056650003202086650002402118650002002142653002502162700001502187700001602202773009602218852000902314856008502323945002502408946001102433655001202444IND4361650120221119162730.0040317e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436165012DNAL7 a136802042pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-003-1373-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This method showed the gene to have a wide-spread geographical distribution and temporal stability; and the primers demonstrated high specificity, sensitivity, and reliability. A total of 110 DNA extracts from different animal fecal and human sewage samples were screened using the primers and no positives resulted. Centrifugation and filtration methods for concentrating E. coli seeded into stream, ocean, secondary effluent, and dairy lagoon waters resulted in detection limits at the femtogram and attogram levels. E. coli with the biomarker seeded into stream, ocean, and secondary effluent waters remained stable for approximately 2 weeks for all water types. Of the farm lagoon and waste samples tested, 94% were positive for the STII trait, regardless of the number of E. coli screened and 100% were positive when > or = 35 E. coli isolates were screened. As the PCR product of the target sequence yielded a single band, the method is applicable to dot blot detection methodology, yielding great accuracy in determining the presence of swine fecal sources. 3aswine 3afeces 3apig manure 3apollutants 3awater pollution 3aenterotoxigenic Escherichia coli 3abiomarkers 3aDNA 3aenterotoxins 3agenes 3apolymerase chain reaction 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Toxinsxgenetics 2aBiomarkers. 2aDNA Primers 2aEnterotoxinsxgenetics 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aEscherichia coli Proteins 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aHumans 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSwinexmicrobiology 2aWater Pollution 0aheat-stable toxin II1 aTsai, Y.L.1 aOlson, B.H.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2003 Dec., v. 63, no. 2 p.231-238x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-003-1373-93Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdGHKe2004/04/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02734naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001600198245011500214300001600329500001500345520107700360650002201437650002601459650002501485650002001510650002001530650002201550650001201572650006301584650002301647650001801670650003901688650004601727650002801773650003401801650002701835650002701862653002001889700001901909700001801928700001801946700001401964773009601978852000902074856008502083945002502168946001102193655001202204IND4361646420221119162909.0040317e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436164642DNAL7 a136802012pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-003-1429-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This cDNA corresponded to the lcc1 gene, which coded for a precursor protein of 517 amino acids with a 21 amino acid signal peptide. Comparison of the deduced sequence with known laccases showed that this enzyme was most closely related to Lac1 from basidiomycete PM1 and Trametes C30 (98% similarity). The expression of lcc1 was analysed under different growth conditions; transcription of this gene was enhanced by the addition of organic nitrogen to the medium. The level of lcc1 transcription was higher when T. trogii was grown on synthetic medium supplemented with yeast extract rather than mycological peptone or tryptone. The transcription data were in agreement with total laccase activity measured in the supernatant and suggested that laccase production and lcc1 transcription are coordinately regulated in this organism. The lcc1 cDNA was expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris and the detection of laccase activity indicated that this cDNA encodes a laccase. 3acomplementary DNA 3aKomagataella pastoris 3arecombinant proteins 3agene expression 3awhite-rot fungi 3amolecular cloning 3alaccase 2aBasidiomycotaxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCulture Media 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aLaccasexchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPichiaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTranscription, Genetic 0aPichia pastoris1 aGarzillo, A.M.1 aBuonocore, V.1 aSchiesser, A.1 aRuzzi, M.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2003 Dec., v. 63, no. 2 p.153-158x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-003-1429-x3Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdGHKe2004/04/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02501naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100002100177245007700198300001600275500002400291500001500315520127100330650002201601650002301623650001301646650001101659650002501670650002101695650003101716653001801747700002001765700002301785773010301808852000901911856009001920930003302010945002502043946001102068655001202079IND4419245820221119162844.0090417e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441924582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2009.02.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF200 0aF4001 aYamashita, Saori10aRelationship between development of compression wood and gene expression  ap. 729-735.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn gymnosperms, tissue that differs from normal wood develops on the lower side of an inclined stem or branch and is referred to as compression wood. Compression wood is characterized by thicker tracheid walls, higher lignin content, and shorter tracheid length, among other features. No definable boundary exists between normal wood and compression wood, and compression wood is classified continuously from mild to severe. Therefore, kinds and abundances of transcripts are expected to be considerably different between mild and severe compression wood. We prepared Chamaecyparis obtusa saplings grown at various angles of inclination (0-50°) to obtain normal, mild, and severe compression wood samples. We examined the relationship between the degree of development of compression wood and relative transcript abundance of previously screened genes. Lignin content and relative abundance of a transcript with high similarity to laccase increased with increasing inclination angle of the saplings, i.e. development of compression wood. In contrast, tracheid length decreased with increasing development of compression wood, and in samples where the tracheid length was short, relative abundance of a transcript with high similarity to ascorbate oxidase decreased. 3aplant development 3aplant biochemistry 3asaplings 3alignin 3aChamaecyparis obtusa 3acompression wood 3agene expression regulation 0aplant anatomy1 aYoshida, Masato1 aYamamoto, Hiroyuki0 tPlant science.g2009 June, v. 176, no. 6 p.729-735dElsevier Science Ireland Ltd.x0168-94527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2009.02.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20090706b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/07/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02613naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245010700170300001800277520159900295653001701894653001901911653002201930653003401952653001201986700001801998700002702016773011802043852000902161856008502170930003302255946001102288655001202299IND4399903520221119162740.0080113e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439990352DNAL7 a10.1007/s00254-007-0710-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYidana, Sandow Mark 10aHydrogeological and hydrochemical characterization of the Voltaian Basin: the Afram Plains area, Ghana  ap. 1213-1223.  aIn the Afram Plains area, groundwater is the main source of water supply for most uses. The area is underlain by aquifers of the southern Voltaian sedimentary basin, which are predominantly sandstones, mudstones, conglomerates and shale. Ordinary least squares regression analysis using 41 well-test data from aquifers in the Afram Plains portion of the Voltaian system reveals that transmissivity, T, exists in a non-linear relationship with specific capacity, Sc. The analysis reveals that T = 0.769Sc¹.⁰⁷⁵ with R ² = 0.83 for aquifers in the area. The mudstone/conglomerate aquifer in the area appears to be the most variable in terms of both specific capacity and transmissivity with transmissivity ranging from 0.18 to 197.7 m²/day and 0.5 and 148.5 m³/day/m, respectively. Horizontal fractures and joints resulting from secondary fracturing appear to be the main determinants of both transmissivity and specific capacity in the area. PHREEQC modeling and mineral stability diagrams indicate that groundwater quality in the Afram Plains area is controlled by the incongruent weathering of silicate minerals in the aquifers. These processes concentrate calcium, sodium, magnesium, potassium, bicarbonate ion and quartz, leading to calcite, dolomite and aragonite supersaturation at most locations. Hierarchical cluster analysis performed on the raw chemical data reveals two main water types or facies: the calcium-sodium-chloride-bicarbonate facies, and the magnesium-potassium-sulfate-nitrate facies for the southern and northern sections of the Afram Plains area, respectively. 0aAfram Plains 0aTransmissivity 0aSpecific capacity 0aHierarchical cluster analysis 0aPHREEQC1 aOphori, Duke 1 aBanoeng-Yakubo, Bruce 0 tEnvironmental geology.g2008 Jan., v. 53, no. 6 p.1213-1223dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0943-01057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-007-0710-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20080113b20080202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02860naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100002200163245010800185300001600293500002400309520152700333650002401860650002201884650001901906650002601925650002101951650001601972650001301988650001902001650002302020650001702043650002102060653001702081700001702098700001602115773012002131852000902251856008502260930003302345945002502378946001102403655001202414IND4385905120140723000000.0061210e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438590512DNAL7 a10.1007/s10705-006-9005-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aX1001 aPuhlmann, Martina10aComparison of methods for the estimation of inert carbon suitable for initialisation of the CANDY model  ap. 295-304.  aIncludes references  aAlmost all soil organic carbon turnover models rely on a partitioning of total organic carbon into an inert and a decomposable pool. The quantification of these pools has a large impact on modelling results. In this study several methods to estimate inert carbon in soils, based either on total soil organic matter or physical protection, were assessed with the objectives of (1) minimising errors in carbon and nitrogen dynamics and (2) ensuring usability for sites with marked differences in site conditions. CANDY simulations were carried out by varying solely the method for calculating the size of the inert carbon pool used to initialise the model. Experimental data from Bad Lauchstädt and Müncheberg were used for the simulation. The data were made available for modellers at a workshop held at Müncheberg (Germany) in 2004. The results concerning not only carbon but also nitrogen dynamics were analysed by applying selected statistical methods. It was shown that even in short-term simulations model initialisation procedure may influence the simulation results considerably. Three methods of estimating inert carbon were identified as being the most appropriate. These methods are either based on soil texture or pore-space classes and therefore account for the physical protection of soil organic matter. Thus, physical protection seems to be of major importance. By extending the scope of the investigation into nitrogen dynamics, additional support for the applicability of a selected method was obtained. 3asoil organic carbon 3asimulation models 3abiodegradation 3aquantitative analysis 3amodel validation 3acalibration 3anitrogen 3asoil fertility 3atemporal variation 3asoil texture 3asoil pore system 0asite factors1 aKuka, Katrin1 aFranko, Uwe0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2006 Mar., v. 74, no. 3 p.295-304dKluwer Academic Publishersx1385-13147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-006-9005-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20071030b20071102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/10/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02644naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100002400168245010100192300001600293500002400309520144200333650001901775650000801794650002501802650002201827650002501849650004701874653002301921700002201944700002101966773010301987852000902090856009002099930003302189945002502222946001102247655001202258IND4419245720140725000000.0090417e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441924572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2009.02.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF4001 aBallesteros, Isabel10aMitochondrial DNA amplification in albino plants of rye (Secale cereale L.) regenerated in vitro  ap. 722-728.  aIncludes references  aSomaclonal variation has been intensively studied by using various molecular markers, however, very little information has been published concerning the nature of the changes and the mutational events involved in the appearance of the marker pattern modifications. Albino plants appeared with a high frequency among the regenerated plants of rye. When RAPDs were performed using the OpF13 primer, all the albino plants presented a very conspicuous band, the ScF13c amplicon, which was very faint or imperceptible in the green plants. We investigated the reasons for the differential amplification of this sequence. IPCR and Southern data indicated that the ScF13c sequence is located in the mitochondrial DNA. The appearance of this band seemed to be related with the amplification of the mitochondrial genome in the albino plants, as the real time PCR data proved. We also observed an increase in the number of mitochondria per cell in these plants that could explain the rise in the copy number of the mitochondrial sequences studied. We observed a very high rate of mutation in a nuclear locus because the same recessive mutation involved in albinism appeared independently in three different cell lines, as the progeny study revealed. This very high rate of mutation in a nuclear locus has been rarely reported. The albino plants of these progenies also showed an increase in the mitochondrial DNA, and in the number of mitochondria. 3aSecale cereale 3arye 3asomaclonal variation 3amitochondrial DNA 3aphenotypic variation 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 0aplant regeneration1 aLinacero, Rosario1 aVázquez, Ana M.0 tPlant science.g2009 June, v. 176, no. 6 p.722-728dElsevier Science Ireland Ltd.x0168-94527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2009.02.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20090706b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/07/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02493naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245010900160300001800269520154100287650001501828653001601843653001501859653001101874653001201885653001101897700001501908773011801923852000902041856008502050930003302135946001102168655001202179IND4399903720221119162931.0080113e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439990372DNAL7 a10.1007/s00254-007-0712-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErtas, B. 10aQuality and durability assessments of the armourstones for two rubble mound breakwaters (Mersin, Turkey)  ap. 1235-1247.  aDue to economic reasons, natural stones (armourstones) of various sizes and qualities are very frequently used for the constructions of the breakwaters to protect coastal engineering structures from wave actions. Deterioration of the armourstones with time in the form of abrasion and disintegration may end up with the damage of the structures. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the long-term performance and quality of the armourstones, which should be sound and durable. Mersin and Kumkuyu harbours were constructed using four different limestones obtained from two quarries. The limestones have different characters and site performances. In this study, the material and mass properties of the limestones taken from the quarries with known site performances as armourstones are investigated. The site performances and durability of the limestones are compared with the field measurements and laboratory works. Thus, the information obtained is used to assess long-term durability of the armourstones. The long-term performance of the Degirmencayi and Tirtar upper level limestones are observed to be good whereas it is rather poor for the Tirtar middle and lower level limestones. Comparison between the predicted and observed durabilities of the armourstones indicated that CIRIA/CUR, RDId, RERS, and wet to dry strength ratio give better results based on their field performances. However, the prediction of the durability of the limestones is poor in case RDIs, average pore diameter, and saturation coefficient are used. 3adurability 0aArmourstone 0aBreakwater 0aMersin 0aQuality 0aTurkey1 aTopal, T. 0 tEnvironmental geology.g2008 Jan., v. 53, no. 6 p.1235-1247dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0943-01057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-007-0712-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080113b20080202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03010naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245014300162300001600305500002400321500001500345520179700360650002202157650001702179650001102196650002502207650001502232650002502247650001102272650002002283650001802303650001902321650001902340650001202359650002102371653001102392700001702403700001802420773009302438852000902531856004802540655001202588IND4431758120221119162754.0100122e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443175812DNAL7 a10.1007/s11284-009-0641-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSellin, Arne10aIs distribution of hydraulic constraints within tree crowns reflected in photosynthetic water-use efficiency? An example of Betula pendula  ap. 173-183.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSpatial and daily variation in photosynthetic water-use efficiency was examined in leaves of Betula pendula Roth with respect to distribution of hydraulic conductance within the crown, morphological properties of stomata, and water availability. Intrinsic water-use efficiency (A n/g s) was determined from gas-exchange measurements performed both in situ in a natural forest stand and on detached shoots under laboratory conditions. In intact foliage, sun leaves demonstrated significantly higher (P < 0.001) A n/g s than shade leaves, as photosynthesis in the lower canopy was chronically limited by low light availability. However, this difference reversed in the mid-day period under sufficient irradiance (I > 800 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹): A n/g s averaged 28.8 and 24.0 µmol mol⁻¹ (P < 0.01) for shade and sun leaves, respectively. This last finding coincided with the data obtained in laboratory conditions: under equivalent leaf water supply and light, A n/g s in shade foliage was greater (P < 0.001) than in sun foliage across a wide range of irradiance. Thus, shade foliage of B. pendula is characterized by inherently higher A n/g s than sun foliage, associated with more conservative stomatal behavior, and lower soil-to-leaf (K T) and leaf hydraulic conductances. Under unlimited light conditions, a within-crown trade-off between A n/g s and K T becomes apparent. Differences in stomatal conductance between the detached shoots from sunlit and shaded canopy layers were largely attributable to the variation in stomatal morphology; significant relationships were established with characteristics combining stomatal size and density (relative stomatal surface, stomatal pore area index). Stomatal morphology is very likely involved in long-term adjustment of photosynthetic WUE. 3astomatal movement 3awater supply 3acanopy 3astomatal conductance 3atree crown 3awater use efficiency 3ashoots 3alight intensity 3aforest stands 3aBetula pendula 3aphotosynthesis 3astomata 3aleaf conductance 0aleaves1 aEensalu, Eve1 aNiglas, Aigar0 tEcological research.g2010 Jan., v. 25, no. 1 p.173-183dSpringer Japanx0912-38147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-009-0641-2 7aarticle03896naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129100002000138245011200158300001800270500002400288500001500312520171200327650002802039650000802067650001002075650001102085650002202096650002302118650002702141650002002168650003602188650002502224650002302249650003102272650002602303650002302329650001102352650001102363650002002374650004802394650002202442650001802464650001302482650001102495650001402506650000902520650003402529650002202563650003302585650001402618650003802632651001102670651001102681653002402692653002102716653001302737700002002750700002102770700002002791700002102811700002102832773013002853852000902983856008702992930003303079945002503112946001303137655001203150IND4385830620221119162724.0061210e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438583062DNAL7 a171584392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT2001 aJacobson, Peter10aResting metabolic rate and respiratory quotient: results from a genome-wide scan in the Quebec Family Study  ap. 1527-1533.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: Genes influencing resting metabolic rate (RMR) and respiratory quotient (RQ) represent candidate genes for obesity, type 2 diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome because of the involvement of these traits in energy balance and substrate oxidation. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a genome-wide scan for quantitative trait loci (QTL) contributing to the variability in RMR and RQ. DESIGN: Regression-based and variance components-based genome-wide autosomal scans on RMR and RQ phenotypes, obtained from indirect calorimetry, were performed in 169 families ascertained via an obese proband or from the general population. RESULTS: We found evidence for linkage to RMR on chromosomes 3q26.1 (lod = 2.74), 1q21.2 (2.44), and 22q12.3 (1.33). QTL influencing RQ were found on chromosomes 12q13 (1.65) and 14q22 (1.83) when the analyses were performed in all families. Considerable locus heterogeneity within this population was suggested because most of the families were unlinked to any one quantitative trait locus. Significant associations between traits and linked microsatellites were detected within the linked, informative subsets. CONCLUSIONS: We found several new QTL for energy metabolism, but the QTL on 1q may be a replication of the one reported in Pima Indians. All 3 RMR linkages overlapped regions previously linked to the metabolic syndrome or its components, and the significant association between RMR and the metabolic syndrome in the present cohort reinforces this relation. We conclude that considerable locus heterogeneity exists even within populations, which should be taken into account when considering candidate gene studies of energy metabolism phenotypes and other complex traits. 3aquantitative trait loci 3amen 3awomen 3agenome 3aenergy metabolism 3alinkage (genetics) 3aresting metabolic rate 3ahuman nutrition 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3arespiratory quotient 3afamilial incidence 2aBasal Metabolismxgenetics 2aCalorimetry, Indirect 2aChromosome Mapping 2aFamily 2aFemale 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenetic Predisposition to Diseasexgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenome, Human 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aLod Score 2aMale 2aMetabolic Syndromexgenetics. 2aObesityxgenetics 2aOxygen Consumptionxgenetics 2aPhenotype 2aQuantitative Trait Locixgenetics 3aQuebec 0aQuebec 0aQuebed Family Study 0aFrench Canadians 0afamilies1 aRankinen, Tuomo1 aTremblay, Angelo1 aPérusse, Louis1 aChagnon, Yvon C.1 aBouchard, Claude0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2006 Dec., v. 84, no. 6 p.1527-1533dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.ajcn.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070606b20070702c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/05/15  aOther US 7aarticle02297naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001600169245009300185300001800278500002400296520103900320650002101359650002301380650001901403650001201422650001201434650001601446650002201462650002701484650002401511650002201535650002201557650001201579650001301591650002201604650001101626700002001637700001701657700001901674773009601693852000901789856005301798655001201851IND4403009320221119162641.0080319e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440300932DNAL7 a177149422pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2007.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Fusheng10aBehavior of natural estrogens in semicontinuous activated sludge biodegradation reactors  ap. 2964-2971.  aIncludes references  aBiological degradation of natural estrogens was investigated by separately spiking 17β-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) into activated sludge reactors operated in a semi-continuous flow mode under aerobic conditions. By conducting runs for simultaneous addition of glucose over the designated initial concentrations of 0, 10, 30, 50 and 100mgl⁻¹, respectively, the likely effect of the easily biodegradable organic constituent on the degradation rate of the natural estrogens was also studied. The spiked E2 disappeared in a manner much faster than E1; and its disappearance occurred through elimination of its metabolic byproduct of E1. The apparent first-order disappearance rate of E2 and E1 fell in the ranges of 0.84-4.31h⁻¹ and 0.15-0.84h⁻¹, respectively when spiked separately into respective reactors. A general trend of decreases in the disappearance rate with increases of the initial glucose concentration was revealed. The presence of glucose was also found capable of lowering the conversion ratio from E2 to E1. 3aactivated sludge 3aaerobic conditions 3abiodegradation 3aestrone 3aglucose 2aBioreactors 2aBiotransformation 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aEstradiolxanalysis 2aEstriolxanalysis 2aEstronexanalysis 2aGlucose 2aKinetics 2aMass Spectrometry 2aSewage1 aDesmiarti, Reni1 aYuasa, Akira1 aHorio, Akihiro0 tBioresource technology.g2008 May, v. 99, no. 8 p.2964-2971dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2007.06.016 7aarticle03240naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148100001800166245012200184300001800306520154000324650001901864650002601883650000901909650001201918650001401930650001201944650002301956650001501979650002601994650002602020650003602046650002002082650003502102650002302137650002202160650002502182650002202207650003902229650002402268650002202292650002302314650003402337650002102371651001202392700001702404700002402421773007602445852000902521856008702530930003302617945001302650946001102663655001202674IND2333130320221119162900.0030619e200212  bcc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233313032DNAL7 a124645792pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/22.17.12572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTegelberg, R.10aEffects of long-term, elevated ultraviolet-B radiation on phytochemicals in the bark of silver birch (Betula pendula)  ap. 1257-1263.  aLong-term outdoor experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of elevated ultraviolet-B (UV-B, 280-320 nm) radiation on secondary metabolites (phenolics and terpenoids) and the main soluble sugars (sucrose, raffinose and glucose) in the bark of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) saplings. Saplings were exposed to a constant 50% increase in erythemal UV irradiance (UV-BCIE; based on the CIE (International Commission on Illumination) erythemal action spectrum) and a small increase in UV-A radiation (320-400 nm) for three growing seasons in an irradiation field in central Finland. Two control groups were used: saplings exposed to ambient radiation and saplings exposed to slightly increased UV-A radiation. Concentrations of sucrose, raffinose and glucose in bark were higher in UV-treated saplings than in saplings grown in ambient radiation, indicating that stem carbohydrate metabolism was changed by long-term elevated UV radiation. Saplings in the elevated UV-A + UV-B radiation treatment and the UV-A radiation control treatment had significantly increased concentrations of certain UV-absorbing phenolics, such as salidroside, 3,4'-dihydroxypropiophenone-3-glucoside, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin compared with saplings in ambient radiation. In contrast, the radiation treatments had no effect on the non-UV-B-absorbing terpenoids, papyriferic acid and deacetylpapyriferic acid. We conclude that plant parts, in addition to leaves, accumulate specific phenolic UV-filters in response to UV radiation exposure. 3aBetula pendula 3aultraviolet radiation 3abark 3aglucose 3araffinose 3asucrose 3aphenolic compounds 3aterpenoids 3aquantitative analysis 3along term experiments 3achemical constituents of plants 3astress response 2aBetulaxchemistryxphysiology. 2aCatechinxanalysis 2aGlucosexanalysis 2aGlucosidesxanalysis 2aPhenolsxanalysis 2aPlant Barkxchemistryxphysiology. 2aRaffinosexanalysis 2aSucrosexanalysis 2aTerpenesxanalysis 2aTreesxchemistryxphysiology. 2aUltraviolet Rays 3aFinland1 aAphalo, P.J.1 aJulkunen-Tiitto, R.0 tTree physiology.g2002 Dec., v. 22, no. 17 p.1257-1263x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/22.17.12573Available from publisher's Web site  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02939naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100001400168245018600182300001800368500001500386520152400401650002301925650001601948650002201964650002101986650002002007650001502027650001302042650001902055650001602074650001102090650002302101653001902124653001702143653001202160653003002172700001802202700001702220773007502237852000902312856008902321930003302410945001302443946001302456655001202469IND2324872920221119162623.0020116e200111  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232487292DNAL7 a189434372pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO.2001.91.11.10302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerto, P.10aPossible role of colonization and cell wall-degrading enzymes in the differential ability of three Ulocladium atrum strains to control Botrytis cinerea on necrotic strawberry leaves  ap. 1030-1036.  a2019-12-04  aUlocladium atrum (strain 385) consistently reduced Botrytis cinerea sporulation on necrotic fragments of strawberry leaves. On these tissues, two strains of U. atrum (isolates 18558 and 18559) showed lower antagonistic activities than the reference strain 385. Colonization of strawberry leaflets by the three U. atrum strains appeared similar in the absence of B. cinerea, whether quantified by chitin or immunological assays. The second method (based on anti-U. atrum antibodies) revealed that strawberry leaflet colonization by U. atrum 385 was better than by the other U. atrum strains in the presence of B. cinerea. An immunoassay using anti-B. cinerea antibodies revealed that the colonization of B. cinerea in tissues was lower in the presence of U. atrum 385 than with the two other U. atrum strains. The enzymatic activities produced by U. atrum 385 during the colonization phases of necrotic tissues were compared to B. cinerea and U. atrum strains 18558 and 18559. U. atrum 385 had the highest lipase, pectate lyase, and cellobiase activities while B. cinerea had the highest endo-beta-1,4-glucanase activity. The study of lytic activities hydrolyzing the fungal cell wall revealed higher beta-1,3-glucanase activity with U. atrum 385, which was stimulated by B. cinerea on necrotic strawberry leaflets. These results suggest that plant and fungal cell wall-degrading enzymes produced by U. atrum 385 may play a complementary role in the competitive colonization of dead strawberry leaves against B. cinerea. 3afungal antagonists 3asporulation 3aFragaria ananassa 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aDeuteromycotina 3acell walls 3anecrosis 3abeta-glucanase 3adegradation 3aleaves 3abiological control 0afungus control 0acolonization 0aenzymes 0abiological control agents1 aJijakli, M.H.1 aLepoivre, P.0 tPhytopathology.g2001 Nov., v. 91, no. 11 p.1030-1036x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO.2001.91.11.10303Available from publisher's Web site  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03168naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100001900168245013900187300001800326500001500344520153800359650004501897650001601942650004701958650001302005650001802018650003002036650001902066650002802085650001102113650001402124650001802138650001602156650001102172653002802183653002302211653001302234653001102247653001802258700002002276700001902296700001802315700001302333700001702346700001902363773007502382852000902457856008902466930003302555945001302588946001302601655001202614IND2324874320221119162924.0020116e200111  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232487432DNAL7 a189434402pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO.2001.91.11.10542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPriyatmojo, A.10aCharacterization of a new subgroup of Rhizoctonia solani anastomosis group 1 (AG-1-ID), causal agent of a necrotic leaf spot on coffee  ap. 1054-1061.  a2019-12-04  aA new foliar disease on coffee leaves was observed in Mindanao, Philippines, in 1996. The symptoms appeared as large circular or irregularly shaped necrotic areas with small circular necrotic spots (1 mm or less in diameter) usually found around the periphery of the large necrotic areas. Rhizoctonia solani was consistently isolated from these diseased coffee leaves. Isolates obtained were multinucleate (3 to 12 nuclei per hyphal cell), had an optimum temperature for hyphal growth at 25 degrees C, prototrophic for thiamine, and anastomosed with tester isolates belonging to R. solani anastomosis group 1 (AG-1). Mature cultures on potato dextrose agar (PDA) were light to dark brown. Sclerotia, light brown to brown, were formed on the surface of PDA and covered the whole mature colony culture. Individual sclerotia often aggregated into large clumps (3 to 8 mm in diameter) and their color was brown to dark brown. In pathogenicity tests, isolates from coffee caused necrotic symptoms on coffee leaves, whereas isolates of AG-1-IA (not isolated from coffee), 1-IB, and 1-IC did not. The results of analyses of restriction fragment length polymorphism of ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer, random amplified polymorphism DNA, and fatty acid profiles showed that R. solani isolates from coffee are a population of AG-1 different from AG-1-IA, 1-IB, and 1-IC. These results suggest that R. solani isolates from coffee represent a new subgroup distinct from AG-1-IA, 1-IB, and 1-IC. A new subgroup ID (AG-1-ID) is proposed. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3afatty acids 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3anecrosis 3aribosomal DNA 3afungal diseases of plants 3aCoffea arabica 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3ahyphae 3aleaf spot 3apathogenicity 3atemperature 3aleaves 0aexperimental infections 0aanastomosis groups 0asymptoms 0agrowth 0aleaf spotting1 aEscopalao, V.E.1 aTangonan, N.G.1 aPascual, C.B.1 aSuga, H.1 aKageyama, K.1 aHyakumachi, M.0 tPhytopathology.g2001 Nov., v. 91, no. 11 p.1054-1061x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO.2001.91.11.10543Available from publisher's Web site  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03823naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147072000900156072000900165072000900174100002300183245012500206300001600331500002400347500001500371520227600386650001302662650002902675650001102704650001902715650001902734650001902753650002602772650002002798650001002818650001602828650001902844650001502863650002402878651001002902653001602912653002202928700002302950700002302973700002102996773009903017852000903116856008703125930003303212945002503245946001103270655001203281IND4419242820221119162619.0090417e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441924282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2008.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aF120 0aJ200 0aF8401 aShisanya, Chris A.10aEffect of organic and inorganic nutrient sources on soil mineral nitrogen and maize yields in central highlands of Kenya  ap. 239-246.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aHigh population pressure in the central highlands of Kenya has led to continuous cultivation of land with minimal additional inputs leading to soil nutrient depletion. Research work has reported positive results from use of manure and biomass from Tithonia, Calliandra, Leucaena, Mucuna and Crotolaria for soil fertility replenishment. An experimental field was set up in Chuka Division to test different soil nutrient replenishment treatments. The experimental design was randomised complete block with 14 treatments replicated three times. At the beginning and end of the experiment, soil was sampled at 0-15cm depth and analysed for pH, Ca, Mg, K, C, N and P. End of the 2000/2001 short rains (SR) season and 2001 long rains (LR) season, soil samples were taken at 0-30, 30-100 and 100-150cm for nitrate and ammonium analysis. All the treatments received an equivalent of 60kgNha⁻¹, except herbaceous legume treatments, where N was determined by the amount of the biomass harvested and incorporated in soil and control treatment received no inputs. Results indicate soil fertility increased slightly in all treatments (except control) over the 2-year study period. Average maize grain yield across the treatments was 1.1, 5.4, 3.5 and 4.0Mgha⁻¹ during the 2000 LR, 2000/2001 SR, 2001 LR and 2001/2002 SR, respectively. The reduced yield in 2000 LR and 2001 LR are attributed to poor rainfall distribution during the two seasons. On average, Tithonia with half recommended rate of inorganic fertilizer recorded the highest (4.8Mgha⁻¹) maize yield followed by sole Tithonia (4.7Mgha⁻¹). Highest average concentration (144.8 and 115.5kgNha⁻¹) of mineral N was recorded at the 30-100cm soil depth at the end of both 2000/2001 SR and LR, respectively. The lowest average concentration (67.1kgNha⁻¹) was recorded in the 100-150cm soil depth in both seasons, while during the 2001 LR, the 0-30cm soil depth recorded the lowest concentration (52.3kgNha⁻¹). The residual mineral N in the 100-150cm soil depth doubled at the end of the LR 2001 compared to what was present and the end of the SR 2000/2001 season in all treatments. This shows that there is substantial amount of mineral N that is being leached below the rooting zone of maize in this region. 3aZea mays 3asoil chemical properties 3ashrubs 3aanimal manures 3asoil nutrients 3aplant residues 3anutrient deficiencies 3asoil amendments 3atrees 3agrain yield 3asoil fertility 3aphosphorus 3aorganic fertilizers 3aKenya 0afertilizers 0aleguminous plants1 aMucheru, Monica W.1 aMugendi, Daniel N.1 aKung'u, James B.0 tSoil & tillage research.g2009 May, v. 103, no. 2 p.239-246dElsevier Sciencex0167-19877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2008.05.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20090513b20090608c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/05/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02260naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245012500144300001400269520136800283650001101651650001201662650001801674651001001692653001601702653001601718653001401734653001501748653002001763700001201783773007201795852000901867939003301876946001301909655001201922IND9001368020221119162623.0900404e199001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900136802DNAL7 a166672322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTateno, M.10aComparison of lodging safety factor of untreated and succinic acid 2,2-dimethylhydrazide-treated shoots of mulberry tree  ap. 12-16.  aThis study examined the lodging resistance of mulberry tree (Morus bombycis Koidz. cv Kenmochi) shoots treated or not treated with succinic acid 2,2-dimethylhydrazide (SADH). The lodging safety factor, an indicator of lodging resistance, was defined as the ratio of critical lodging load to the leaf fresh weight observed, provided that the distribution of the critical lodging load along the stem was similar to that of the leaf fresh weight observed. The critical lodging load was experimentally estimated by loading weights onto the stems. In the untreated trees, the lodging safety factor was maintained at about 3.2. In the SADH-treated trees, the stem elongation was inhibited to about 80% of that in the untreated trees, and the percentage of shoot dry matter partitioned into the leaves was always larger than that of the untreated trees. This dwarfing of the stem caused by SADH increased the critical lodging load supported by the unit stem dry weight, while this large investment of materials in leaves increased the leaf fresh weight supported by the unit stem dry weight. Since the increments canceled each other, the lodging safety factor of the SADH-treated shoots was similar to that of the untreated ones. These results suggest that the shoot formation of the mulberry tree is controlled to maintain the lodging safety factor at a constant level. 3ashoots 3alodging 3asuccinic acid 3aJapan 0agrowth rate 0aderivatives 0atreatment 0aresistance 0amorus bombycina1 aBae, K.0 tPlant physiology.g1990 Jan., v. 92, no. 1 p.12-16x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03054naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100001500168245013700183300001800320500001500338520143700353650002401790650002001814650001601834650003001850650002301880650002601903650001101929650002501940650001101965650001401976650001001990650001402000650001402014653001302028653001702041653001802058653002702076653001202103700001502115700001702130700001902147700001802166700001702184700001502201700001402216700001402230773007502244852000902319856008902328930003302417945001302450946001302463655001202476IND2324872320221119162738.0020116e200111  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232487232DNAL7 a189434362pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO.2001.91.11.10242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOshima, K.10aIsolation and characterization of derivative lines of the onion yellows phytoplasma that do not cause stunting or phloem hyperplasia  ap. 1024-1029.  a2019-12-04  aTwo lines of onion yellows phytoplasma producing milder symptoms were isolated from the original line (OY-W). One has an additional characteristic, non-insect-transmissibility (OY-NIM), compared with the other (OY-M). OY-M was established after maintaining OY-W for 11 years on a plant host (Chrysanthemum coronarium) with an insect vector (Macrosteles striifrons), and OY-NIM was isolated after subsequent maintenance of OY-M in plants by periodic grafting. Polymerase chain analysis suggested that OY-NIM cannot traverse the gut or survive in the hemolymph of the leafhopper. OY-W results in witches'-broom formation and stunted growth in the host plant. In contrast, OY-M and OY-NIM do not cause stunting in the host plant, although they result in witches'-broom. Histopathological analysis of these lines revealed that the hyperplastic phloem tissue and severe phloem necrosis seen in OY-W did not exist in OY-M and OY-NIM. This was attributed to a reduction in the population of phytoplasma in tissues in both OY-M- and OY-NIM-infected plants. The results suggest that the cause of stunting and phloem hyperplasia may be genetically different from the cause of witches'-broom. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis analysis showed that OY-M had a smaller genome size (approximately equal to 870 kbp) than OY-W (approximately equal to 1,000 kbp). Thus, some of the OY-W genes responsible for pathogenicity may not be present in OY-M. 3aGlebionis coronaria 3aelectrophoresis 3aMacrosteles 3apolymerase chain reaction 3astrain differences 3aplant characteristics 3aheight 3adisease transmission 3aphloem 3ahemolymph 3agenes 3avirulence 3amortality 0asymptoms 0aphytoplasmas 0apathogenicity 0amacrosteles striifrons 0astrains1 aShiomi, T.1 aKuboyama, T.1 aSawayanagi, T.1 aNishigawa, H.1 aKakizawa, S.1 aMiyata, S.1 aUgaki, M.1 aNamba, S.0 tPhytopathology.g2001 Nov., v. 91, no. 11 p.1024-1029x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO.2001.91.11.10243Available from publisher's Web site  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle01263naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100002000117245006900137300001300206520045900219650002500678650001300703650001600716650003200732653001600764653003500780653003100815773007700846852000900923939003300932945000800965655001200973991567932910742620221119162532.0780701e197709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7894831772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeLong, Thomas.10aWhat do middle managers really want from first line supervisors?  ap. 8-12.  aInsights gained from interviews with 25 middle level managers throughout the Midwest point to the importance they attach to communicative ability over technical competence.

Sequence analysis of internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 (ITS1 and ITS2) and 5.8S regions of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcriptional unit and analysis of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) data were performed for the 68 isolates of Verticillium spp. Identical rDNA sequences were obtained for all 40 Pennsylvania isolates collected during 1999, 13 North American isolates collected during the last 50 years, and the ex-type strain of V. fungicola var. aleophilum. Sequence analysis of European isolates revealed a close relationship to the ex-type strain V. fungicola var. fungicola. No European-like isolates of V. fungicola var. fungicola were detected in the collection of North American isolates examined. Results from six decamer RAPD primers strongly indicate the presence of a clonal population of V. fungicola among Pennsylvania isolates. In addition, RAPD data delineated a Korean isolate (DC130) and ex-type strain V. fungicola var. aleophilum from the North American group. Virulence assays, based on spore inoculation of mushroom pilei, revealed variation corresponding to each neighbor-joining and RAPD grouping. All isolates with rDNA sequence and RAPD grouping similarity to ex-type strains V. fungicola var. aleophilum and V. fungicola var. fungicola displayed the highest level of virulence. Based on rDNA sequence and RAPD analyses, isolates displaying reduced or no virulence were distantly related to these two varieties. All results obtained for the analyses of ex-type strain V. fungicola var. flavidum suggested that this fungal isolate should not be considered a variety of V. fungicola, but rather a distinct species. 3aAcremonium strictum 3aVerticillium 3aAgaricus bisporus 3aphylogeny 3aTolypocladium 3aNectria 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aLecanicillium fungicola 3agenetic variation 3apathotypes 3aintergenic DNA 3aPennsylvania 0ageographical races 0atolypocladium parasiticum 0aVerticillium fungicola 0averticillium tenerum 0anectria inventa 0amolecular sequence data 0adna amplification 0ahelicoon sessile 0aorbilia luteorubella1 aLargeteau-Mamoun, M.L.1 aRomaine, C.P.1 aRoyse, D.J.0 tPhytopathology.g2001 Sept., v. 91, no. 9 p.905-912x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO.2001.91.9.9053Available from publisher's Web site  a20010929b20011005c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02759naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001500167245014100182300001600323500001500339520133300354650001001687650001601697650002201713650001001735650001901745650001101764650001501775650001401790650001301804650001701817650002501834650002501859650001401884650001001898650001101908653001301919653001901932700001301951700001401964700001801978700001601996773007302012852000902085856008802094930003302182945001302215946001302228655001202241IND2323501220221119162601.0011015e200110  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232350122DNAL7 a189441202pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO.2001.91.10.9412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFleysh, N.10aPathogenesis of Alfalfa mosaic virus in soybean (Glycine max) and expression of chimeric rabies peptide in virus-infected soybean plants  ap. 941-947.  a2019-12-04  aInfection of soybean (Glycine max) plants inoculated with particles of Alfalfa mosaic virus (AlMV) isolate 425 at 12 days after germination was monitored throughout the life cycle of the plant (vegetative growth, flowering, seed formation, and seed maturation) by western blot analysis of tissue samples. At 8 to 10 days after inoculation, the upper uninoculated leaves showed symptoms of virus infection and accumulation of viral coat protein (CP). Virus CP was detectable in leaves, stem, roots, seedpods, and seed coat up to 45 days postinoculation (dpi), but only in the seedpod and seed coat at 65 dpi. No virus accumulation was detected in embryos and cotyledons at any time during infection, and no seed transmission of virus was observed. Soybean plants inoculated with recombinant AlMV passaged from upper uninoculated leaves of infected plants showed accumulation of full-length chimeric AlMV CP containing rabies antigen in systemically infected leaves and seed coat. These results suggest the potential usefulness of plants and plant viruses as vehicles for producing proteins of biomedical importance in a safe and inexpensive manner. Moreover, even the soybean seed coat, treated as waste tissue during conventional processing for oil and other products, may be utilized for the expression of value-added proteins. 3atesta 3aGlycine max 3aprotein synthesis 3astems 3aplant residues 3arabies 3acotyledons 3achimerism 3apeptides 3apathogenesis 3arecombinant vaccines 3aAlfalfa mosaic virus 3asynthesis 3aroots 3aleaves 0asymptoms 0aembryo (plant)1 aDeka, D.1 aDrath, M.1 aKoprowski, H.1 aYusibov, V.0 tPhytopathology.g2001 Oct., v. 91, no. 10 p.941-947x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO.2001.91.10.9413Available from publisher's Web site  a20011101b20011108c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02667naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245007100144300001600215500001500231520174400246650001001990650001702000650001802017650002502035650001702060650001802077650002302095653001502118653001602133653001102149700001602160773007402176852000902250939003302259946001302292655001202305IND9000142220221119162523.0900108e198910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900014222DNAL7 a166670732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMudd, S.H.10aSynthesis of ethanolamine and its regulation in Lemna paucicostata  ap. 587-597.  a2019-12-05  aThe metabolism of ethanolamine and its derivatives in Lemna paucicostata has been investigated, with emphasis on the pathway for synthesis of phosphoethanolamine, a precursor of phosphatidylcholine in higher plants. In experiments involving labeling of intact plants with radioactive serine, ambiguities of interpretation due to entry of radioactivity into methyl groups of methylated ethanolamine derivatives were mitigated by pregrowth of plants with methionine. Difficulties due to labeling of diacylglyceryl moieties of phospholipids were avoided by acid hydrolysis of crucial samples and determination of radioactivity in isolated serine or ethanolamine moieties. The results obtained from such experiments are most readily reconciled with the biosynthetic sequence: serine leads to ethanolamine leads to phosphoethanolamine leads to phosphatidylethanolamine. A possible alternative is: serine leads to phosphatidylserine leads to phosphatidylethanolamine leads to ethanolamine leads to phosphoethanolamine. Cell-free extracts of L. paucicostata were shown to produce CO2 from the carbon originating as C-1 of serine at a rate sufficient to satisfy the demand for ethanolamine moieties. A number of experiments produced no support for a hypothetical role for phosphoserine in phosphoethanolamine formation. Uptake of exogenous ethanolamine comensurately down-regulates the synthesis of ethanolamine moieties (considered as a whole, and regardless of their state of derivatization at the time of their formation). In agreement with previous observations, uptake of exogenous choline down-regulates the methylation of phosphoethanolamine, without being accompanied by secondary accumulation of a marked excess of ethanolamine derivates. 3aLemna 3abiosynthesis 3aradiolabeling 3abiochemical pathways 3aethanolamine 3agrowing media 3aserine dehydratase 0ametabolism 0aderivatives 0auptake1 aDatko, A.H.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 Oct., v. 91, no. 2 p.587-597x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02718naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002200110040001800132100001700150245007200167300001600239520118200255650002001437650001001457650001101467650002301478650003001501650001501531650004301546650002301589650003401612650001501646650002401661650001101685650001101696650000901707650004901716650001901765650002301784650001701807650004701824650001301871650002101884651001801905653001501923700001701938700002101955700001301976700001401989700001802003773007602021852000902097939003302106946001302139655001202152IND9003820820221119162633.0900809e198912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900382082DNAL7 a25115902pmid7 aPMC15801452pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBotvin, G.J.12aA psychosocial approach to smoking prevention for urban black youth  ap. 573-582.  aDespite the high rates of smoking-related cancers among black Americans, little is known about the type of smoking prevention program that might be effective with black youth. The current study pilot-tested a promising smoking prevention approach to determine its feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness. A total of 608 students in nine predominantly black urban junior high schools were stratified by community and randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions. Students in the treatment condition participated in a 12-session smoking prevention program which taught resistance skills and general life skills. Process data indicated that this prevention approach was feasible and acceptable to students, teachers, and administrators. Outcome data indicated that this program reduced the proportion of children who smoked in the past month by 56 percent and it increased knowledge of the adverse consequences of smoking and normative expectations concerning adult and peer smoking.

  1 aTrujillo-Roldan, M.A.14aThe roles of oxygen and alginate-lyase in determining the molecular weight of alginate produced by Azotobacter vinelandii  ap. 742-747.  aAn Azotobacter vinelandii mutant lacking alginate-lyase (SML2) and the wild type (ATCC 9046) were used to discriminate between the roles of the polymerase complex and alginate-lyase in the synthesis of alginate in cultures conducted under controlled dissolved oxygen tension (DOT). To avoid the presence of pre-synthesized alginates, all cultures were inoculated with washed cells. For cultures carried out at 3% DOT using the mutant, a well defined family of alginates of high mean molecular weight (MMW) were obtained (985 kDa). Under 1% and 5% DOT, the mutant produced unique families of alginates with lower MMW (150 and 388 kDa). A similar behavior was observed using the wild type: a production of well defined families of alginates of high MMW at 3% DOT (1,250 kDa) and lower MMW at 1% and 5% DOT (370 and 350 kDa). At the end of the ATCC 9046 fermentations, alginate was depolymerized by the action of lyases. Overall, the evidence indicated that polymerization of alginate is carried out by producing families of polysaccharide in a narrow MMW range, and that it is highly dependent on DOT. The role of alginate-lyase (present in the wild type) is restricted to a post-polymerization step. 3aalginates 3abiosynthesis 3abiological production 2aAlginatesxchemistry 2aAzotobacter vinelandiixenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aGene Deletion 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGlucuronic Acidxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aHexuronic Acidsxchemistry 2aIndustrial Microbiology 2aMolecular Weight 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aPolysaccharide-Lyasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0adissolved oxygen tension1 aMoreno, S.1 aEspin, G.1 aGalindo, E.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2004 Feb., v. 63, no. 6 p.742-747x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-003-1419-z3Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdGHKe2004/04/09  aNon-US 7aarticle03099naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100002500154245016300179300001800342500002400360520164400384650002802028650002102056650002402077650002502101650001702126650001002143650001402153650001302167650002202180650001602202650001202218650002102230650002402251651001302275653002002288653001202308700002102320700002202341773010702363852000902470856006902479930003302548945002502581946001102606655001202617IND4385906220221119162620.0061210e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438590622DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-005-8155-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF3001 aThomas, Jennifer R. 12aA Landscape Perspective of the Stream Corridor Invasion and Habitat Characteristics of an Exotic (Dioscorea oppositifolia) in a Pristine Watershed in Illinois  ap. 1103-1113.  aIncludes references  aThe spatial distribution of exotics across riparian landscapes is not uniform, and research elaborating the environmental constraints and dispersal behavior that underlie these patterns of distribution is warranted. This study examined the spatial distribution, growth patterns, and habitat constraints of populations of the invasive Dioscorea oppositifolia in a forested stream corridor of a tributary of Drury Creek in Giant City State Park, IL. The distribution of D. oppositifolia was determined at the watershed scale mainly by floodplain structure and connectivity. Populations of D. oppositifolia were confined to the floodplain, with overbank flooding from the stream. Dioscorea oppositifolia probably originates in disturbed areas upstream of natural corridors, and subsequently, the species disperses downstream into pristine canyons or ravines via bulbils dispersing in the water. In Giant City State Park, populations of D. oppositifolia were distributed on the floodplain across broad gradients of soil texture, light, slope, and potential radiation. The study also examined the longevity of bulbils in various micro-environments to illuminate strategies for the management of the species in invaded watersheds. After 1 year, the highest percentages of bulbils were viable under leaves, and much lower percentages were viable over leaves, in soil, and in the creek (76.0±6.8, 21.2±9.6, 21.6±3.6, and 5.2±5.2%), respectively. This study suggests that management procedures that reduce leaf litter on the forest floor (e.g., prescribed burning) could reduce the number of bulbils of D. oppositifolia stored in the watershed. 3aDioscorea oppositifolia 3ainvasive species 3aecological invasion 3aspatial distribution 3aplant growth 3abulbs 3aviability 3ahabitats 3alandscape ecology 3afloodplains 3astreams 3ariparian forests 3aforested watersheds 3aIllinois 0aplant dispersal 0abulbils1 aMiddleton, Beth 1 aGibson, David J. 0 tBiological invasions.g2006 July, v. 8, no. 5 p.1103-1113dKluwer Academic Publishersx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-005-8155-53electronic resource  a20061214b20070102c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/12/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02969naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245006300206300001800269506007600287520162600363506003701989650001202026650001002038650000902048650001402057650001202071700002102083700001902104700002702123700002002150700002402170700002202194700002102216773017202237852000902409856008302418930003302501946001302534655001202547IND4391054320221207090005.0070506e20070501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439105432DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07012891042doi7 aPMC18634472pmcid7 a174526352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuchon, Dorothée10aMultiple molecular evidences for a living mammalian fossil  ap. 7495-7499.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLaonastes aenigmamus is an enigmatic rodent first described in 2005. Molecular and morphological data suggested that it is the sole representative of a new mammalian family, the Laonastidae, and a member of the Hystricognathi. However, the validity of this family is controversial because fossil-based phylogenetic analyses suggest that Laonastes is a surviving member of the Diatomyidae, a family considered to have been extinct for 11 million years. According to these data, Laonastes and Diatomyidae are the sister clade of extant Ctenodactylidae (i.e., gundies) and do not belong to the Hystricognathi. To solve the phylogenetic position of Laonastes, we conducted a large-scale molecular phylogeny of rodents. The analysis includes representatives of all major rodent taxonomic groups and was based on 5.5 kb of sequence data from four nuclear and two mitochondrial genes. To further validate the obtained results, a short interspersed element insertion analysis including 11 informative loci was also performed. Our molecular data based on sequence and short interspersed element analyses unambiguously placed Laonastes as a sister clade of gundies. All alternative hypotheses were significantly rejected based on Shimodaira-Hasegawa tests, supporting the idea that Laonastes does not belong to the Hystricognathi. Molecular dating analysis also supports an ancient divergence, [almost equal to]44 Mya ago, between Ctenodactylidae and LAONASTES: These combined analyses support the hypothesis that Laonastes is indeed a living fossil. Protection of this surviving species would conserve an ancient mammalian family.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afossils 3agenes 3aloci 3aphylogeny 3arodents1 aChevret, Pascale1 aJordan, Ursula1 aKilpatrick, C.

Isolates from Georgia peanuts exhibiting limb rot were characterized as gas chromatography (GC) subgroup 1 (GC-1) and contained HG-I isolates. Isolates from diseased soybean hypocotyls grown in North Dakota and sugar beet seedlings, taproots, and tare soil in Minnesota and North Dakota were characterized as GC subgroup 2 (GC-2) and contained predominantly HG-II isolates but also included three distinct isolates based on fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis and morphological features. Selected isolates from North Carolina cucumbers clustered into three distinct groups that corresponded to HG-I, HG-II, and the newly described HG-III. Distinct isolates from the soybean and sugar beet populations clustered with HG-III. Fatty acid profiles of AG-4 were compared with FAME library profiles of AG-1, AG-2 type 2, and AG-3, which were developed in previous studies and were sufficiently different that they could be used to support speciation of this group from R. solani. It is suggested that binomial R. practicola may be appropriate for the portion of AG-4 identified as HG-II. 3afatty acids 3aGlycine max 3aquantitative analysis 3aCucumis sativus 3achemical constituents of plants 3apathotypes 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3apathogenicity 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3agenetic variation 3aArachis hypogaea 3achemotaxonomy 3aBeta vulgaris 3aNorth Dakota 3aTexas 3aMinnesota 3aCalifornia 3aMaryland 3aGeorgia 3aNorth Carolina 0ageographical races 0aanastomosis groups 0aThanatephorus praticola1 aJones, R.K.0 tPhytopathology.g2001 Sept., v. 91, no. 9 p.821-830x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO.2001.91.9.8213Available from publisher's Web site  a20010929b20011005c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03154naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001700163245014600180300001800326500002400344520166200368650002102030650001602051650002202067650002202089650003002111650001402141650002402155650002002179650002302199650001402222650001302236650001102249651001402260653001902274653002002293653001802313653002102331700002002352700002202372773010702394852000902501856006902510930003302579945002502612946001102637655001202648IND4385906820221119161500.0061210e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438590682DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-005-5445-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL300 0aL0011 aKoch, R.

A quantitative risk assessment for the potential impact of H. axyridis on D. plexippus in Minnesota corn and soybean fields was developed using risk analysis software. This assessment considered a potential worst-case scenario for the impact of H. axyridis on D. plexippus. Habitat-specific recruitment of D. plexippus eggs was determined empirically. Subsequently, simulated abundance of D. plexippus in each habitat was reduced by two classes of stage-specific mortality: predation by H. axyridis and causes other than H. axyridis. Predation was modeled as a function of D. plexippus exposure to H. axyridis, and predation rate of D. plexippus by H. axyridis. Exposure and subsequent risk varied considerably by habitat, with a low risk of H. axyridis adversely affecting D. plexippus populations developing in corn fields, but a moderate to high risk in soybean fields. Predicted rates of D. plexippus mortality attributable to H. axyridis were greater in soybean compared to corn fields, possibly due to the numerical response of H. axyridis to soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura. This study demonstrates that H. axyridis has the potential to have a strong adverse impact on D. plexippus populations. However, the likelihood of occurrence for this worst-case scenario remains uncertain. To evaluate the landscape-level risk of H. axyridis impacting D. plexippus, further data on recruitment of D. plexippus in other habitats and exposure estimates specific to additional habitats are needed. 3aDanaus plexippus 3abutterflies 3aHarmonia axyridis 3apredatory insects 3abiological control agents 3apredation 3anontarget organisms 3arisk assessment 3apopulation density 3amortality 3ahabitats 3amodels 3aMinnesota 0apredation risk 0anon-target prey 0acorn habitats 0asoybean habitats1 aVenette, R.

The interactions between the antagonist and the pathogen, as well as the effect of the toxins produced by the antagonist on mycelial growth of R. solani were studied using transmission electron microscopy. On sclerotia produced in vitro, for all incubation periods (1 to 42 days), Microsphaeropsis sp. significantly reduced germination. Percent germination of sclerotia treated with Microsphaeropsis sp. decreased with increasing incubation period from an average of 82.0% after 1 day to stabilize at an average of 5.8% after 35 days. Similarly, percent germination of tuber-borne sclerotia was significantly lower when tubers were treated with Microsphaeropsis sp. Both 2% formaldehyde and Microsphaeropsis sp. treatments significantly reduced sclerotia germination to approximately 10% after 42 days of incubation at 4 degrees C. Furthermore, on tubers treated with the antagonist, the number of sclerotia per square centimeter decreased from 1.6 to 0.5 during the 8 months of storage at 4 degrees C, whereas an increase from 1.2 to 7.8 sclerotia per square centimeter was observed on untreated tubers. Microsphaeropsis sp. (strain P130A) colonized hyphae of R. solani within 4 days after contact on culture media. Transmission electron microscopic observations showed that the antagonist induced a rupture of the pathogen plasma membrane and that a chitin-enriched matrix was deposited at sites of potential antagonist penetration. Host penetration was not associated with pathogen cell wall alterations, which occurred at the time of progress of the antagonist in the pathogen cytoplasm. In the presence of a crude extract of Microsphaeropsis sp., cells of R. solani showed cytoplasm disorganization and breakdown of plasma membranes. Antibiosis and mycoparasitism were involved in the antagonism of R. solani by Microsphaeropsis sp., but the sequence by which these events occur, as well as the significance of wall appositions produced by R. solani, is yet to be established. 3ainfection 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apathogenicity 3abiological control 3aDeuteromycotina 3afungal antagonists 3aspore germination 3asclerotia 3aviability 3ahyphae 3adevelopmental stages 3aCanada 0asymptoms 0acell ultrastructure 0agrowth 0ainhibition 0ainteractions1 aEl Bassam, S.1 aBenhamou, N.0 tPhytopathology.g2001 Aug., v. 91, no. 8 p.782-791x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO.2001.91.8.7823Available from publisher's Web site  a20010929b20011005c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02814naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001500166245006000181300001300241500012400254500002400378500001500402520110300417650003201520650002301552650001601575650001401591650002401605650001301629650001601642650004101658650002301699650002601722650002301748650001501771650001401786650000901800650001301809650002401822650002301846650001701869650001301886650002201899653002301921653003101944653002001975773009101995852000902086856007202095930003302167945002502200946001102225655001202236IND4385917920221119161438.0061211e20061005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438591792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2006.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aL8101 aTruyen, U.10aEvolution of canine parvovirus--A need for new vaccines  ap. 9-13.  aIn the special issue: Canine and feline vaccination - a scientific re-appraisal / edited by J.M.

The most successful mutants, from an evolutionary perspective, appear to be selected by improved binding to the CPV receptor, the canine transferrin receptor, and by an extended host range, which for the newer antigenic types now includes both the dog and the cat. The new viruses also show antigenic differences that can be defined by binding of certain monoclonal antibodies; they also differ in their reactivity in virus neutralisation tests, using immune sera raised against the various antigenic types. These differences may influence the susceptibility of young animals to infection at the time when the level of maternally derived antibody decreases to the minimum protective titre. This minimum protective titre may vary depending on the infecting virus type. There is, however, a high degree of cross-protection between the virus types and the true relevance of the differences in neutralisation titer is currently not known. 3aCarnivore protoparvovirus 1 3adisease prevention 3avaccination 3areceptors 3aantigenic variation 3aimmunity 3atransferrin 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3abinding properties 3amonoclonal antibodies 3adisease resistance 3ahost range 3aevolution 3adogs 3amutation 3avaccine development 3amicrobial genetics 3adog diseases 3avaccines 3aemerging diseases 0aliterature reviews 0aFeline panleukopenia virus 0adisease control0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2006 Oct. 5, v. 117, no. 1 p.9-13dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2006.04.0033electronic resource  a20070308b20070402c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/02/20  aNon-US 7aarticle03426naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001600198245013200214300001600346520157500362650003101937650002301968650002601991650003002017650007102047650002402118650003302142650003102175650003002206650001702236650002102253650002402274650003102298650004502329650003302374650002202407650002102429650003202450650002702482650002602509650001602535650002802551700001702579700001402596700002402610773009602634852000902730856008502739945002502824946001102849655001202860IND4361959020221119161329.0040407e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436195902DNAL7 a146158542pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-003-1481-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The purified homogeneous preparation of native StFAE-A exhibited a molecular mass of 57.0 ± 1.5 kDa, with a mass of 33 ± 1 kDa on SDS-PAGE. The pI of the enzyme was estimated by cation-exchange chromatofocusing to be at pH 3.1. The enzyme activity was optimal at pH 6.0 and 55-60°C. The purified esterase was stable at the pH range 5.0-7.0. The enzyme retained 70% of activity after 7 h at 50°C and lost 50% of its activity after 45 min at 55°C and after 12 min at 60°C. Determination of k(cat)/K m revealed that the enzyme hydrolyzed methyl p-coumarate 2.5- and 12-fold more efficiently than methyl caffeate and methyl ferulate, respectively. No activity on methyl sinapinate was detected. The enzyme was active on substrates containing ferulic acid ester linked to the C-5 and C-2 linkages of arabinofuranose and it hydrolyzed 4-nitrophenyl 5-O-trans-feruloyl-α-L-arabinofuranoside (NPh-5-Fe-Araf) 2-fold more efficiently than NPh-2-Fe-Araf. Ferulic acid (FA) was efficiently released from destarched wheat bran when the esterase was incubated together with xylanase from S. thermophile (a maximum of 34% total ferulic acid released after 1 h incubation). StFAE-A by itself could release FA, but at a level almost 47-fold lower than that obtained in the presence of xylanase. The potential of StFAE-A for the synthesis of various phenolic acid esters was tested using a ternary water-organic mixture consisting of n-hexane, 1-butanol and water as a reaction system. 3aMyceliophthora thermophila 3athermophilic fungi 2a1-Butanolxmetabolism 2aCaffeic Acidsxmetabolism 2aCarboxylic Ester Hydrolasesxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aChromatography, Gel 2aChromatography, Ion Exchange 2aCoumaric Acidsxmetabolism 2aDietary Fiberxmetabolism 2aDimerization 2aEnzyme Stability 2aHexanesxmetabolism 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aHydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions 2aHydroxybenzoatesxmetabolism 2aIsoelectric Point 2aMolecular Weight 2aProtein Subunitsxchemistry 2aSporothrixxenzymology 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTemperature 2aXylosidasesxmetabolism1 aStamatis, H.1 aBiely, P.1 aChristakopoulos, P.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2004 Feb., v. 63, no. 6 p.686-690x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-003-1481-63Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdGHKe2004/04/09  aNon-US 7aarticle03367naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245011300205300001800318506007600336520161100412506003702023650001802060650002502078650001702103650001902120650001602139650002002155650001002175650001902185650002202204650000902226650003702235650001602272650002202288650002402310650003602334650003202370700001502402700001802417700001902435700001702454700002302471700002102494773017202515852000902687856008302696930003302779946001302812655001202825IND4391054920221207085712.0070506e20070501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439105492DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.06115891042doi7 aPMC18635052pmcid7 a174565982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaitra, Amarnath10aDistinct functional motifs within the IL-17 receptor regulate signal transduction and target gene expression  ap. 7506-7511.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIL-17 is the founding member of a novel family of proinflammatory cytokines that defines a new class of CD4⁺ effector T cells, termed "Th17." Mounting evidence suggests that IL-17 and Th17 cells cause pathology in autoimmunity, but little is known about mechanisms of IL-17RA signaling. IL-17 through its receptor (IL-17RA) activates genes typical of innate immune cytokines, such as TNFα and IL-1β, despite minimal sequence similarity in their respective receptors. A previous bioinformatics study predicted a subdomain in IL-17-family receptors with homology to a Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain, termed the "SEFIR domain." However, the SEFIR domain lacks motifs critical for bona fide TIR domains, and its functionality was never verified. Here, we used a reconstitution system in IL-17RA-null fibroblasts to map functional domains within IL-17RA. We demonstrate that the SEFIR domain mediates IL-17RA signaling independently of classic TIR adaptors, such as MyD88 and TRIF. Moreover, we identified a previously undescribed"TIR-like loop" (TILL) required for activation of NF-κB, MAPK, and up-regulation of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ. Mutagenesis of the TILL domain revealed a site analogous to the LPSd mutation in TLR4, which renders mice insensitive to LPS. However, a putative salt bridge typically found in TIR domains appears to be dispensable. We further identified a C-terminal domain required for activation of C/EBPβ and induction of a subset IL-17 target genes. This structure-function analysis of a IL-17 superfamily receptor reveals important differences in IL-17RA compared with IL-1/TLR receptors.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aautoimmunity 3abioinformatics 3afibroblasts 3agene expression 3agenes 3ainterleukin-17 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amutagenesis 3asequence homology 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aShen, Fang1 aHanel, Walter1 aMossman, Karen1 aTocker, Joel1 aSwart, D.q(David)1 aGaffen, Sarah L.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 May 1, v. 104, no. 18 p.7506-7511dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.06115891043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03039naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245009400203300001800297506007600315520124100391506003701632650002201669650002801691650001701719650001001736650001101746650001101757650001201768650001301780650001701793650003701810650001501847650002401862650002901886700001501915700001701930700001501947700001901962700002301981700002402004700001502028700001602043700001602059700002702075700002502102700002402127773017202151852000902323856008302332930003302415946001302448655001202461IND4391055720221207085708.0070506e20070501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439105572DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.06102991042doi7 aPMC18634892pmcid7 a174526412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSukhdeo, Kumar10aTargeting the β-catenin/TCF transcriptional complex in the treatment of multiple myeloma  ap. 7516-7521.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMultiple myeloma (MM) is an invariably fatal form of cancer characterized by clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is activated in MM cells through constitutively active β-catenin, a messenger molecule relevant to growth, survival, and migration of MM cells. The identification of a number of small molecular compounds, such as PKF115-584, which disrupt the interaction of the transcriptionally active β-catenin/TCF protein complex, provides valuable new therapeutic tools to target an alternative pathway in MM independent of the proteasome. Here we evaluated the transcriptional, proteomic, signaling changes, and biological sequelae associated with the inhibition of Wnt signaling in MM by PKF115-584. The compound blocks expression of Wnt target genes and induces cytotoxicity in both patient MM cells and MM cell lines without a significant effect in normal plasma cells. In xenograft models of human MM, PKF115-584 inhibits tumor growth and prolongs survival. Taken together, these data demonstrate the efficacy of disrupting the β-catenin/TCF transcriptional complex to exploit tumor dependence on Wnt signaling as a therapeutic approach in the treatment of MM.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abone marrow cells 3acomplications (disease) 3acytotoxicity 3agenes 3ahumans 3amodels 3amyeloma 3apatients 3aplasma cells 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aproteomics 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics)1 aMani, Mala1 aZhang, Yunyu1 aDutta, Jui1 aYasui, Hiroshi1 aRooney, Melissa D.1 aCarrasco, Daniel E.1 aZheng, Mei1 aHe, Haiying1 aTai, Yu-Tzu1 aMitsiades, Constantine1 aAnderson, Kenneth C.1 aCarrasco, Daniel R.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 May 1, v. 104, no. 18 p.7516-7521dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.06102991043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03598naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001900166245005000185300001400235500012400249500002400373500001500397520205000412650002502462650001302487650001802500650000902518650002302527650002002550650000902570650002502579650003702604650001302641650001602654650003102670650002002701653002702721653002302748653002002771653002902791653001802820773009202838852000902930856007202939930003303011945002503044946001103069655001203080IND4385918320221119161422.0061211e20061005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438591832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2006.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL830 0aL8101 aSaalmuller, A.10aNew understanding of immunological mechanisms  ap. 32-38.  aIn the special issue: Canine and feline vaccination - a scientific re-appraisal / edited by J.M. Rottier and D. Sutton.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe understanding and importance of antigen-specific immune responses after vaccination has completely changed in recent years. In the past, the focus for monitoring a vaccine-specific immune reaction was principally on the humoral branch of the immune system. The efficacy of vaccines, as assessed by the induction of protective immunity was mainly correlated with antibodies and antibody-titers. However, this correlation often failed and other parts of the immune system had also to be considered: namely, the innate immune system and the cellular branch of the antigen-specific immune system. With regard to vaccines, the innate immune system plays its main role in the effective activation of the antigen-specific immune response, in antigen-uptake and antigen-presentation. The dendritic cells (DCs) are the most important antigen presenting cells which present processed protein antigens (peptides) through MHC-molecules: MHC-class I, for the presentation of endogenous synthesised antigen; MHC-class II for exogenous antigen. Activation of DC leads to an enhanced production of cytokines and chemokines, to an up-regulation of co-stimulatory and activation molecules and also molecules for cell-cell interactions, e.g. interactions with cells of the antigen-specific immune system. T lymphocytes are the effector cells of the cellular branch of the antigen-specific immune system. They act either as MHC-class I-restricted cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) or as MHC-class II-restricted T-helper cells providing support for B lymphocytes (TH2) and the cellular part of the antigen-specific immune system (TH1). In order to achieve effective vaccination, the activation of all T-cell subpopulations is of advantage, but more important is the generation of antigen-specific memory T and B lymphocytes. In addition to these 'generic' immunological factors which are essential for the design of more efficacious vaccines, our detailed knowledge about feline and canine immune reactions after vaccination, which is still poor, has to be improved. 3aantigen presentation 3aantigens 3aT-lymphocytes 3acats 3adisease prevention 3adendritic cells 3adogs 3abiochemical pathways 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3apeptides 3avaccination 3aantigen-antibody reactions 3aanimal diseases 0acell-mediated immunity 0aliterature reviews 0adisease control 0aantigen-presenting cells 0aimmune system0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2006 Oct. 5, v. 117, no. 1 p.32-38dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2006.04.0073electronic resource  a20070308b20070402c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/02/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02440naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245010400123300001600227520157800243650002101821650002001842650001701862650001501879650001801894653001101912653000901923653001801932700001901950700001701969773007301986852000902059939003302068946001302101655001202114IND9101919820221119161315.0910424e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910191982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, L.10aHeritabilities of adjusted and unadjusted feed and abdominal fat traits in a broiler dam population  ap. 440-446.  aData from five generations of selected and control strains of a pedigreed synthetic broiler dam population were analyzed to estimate heritabilities for production traits. The population was composed of one selected strain with two replicates and one control in each generation. Eight production traits were measured. Growth rate traits included body weights at 28 (BW28) and 42 days (BW42) and weight gain (WG) during Days 28 to 42. Feed traits included feed consumption (PC) and feed efficiency (FE) during 28 to 42 days. Carcass traits included carcass weight (CWT), abdominal fat weight (AFW), and abdominal fat percentage (AFP) of carcass weight at 47 days. Realized heritability estimates for the two selected traits, BW28 and FE, were .32 and .14, respectively. Heritability estimates based on sire variance components were .38 for BW28, .41 for BW42, .30 for WG, .35 for PC, .16 for FE, .43 for CWT, .53 for AFW, and .53 for AFP. Heritability estimates for feed traits adjusted for BW28 and BW42 as covariates and AFW and AFP adjusted for 47-day CWT as a covariate were averaged after weighting. Heritabilities for adjusted FC, FE, AFW, and AFP were .27, .26, .48, and .49, respectively. When either FC or FE and either BW or WG are both being selected, the feed traits should be corrected for differences in growth rate during test. The need for adjustment is evident from the differences in heritability estimates for feed traits before and after correction for growth differences as well as the absence of correlation between adjusted feed traits and growth rate. 3abroiler chickens 3afeed conversion 3aheritability 3aestimation 3aabdominal fat 0agrowth 0adams 0abroiler lines1 aChambers, J.R.1 aMcMillan, I.0 tPoultry science.g1991 Mar., v. 70, no. 3 p.440-446x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02357naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001700198245007200215300001600287520089300303650002101196650002201217650002501239650002001264650002001284650005501304650003001359650002301389650003001412650004101442650003301483650003401516650003401550650005201584700001701636700002001653773009601673852000901769856008501778945002501863946001101888655001201899IND4361651820221119161540.0040317e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436165182DNAL7 a145955252pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-003-1466-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In order to expand the range of available enzymes, we have examined the presence of feruoyl esterase genes present in the genome sequence of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. We have identified an orphan gene (contig 3.544), the translation of which shows sequence identity with known feruloyl esterases. This gene was cloned and the corresponding recombinant protein expressed in Pichia pastoris to confirm that the enzyme (NcFaeD-3.544) exhibits feruloyl esterase activity. Unusually the enzyme was capable of p-coumaric acid release from untreated crude plant cell wall materials. The substrate utilisation preferences of the recombinant enzyme place it in the recently recognised type-D sub-class of feruloyl esterase. 3astructural genes 3asequence analysis 3arecombinant proteins 3agene expression 3aenzyme activity 2aCarboxylic Ester Hydrolasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEdible Grainxmetabolism. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDietary Fiberxmetabolism 2aGenes, Fungalxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aHydroxybenzoatesxmetabolism 2aNeurospora crassaxenzymology 2aPichiaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxmetabolism.1 aFaulds, C.B.1 aConnerton, I.F.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2004 Feb., v. 63, no. 5 p.567-570x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-003-1466-53Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdNZMe2004/03/26  aNon-US 7aarticle03139naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164100001500181245008800196300001600284520186500300650001002165650002902175650001802204650003502222650002502257650001602282650002702298650002602325650001702351650002202368650004102390700001402431700001302445773009602458852000902554856008502563930003302648945002502681946001102706655001202717IND4362583620221119161209.0040519e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436258362DNAL7 a149636142pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-003-1504-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHolker, U.10aBiotechnological advantages of laboratory-scale solid-state fermentation with fungi  ap. 175-186.  aDespite the increasing number of publications dealing with solid-state (substrate) fermentation (SSF) it is very difficult to draw general conclusion from the data presented. This is due to the lack of proper standardisation that would allow objective comparison with other processes. Research work has so far focused on the general applicability of SSF for the production of enzymes, metabolites and spores, in that many different solid substrates (agricultural waste) have been combined with many different fungi and the productivity of each fermentation reported. On a gram bench-scale SSF appears to be superior to submerged fermentation technology (SmF) in several aspects. However, SSF up-scaling, necessary for use on an industrial scale, raises severe engineering problems due to the build-up of temperature, pH, O2, substrate and moisture gradients. Hence, most published reviews also focus on progress towards industrial engineering. The role of the physiological and genetic properties of the microorganisms used during growth on solid substrates compared with aqueous solutions has so far been all but neglected, despite the fact that it may be the microbiology that makes SSF advantageous against the SmF biotechnology. This review will focus on research work allowing comparison of the specific biological particulars of enzyme, metabolite and/or spore production in SSF and in SmF. In these respects, SSF appears to possess several biotechnological advantages, though at present on a laboratory scale only, such as higher fermentation productivity, higher end-concentration of products, higher product stability, lower catabolic repression, cultivation of microorganisms specialized for water-insoluble substrates or mixed cultivation of various fungi, and last but not least, lower demand on sterility due to the low water activity used in SSF. 3afungi 3asolid state fermentation 3abiotechnology 2aAspergillus oryzaexmetabolism 2aBacteriaxmetabolism 2aBioreactors 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aEnzymesxbiosynthesis 2aFermentation 2aFungixmetabolism 2aSpores, Fungalxgrowth & development1 aHofer, M.1 aLenz, J.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2004 Apr., v. 64, no. 2 p.175-186x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-003-1504-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20040525b00000000c00000000  aINDdGHKe2004/05/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02051naa a2200469 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097024002200115040001800137100002400155245005900179300001600238500012900254520068300383650001701066650001301083650001001096650002301106650001601129650001901145650002201164650002401186650001201210650002201222650002401244650002201268650000901290650002401299650001701323650001001340651001801350653002301368653004001391773007501431852000901506939003301515945000801548946001301556655001201569991567921110742620221119161333.0841212e198407  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840061112DNAL7 a64314832pmid7 aPMC14246092pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCutcheon, John W.10aNitrosamines in bacon: A case study of balancing risks  ap. 360-364.  aBased on a paper presented at the Second Binational Symposium: United States-Israel, held October 17-19, 1983, Bethesda, MD.  aA brief literature review examines the historical concerns of nitrosamines in foods, their potential association with added nitrate in cured meat products, the USDA nitrosamine monitoring program for bacon, and current considerations for lowering added nitrate levels in meat products.

Compared with heavier infants, infants with birth weights of 500-2,499 grams (g) are at increased risk of both neonatal and postneonatal death for virtually all causes. Sixty-two percent of neonatal deaths (under 28 days of life) were attributed to "conditions arising in the perinatal period," as defined using codesfrom the International Classification of Diseases. Prematurity-low birth weight and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) were the leading causes of such deaths among infants with birth weights of 500-2,499 g, while birth trauma-hypoxia-asphyxia and other perinatal respiratory conditions were the leading causes among heavier infants. For all birth weight groups, congenital anomalies were the second leading cause, representing 27 percent of neonatal deaths. Although perinatal conditions caused nearly one-third of postneonatal deaths (28 days to under 1 year of life) among infants with birth weights of 500-1,499 g, for the other birth weight groups these conditions were much less important; predominant causes of postneonatal death were sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), congenital anomalies, infections, and injuries. Black infants had a roughly twofold higher risk of neonatal and postneonatal death than did white infants for all causes except congenital anomalies, which occurred with almost equal frequency in blacks and whites. However, for infants with birth weights of 500-2,499 g, blacks had lower risks of neonatal death from RDS and congenital anomalies. Between 1960 (the latest year for which national birth weight-specific mortality statistics had been available) and 1980, SIDS emerged as a major diagnostic rubric. Otherwise, except for infections and congenital anomalies among infants with birth weights of 500-1,499 g, all causes of death declined in frequency among all birth weight groups.(author) 3arisk 3anational surveys 3aWhites 3aBlacks 3ainfant mortality 3abirth weight 2aBlack People. 2aBirth Weight 2aWhite People. 2aHealth Surveys 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant Mortality 2aInfant, Newborn 2aInfant, Newborn, Diseasesxmortality 3aUnited States 0aUnited States 0abody weight1 aStrauss, L.T.1 aHogue, C.J.R.1 aSmith, J.C.0 tPublic health reports.g1987 , v. 102, no. 2 p.162-171x0090-28187nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880308c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02981naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001500198245016400213300001600377520113600393650002401529650001901553650002201572650001801594650002301612650001701635650003401652650002601686650002701712650003501739650003801774650004101812650003701853650002701890650003501917650003101952650004401983650005302027650003502080650001502115650001502130700001702145700001702162700002202179773009602201852000902297856008502306945002502391946001102416655001202427IND4362215020221119161218.0040422e200403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436221502DNAL7 a128114262pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-003-1368-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAranda, E.10aContribution of hydrolytic enzymes produced by saprophytic fungi to the decrease in plant toxicity caused by water-soluble substances in olive mill dry residue  ap. 132-135.  aWe studied the influence of saprophytic fungi on the toxic effect that the water-soluble substances in dry residues from olive (ADOR) have on the growth of plants. All saprophytic fungi were able to decrease the phytotoxicity of ADOR, although the toxicity of this residue did not decrease in the same way. Penicillium chrysogenum was able to reduce the toxicity of ADOR when this residue was applied at the highest dose of 15%. Fusarium lateritum, F. graminearum and Mucor racemosus were able to reduce the toxicity of ADOR when this residue was applied at the intermediate doses. However, F. oxysporum decreased the phytotoxicity of ADOR only when the residue was applied at the lowest dose of 2.5%. All saprophytic fungi tested produce endoglucanase, endopolymetylgalacturonase and endoxiloglucanase when grown in the presence of ADOR. A close relationship was found between the decrease in the phytotoxicity of ADOR and the amount of hydrolytic enzymes produced by the saprophytic fungi. These results shows that hydrolytic enzymes can be important in the degradation of phytotoxic substances present in olive mill dry residue. 3aprocessing residues 3aplant residues 3awaste utilization 3aphytotoxicity 3aphenolic compounds 3aplant growth 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aCellulasexmetabolism 2aFood Industryxmethods 2aFungixenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aFusariumxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aGlycoproteinsxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxmetabolism 2aHydrolasesxmetabolism 2aMucorxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aOleaxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aOligosaccharidesxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aPenicillium chrysogenumxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aPhenolsxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aPlant Oils 2aSolubility1 aSampedro, I.1 aOcampo, J.A.1 aGarcia-Romera, I.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2004 Mar., v. 64, no. 1 p.132-135x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-003-1368-63Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdGHKe2004/04/28  aNon-US 7aarticle01470naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100002000117245004500137300001200182500001500194520062600209650002000835650003100855650002000886653001500906653002700921653003000948653002500978653002801003773007501031852000901106939003301115945000801148655001201156991567920220742620221119161522.0770501e197702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7794417482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirby, Peter G.10aHow to make different kinds of decisions  ap. 2-8.  a2019-12-06  aDifferent types of managerial decisions are defined and a framework developed to categorize them.

  1 aLudwig, R.10aCharacterisation of cellobiose dehydrogenases from the white-rot fungi Trametes pubescens and Trametes villosa  ap. 213-222.  aCellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) is an extracellular haemoflavoenzyme that is produced by a number of wood-degrading and phytopathogenic fungi and it has a proposed role in the early events of lignocellulose degradation and wood colonisation. In the presence of a suitable electron acceptor, e.g. 2,6-dichloro-indophenol, cytochrome c, or metal ions, CDH oxidises cellobiose to cellobionolactone. When screening 11 different Trametes spp. for the formation of CDH activity, all the strains investigated were found to secrete significant amounts of CDH when cultivated on a cellulose-containing medium. Amongst others, Trametes pubescens and Trametes villosa were identified as excellent, not-yet-described, producer strains of this enzyme activity that has various potential applications in biotechnology. CDH from both strains was purified to apparent homogeneity and subsequently characterised. Both monomeric enzymes have a molecular mass of approximately 90 kDa (gel filtration) and a pI value of 4.2-4.4. The best substrates are cellobiose and cellooligosaccharides; additionally, lactose, thiocellobiose, and xylobiose are efficiently oxidised. Glucose and maltose are poor substrates. The preferred substrate is cellobiose with a K(m) value of 0.21 mM and a k(cat) value of 22 s-1 for CDH from T. pubescens; the corresponding values for the T. villosa enzyme are 0.21 mM and 24 s-1, respectively. Both enzymes showed very high activity with one-electron acceptors such as ferricenium, ferricyanide, or the azino-bis-(3-ethyl-benzthiazolin-6-sulfonic acid) cation radical. 3aTrametes 3awhite-rot fungi 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aalcohol oxidoreductases 2a2,6-Dichloroindophenolxmetabolism 2aBioreactors 2aCarbohydrate Dehydrogenasesxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aCellobiosexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aCellulosexmetabolism 2aChromatography, Gel 2aChromatography, Ion Exchange 2aCytochromes cxchemistry 2aDisaccharidesxmetabolism 2aElectron Transport 2aFerricyanidesxmetabolism 2aFerrous Compoundsxmetabolism 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aIsoelectric Point 2aLactosexmetabolism 2aMaltosexmetabolism 2aMolecular Weight 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPolyporalesxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aThioglycosidesxmetabolism 0aTrametes pubescens 0aTrametes villosa 0acellobiose dehydrogenase1 aSalamon, A.1 aVarga, J.1 aZamocky, M.1 aPeterbauer, C.K.1 aKulbe, K.D.1 aHaltrich, D.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2004 Apr., v. 64, no. 2 p.213-222x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-003-1501-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20040525b00000000c00000000  aINDdGHKe2004/05/25  aNon-US 7aarticle01257naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100001900117245003900136300001400175520056200189650001000751650001100761650001200772650001300784653003000797653002500827773007700852852000900929939003300938945000800971655001200979991567917610742620221119161428.0781101e197807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7894839152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarcus, Jay B.10aTranscendental meditation (Part 2)  ap. 33-39.  aExtraordinary findings regarding brain wave activity, creativity, and transcendental meditation (TM) are reported.

This was carried out to identify the sites at which N assimilation is acting to regulate carbon metabolism. Over 120 seconds following NH4+ addition we found that: (a) N accumulated in glutamine while glutamate and alpha-ketoglutarate levels fell; (b) ATP levels declined within 5 seconds and recovered within 30 seconds of NH4+ addition; (c) ratios of pyruvate/phosphoenolpyruvate, malate/phosphoenolpyruvate, Glc-1-P/Glc-6-P and Fru- 1,6-bisphosphate/Fru-6-P increased; and (d) as previously seen, photosynthetic carbon fixation was inhibited. Further, we monitored starch degradation during N assimilation over a longer time course and found that starch breakdown occurred at a rate of about 110 micromoles glucose per milligram chlorophyll per hour. The results are consistent with N assimilation occurring through glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase at the expense of carbon previously stored as starch. They also indicate that regulation of several enzymes is involved in the shift in metabolsim from photosynthetic carbon assimilation to carbohydrate oxidation during N assimilation. It seems likely that pyruvate kinase, phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxylase, and starch degradation are all activated, whereas key Calvin cycle enzyme(s) are inactivated within seconds of NH4+ additon to N-limited S. minutum cells. The rapid changes in glutamate and triose phosphate, recently shown to be regulators of cytosolic pyruvate kinase, are consistent with them contributing to the short-term activation of this enzyme. 3aammonia 3ametabolism 3aChlorophyta 3ametabolites 3alight 3aOntario 0aChlorophycota 0anitrogen assimilation 0alight relations1 aVanlerberghe, G.C.1 aStitt, M.1 aTurpin, D.H.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 Oct., v. 91, no. 2 p.749-755x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01312naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100002100117245003800138300001400176500001500190520050500205650002000710650003100730650001500761653001900776653003500795653003000830653002300860773007700883852000900960939003300969945000801002655001201010991567917350742620221119161532.0780801e197804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7894832322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVavra, Sandra A.10aTreat your employees as customers  ap. 16-21.  a2019-12-06  aFigures are cited to illustrate in monetary terms the average investment loss per customer in a savings and loan association and the investment loss on each new employee who leaves or is terminated at the end of one year.

The excision repair RAD1 gene is partially required for the expression on the hpr1 phenotype. The simplest hypothesis to account for some of the hpr1 stimulated recombination events is that a heteroduplex DNA intermediate and localized gene conversion are involved. hpr1 stimulated crossover events are independent on intrachromosomal gene conversion events stimulated by the hyper-gene conversion mutation hpr5. This result suggests that different intrachromosomal recombination processes are affected in each mutant strain. We propose that HPR1 may function to inhibit intrachromatid crossovers. 3aDNA 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3achromosome mapping 3amutants 3agenetic recombination 2aCrossing Over, Genetic 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aGene Conversion 2aGenes, Fungal 2aMeiosis 2aMitosis 2aMutation 2aNucleic Acid Heteroduplexesxgenetics 2aPlasmids 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 0agenetic techniques and protocols1 aKlein, H.L.0 tGenetics.g1989 July, v. 122, no. 3 p.503-517x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01069naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001400115242006100129245006500190300001600255500002400271520018100295650001400476650002400490651003700514653003200551773013500583852000900718939003300727945000800760946001100768655001200779991567915710742620221119161247.0830131e198111  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aPAR830008902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamey, B.10aTwo cases of primary amebic meningoencephalitis in Zaire10aDeux cas de meningo-encephalite amibienne primitive au Zaire  ap. 675-676.  aSummary in English.  aprimary amoebic meningoencephalitis, human, 2 case reports, fatal illnesses as miconazole therapy was not effective, probably infected while bathing in small rural ponds: Zaire 3aamebiasis 3ameningoencephalitis 3aDemocratic Republic of the Congo 0aDisease transmission, Water0 tMedecine Tropicale.

Classification of 163 isolates for four putative isozyme systems, a colony color dimorphism and 20 ribosomal DNA restriction fragment length variants revealed 49 different multilocus phenotypes (haplotypes). The six most common haplotypes differed significantly in pathogenicity. Genetic analyses of the data indicated that effective population sizes of the fungus were very large, that the effects of genetic drift were small, and that negligible recombination occurred in the populations studied. Frequency dependent selection was suggested as an explanation for the maintenance of variation in pathogenicity in the fungus. 3aHordeum vulgare 3aRhynchosporium secalis 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aalleles 3apathogenicity 3adisease resistance 3afungal diseases of plants 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aGene Frequency 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenetic Variation 2aIsoenzymesxgenetics 2aMitosporic Fungixenzymologyxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aPigmentationxgenetics 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aSelection, Genetic1 aMcDonald, B.A.1 aAllard, R.W.1 aWebster, R.K.0 tGenetics.g1989 July, v. 122, no. 3 p.561-565x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02926naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148100001500166245013700181300001600318520168300334650001902017650001602036650001802052650001402070650002502084650001302109650001902122650001302141650002902154653002302183653002802206700001402234700001502248700001402263773007202277852000902349856008702358930003302445945001302478946001302491655001202504IND2328230320221119161538.0020725e200202  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232823032DNAL7 a189430882pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO.2002.92.2.1562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoon, J.Y.10aGenome structure and production of biologically active in vitro transcripts of cucurbit-infecting Zucchini green mottle mosaic virus  ap. 156-163.  aThe complete nucleotide sequence of the Zucchini green mottle mosaic virus (ZGMMV), a new member of the genus Tobamovirus, has been determined. The genome of ZGMMV is 6,513 nucleotides long and contains four open reading frames coding for proteins of 131, 189, 28, and 17 kDa from the 5' to 3' end, respectively. The 5'- and 3'-nontranslated regions consist of 59 and 163 residues, respectively. The sequences of the viral proteins exhibit high identity to the proteins of the members of the genus Tobamovirus and are distinct from other viruses within the subgroup of cucurbit-infecting tobamoviruses. Results from phylogenetic trees of the coding regions demonstrated that ZGMMV is a very close relative of Kyuri green mottle mosaic virus and Cucumber fruit mottle mosaic virus and is less similar to Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus. Full-length cDNA of ZGMMV was directly amplified by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the 5'-end primer containing a T7 RNA promoter sequence and 3'-end primer. Capped in vitro transcript from the RT-PCR products was infectious on zucchini squash, cucumber, and Nicotiana benthamiana plants. This cell-free system to produce infectious transcripts from uncloned cDNA copies is useful for quick assessment of infectivity of transcripts from plant RNA viruses prior to cloning. Synthesized capped transcript from a full-length cDNA clone of the virus was highly infectious. Progeny virus derived from infectious transcripts had the same biological and biochemical properties as wild-type virus. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a biologically active transcript from a cucurbit-infecting tobamovirus. 3aCucurbita pepo 3aTobamovirus 3apathogenicity 3ainfection 3anucleotide sequences 3ataxonomy 3aclassification 3agenomics 3atranscription (genetics) 0agenetic regulation 0amolecular sequence data1 aMin, B.E.1 aChoi, J.K.1 aRyu, K.H.0 tPhytopathology.g2002 Feb., v. 92, no. 2 p.156-163x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO.2002.92.2.1563Available from publisher's Web site  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02669naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245013100206300001800337506007600355520144600431506003701877650001501914650001701929650003901946650001601985700001802001773017402019852000902193856008302202930003302285946001302318655001202331IND4390041020221207092214.0070402e20070327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439004102DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.06101411042doi7 aPMC18384932pmcid7 a173747212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakeuchi, Satoshi14aThe answer to concerted versus step-wise controversy for the double proton transfer mechanism of 7-azaindole dimer in solution  ap. 5285-5290.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe dynamics and mechanism of the double proton transfer reaction of the 7-azaindole dimer was investigated in solution by excitation wavelength dependence in steady-state and femtosecond time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. Femtosecond measurements in the UV region revealed that the dynamics of the dimer fluorescence exhibits remarkable change as the excitation wavelength was scanned from 280 to 313 nm. The fluorescence showed a biexponential decay (0.2 and 1.1 ps) with 280-nm excitation, whereas it exhibited a single exponential decay (1.1 ps) with 313-nm excitation (the red-edge of the dimer absorption). This observation clearly indicates that the 0.2-ps component is irrelevant to the proton transfer. In the visible region, we found that the tautomer fluorescence rises in accordance with the decay of the dimer fluorescence with a common time constant of 1.1 ps. This finding unambiguously denies the appearance of any intermediate species in between the dimer and tautomer excited states, indicating that the double proton transfer reaction is essentially a single-step process. We conclude that the double proton transfer of the 7-azaindole dimer in solution proceeds in the concerted manner from the lowest excited state with the 1.1-ps time constant. On the basis of the experimental data obtained, we discuss the long-lasting concerted versus step-wise controversy for the double proton transfer mechanism in solution.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3awavelengths1 aTahara, Tahei0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Mar. 27, v. 104, no. 13 p.5285-5290dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.06101411043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070402b20070502c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03044naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245007300201300001800274506007600292520149900368506003701867650001401904650001501918650002601933650001901959650002001978650001801998650001102016650001702027650001102044650002502055650001402080650001102094700002002105700002802125700001702153700002202170700002702192700001902219773017402238852000902412856008302421930003302504946001302537655001202550IND4390040720221207092217.0070402e20070327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439004072DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.06072541042doi7 aPMC18289422pmcid7 a173747242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerr, Amy E.10aMicrofluidic immunoassays as rapid saliva-based clinical diagnostics  ap. 5268-5273.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAt present, point-of-care (POC) diagnostics typically provide a binary indication of health status (e.g., home pregnancy test strip). Before anticipatory use of diagnostics for assessment of complex diseases becomes widespread, development of sophisticated bioassays capable of quantitatively measuring disease biomarkers is necessary. Successful translation of new bioassays into clinical settings demands the ability to monitor both the onset and progression of disease. Here we report on a clinical POC diagnostic that enables rapid quantitation of an oral disease biomarker in human saliva by using a monolithic disposable cartridge designed to operate in a compact analytical instrument. Our microfluidic method facilitates hands-free saliva analysis by integrating sample pretreatment (filtering, enrichment, mixing) with electrophoretic immunoassays to quickly measure analyte concentrations in minimally pretreated saliva samples. Using 20 μl of saliva, we demonstrate rapid (<10 min) measurement of the collagen-cleaving enzyme matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) in saliva from healthy and periodontally diseased subjects. In addition to physiologically measurable indicators of periodontal disease, conventional measurements of salivary MMP-8 were used to validate the microfluidic assays described in this proof-of-principle study. The microchip-based POC diagnostic demonstrated is applicable to rapid, reliable measurement of proteinaceous disease biomarkers in biological fluids.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioassays 3abiomarkers 3adiagnostic techniques 3adisease course 3aelectrophoresis 3ahealth status 3ahumans 3aimmunoassays 3amixing 3aperiodontal diseases 3apregnancy 3asaliva1 aHatch, Anson V.1 aThrockmorton, Daniel J.1 aTran, Huu M.1 aBrennan, James S.1 aGiannobile, William V.1 aSingh, Anup K.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Mar. 27, v. 104, no. 13 p.5268-5273dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.06072541043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070402b20070502c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04135naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165072000900174100001900183245012500202300001800327500002400345520192900369650002002298650002302318650002502341650002002366650001202386650002402398650002402422650002102446650001902467650001802486650001302504650002302517650001902540650002302559650001202582650007502594650001102669650002302680650001502703650006002718650002702778650001702805650003002822650000902852650001702861650003602878650005102914650002202965650002802987650005103015700001603066700001803082700001803100773016203118852000903280856007703289930003303366945002503399946001303424655001203437IND4418175820221119161727.0090324e20090311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441817582DNAL7 a192165522pmid7 a10.1021/jf802936c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX380 0aQ5041 aTsai, Tsung-Yu10aAtherosclerosis-Preventing Activity of Lactic Acid Bacteria-Fermented Milk-Soymilk Supplemented with Momordica charantia  ap. 2065-2071.  aIncludes references  aIn this study, the milk-soymilk and milk-soymilk supplemented with Momordica charantia, a common oriental vegetable possessing medicinal activities, were fermented by lactic bacteria. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of milk-soymilk and fermented milk-soymilk with or without M. charantia on atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic hamsters. Fermented 25% milk and 75% soymilk combinations, supplemented with 1% M. charantia solution, can improve the acceptability of the fermented beverage. A total of 72 male Golden Syrian hamsters were divided into 9 groups (n = 8/group), and experimental diets were provided with a normal diet for the normal group and a high-cholesterol diet for others. The milk-soymilk and fermented milk-soymilk with or without M. charantia were administrated for 8 weeks. The milk-soymilk and fermented milk-soymilk with and without M. charantia were able to significantly decrease (p < 0.05) the serum cholesterol and the atherosclerotic plaque in aorta based on the comparison to the high-cholesterol diet (H) group. The groups on fermented milk-soymilk by Lactobacillus plantarum NTU 102 with or without M. charantia could significantly decrease (p < 0.05) the ratio of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The femented milk-soymilk by Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei NTU 101 supplemented with M. charantia had an anti-atherosclerotic activity by increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant status (TAS) activity of the blood and relieving the degree of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) compared to the other treatments. It is concluded that the milk-soymilk and the fermented milk-soymilk supplemented with or without M. charantia by L. paracasei subsp. paracasei NTU 101 are effective in preventing and retarding the hyperlipidemia-induced oxidative stress and atherosclerosis. 3aatherosclerosis 3adisease prevention 3alactic acid bacteria 3afermented foods 3asoymilk 3adietary supplements 3aMomordica charantia 3amedicinal plants 3ahyperlipidemia 3aanimal models 3ahamsters 3aexperimental diets 3alipemic effect 3asensory properties 2aAnimals 2aAtherosclerosisxchemically inducedxmetabolismxprevention & control. 2aCattle 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCricetinae 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aFermentation 2aLactobacillusxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMesocricetus 2aMilkxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aMomordica charantiaxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aRandom Allocation 2aSoy Foodsxmicrobiology 2aSoy Milkxadministration & dosagexmetabolism.1 aChu, Li-Han1 aLee, Chun-Lin1 aPan, Tzu-Ming0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2009 Mar. 11, v. 57, no. 5 p.2065-2071dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf802936c3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090622b20090703c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/05/25  aOther US 7aarticle03075naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001500165245014200180300001400322500001500336520138600351650002301737650002101760650002201781650002901803650002501832650002501857650002601882650001001908650002701918650001201945650003401957650003001991650002002021650001402041651001002055653001202065653001202077653002802089653001702117653003802134700001702172700001402189700001802203700001702221700001702238700001802255773007002273852000902343856008602352930003302438945001302471946001302484655001202497IND2327469920221119161226.0020610e200201  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232746992DNAL7 a189441422pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO.2002.92.1.752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOshima, M.12aA point mutation in the two-component histidine kinase BcOS-1 gene confers dicarboximide resistance in field isolates of Botrytis cinerea  ap. 75-80.  a2019-12-04  aPartial DNA fragments of Botrytis cinerea field isolates encoding the putative osmosensor histidine kinase gene (BcOS1) were cloned by polymerase chain reaction amplification and the predicted amino acid sequences were compared between dicarboximide-sensitive and resistant field isolates. The predicted BcOS1p is highly homologous to osmosensor histidine kinase OS1p from Neurospora crassa including the N-terminal six tandem repeats of approximately 90 amino acids. Four dicarboximide-resistant isolates of B. cinerea (Bc-19, Bc-45, Bc-682, and Bc-RKR) contained a single base pair mutation in their BcOS1 gene that resulted in an amino acid substitution in the predicted protein. In these resistant isolates, codon 86 of the second repeat, which encodes an isoleucine residue in sensitive strains, was converted to a codon for serine. The mutation of Botrytis field resistant isolates was located on the second unit of tandem amino acid repeats of BcOS1p, whereas the point mutations of the fifth repeat of OS1p confer resistance to both dicarboximides and phenylpyrroles and also osmotic sensitivity in Neurospora crassa. These results suggest that an amino acid substitution within the second repeat of BcOS1p is responsible for phenotypes of field resistant isolates (resistant to dicarboximides but sensitive to phenylpyrroles, and normal osmotic sensitivity) in B. cinerea. 3agenetic resistance 3aBotrytis cinerea 3agenetic variation 3adicarboximide fungicides 3aamino acid sequences 3afungicide resistance 3aresistance mechanisms 3agenes 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3amutants 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3aenzyme activity 3ahistidine 3aJapan 0akinases 0acloning 0amolecular sequence data 0atransduction 0atwo-component signal transduction1 aFujimura, M.1 aBanno, S.1 aHashimoto, C.1 aMotoyama, T.1 aIchiishi, A.1 aYamaguchi, I.0 tPhytopathology.g2002 Jan., v. 92, no. 1 p.75-80x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO.2002.92.1.753Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdPNN  aOther US 7aarticle01990naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009300126300001600219500001500235520105500250650002701305650003101332650002401363650002401387653002501411653001301436653001101449653001801460653001101478700001601489773006901505852000901574930003301583945001301616946001101629655001201640IND2180694820221119161538.0981028e199803  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218069482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaitt, D.E.10aGenetic and phenotypic correlations in plants: a botanical test of Cheverud's conjecture  ap. 310-319.  a2019-12-05  aA survey of the agricultural and evolutionary literature was undertaken to determine the extent to which phenotypic correlations reflect their genetic counterparts in plants. More than 4000 phenotypic and genetic correlations representing 27 different plant species and over 40 years of research were analysed. In 74 per cent of the comparisons, the arrangement of elements of different magnitudes in genetic and phenotypic correlation matrices was more simi1ar than would be expected by chance alone. In addition, the overall magnitude of correlation was greater in genetic correlation matrices than in phenotypic correlation matrices in 85 per cent of the comparisons. Several studies which reported correlations within and among distinct suites of traits provided the opportunity to evaluate correlations among functionally or developmentally related characters. It was determined from these studies that traits belonging to the same suite of characters were more highly genetically and phenotypically correlated than traits from different suites. 3aphenotypic correlation 3amathematics and statistics 3agenetic correlation 3aquantitative traits 0acorrelation matrices 0amatrices 0aplants 0arelationships 0atheory1 aLevin, D.A.0 tHeredity.g1998 Mar., v. 80, no. pt.3 p.310-319x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03202naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245010900200300001800309500002400327506007600351520168400427506003702111650002502148650002902173650001602202650002802218650001002246650001802256650001102274650002102285650001302306650000702319650001202326650002202338650001102360700001902371700003002390700002302420700002202443700003002465773013602495852000902631856008002640655001202720IND4415968320221207083117.0090206e20090215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441596832DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02061-082doi7 aPMC26435592pmcid7 a190883192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinde, Dolores10aMolecular and Biochemical Characterization of a β-Fructofuranosidase from Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous  ap. 1065-1073.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAn extracellular β-fructofuranosidase from the yeast Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous was characterized biochemically, molecularly, and phylogenetically. This enzyme is a glycoprotein with an estimated molecular mass of 160 kDa, of which the N-linked carbohydrate accounts for 60% of the total mass. It displays optimum activity at pH 5.0 to 6.5, and its thermophilicity (with maximum activity at 65 to 70°C) and thermostability (with a T₅₀ in the range 66 to 71°C) is higher than that exhibited by most yeast invertases. The enzyme was able to hydrolyze fructosyl-β-(2[rightward arrow]1)-linked carbohydrates such as sucrose, 1-kestose, or nystose, although its catalytic efficiency, defined by the kcat/Km ratio, indicates that it hydrolyzes sucrose approximately 4.2 times more efficiently than 1-kestose. Unlike other microbial β-fructofuranosidases, the enzyme from X. dendrorhous produces neokestose as the main transglycosylation product, a potentially novel bifidogenic trisaccharide. Using a 41% (wt/vol) sucrose solution, the maximum fructooligosaccharide concentration reached was 65.9 g liter⁻¹. In addition, we isolated and sequenced the X. dendrorhous β-fructofuranosidase gene (Xd-INV), showing that it encodes a putative mature polypeptide of 595 amino acids and that it shares significant identity with other fungal, yeast, and plant β-fructofuranosidases, all members of family 32 of the glycosyl-hydrolases. We demonstrate that the Xd-INV could functionally complement the suc2 mutation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and, finally, a structural model of the new enzyme based on the homologous invertase from Arabidopsis thaliana has also been obtained.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aamino acids 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3agenes 3aglycoproteins 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3amutation 3apH 3asucrose 3athermal stability 3ayeasts1 aMacias, Isabel1 aFernández-Arrojo, Lucía1 aPlou, Francisco J.1 aJimenez, Antonio.1 aFernández-Lobato, María0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2009 Feb. 15, v. 75, no. 4 p.1065-1073dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02061-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02945naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165100002000174245019400194300001600388500002400404520085600428650000901284650002301293650003001316650001301346650002401359650002001383650002101403650002701424650002001451650003101471650006301502650001201565650003801577650005101615650002101666650001101687650004101698650000901739650003801748650001901786650004401805653001501849653002401864653001501888653004201903700002501945700002801970700002001998700002002018700001902038773008602057852000902143856008602152930003302238945002502271946001102296655001202307IND4418177920221119161524.0090324e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441817792DNAL7 a182948772pmid7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2007.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8101 aLeemans, Jerome12aA pilot study comparing the antispasmodic effects of inhaled salmeterol, salbutamol and ipratropium bromide using different aerosol devices on muscarinic bronchoconstriction in healthy cats  ap. 236-245.  aIncludes references  aThis study compared the duration and magnitude of the antispasmodic effects of salmeterol (SLM), salbutamol (SAL), ipratropium bromide (IB) and the combination of SAL and IB (SAL/IB) against carbachol-induced bronchoconstriction in healthy cats, and investigated the gain in efficacy using a two or fourfold increase in drug dosages.

Values of Q were obtained for Phytophthora infestans sporangia released from an area source of diseased plants in a potato canopy by comparing the concentrations of airborne sporangia measured at several heights above the source, with the concentrations predicted by a Lagrangian Stochastic simulation model. An independent estimate of Q was obtained by quantifying the number of sporangia per unit area of source at the beginning of each sampling day by harvesting diseased plant tissue and enumerating sporangia from these samples. This standing spore crop was the potential number of sporangia released per area of source during the day. The standing spore crop was apportioned into time segments corresponding to sporangia concentration measurement periods using the time trace of sporangia sampled above the source by a Burkard continuous suction spore sampler. This apportionment of the standing spore crop yielded potential release rates that were compared with modeled release rates. The two independent estimates of Q were highly correlated (P = 0.003), indicating that the model has utility for predicting release rates for P. infestans sporangia and the spread of disease between fields. 3asimulation models 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aquantitative analysis 3asporangia 3acanopy 3aspore dispersal 3aequations 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aPhytophthora infestans 3aprobability analysis 3adisease control 3adiurnal variation 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aclimatic factors 3ainoculum 3aNew York 0aatmospheric spore transport 0adisease forecasting 0asources 0amathematical models 0aairborne infection 0aetiology 0aforecasting1 aFry, W.E.1 aMayton, H.1 aAndrade-Piedra, J.L.0 tPhytopathology.g2001 Dec., v. 91, no. 12 p.1189-1196x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO.2001.91.12.11893Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdPNN  aOther US 7aarticle02336naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245012200148300001600270520133200286650002201618650001001640650001201650650001301662650001301675650001801688650001301706650001401719650001801733650002001751650001801771653001401789653002901803773007501832852000901907939003301916946001301949655001201962IND9000150120221119160736.0900108e198909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900015012DNAL7 a166670032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaldwell, C.R.10aAnalysis of aluminum and divalent cation binding to wheat root plasma membrane proteins using terbium phosphorescence  ap. 233-241.  aA phosphorescent trivalent cation, terbium [Tb(III)], has been used to study the binding of different polyvalent cations to the proteins of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) root plasma membranes. The phosphorescence emission intensity of Tb(III) was enhanced after Tb(III) binding to wheat root plasma membranes as a result of nonradiative resonance energy transfer from the membrane protein tyrosine and phenylalanine residues. Complex, saturable Tb(III) binding was observed, suggesting multiple binding sites. Bound Tb(III) could be displaced by divalent cations in the general order: Mn(II) greater than Ca(II) greater than Mg(II). Al(III) was very effective in reducing the protein-enhanced Tb(III) phosphorescence at pH values below 5. Al(III) also altered the Tb(III) phosphorescence lifetime, suggesting Al(III)-induced changes in membrane protein conformation. The more Al(III)-sensitive wheat cultivar (Anza) bound Al(III) with higher affinity than the more tolerant cultivar (BH 1146). At pH 5.5 where Al(III) did not displace bound Tb(III), low levels of Al(III) reduced the ability of Mn(II) to decrease Tb(III) phosphorescence. The significance of these results is discussed with respect to the mechanisms of Al(III) tolerance in wheat and the potential beneficial effects of Al(III) in reducing Mn(II) phytotoxicity. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aroots 3acations 3aproteins 3atyrosine 3aphenylalanine 3aaluminum 3amanganese 3aphytotoxicity 3aplasma membrane 3abinding sites 0atolerance 0aphosphorescence spectrum0 tPlant physiology.g1989 Sept., v. 91, no. 1 p.233-241x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03197naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148100001600166245014800182300001600330500001500346520177000361650003002131650001402161650001602175650002002191650001402211650002502225650001202250650002502262650000802287650001302295650000902308650001102317653001302328653001802341653001302359653002602372700001402398700002002412700001502432700001702447773007202464852000902536856008702545930003302632945001302665946001302678655001202691IND2328256420221119161110.0020729e200204  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232825642DNAL7 a189429462pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO.2002.92.4.3362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPruvost, O.10aSurvival of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri in leaf lesions under tropical environmental conditions and simulated splash dispersal of inoculum  ap. 336-346.  a2019-12-04  aAsiatic citrus canker (ACC) is a severe disease of several citrus species and hybrids in many tropical and subtropical areas. Populations of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri in leaf and twig lesions are the most important inoculum source for secondary infections. In areas with a marked winter season (e.g., Argentina and Japan), low temperatures induce a decrease of 10(2) to 10(4) in population sizes in lesions, thus creating a discontinuity in the X. axonopodis pv. citri life cycle. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the dynamics of X. axonopodis pv. citri populations in leaf lesions exposed to the mild winter temperatures prevailing in a tropical environment. Internal X. axonopodis pv. citri population levels in Mexican lime leaf lesions reached 10(6) to 10(7) CFU lesion(-1) whatever the lesion size. These densities, however, were not strongly negatively affected by winter temperatures prevailing under experimental conditions. The estimated decrease in internal X. axonopodis pv. citri population sizes was approximately 10-fold. When exposed to 35 mm h(-1) of simulated rainfall, internal population sizes decreased over time by approximately equal to 1 log unit for lesions 1 and 2 months old, but did not for older lesions. A microscopic examination indicated that lignin-like compounds are present in lesions more than 6 months old. The slow decrease over time of X. axonopodis pv. citri population sizes in leaf lesions may be the balanced result of defense reactions by the host at late stages of disease development, and the concomitant multiplication of the pathogen at the margin of old lesions. We conclude that the epidemiological significance of overwintered leaf lesions in the tropics is higher than that reported in other areas. 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3ainfection 3aXanthomonas 3aspore dispersal 3ahistology 3aCitrus aurantiifolia 3atropics 3adevelopmental stages 3aage 3ainoculum 3arain 3aleaves 0asymptoms 0aplant anatomy 0ainjuries 0aasiatic citrus canker1 aBoher, B.1 aBrocherieux, C.1 aNicole, M.1 aChiroleu, F.0 tPhytopathology.g2002 Apr., v. 92, no. 4 p.336-346x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO.2002.92.4.3363Available from publisher's Web site  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02336naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001600136245008000152300001800232500002400250520125000274650001201524650002401536650001901560650002101579650001301600650001301613650000901626650001101635650001101646650001201657700001401669700001601683700001201699700001201711700002401723700001901747773011201766852000901878856003901887655001201926IND4442680820221119160926.0100917e20100930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444268082DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.77172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhao10aCharacterizing the flush of stream chemical runoff from forested watersheds  ap. 2960-2970.  aIncludes references  aA flush can be defined as stream chemical exhibiting higher concentrations during the prophase of a storm event at an event scale, or exhibiting progressively lower concentrations during several successive storms at a seasonal scale. Investigating the flush characteristics of chemical runoff from forested watersheds is important and helpful to understand the chemical dynamics as well as to design a sampling schedule strategy during storm events. Here, three parameters describing the flush characteristic are quantified and the flush characteristics of chemicals from four Japanese forested watersheds (Mie, Kochi, Nagano and Tokyo) were investigated at both event and seasonal levels. We found that the characteristics of the flush were complicated, and depended on the constituents of the hydrochemistry, climate and runoff quality. Generally, the flush occurs more readily for particulate components than for those in solution; the flush on nitrate-nitrogen is weaker in regions of nitrogen saturation, such as Nagano and Tokyo, than in Mie and Kochi. Rainfall feature was the main factor controlling the flush of particulate components. However, the source available in a watershed plays a main role on the flushes of dissolve chemicals. 3aclimate 3aforested watersheds 3ahydrochemistry 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrogen 3aprophase 3arain 3arunoff 3astorms 3astreams1 aTao, Fulu1 aShi, Peijun1 aXu, Wei1 aSun, Yu1 aFukushima, Takehiko1 aOnda, Yūichi.0 tHydrological processes.g2010 Sept. 30, v. 24, no. 20 p.2960-2970dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.7717 7aarticle02121naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245005400166300001600220520118500236650001401421653003301435653003401468653002801502653002401530700002701554773011601581852000901697856006901706930003301775946001101808655001201819IND4389063420221119161204.0070318e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438906342DNAL7 a10.1007/s00254-006-0585-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuedrich, Joerg 10aSalt and ice crystallisation in porous sandstones  ap. 225-249.  aSalt and ice crystallisation in the pore spaces causes major physical damage to natural building stones. The damaging effect of these processes can be traced back to physically induced stress inside of the rock while crystallizing. The increasing scientific research done during the past century has shown that there are numerous parameters that have an influence on the weathering resulting from these processes. However, the working mechanisms of the stress development within the rock and its material dependency are still subject to discussion. This article gives an overview of salt and ice weathering. Additionally, laboratory results of various sandstones examined are presented. Salt crystallisation tests and freeze/thaw tests were done to obtain information about how crystallisation weathering depends on material characteristics such as pore space, water transportation, and mechanical features. Simultaneous measuring of the length alternating during the salt and ice crystallisation has revealed detailed information on the development of crystal in the pore spaces as well as the development of stress. These findings can help to understand the damaging mechanisms. 3asandstone 0aSalt and ice crystallisation 0aPhysical weathering processes 0aLength change behaviour 0aStone deterioration1 aSiegesmund, Siegfried 0 tEnvironmental geology.g2007 Mar., v. 52, no. 2 p.225-249dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0943-01057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-006-0585-63electronic resource  a20070318b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle00676naa a2200241 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245002100132300001600153520006400169650001700233650001400250650001500264773008000279852000900359939003300368945000800401946001300409655001200422991567901770742620221119161043.0900926e19900120xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI900010962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurocher, J.10aBeverage systems  ap. 142-145.  aBeverage dispensing equipment for restaurants is discussed. 3afood service 3abeverages 3adispensers0 tRestaurant business.g1990 Jan. 20, v. 89, no. 2 p.142-145x0097-80437nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03991naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001600165245012200181300001600303500002400319520209200343650002002435650001802455650002502473650000802498650001602506650001802522650002402540650001002564650001002574650001002584650002102594650000902615650001002624650004602634650002802680650001702708650003002725650001102755650005202766650001102818650006402829650002502893650000902918650001602927650002102943650002202964650001802986650007203004651002503076700001503101700001703116700001703133700002303150773013403173852000903307856004903316655001203365IND4458557020221119161144.0110603e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445855702DNAL7 a216161962pmid7 a10.1016/j.jada.2011.03.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtsuka, Rei10aDecreased Salt Intake in Japanese Men Aged 40 to 70 Years and Women Aged 70 to 79 Years: An 8-Year Longitudinal Study  ap. 844-850.  aIncludes references  aBackground: It is not known whether salt intake decreases over time in the same population. This study attempts to describe salt intake for 8 years according to age groups, and examines whether salt intake changes over time in community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly Japanese subjects. Methods: Data were collected as part of the National Institute for Longevity Sciences Longitudinal Study of Aging. Participants included 544 men and 512 women who participated in and completed all nutrition surveys from the first (1997-2000) to fifth (2006-2008) study waves. Each study wave was conducted for 2 years; in individuals, the entire follow-up period was 8 years. Salt and energy intake were calculated from 3-day diet records with photographs. The mixed-effects regression model was used for analysis of repeated measures of salt intake. Results: Mean age and salt intake for study participants at first participation in the survey were 56.5±9.3 years and 12.8±3.3 g/day in men and 55.8±9.4 years and 10.6±2.5 g/day in women, respectively. Mean energy intake decreased in men and women in all age groups from the first to fifth study waves. Eight-year longitudinal data showed that salt intake decreased in men. In stratified analyses by age, mean salt intake in men decreased 0.08 g/year among 40- to 49-year-olds, 0.09 g/year among 50- to 59-year-olds, 0.16 g/year among 60- to 69-year-olds, and 0.14 g/year among 70- to 79-year-olds. For women, mean salt intake decreased 0.08 g/year among 70- to 79-year-olds (P=0.098). After adjusting for energy intake, salt intake was decreased among 60- to 69-year-old men (P=0.049) and increased among 50- to 59-year-old women (P=0.015). Conclusions: Absolute salt intake was decreased among all age groups from 40 to 70 years in men and from 70 to 79 years in women. An increased focus on reducing energy intake resulted in only a modest decrease in salt intake. Although we observed a decline, salt intake still exceeded recommended levels. Efforts that focus on salt reduction are needed to address this important public health problem. 3adietary surveys 3aenergy intake 3alongitudinal studies 3amen 3aphotographs 3apublic health 3aregression analysis 3asalts 3awomen 2aAdult 2aAge Distribution 2aAged 2aAging 2aBlood Pressurexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiet Records 2aEnergy Intakexphysiology 2aFemale 2aHealth Promotionxorganization & administration 2aHumans 2aHypertensionxepidemiologyxetiologyxprevention & control. 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutrition Policy 2aNutrition Surveys 2aPublic Health 2aSodium Chloride, Dietaryxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 0aJapanxepidemiology.1 aKato, Yuki1 aImai, Tomoko1 aAndo, Fujiko1 aShimokata, Hiroshi0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2011 June, v. 111, no. 6 p.844-850dAmerican Dietetic Associationx0002-82237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jada.2011.03.020 7aarticle00674naa a2200229 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245002800132300001700160520007600177650001700253650001000270773008900280852000900369939003300378945000800411946001300419655001200432991567901410742620221119161323.0900925e19900301xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI900010832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurocher, J.10aConveyor and deck ovens  ap. 182, 184.  aCharacteristics and advantages of conveyor and deck ovens are detailed. 3afood service 3aovens0 tRestaurant business.g1990 Mar. 1, v. 89, no. 4 p.182, 184-182, 184x0097-80437nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03112naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245019300127300001600320500001500336520147900351650001201830650002401842650001301866650002701879650001401906650001301920650001401933650002301947650003201970650002502002650001402027650002302041650001802064650001402082650002202096650001202118650001802130650001602148650001902164650001402183650002202197650001502219650002102234651001102255653001602266653001802282653001902300653001002319653001002329700001602339700002002355773006902375852000902444930003302453945001302486946001102499655001202510IND2196454420221119161205.0990113e199806  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219645442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGauthier, P.10aGenetic variation and gene flow in Alpine diploid and tetraploid populations of Lotus (L. alpinus (D.C.)

Insights from morphological and allozyme markers  ap. 683-693.  a2019-12-05  aThe altitudinal distribution, morphology, phenology and allozyme polymorphism at 12 loci were studied in diploid and tetraploid populations of Lotus growing at over 1800 m in the French Alps to clarify relationships between these cytotypes. In general, diploids occurred at higher elevation than tetraploids, although some sites at intermediate elevation contained both cytotypes, diploids predominating in the upper part and tetraploids in the lower part of the contact area. Evidence for an autopolyploid origin of the tetraploids was provided by tetrasomic inheritance at two enzyme loci, although no tetravalents were observed at meiosis. Diploid and tetraploid plants shared morphological traits distinct from those of other Lotus species and showed differences in size, which may be attributable to chromosome doubling. The diploid cytotype, L. alpinus, may thus be the ancestor of the Alpine tetraploids. Both cytotypes showed nearly identical suites of alleles at all loci and very similar genetic parameters, except for heterozygosity, which was higher in the tetraploid plants. However, the occurrence of few alleles specific to each ploidy level indicated limited gene flow between cytotypes, probably as a result of spatial segregation and variation in flowering time. Of the individuals in a tetraploid population, 25% showed morphological traits similar to those observed in L. corniculatus, suggesting genetic introgression between the two tetraploid species. 3aalleles 3aenzyme polymorphism 3aaltitude 3ainheritance (genetics) 3acytotypes 3adiploidy 3aphenology 3achromosome pairing 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aphenotypic variation 3aallozymes 3aLotus corniculatus 3aintrogression 3acultivars 3achromosome number 3ameiosis 3aalpine plants 3atetraploidy 3aheterozygosity 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3apopulation 3aplant morphology 3aFrance 0asegregation 0alotus alpinus 0aflowering date 0atypes 0aLotus1 aLumaret, R.1 aBedecarrats, A.0 tHeredity.g1998 June, v. 80, no. pt.6 p.683-693x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02360naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008600127300001600213500001500229520110600244650001201350650001101362650001301373650001301386650001001399650002301409650001701432650001101449650000901460650001001469651002001479653001401499653002001513653001401533653002301547653001101570653002101581653002101602653002001623653001001643653001801653653002701671700002101698773006901719852000901788930003301797945001301830946001101843655001201854IND2123466620221119160821.0980618e199712  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212346662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrespi, B.J.10aFluctuating asymmetry in vestigial and functional traits of a haplodiploid insect  ap. 624-630.  a2019-12-05  aIf natural selection on fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is common and related to trait functionality, then vestigial traits should show elevated FA. Moreover, if FA increases with heterozygosity, then haploid males of haplodiploid taxa should exhibit higher FA than diploid females. We measured fluctuating asymmetry of functional traits (fore femora of soldier morphs and disperser morphs, and wings of dispersers) and a vestigial trait (wings of soldiers) in the eusocial haplodiploid gall thrips Oncothrips tepperi (Insecta: Thysanoptera). Wing FA, but not femur FA, was substantially and significantly higher in soldiers than in dispersers in both sexes. Patterns of intersexual variation in FA were complex: for wings, female soldiers had higher FA than male soldiers but male dispersers had higher FA than female dispersers, and for femora males and females did not differ in FA in either morph. Our results suggest that vestigial traits exhibit higher FA because of relaxation of selection for functionality, and that haploidy does not necessarily lead to increased FA in males of haplodiploid taxa. 3afemales 3amorphs 3ahaploidy 3adiploidy 3amales 3agender differences 3aThysanoptera 3alength 3alegs 3awings 3aNew South Wales 0aasymmetry 0avestigial wings 0avariation 0aoncothrips tepperi 0atraits 0avestigial traits 0afunctional wings 0adisperser caste 0acaste 0asoldier caste 0aanatomy and morphology1 aVanderkist, B.A.0 tHeredity.g1997 Dec., v. 79, no. pt.6 p.624-630x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02244naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245007000146300001800216520118400234650001801418650001801436650001601454650002201470650002001492650001901512650002101531650001301552650001501565650001301580650002001593650001201613650001201625653003101637700001701668700001801685773007601703852000901779939003301788946001301821655001201834IND9000356320221119160817.0900123e198904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900035632DNAL7 a166667012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoudey, J.S.12aA role for ethylene in the metabolism of cyanide by higher plants  ap. 1306-1310.  aThe action of ethylene on the capacity of plant tissues to metabolize cyanide to beta-cyanoalanine was examined. Beta-cyanoalanine synthase (EC 4.4.1.9) catalyzes the reaction between cyanide and cysteine to form beta-cyanoalanine and hydrogen sulfide. Levels of beta-cyanoalanine synthase activity in tissues of 6 day old etiolated pea (Pisum sativum) seedlings were enhanced severalfold by 1 microliter per liter ethylene. The promotive effect of ethylene increased with increasing ethylene concentrations from 0.01 to 100 microliters per liter and with the period of exposure from 3 to 24 hours. Ethylene enhanced beta-cyanoalanine synthase activity in all regions of the seedling (shoots and roots, internodal regions, cotyledons). The promotive effect was eliminated by norbornadiene, a competitive inhibitor of ethylene action. Levels of beta-cyanoalanine synthase in seedlings of four other dicots (Phaseolus aureas, Glycine max, Lactuca sativa, Sinapis arvensis) and two monocots (Hordeum vulgares, Triticum aestivum) were also increased in response to ethylene. Our results suggest an important regulatory role for ethylene in the metabolism of cyanide by higher plants. 3aPisum sativum 3aVigna radiata 3aGlycine max 3aTriticum aestivum 3aHordeum vulgare 3aLactuca sativa 3aSinapis arvensis 3acyanides 3ametabolism 3aethylene 3aenzyme activity 3aligases 3aalanine 0abeta-cyanoalanine synthase1 aTittle, F.L.1 aSpencer, M.S.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 Apr., v. 89, no. 4 p.1306-1310x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02365naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245012700129300001600256500001500272520113400287650001401421650001201435650002401447650001301471650002701484650001201511650001701523650002201540650002101562650001201583650002401595650002401619650001001643651001301653653003001666653002601696653004601722653001601768773006901784852000901853930003301862945001301895946001101908655001201919IND2123466420221119161006.0980618e199712  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212346642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, D.R.10aGenetic correlation between biomass allocation to male and female functions in a natural population of Ipomopsis aggregata  ap. 606-614.  a2019-12-05  aModels for sex allocation assume that increased expenditure of resources on male function decreases the resources available for female function. Under some circumstances, a negative genetic correlation between investment in stamens and investment in pistil and seeds is expected. This study used a nested half-sibship design to test for genetic correlations between biomass of stamens, corolla, calyx, pistil and seeds in the hermaphroditic herb Ipomopsis aggregata. Over 5000 seeds from 32 paternal half-sib families and 229 maternal full-sib families were planted under natural field conditions and followed for up to 9 years until blooming. Stamen mass and corolla mass exhibited moderately high levels of additive genetic variance, and heritabilities of 0.32 and 0.40, respectively. Genetic correlations, as estimated with family mean correlations, were all either positive or not significantly different from zero. Even after controlling for plant size and flower number as indices of resource acquisition, paternal half-sib families that invested more biomass in stamens also invested more in the pistil and in the corolla. 3agynoecium 3acorolla 3agenetic correlation 3acrossing 3aphenotypic correlation 3astamens 3aheritability 3agenetic variation 3agenetic variance 3abiomass 3aquantitative traits 3aIpomopsis aggregata 3acalyx 3aColorado 0aadditive genetic variance 0aquantitative genetics 0aadditive genetic coefficient of variation 0aseed weight0 tHeredity.g1997 Dec., v. 79, no. pt.6 p.606-614x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01590naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245006700130300001400197520083000211650002101041653002701062653002301089700001501112773010901127852001301236939003301249945000801282946001301290852000901303655001201312991567898960742620221119161036.0930128e199212  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930003542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerger, F.10aPreparing a training proposal: ideas from the on-track trainer  ap. 36-42.  aThe training proposal's a summary of the research and planning that go into developing a training program, and should follow this outline: Introduce the plan and its purpose; identify the training deficiency; list the training objectives; justify the objectives based on needs-analysis results; set training priorities; explain how to evaluate the training; and provide a cost-benefit analysis.

Progeny of eggs from all combinations of injection were analysed. The maII or siI molecules, when provided by the donor, were never detected in the offspring of the hosts, whatever the host's mitochondrial type. Heteroplasmic flies were detected when siII, siIII or maI mitochondria were injected into any of the other cytoplasms. In the majority of cases the percentage of foreign mtDNA increased over generations, leading to a complete replacement of the endogenous mtDNA. In most cases, sill was prevalent. The stochastic processes involved in the evolution of heteroplasmic states are strongly affected by selective values of the different mtDNA types, with a clear hierarchy among them: siII has the most advantage, then siIII and maI, and finally siI and maII. In the siII/maII heteroplasmy case, the loss of mall was more rapid at a high temperature. 3aDrosophila simulans 3aDrosophila mauritiana 3arestriction mapping 3amitochondrial DNA 3aair temperature 3ainjection 3amitochondria 3agenomics 3acytoplasmic inheritance 0acytoplasm 0amicroinjection 0aDrosophila 0aheteroplasmy0 tHeredity.g1997 Dec., v. 79, no. pt.6 p.615-623x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03119naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245006900131300001800200520213100218650003002349650001602379650001702395650001902412650001502431650002002446650002602466650001802492650002202510650001702532700001702549700001602566700001502582700001702597773007602614852000902690939003302699946001302732655001202745IND9000411920221119160937.0900125e198904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900041192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSultemeyer, D.F.10aActive CO2 transport by the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtti  ap. 1213-1219.  aMass spectrometric measurements of dissolved free 13CO2 were used to monitor CO2 uptake by air grown (low CO2) cells and protoplasts from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. In the presence of 50 micromolar dissolved inorganic carbon and light, protoplasts which had been washed free of external carbonic anhydrase reduced the 13CO2 concentration in the medium to close to zero. Similar results were obtained with low CO2 cells treated with 50 micromolar acetazolamide. Addition of carbonic anhydrase to protoplasts after the period of rapid CO2 uptake revealed that the removal of CO2 from the medium in the light was due to selective and active CO2 transport rather than uptake of total dissolved inorganic carbon. In the light, low CO2 cells and protoplasts incubated with carbonic anhydrase took up CO2 at an apparently low rate which reflected the uptake of total dissolved inorganic carbon. No net CO2 uptake occurred in the dark. Measurement of chlorophyll a fluorescence yield with low CO2 cells and washed protoplasts showed that variable fluorescence was mainly influenced by energy quenching which was reciprocally related to photosynthetic activity with its highest value at the CO2 compensation point. During the linear uptake of CO2 low CO2 cells and protoplasts incubated with carbonic anhydrase showed similar rates of net O2 evolution (102 and 108 micromoles per milligram of chlorophyll per hour, respectively). The rate of net O2 evolution (83 micromoles per milligram of chlorophyll per hour) with washed protoplasts was 20 to 30% lower during the period of rapid CO2 uptake and decreased to a still lower value of 46 micromoles per milligram of chlorophyll per hour when most of the free CO2 had been removed from the medium. The addition of carbonic anhydrase at this point resulted in more than a doubling of the rate of O2 evolation. These results show low CO2 cells of Chlamydomonas are able to transport both CO2 and HCO3(-1) but CO2 is preferentially removed from the medium. The external carbonic anhydrase is important in the supply to the cells of free CO2 from the dehydration of HCO3(-1). 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aprotoplasts 3agas exchange 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonates 3aenzyme activity 3acarbonate dehydratase 3aion transport 3amass spectrometry 3afluorescence1 aMiller, A.G.1 aEspie, G.S.1 aFock, H.P.1 aCanvin, D.T.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 Apr., v. 89, no. 4 p.1213-1219x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle00763naa a2200241 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245002300132300001700155520013500172650001700307650001600324653001600340773009000356852000900446939003300455945000800488946001300496655001200509991567898480742620221119160935.0901002e19900320xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI900011522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurocher, J.10aSanitation systems  ap. 166, 168.  aProper dishwashing techniques and equipment for dish machines that promote sanitation in food service establishments are detailed. 3afood service 3afood safety 0adishwashing0 tRestaurant business.g1990 Mar. 20, v. 89, no. 5 p.166, 168-166, 168x0097-80437nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03305naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245008600200300001800286500002400304506007600328520175000404506003702154650001502191650001302206650000902219650002702228650001602255650001702271650001302288650001002301650001602311650002302327650001002350650002202360650002302382650002502405700001802430700002102448700001502469700001902484700002202503773013702525852000902662856008002671856004802751655001202799IND4396458520221207082329.0071021e20071015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439645852DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.00181-072doi7 aPMC20750412pmcid7 a176754442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFonty, Gérard10aEstablishment and Development of Ruminal Hydrogenotrophs in Methanogen-Free Lambs  ap. 6391-6403.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aim of this work was to determine whether reductive acetogenesis can provide an alternative to methanogenesis in the rumen. Gnotobiotic lambs were inoculated with a functional rumen microbiota lacking methanogens and reared to maturity on a fibrous diet. Lambs with a methanogen-free rumen grew well, and the feed intake and ruminal volatile fatty acid concentrations for lambs lacking ruminal methanogens were lower but not markedly dissimilar from those for conventional lambs reared on the same diet. A high population density (10⁷ to 10⁸ cells g⁻¹) of ruminal acetogens slowly developed in methanogen-free lambs. Sulfate- and fumarate-reducing bacteria were present, but their population densities were highly variable. In methanogen-free lambs, the hydrogen capture from fermentation was low (28 to 46%) in comparison with that in lambs containing ruminal methanogens (>90%). Reductive acetogenesis was not a significant part of ruminal fermentation in conventional lambs but contributed 21 to 25% to the fermentation in methanogen-free meroxenic animals. Ruminal H₂ utilization was lower in lambs lacking ruminal methanogens, but when a methanogen-free lamb was inoculated with a methanogen, the ruminal H₂ utilization was similar to that in conventional lambs. H₂ utilization in lambs containing a normal ruminal microflora was age dependent and increased with the animal age. The animal age effect was less marked in lambs lacking ruminal methanogens. Addition of fumarate to rumen contents from methanogen-free lambs increased H₂ utilization. These findings provide the first evidence from animal studies that reductive acetogens can sustain a functional rumen and replace methanogens as a sink for H₂ in the rumen.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal age 3abacteria 3adiet 3afatty acid composition 3afeed intake 3afermentation 3ahydrogen 3alambs 3amethanogens 3apopulation density 3arumen 3arumen development 3arumen fermentation 3avolatile fatty acids1 aJoblin, Keith1 aChavarot, Michel1 aRoux, Remy1 aNaylor, Graham1 aMichallon, Fabien0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2007 Oct. 15, v. 73, no. 20 p.6391-6403dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00181-073Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle03698naa a2200517 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245007500149300001600224520231400240650001602554650001902570650001902589650002002608650001802628650002102646650003202667650001902699650001202718650001602730650001802746650002202764650001102786650001102797650001602808650004702824650002002871650002502891650000902916650001602925650001602941653001902957653001802976700001802994773008003012852001303092939003303105945000803138946001303146852000903159655001203168991567897730742620221119160800.0901003e198912  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI900011692DNAL7 a25852352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStuff, J.E.10aNutrient intake and growth performance of older infants fed human milk  ap. 959-968.  aStudy objective: To determine whether the ad libitum addition of solid foods to the diet of exclusively human milk-fed infants will increase energy intake and reverse the decline in weight-for-age percentiles observed during the exclusive breast-feeding period. Design: Weekly or biweekly measures of growth were made longitudinally on a cohort of infants from birth to 36 weeks of age, and monthly measures of nutrient intake were made from 16 weeks of age until 10 weeks after solid foods were introduced into the diet. Subjects: Volunteer mother-infant pairs from middle and upper income groups who met entry criteria, including the intention to breast-feed exclusively for at least for 16 weeks; 58 pairs entered and 45 pairs completed the study. Intervention: Solid foods were introduced at a time determined by the mother and the pediatrician; solid foods from controlled lot numbers were provided for each infant. Measurements and main results: After solid foods were added, daily human milk intake declined at a rate of 77 gm/mo (p less than 0.001). Milk composition did not change during the observation period. Daily total energy intake increased 29 kcal/mo, but no changes were noted in energy intake when consumption was normalized for body weight. Weight (National Center for Health Statistics percentiles) at 28 weeks was 13 percentiles lower than that at birth, and length at 28 weeks was 1 percentile lower than at week 1. Weight and length percentiles at 28 weeks, when compared with peak values at 8 weeks, had dropped 19 and 14 percentiles, respectively. Conclusions: Energy intake of human milk-fed infants did not increase after solid foods were added to their diet but was maintained at approximately 20% below recommended levels. Energy intake appeared to reflect infant demands. These data suggest that the recommendations for the energy requirements of infancy should be reevaluated. The growth pattern of exclusively breast-fed infants differs from that of the National Center for Health Statistics reference population. These observations raise questions about the adaptive response of human milk-fed infants to different levels of energy intake and about the estimations of energy requirements based on the sum of basal metabolism, activity, growth, and diet-induced thermogenesis. 3abreast milk 3abreast feeding 3ainfant feeding 3anutrient intake 3aenergy intake 3afood composition 3aanthropometric measurements 3agrowth factors 3ainfants 2aBody Weight 2aEnergy Intake 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant Food 2aInfant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aInfant, Newborn 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aMilk, Human 2aSex Factors 0afeeding habits 0asolid feeding1 aNichols, B.L.0 tJournal of pediatrics.g1989 Dec., v. 115, no. 6 p.959-968x0022-34767nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle01660naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245005200133300001400185520094800199650002101147650001701168653002501185773010801210852001301318939003301331945000801364946001301372852000901385655001201394991567897470742620221119160804.0920917e199208  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920030022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRainsford, P.14aThe small business institute: hands-on learning  ap. 73-76.  aThe Small Business Institute program is designed to help businesses and give students an experiential-learning opportunity. Students function as consultants, under faculty supervision, to area businesses that request assistance. Based on students' work experiences and academic concentrations, they are assigned to four-member teams. Each team is assigned a business client. Teams are required to meet regularly with the course instructor and at least three times with the client at the place of business. Students integrate the disciplines studied in other courses, apply an investigative process, and analyze the entire business entity. They quickly learn to examine a diversity of topics to understand the business, and to communicate, both orally and in writing, with a variety of people. The on-going nature of the project and the repeated contact and discussions with the owners are what allow learning and problem solving to take place. 3asmall businesses 3ajob training 0amanagement education0 tCornell hotel and restaurant administration quarterly.g1992 Aug., v. 3, no. 8 p.73-76x0010-88047nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle01275naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245004400134300001400178300001900192520050700211650001800718650002100736650002800757650001500785773010900800852001300909939003300922945000800955946001300963852000900976655001200985991567896910742620221119160932.0880630e198711  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880017772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTabacchi, M.H.10aTargeting the health-conscious consumer  ap. 21-24.  ap. 21-24. ill.  aAn informative report for food service managers highlights the dimensions of the "healthy foods" market and provides practical suggestions on how to satisfy the public demand needs it represents.

Objective: The objective was to examine the relation between serum cholesterol concentrations and performance in immediate memory, visuomotor speed, and coding speed tests. Design: The participants were 4110 adults aged 20-59 y who completed a set of neurobehavioral tests and had blood specimens collected as a part of the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-1994. Results: After adjustment for sociodemographic variables, serum trace elements and vitamins, dietary energy intake, and risk factors for cardiovascular disease, we found inverse linear associations of serum total cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol with visuomotor speed in men. The least-squares mean (± SE) visuomotor speeds were 231.6 ± 2.6, 224.0 ± 2.2, and 218.9 ± 2.5 ms, respectively, for men with serum total cholesterol concentrations below the 25th, between the 25th and the 75th, and at or above the 75th percentile (P for trend < 0.001) and were 231.7 ± 2.7, 225.8 ± 2.4, and 214.1 ± 2.3 ms, respectively, for men with a non-HDL-cholesterol concentration below the 25th, between the 25th and the 75th, and at or above the 75th percentile (P for trend < 0.001). No significant associations were observed between memory or coding speed and the selected serum cholesterol measures in men, and the scores of the 3 neurobehavioral tests were unrelated to serum cholesterol in women. Conclusion: Low serum total cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol are associated with slow visuomotor speed in young and middle-aged men. 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aadults 3acardiovascular diseases 3acholesterol 3aenergy intake 3ahematologic tests 3ahypercholesterolemia 3aleast squares 3amemory 3amen 3arisk factors 3atrace elements 3avitamins 3awomen 2aAdult 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCognition 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMemory 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutrition Surveys 2aPsychomotor Performance 2aRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic 0aUnited States1 aMuldoon, M.F.1 aMcKeown, R.E.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2004 Aug., v. 80, no. 2 p.291-298dThe American Society for Nutrition, with the assistance of Highwire Pressx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01667naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245004900127300001600176500001500192520072000207650001300927650002400940650001200964650000800976650001900984650002501003650001201028650003701040650001401077650001401091653001301105653001101118700001701129773006901146852000901215930003301224945001301257946001101270655001201281IND2124227620221119160944.0980724e199801  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212422762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCurnow, R.N.10aPooling DNA in the identification of parents  ap. 101-109.  a2019-12-05  aThe preliminary pooling of DNA samples to reduce the number of tests required to identify which of a set of potential parents could be the parent of an individual progeny plant is discussed.

Our results show that PgiC2—a natural functional nuclear transgene—is not a local ephemeral phenomenon but is present in a very large number of individuals. We find also that its frequency is geographically variable and that it appears in more than one molecular form. The chloroplast variation in the region does not indicate any distinct subdivision due to different colonization routes after the last glaciation. Our data illustrate the geographic and molecular variation that may occur in natural populations with a polymorphic, unfixed transgene affected by diverse kinds of mutational and evolutionary processes. 3aFestuca ovina 3achloroplasts 3aglaciation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asurveys 3atransgenes 2aDNA, Chloroplastxanalysisxgenetics. 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFestucaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aGene Frequency 2aGene Transfer, Horizontal 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenome, Plant 2aGeography 2aGlucose-6-Phosphate Isomerasexgenetics 2aOceans and Seas 2aPoaxgenetics 2aPseudogenes 2aSelection, Genetic 2aTransgenes 0aEurope1 aBengtsson, Bengt O.1 aGhatnekar, Lena0 tGenetica.g2010 Mar., v. 138, no. 3 p.355-362dSpringer Netherlandsx0016-67077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10709-009-9425-4 7aarticle04025naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003300135040001800168100001600186245012300202300001100325506007600336520209200412592002802504506003702532650001902569650001702588650001302605650001002618650001002628650001802638650001002656650001302666650001402679650004302693650002102736650001202757650001202769650004502781650003402826650001402860650005202874650007402926650003203000650001003032650005503042651001203097651002703109700002003136700002203156700002503178700002803203773011503231856008003346852000903426655001203435IND50073072620221207130916.0210908e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007307262DNAL7 aPMC39221662pmcid7 a244678332pmid7 a10.1186/1746-6148-10-312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZro, Khalil12aA sheeppox outbreak in Morocco: isolation and identification of virus responsible for the new clinical form of disease  ap. 31.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Sheeppoxvirus (SPPV) is a member of the Capripoxvirus genus of the Poxviridae family, which causes significant economic losses in Morocco. The resurgence of the sheeppox disease during 2010 was characterized by an emergence of a classical nodular form for the first time in Morocco. However, little is known about the virus strain responsible for nodular form. In this study, thirty three sheep, from the eastern region of Morocco, clinically infected were examined and dead animals were autopsied. A rapid diagnostic assay for SPPV using different type of clinical samples would be useful for outbreak management. The aim of this work was to isolate the virus strain responsible for nodular form and we identified and compared by phylogenetic analysis the field strain with Moroccan vaccine strain targeting the thymidine kinase (TK) gene and the chemokine analogue receptor of interleukin (IL8) gene. Further, it was important to investigate and validate a real-time PCR using different clinical and post-mortem samples to manage epidemic sheeppox disease. RESULTS: The nodular form of sheeppox disease observed in Morocco was clinically characterized by fever, depression, lacrimation, diarrhea in lambs and nodule. At necropsy, the most affected organ was the lung. The etiological strain was successfully isolated from lung nodule in a dead lamb and was identified by using real-time PCR that has been tested and validated on different types of clinical and post mortem samples from naturally infected animals. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of TK and IL8 gene showed that there was a very close relationship between field and vaccine strain. They were clustered within other SPPV strains. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we show for the first time the nodular form of sheeppox in Morocco. We demonstrate a robust real-time PCR-based diagnostic assay to detect the sheeppox virus in multiple sample that can be implemented to efficiently manage the disease outbreak. Our study also offers the prospect for future molecular studies to understand the clinical forms.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSheeppox virus 3adead animals 3adiarrhea 3afever 3agenes 3ainterleukin-8 3alambs 3anecropsy 3aphylogeny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3athymidine kinase 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aCapripoxvirusxclassificationxgenetics. 2aDisease Outbreaksxveterinary 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethodsxveterinary. 2aPoxviridae Infectionsxepidemiologyxpathologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxepidemiologyxpathologyxvirology. 3aMorocco 0aMoroccoxepidemiology.1 aZakham, Fathiah1 aMelloul, Marouane1 aEl Fahime, Elmostafa1 aEnnaji, Moulay Mustapha0 tBMC veterinary research.g2014 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.31-31dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-10-313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03581naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245011200206300001400318520215700332592002802489650002902517650001902546650002102565650001302586650001302599650002802612650001502640650000902655650001802664650001502682650001802697650001902715650002102734650001502755650002002770650001602790651001002806700001902816700001702835700001602852700001702868773013402885856008303019852000903102655001203111IND60762086720221118192443.0220818e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076208672DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-021-03069-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQian, Xiaoyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3234-809010aSalt redistribution and nutrient loss after soil salt washing in plastic shed vegetable field in East China  ap. 12-20.  aPURPOSE: Soil salt washing is very common in plastic shed vegetable field in East China, and understanding salt movement and nutrient fate during soil salt washing is vital for agricultural production and environmental protection. However, little attention was paid to salt redistribution after salt washing, which would lead to nutrient loss, and then induce eutrophication and water pollution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An on-site experiment of undisturbed soil columns with different salt contents was implemented to investigate the salt redistribution and nutrient loss after soil salt washing in six intensive farms with plastic shed vegetable field in Shanghai suburbs. The contents of salt and nutrient in the different depths of soils after salt washing were determined, and the losses of nitrogen and phosphorus from salt washing were calculated. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: After the soil salt washing, the contents of total soluble salt (TSS) and nitrate nitrogen (nitrate N) in the 0–20 cm soil layers at all sites decreased more than 35% and 15%, respectively, while the total phosphorus (TP) only performed slight decreasing trends of less than 10%. The pollution loads of total nitrogen (TN) from soil salt washing greatly increased following the increase of TSS contents in the surface soil, and ranged from 24.80 to 215.64 kg ha⁻¹, while the TP ranged from 0.37 to 1.43 kg ha⁻¹. The pollution loads of TN, nitrate N, TP, and soluble P were significantly correlated with the TSS contents of the 0–20-cm soil layer (P < 0.05). The salt washing could effectively eliminate soil secondary salinization, and cause nutrient loss and water pollution in the meantime. CONCLUSIONS: In the plastic shed vegetable field, soil salt washing performed very positive effect on the reduction of soil salinity, and can remarkably decrease the nitrate contents in the surface soil layers, while there was no obvious impact on the downward vertical movement of phosphorus. Meanwhile, salt washing from soils decreased nitrogen use efficiency and increased the risk of water pollution in the plain network area with shallow groundwater table.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental protection 3aeutrophication 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anutrient use efficiency 3aphosphorus 3arisk 3asoil salinity 3asoil salts 3asoluble salts 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 3avegetables 3awater pollution 3awater table 3aChina1 aShen, Genxiang1 aGuo, Chunxia1 aGu, Hairong1 aWang, Zhenqi0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2022 Jan., v. 22, no. 1 p.12-20dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949862x1439-01087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-021-03069-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245009800177300001600275520145000291592002801741650001601769650001601785650001501801650001801816650001501834650001501849650001601864650001101880650001301891700002801904700007601932700002102008773010402029856008302133852000902216655001202225IND60780642920221120114416.0220621e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078064292DNAL7 a10.1007/s10646-022-02537-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamírez-Morales, Didier10aSingle and mixture toxicity of selected pharmaceuticals to the aquatic macrophyte Lemna minor  ap. 714-724.  aPlants represent uncommon targets to evaluate pharmaceuticals toxicity. In this work, Lemna minor was employed as a plant model to determine the toxicity of selected pharmaceuticals, and to assay if such toxicity could be predicted by QSAR models based on green algae. Among eight compounds, measurable toxicity was determined for ketoprofen (EC₅₀ = 11.8 ± 1.9 mg/L), fluoxetine (EC₅₀ = 27.0 ± 8.7 mg/L) and clindamycin 2-phosphate (EC₅₀ = 57.7 ± 1.7 mg/L). Even though a correlation of r² = 0.87 was observed between experimental toxicity towards algae and L. minor, QSAR estimations based on algae data poorly predicted the toxicity of pharmaceuticals on the plant. More experimental data for L. minor are necessary to determine the applicability of these predictions; nonetheless, these results remark the importance of measuring experimental ecotoxicological parameters for individual taxa. The toxicity of pharmaceutical binary mixtures (ketoprofen, fluoxetine and clindamycin) revealed in some cases deviations from the concentration addition model; nonetheless these deviations were small, thus the interactions are unlikely to be of severe biological significance. Moreover, the EC₅₀ concentrations determined for these pharmaceuticals are significantly higher than those detected in the environment, suggesting that acute effects on L. minor would not take place at ecosystem level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLemna minor 3aclindamycin 3aecosystems 3aecotoxicology 3afluoxetine 3aketoprofen 3amacrophytes 3amodels 3atoxicity1 aFajardo-Romero, Daniela1 aRodríguez-Rodríguez, Carlos E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6923-72581 aCedergreen, Nina0 tEcotoxicology.g2022 July, v. 31, no. 5 p.714-724dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870048x0963-92927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-022-02537-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04932naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245018500167300001800352500001500370520317800385592002803563650001603591650001803607650001203625650000903637650002303646650001903669650001803688650002403706650001503730650002003745650002303765650001503788650001903803650001203822650001103834650001303845650002203858650002003880650001003900650002403910650001803934651001303952653002203965653002003987653002104007653001804028653000904046700002004055700003704075773015404112856007904266852000904345655001204354IND60567962820221122171519.0190318e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056796282DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2016-125032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBatistel, Fernanda10aCorn grain-processing method interacts with calcium salts of palm fatty acids supplementation on milk production and energy balance of early-lactation cows grazing tropical pasture  ap. 5343-5357.  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of our study was to investigate the associative effects of feeding Ca salts of palm fatty acids (FA) and corn grain-processing method on production, nutrient digestibility, energy balance, and carryover effects of early-lactation dairy cows grazing a tropical pasture. Treatment diets were offered from 3 to 16 wk postpartum (treatment period), in which all cows grazed elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum L. Cameroon) and treatments were added to a concentrate supplement. Treatments were flint corn grain-processing method either as fine ground (FGC) or steam-flaked (SFC) associated with Ca salts of palm FA supplementation either not supplemented or supplemented (CSPO). From 17 to 40 wk postpartum (carryover period) all cows received a common diet fed as total mixed ration. During the treatment period, a tendency for an interaction between CSPO and corn grain-processing method were observed for milk yield, milk fat yield, and energy-corrected milk (ECM), as CSPO caused them to increased to a greater extent in the FGC diet compared with the SFC diet. Furthermore, a tendency for an interaction between CSPO and corn grain-processing method was observed for body weight change, because CSPO increased body weight loss in the FGC diet but not in the SFC diet. The CSPO increased milk yield, milk fat yield, 3.5% fat-corrected milk, ECM, and cumulative milk yield compared with not supplemented. Also, CSPO increased energy intake, milk energy output, and energy partitioning toward milk, whereas reduced energy was allocated to body reserves. The SFC increased milk yield, ECM, milk protein yield, milk casein yield, and cumulative milk yield, and decreased milk urea N compared with FGC. The SFC compared with FGC also increased body condition score and body weight change, and increased energy partitioning toward body reserves. During the carryover period, an interaction between CSPO and corn grain-processing method was observed for milk yield, which occurred because CSPO maintained higher milk yield in the FGC diet but not in the SFC diet. Therefore, in the carryover period, the additive effect between SFC and CSPO that occurred in the treatment period was not maintained throughout the carryover period. However, CSPO increased yields of milk fat, protein, casein as well as fat-corrected milk and ECM. In conclusion, corn grain-processing method interacts with CSPO supplementation on production responses and carryover effects of grazing cows. When CSPO was fed in the FGC diet, milk production increased to a greater extent than when fed in the SFC diet, but also caused greater mobilization of reserves at early lactation. This suggests an interaction between fat supplementation and corn grain-processing method on energy partitioning of dairy cows. Also, both supplementation with CSPO and SFC were effective strategies to increase energy intake and yields of milk and milk solids. The carryover effect on milk production was greater for CSPO supplementation than corn grain-processing method, whereas feeding SFC diets had lower mobilization of reserves and less body weight and body condition score variation throughout lactation.  aPublisher supplied data 3afatty acids 3aenergy intake 3agrazing 3amilk 3aCenchrus purpureus 3amilk fat yield 3adigestibility 3abody weight changes 3adairy cows 3aadditive effect 3amilk protein yield 3aflint corn 3abody condition 3acalcium 3acasein 3amilk fat 3atropical pastures 3aearly lactation 3asalts 3atotal mixed rations 3aurea nitrogen 3aCameroon 0asteam-flaked corn 0acorn processing 0apalm fatty acids 0acalcium salts 0adiet1 ade Souza, Jonas1 aSantos, Flávio Augusto Portela,0 tJournal of dairy science.g2017 July, v. 100, no. 7 p.5343-5357dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2016-125033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01990naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009500167300001800262520106600280592002801346650002601374650002701400650001201427650001901439700001901458700001801477773011001495856008601605852000901691655001201700IND60530464820221121165737.0160721e20160405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053046482DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.5b047432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Juhwan10aPressed Paper-Based Dipstick for Detection of Foodborne Pathogens with Multistep Reactions  ap. 3781-3788.  aThis paper presents a pressed paper-based dipstick that enables detection of foodborne pathogens with multistep reactions by exploiting the delayed fluid flow and channel partition formation on nitrocellulose (NC) membrane. Fluid behaviors are easily modified by controlling the amount of pressure and the position of pressed region on the NC membrane. Detection region of the dipstick is optimized by controlling flow rate and delayed time based on Darcy’s law. All the reagents required for assay are dried on the NC membrane and they are sequentially rehydrated at the prepartitioned regions when the device is dipped into sample solution. In this manner, multistep reactions can be facilitated by one-step dipping of the dipstick into the sample solution. As a proof of concept, we performed detection of two fatal foodborne pathogens (e.g., Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella typhimurium) with signal enhancement. In addition, we expanded the utilization of channel partitions by developing a pressed paper-based dipstick into dual detection format.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3adipping 3afood pathogens1 aShin, Joong Ho1 aPark, Je-Kyun0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2016 Apr. 05, v. 88, no. 7 p.3781-3788dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.5b047433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03482naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245016200185300001800347500001500365520172800380592002802108650002402136650001202160650001402172650001002186650001902196650001702215650001402232650001602246650005802262650001202320650003602332650002002368650004402388650001702432650002602449650002702475650002702502650001202529650003702541650003102578653002202609700001902631700002202650700002102672700002202693773010002715856008102815990002302896852000902919655001202928IND60089852520221123005526.0141102e20110501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008985252DNAL7 a213714472pmid7 a10.1016/j.bcp.2011.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsukawa, Jun12aA comparative study on the modes of action of TAK-438, a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker, and lansoprazole in primary cultured rabbit gastric glands  ap. 1145-1151.  a2019-12-06  aTAK-438 is a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB) type antisecretory agent that reversibly inhibits gastric H⁺, K⁺-ATPase. Previously, we showed that TAK-438 has superior efficacy compared to lansoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, in the inhibition of acid secretion in vivo. In this study, we investigated the differences in the mode of actions of the two drugs using primary cultured rabbit gastric glands. TAK-438 and lansoprazole inhibited gastric acid formation in acutely isolated gastric glands (IC₅₀ values, 0.30 and 0.76μM, respectively). In cultured gastric glands that were preincubated with TAK-438, the inhibitory effect on forskolin-stimulated acid formation was augmented over the incubation period, whereas the inhibitory effect of lansoprazole was not affected by time of incubation. Next, we evaluated the durations of the actions of TAK-438 and lansoprazole after gastric glands were incubated with either drug for 2h followed by washout. Even 8h after the drug washout, TAK-438 at higher concentrations inhibited acid formation, but the inhibitory effect of lansoprazole disappeared immediately after washout. Additionally, only a small amount of [¹⁴C] lansoprazole accumulated in resting glands, and this accumulation was enhanced by treatment with 1μM of forskolin. In contrast, high levels of [¹⁴C] TAK-438 accumulated in both resting and forskolin-treated glands. Furthermore, a 2-h preincubation followed by washout demonstrated a slow clearance of [¹⁴C] TAK-438 from the glands. These findings suggest that TAK-438 exerts a longer and more potent antisecretory effect than lansoprazole as a result of its high accumulation and slow clearance from the gastric glands.  aPublisher supplied data 3amechanism of action 3arabbits 3asecretion 3adrugs 3agastric mucosa 3agastric acid 3aforskolin 3aproton pump 2a2-Pyridinylmethylsulfinylbenzimidazolesxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Ulcer Agentsxpharmacology 2aCells, Cultured 2aH(+)-K(+)-Exchanging ATPasexmetabolism 2aLansoprazole 2aPotassiumxmetabolism 2aProton Pump Inhibitors 2aPyrrolesxpharmacology 2aRabbits 2aStomachxcytologyxdrug effects. 2aSulfonamidesxpharmacology 0aincubation period1 aHori, Yasunobu1 aNishida, Haruyuki1 aKajino, Masahiro1 aInatomi, Nobuhiro0 tBiochemical pharmacology.g2011 May 1, v. 81, no. 9 p.1145-1151dElsevier Inc.x0006-29527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2011.02.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03262naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009100165300001600256520162300272592002801895650002101923650003101944650001001975650002301985650001202008650002202020650001302042650001302055650002402068650001402092650003002106650004302136650005202179650000902231650002102240650002302261650002902284653001602313653002402329653002202353653002402375653002002399700002202419700001902441700001602460700001802476773014502494856008402639852000902723655001202732IND60112797820221120181334.0161024e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011279782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2012.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIino, Toju10aCharacterization of nitrate and nitrite utilization system in Rhodococcus jostii RHA1  ap. 600-606.  aA polychlorinated-biphenyl degrader, Rhodococcus jostii RHA1, has the potential to be used in soil for the remediation of environmental contamination. It has been found that RHA1 genes, ro06365 (narK) and ro06366, encoding a nitrate/nitrite transporter and nitrite reductase, respectively, were highly upregulated during the growth in sterile soil. In this study, these genes and ro00862, a paralog of ro06366 were characterized to reveal the nitrate and nitrite utilization systems of RHA1. The transcriptional induction of ro06366 (nirB1) and ro00862 (nirB2) by either nitrate or nitrite was revealed by qRT-PCR. Deletion mutants for each gene exhibited retarded growth on either nitrate or nitrite as a sole nitrogen source. Furthermore, their double mutant, Dnit, grew on and consumed neither nitrate nor nitrite as a sole nitrogen source, suggesting that both nirB1 and nirB2 are involved in the utilization of nitrite and nitrate. A narK mutant, DnarK, exhibited no growth on nitrate and retarded growth on nitrite as the sole nitrogen source. DnarK showed no consumption of nitrate and reduced consumption of nitrite, suggesting that narK is essential for nitrate uptake and is partially involved in nitrite uptake. The induced transcription of nirB1, nirB2, and narK was repressed in the presence of 3 mM ammonium or more. The upregulation of nirB1 and narK in sterilized soil containing ammonium and nitrate suggests that the ammonium concentration of the sterilized soil is equivalent to less than 3 mM. The unique nitrogen metabolism system of RHA1 and its importance for the growth in soil are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrate 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agrowth retardation 3amutants 3anitrite reductase 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anitrogen metabolism 3apollution 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asoil 3asoil remediation 3asoil sterilization 3atranscription (genetics) 0aRhodococcus 0aNitrate utilization 0aNitrite reductase 0aAmmonium repression 0aActinobacterium1 aMiyauchi, Keisuke1 aKasai, Daisuke1 aMasai, Eiji1 aFukuda, Masao0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2013 June, v. 115 p.600-606dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, Japanx1389-17237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2012.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245009600157300001400253520152200267592002801789650001101817650001301828650001501841650000901856650001801865650001401883650001401897650003201911650001501943650001101958650001001969650001801979650001201997650001102009650001402020650001502034650001302049700001602062700001802078700001702096700002002113700001702133700001802150773012502168856007702293852000902370655001202379IND60765433520221120100933.0220419e20140327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076543352DNAL7 a10.17221/7315-vetmed2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTatara, MR10aChanges of amino acid concentrations in Polish Merino sheep between 21 and 150 days of life  ap. 68-75.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate plasma amino acid profiles and their interrelationships in male Polish Merino sheep at two different stages of their systemic development &ndash; at the neonatal monogastric stage and as a fully grown ruminant. Male lambs (n = 12, singles) were kept indoors in pens under standard rearing conditions and weaned at the age of 10 weeks of life. Blood samples were collected on day 21 and 150 of life. Free amino acids were determined in plasma using ion-exchange chromatography. There was a significant reduction in plasma amino acid concentrations between neonatal and functioning ruminants for threonine, serine, glutamate, proline, citrulline, tyrosine, tryptophan, lysine, histidine and arginine. Significant increases in the plasma concentrations of alpha-amino-butyrate and isoleucine were observed in 150 day old lambs. Except for glutamine in 21 day old sheep which was significantly negatively correlated with serine, glutamate, proline and tyrosine concentrations in plasma, the obtained results in younger and older groups of lambs showed 47 and 22 significant positive correlations between the evaluated amino acids. This study shows that decreases in plasma amino acid concentrations in 150 day old sheep with physiologically developed forestomachs are dominant in comparison to 21 day-old animals receiving maternal milk as a basic diet. Our results address the possibility of utilising improved amino acid supply for growing lambs with developed forestomachs. &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aMerino 3aarginine 3acitrulline 3adiet 3aglutamic acid 3aglutamine 3ahistidine 3aion exchange chromatography 3aisoleucine 3alysine 3amales 3amaternal milk 3aproline 3aserine 3athreonine 3atryptophan 3atyrosine1 aBrodzki, A.1 aPasternak, K.1 aSzpetnar, M.1 aRosenbeiger, P.1 aTymczyna, B.1 aNiedziela, D.0 tVeterinární medicína.g, v. 59, no. 2 p.68-75dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21422x0375-84277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/7315-vetmed3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245009800204300001600302520162100318592002801939596005901967596006302026650002602089650001602115650001802131650001902149650002902168650001802197650002102215650003402236650001402270650002802284650001802312700001402330700001802344700001202362700001502374700001702389700001702406773010402423856008302527852000902610655001202619IND60780643020221120114417.0220621e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078064302DNAL7 a10.1007/s10646-022-02539-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhuang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7032-450010aDissolved organic matter heightens the toxicity of tetrabromobisphenol A to aquatic organisms  ap. 725-734.  aTetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is a new type of persistent organic pollutant, which causes environmental pollution and health problems, and has attracted the attention of the international research community. Once released into the environment, TBBPA can interact with dissolved organic matter (DOM), which affects its behavior. However, the effect of DOM on the biological toxicity of TBBPA remains unclear. The toxic effects of TBBPA on three model aquatic organisms (Chlorella pyrenoidosa, Daphnia magna, and Danio rerio), in the absence and presence of DOM were investigated. The order of acute toxicity of TBBPA to the three aquatic organisms was D. magna > D. rerio > C. pyrenoidosa. In the presence of DOM the median effect/lethal concentrations values of TBBPA to the three aquatic organisms decreased by at least 32 (C. pyrenoidosa), 52 (D. magna), and 6.6% (D. rerio), implying that DOM enhanced the acute toxicity of TBBPA to all the organisms. Moreover, the higher the concentration of DOM, the higher the acute toxicity of TBBPA. Furthermore, the presence of DOM increased total reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by TBBPA in a concentration-dependent manner. A tracking analysis of total ROS in the three aquatic organisms also showed that the presence of DOM aggravated the accumulation of total ROS induced by TBBPA, indicating that oxidative stress is a characteristic mechanism of toxicity of TBBPA to aquatic organisms when DOM is present. In addition, the evaluated risk quotient indicated that the ecological risk of TBBPA to aquatic organisms can increase in environments rich in DOM.  aPublisher supplied data  aR2021Q03cqinglan project of jiangsu province of china  aBK20191403cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province 3aChlorella pyrenoidosa 3aDanio rerio 3aDaphnia magna 3aacute toxicity 3adissolved organic matter 3aecotoxicology 3aoxidative stress 3apersistent organic pollutants 3apollution 3areactive oxygen species 3arelative risk1 aSong, Lan1 aJin, Shiguang1 aYe, Nan1 aZhang, Fan1 aLuo, Tianlie1 aWang, De-Gao0 tEcotoxicology.g2022 July, v. 31, no. 5 p.725-734dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870048x0963-92927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-022-02539-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03723naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007300139245009700212300001800309500001100327520198500338592002802323596007002351596006102421596006102482650002002543650005802563650002002621650001902641650002502660650001902685650002202704650001502726650002202741650001202763650001502775650001302790650001002803651002502813700002002838700005702858700005902915700006002974773012503034856007303159852000903232655001203241IND60747599120221119190722.0210816e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074759912DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.157452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorán‐Ordóñez, Alejandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5815-608910aEcosystem services provision by Mediterranean forests will be compromised above 2℃ warming  ap. 4210-4222.  aREVIEW  aForests provide a wide range of provisioning, regulating and cultural services of great value to societies across the Mediterranean basin. In this study, we reviewed the scientific literature of the last 30 years to quantify the magnitude of projected changes in ecosystem services provision by Mediterranean forests under IPCC climate change scenarios. We classified the scenarios according to the temperature threshold of 2℃ set by the Paris Agreement (below or above). The review of 78 studies shows that climate change will lead to a general reduction in the provision of regulating services (e.g. carbon storage, regulation of freshwater quantity and quality) and a general increase in the number of fires, burnt areas and generally, an increase in climate‐related forest hazards (median + 62% by 2100). Studies using scenarios above the 2℃ threshold projected significantly more negative changes in regulating services than studies using scenarios below this threshold. Main projected trend changes on material services (e.g. wood products), were less clear and depended on (i) whether or not the studies considered the interaction between the rise in temperatures and other drivers (e.g. forest management, CO₂ fertilization) and (ii) differences in productivity responses across the tree species evaluated. Overall, the reviewed studies projected significant reductions in range extent and habitat suitability for the most drought‐sensitive forest species (e.g. −88% Fagus sylvatica), while the amount of habitat available for more drought‐tolerant species will remain stable or increase; however, the magnitude of projected change for these more xeric species was limited when high‐end extreme climatic scenarios were considered (above Paris Agreement). Our review highlights the benefits that climate change mitigation (to keep global mean temperature increase <2℃) can bring in terms of service provision and conservation of Mediterranean forests.  aPublisher supplied data  aCGL2017‐89999‐C2‐2‐RcMinisterio de Ciencia e Innovación  aIJCI‐2016‐30049cMinisterio de Ciencia e Innovación  aIJCI‐2016‐30349cMinisterio de Ciencia e Innovación 3aFagus sylvatica 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3aair temperature 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3adrought tolerance 3aecosystems 3aforest management 3aforests 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3atrees 3aMediterranean region1 aRamsauer, Julia1 aColl, Lluís,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8035-59491 aBrotons, Lluís1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4826-44571 aAmeztegui, Aitor1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2006-15590 tGlobal change biology.g2021 Sept., v. 27, no. 18 p.4210-4222dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.157453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005400152245011500206300001600321520105100337592002801388650002501416650001601441650001501457650002201472650001401494650002301508650000901531650001801540650002101558650001401579650002001593650001601613650001301629650002401642650002201666650001501688650000901703650000901712653001501721653001901736653001501755653002001770700001801790700001201808700005801820700001601878700001901894700001601913773010101929856008602030852000902116655001202125IND60635632020221116162451.0190402e20180930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063563202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.04.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLü, Jing,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6868-363210aComparative proteomics analysis of human and ruminant milk serum reveals variation in protection and nutrition  ap. 274-282.  aIn present study, 198, 169, 213 and 128 proteins were identified and quantified in human, cow, goat and yak milk serum respectively by using proteomics techniques.

The enzyme exhibited broad substrate specificity and catalyzed an oxidative deamination of the α-amino group of l-amino acids. The optimal enzyme activities for l-amino acids tested were observed in the pH range from 6.0 to 8.5, and more than 80% of the maximum activity was obtained at pH 7.5. The enzyme was stable in the pH range from 7.0 to 8.5, and the apparent Km values for those l-amino acids were small. We, therefore, developed a new enzymatic method for assay of l-aminoacylase activity using the l-AAO at pH 7.5. The new enzymatic method had advantages that the l-aminoacylase reaction was spectrophotometrically followed by measuring absorbance at 555 nm. The l-aminoacylase activity was assayed within 10 min using a small reaction volume. Thus, the new enzymatic method was simple and sensitive compared to the ninhydrin method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aamino acids 3adeamination 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme stability 3apH 3asubstrate specificity 0al-Amino acid oxidase 0al-Aminoacylase 0aRhodococcus 0aNinhydrin 0aN-Acyl-amino acid amidohydrolase1 aSatou, Shiina1 aMatsumoto, Erika1 aYoshida, Sachiko1 aYamada, Miwa1 aHibi, Makoto1 aOgawa, Jun0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2013 June, v. 115 p.613-617dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, Japanx1389-17237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2012.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245010600161300001400267520152300281592002801804650001301832650002101845650002901866650001601895650002101911650001001932650002201942650002101964650001801985650002002003651001102023700001702034700002602051773009002077856004402167852000902211655001202220IND50074890520221119083650.0140410e199707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007489052DNAL7 a10.1007/s0024899000352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnesio, A.M. 10aInfluence of the Hydrological Cycle on the Bacterioplankton of an Impacted Clear Water Amazonian Lake  ap. 66-73.  aFree-living and attached bacterial population sizes were determined fortnightly from December 1991 to December 1992 in natural and disturbed areas of an Amazonian clear water lake (Batata Lake, Pará, Brazil) impacted by bauxite tailings. The bacterioplankton showed distinct patterns during different phases of the hydrological cycle. Total bacterial population size and rates of thymidine incorporation (measured during high and low water phases) were high during low water, with values ranging from 3.3 × 10⁵ to 1.1 × 10⁶ cells ml⁻¹, and from 0.28 to 4.01 μg C l⁻¹ h⁻¹, respectively. The population size of free-living bacteria was larger at the natural station, while no differences were observed between attached bacterial populations at both stations. However, production and turnover rate of attached bacteria were high at the disturbed area. During low water, bacterial growth appeared to be driven mainly by the input of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from phytoplankton origin. During high water, bacterial abundance was reduced, probably as the result of dilution and the input of less labile DOC from floodplains. The presence of bauxite tailings seems to influence bacterial dynamics in an indirect way, probably due to shading of phytoplankton cells and, hence, reducing the DOC supply for bacterial growth. This study, the first on the microbial ecology of an Amazonian clear water lake, demonstrated that water level variations exert a strong influence on the bacterioplankton dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abacterioplankton 3adissolved organic carbon 3afloodplains 3ahydrologic cycle 3alakes 3amicrobial ecology 3amicrobial growth 3aphytoplankton 3apopulation size 3aBrazil1 aAbreu, P.C. 1 ade Assis Esteves, F. 0 tMicrobial ecology.g1997 July, v. 34, no. 1 p.66-73dSpringer-Verlagx0095-36287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002489900035  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245007800178300001800256520142400274592002801698650001701726650002101743650001801764650002701782650001001809650001801819650002301837650000901860650001301869650001101882650001001893650001501903650003301918650001201951650002201963650001301985700002901998700002702027700002802054700004002082700002402122700002602146773010702172856004802279852000902327655001202336IND50068984520221120225904.0130903e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006898452DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-012-0915-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález Álvarez, Jaime,10aMultivariate Characterization of Milk Fat Fractions by Gas Chromatography  ap. 2651-2658.  aA high-speed gas chromatography method has been developed to separate the fatty acids in different milk fat fractions obtained via the dry fractionation deodorization process (TIRTIAUX method). Exploratory data techniques, namely cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA), were applied to gas chromatographic data for fatty acids composition in these milk fractions. Cluster analysis allowed the authors to visualize natural groupings corresponding to milk fat cracking achieved via the TIRTIAUX method. Principal component plots showed that six fractions are grouped in different classes, each group being clearly distinguished. Furthermore, a relationship was established between these classes and fatty acids through PCA analysis. A discriminant linear model for predicting milk fat classes from fatty acid composition was computed; 99 % of the criterion variable (milk fat class) variance was explained by the constructed model. Enrichment in unsaturated cis-fatty acids in the olein fractions and in the saturated and unsaturated trans-fatty acids in the stearin fractions was visualized from chemometric analysis. This differentiation of the milk fat fractions on the basis of fatty acids composition will enable food industries to use these fractions in both an efficient and safe way to enrich dairy products, or other foods, for healthy consumption. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemometrics 3acluster analysis 3adeodorization 3afatty acid composition 3afoods 3afractionation 3agas chromatography 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amodels 3aolein 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3astearin 3atrans fatty acids 3avariance1 aAlonso, Juan Jose Mangas1 aLlorente, Daniel Díaz1 aVelasco, Cristina Botas1 aÁlvarez, María Dolores Gutiérrez1 aAbrodo, Pilar Arias1 aGomis, Domingo Blanco0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2013 Oct., v. 6, no. 10 p.2651-2658dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-012-0915-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02265naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245007900162300001600241520098200257592002801239650001201267650001201279650001201291650001701303650002501320650001401345650001201359650001701371650002001388650001401408650001401422650001501436650001201451650002001463650001101483651001001494700001501504700001601519700001601535700001401551700001701565773012701582856007701709852000901786655001201795IND60765434020221120053857.0220422e20140327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076543402DNAL7 a10.17221/7320-vetmed2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerez-Marin, CC10aUterine and ovarian remnants in an incorrectly spayed bitch: a case report  ap. 102-106.  aA spayed Samoyed bitch, 12 years old, was presented to the Veterinary Clinical Hospital of the University of Cordoba (Spain) with abundant vulvar sanguineous discharge over the previous three days. The clinical examination revealed a remarkable vulvar mass, which protruded through the vulvar lips. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed the presence of structures compatible with uterus and ovary, which had been presumably removed eight years previously. An exploratory laparotomy was carried out, which confirmed the presence of the right ovary and a remnant of the uterus. The histological evaluation confirmed a granulosa cell tumour in the ovary, and an enlarged portion of the right uterine horn with brownish contents. The vulvar mass was also surgically removed and fibroma with some fibrosarcoma areas was diagnosed. This case shows the evolution of ovary and uterus into the abdomen, which were incorrectly removed after ovariohysterectomy eight years previously. &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aSamoyed 3aabdomen 3abitches 3acase studies 3aclinical examination 3aevolution 3afibroma 3afibrosarcoma 3agranulosa cells 3ahistology 3ahospitals 3alaparotomy 3aspaying 3aultrasonography 3auterus 3aSpain1 aMolina, L.1 aVizuete, G.1 aSanchez, JM1 aZafra, R.1 aBautista, MJ0 tVeterinární medicína.g, v. 59, no. 2 p.102-106dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21422x0375-84277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/7320-vetmed3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03429naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002400188245016700212300001800379520199300397592002802390650000802418650001902426650002602445650001402471650001402485650001702499650001202516650001302528650001102541650001402552650001202566650001302578650000902591650002602600700002102626700002302647700002502670700001302695700002402708773010202732856008102834990002302915852000902938655001202947IND60089853020221120051947.0141102e20110515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008985302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcp.2011.02.0192doi7 aPMC30843272pmcid7 a213969172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaumann, Raymond P.10aKS900: A hypoxia-directed, reductively activated methylating antitumor prodrug that selectively ablates O⁶-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase in neoplastic cells  ap. 1201-1210.  aTo most effectively treat cancer it may be necessary to preferentially destroy tumor tissue while sparing normal tissues. One strategy to accomplish this is to selectively cripple the involved tumor resistance mechanisms, thereby allowing the affected anticancer drugs to gain therapeutic efficacy. Such an approach is exemplified by our design and synthesis of the intracellular hypoxic cell activated methylating agent, 1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-methyl-2-[[1-(4-nitrophenyl)ethoxy]carbonyl]hydrazine (KS900) that targets the O-6 position of guanine in DNA. KS900 is markedly more cytotoxic in clonogenic experiments under conditions of oxygen deficiency than the non-intracellularly activated agents KS90, and 90M, when tested in O⁶-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) non-expressing cells (EMT6 mouse mammary carcinoma, CHO/AA8 hamster ovary, and U251 human glioma), and than temozolomide when tested in AGT expressing cells (DU145 human prostate carcinoma). Furthermore, KS900 more efficiently ablates AGT in HL-60 human leukemia and DU145 cells than the spontaneous globally activated methylating agent KS90, with an IC₅₀ value over 9-fold lower than KS90. Finally, KS900 under oxygen-deficient conditions selectively sensitizes DU145 cells to the chloroethylating agent, onrigin, through the ablation of the resistance protein AGT. Thus, under hypoxia, KS900 is more cytotoxic at substantially lower concentrations than methylating agents such as temozolomide that are not preferentially activated in neoplastic cells by intracellular reductase catalysts. The necessity for intracellular activation of KS900 permits substantially greater cytotoxic activity against cells containing the resistance protein O⁶-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) than agents such as temozolomide. Furthermore, the hypoxia-directed intracellular activation of KS900 allows it to preferentially ablate AGT pools under the oxygen-deficient conditions that are present in malignant tissue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aanimal ovaries 3aantineoplastic agents 3acarcinoma 3acatalysts 3acytotoxicity 3aguanine 3ahamsters 3ahumans 3ahydrazine 3ahypoxia 3aleukemia 3amice 3aresistance mechanisms1 aIshiguro, Kimiko1 aPenketh, Philip G.1 aShyam, Krishnamurthy1 aZhu, Rui1 aSartorelli, Alan C.0 tBiochemical pharmacology.g2011 May 15, v. 81, no. 10 p.1201-1210dElsevier Inc.x0006-29527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2011.02.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009000166300001600256520113000272592002801402650002101430650002301451650001201474650000701486650001301493650003001506650001601536650002201552653002001574653001601594653003401610653003401644653003001678700001201708700001801720700001501738700001501753700001201768700001301780700001801793700001201811773014501823856008401968852000902052655001202061IND60112798220221120021439.0161024e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011279822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2012.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFei, Baojin10aRelationship between Escherichia coli AppA phytase's thermostability and salt bridges  ap. 623-627.  aIn order to study on the relationship between Escherichia coli AppA phytase's thermostability and salt bridges, and indicate an effective technical route of which factor to think about and where to modify at AppA for enhancing its thermostability, a salt bridge subtraction mutant E31Q and a salt bridge addition mutant Q307D were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. The residual activities of the wild-type AppA phytase, E31Q and Q307D were 31.42%, 17.46%, and 40.57%, respectively, after being heated at 80°C for 10 min. The salt bridge subtraction mutant E31Q showed 13.96% thermostability decreasement, and the salt bridge addition mutant Q307D showed 9.15% thermostability enhancement than the wild-type both without the pH and temperature optimum changed. It proved salt bridges play a key role in E. coli AppA phytase's thermostability and the α/β-domain of AppA may be sensitive to heat. Salt bridges and the α/β-domain of AppA should have high priority to think about to enhance AppA's thermostability for commercial application.

Protective antigen (PA) was used as an Anthrax biomarker in this study. For this purpose, five small peptides selective to various PA epitopes with different binding affinities were chosen and peptide-conjugated Au nanoparticle (AuNP) SERS probes were individually prepared using each peptide. Initially, five different SERS probes were separately used to detect PA and the sensitivities were compared. Next, the possibility of enhancing sensitivity by employing multiple SERS probes was examined. Rather than applying the probes simultaneously, which would induce competitive binding, each probe was added sequentially and an optimal probe-addition sequence was determined to provide maximal sensitivity. Finally, PA samples at seven different concentrations were measured with the optimal sequence. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.1 aM, and the enhancement was more effective at lower PA concentrations. The proposed scheme can be further applicable to detect other protein biomarkers to diagnose various diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aanthrax 3abinding capacity 3abiomarkers 3adetection limit 3aepitopes 3agold 3ananogold 3apeptides1 aCho, Jun-Haeng1 aYoon, Moon-Young1 aChung, Hoeil0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2016 Apr. 05, v. 88, no. 7 p.3465-3470dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.5b048733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03390naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002300188245011100211300001800322520145400340592002801794650000901822650001401831650001501845650001901860650001701879650001001896650001101906650001101917650001601928650001301944650001601957650001501973650002101988650001302009650001402022650002802036650004002064650001402104650002802118650002902146650002102175650003702196650003202233650001102265650003702276650002402313650004002337650002402377650004302401700001502444700002402459700002202483700002002505773010202525856008102627990002302708852000902731655001202740IND60089853120221120052054.0141102e20110515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008985312DNAL7 a214191062pmid7 aPMC30843692pmcid7 a10.1016/j.bcp.2011.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPayton, Florastina10a4-Methylcatechol-induced oxidative stress induces intrinsic apoptotic pathway in metastatic melanoma cells  ap. 1211-1218.  aThere has been a steady rise in fatalities associated with thick melanomas (>4mm). Although understanding of the biology of the disease has improved, effective treatment strategies for patients with advanced metastatic melanoma remain elusive. Therefore, more intensive testing of agents with therapeutic potential are needed to improve survival of patients with metastatic malignant melanoma. We have tested the ability of 4-methylcatechol, a metabolite of quercetin; a naturally occurring compound that is commonly found in a variety of fruits for its potential as an anti-melanoma agent. Our results show that 4-methylcatechol inhibits proliferation of melanoma cells in culture while not affecting the growth of normal human epidermal melanocytes. Further, the ability of metastatic melanoma cells to form colonies on soft agar was also inhibited. 4-Methylcatechol caused the accumulation of cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle and induced apoptosis. There was an increase in reactive oxygen species following treatment with 4-methylcatechol that led to apoptosis through the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. Treatment also inhibited cell survival mediated by Akt, a key player in melanoma cell survival. Taken together our results suggest that 4-methylcatechol exhibits cytotoxicity towards metastatic malignant melanoma cells while sparing normal melanocytes and should be tested further as a potential drug candidate for malignant melanoma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagar 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3afruits 3ahumans 3amelanocytes 3amelanoma 3ametabolites 3ametastasis 3aoxidative stress 3apatients 3aquercetin 3areactive oxygen species 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxpharmacology 2aApoptosis 2aCatecholsxpharmacology 2aCell Cyclexdrug effects 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aMelanomaxmetabolismxpathology. 2aNeoplasm Metastasis 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aSignal Transduction 2aSkin Neoplasmsxmetabolismxpathology.1 aBose, Rumu1 aAlworth, William L.1 aKumar, Addanki P.1 aGhosha, Rītā,0 tBiochemical pharmacology.g2011 May 15, v. 81, no. 10 p.1211-1218dElsevier Inc.x0006-29527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2011.03.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245012900172520094400301592002801245650002001273650001601293650001101309650002901320650001601349650001901365650001801384650001401402650002001416650004001436650001801476650001001494650002501504650001001529650002601539651002301565653003601588653001001624653001001634653002901644653002401673653001901697700002101716700001801737773011401755856008301869852000901952655001201961IND60644364120221119131751.0190712e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064436412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2019.1006592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArchibald, James P.10aDiel versus tidal cycles of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and radon in a coral reef in the Great Barrier Reef  aExcessive ultra-violet (UV) exposure acts synergistically with ocean warming to trigger coral bleaching. Photoinhibition in corals may be reduced by chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorbing UV light. This study assesses whether submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) delivers CDOM to the coral reef lagoon of One Tree Island (Great Barrier Reef). SGD was traced using radon (222Rn), a naturally occurring tracer. Time series observations revealed tidal radon and diel CDOM trends at One Tree Island. CDOM exhibited a strong negative correlation with PAR (R2= 0.50), and a weak positive correlation with 222Rn (R2= 0.13). Removal of time and light as drivers of CDOM resulted in residuals linked to radon at low tide and at night, but not at high tide or during the day. We conclude that CDOM was driven primarily by PAR fluctuations and light-driven oxidation with only minor contributions via 222Rn-traced SGD in this lagoon.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoral bleaching 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3adissolved organic matter 3agroundwater 3amarine science 3aocean warming 3aoxidation 3aphotoinhibition 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aradionuclides 3aradon 3atime series analysis 3atrees 3aultraviolet radiation 3aGreat Barrier Reef 0aSubmarine groundwater discharge 0aRadon 0aCoral 0aDissolved organic carbon 0aPermeable sediments 0aCoastal carbon1 aSantos, Isaac R.1 aDavis, Kay L.0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2019 May, v. 29 p.100659-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2019.1006593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003600149245008800185300001400273520125900287592002801546650002601574650001901600650001901619650001401638650002401652650000701676650001401683650002301697650003201720650001201752653002401764653002101788653002401809653001401833653002501847653002201872653002601894700003001920700001901950700002201969773013001991856008402121852000902205655001202214IND60567963420221122171438.0190318e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056796342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2017.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez Fernández, Adriana,10aEffects of ocean acidification on juveniles sea urchins: Predator-prey interactions  ap. 31-40.  aIncreasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere during the last decades has led to a significant decrease in ocean pH. Organisms that need carbonate to build their calcareous skeletons could be severely affected. In this study we focused on the effects of ocean acidification on juveniles of the sea urchins Paracentrotus lividus and Diadema africanum. We assessed the effects of decreased pH on two skeletal structures, spines and test, and their impacts on species performance to avoid predation events in the field. Juveniles of both study species were exposed for 100days to two treatments of pH: a pH of 8.0 (413.2μatm) and pH of 7.6 (1349μatm). Our results showed that D. africanum juveniles from the acidic treatment were more predated than those kept in the control treatment. These differences were not observed between treatments in P. lividus. Diadema africanum may be more sensitive to the indirect effects of ocean acidification on predator avoidance than P. lividus. However juveniles reared in a pH of 7.6 showed changes in shape in skeletal structures in both species. Considering these results in future scenarios, P lividus may be considered a “winning species”, and D. africanum a “losing species” in the climate change stake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParacentrotus lividus 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3ajuveniles 3aocean acidification 3apH 3apredation 3apredator avoidance 3apredator-prey relationships 3arearing 0aOcean acidification 0aIndirect effects 0aSkeletal structures 0aPredation 0aSea urchins juvenile 0aDiadema africanum 0aParacentrotus lividus1 aHernández, José Carlos,1 aBrito, Alberto1 aClemente, Sabrina0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2017 Aug., v. 493 p.31-40dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2017.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245015500167300001600322520126700338592002801605650002401633650002401657650002101681650001501702650001201717650003301729650001401762650002601776650002701802653002501829653001701854653002101871653002901892653003101921700002301952700002001975773014501995856008402140852000902224655001202233IND60112798420221120021330.0161024e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011279842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2012.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiroe, Ayaka10aCharacterization of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase derived from Delftia acidovorans DS-17 and the influence of PHA production in Escherichia coli  ap. 633-638.  aHeterologous expression of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase from Delftia acidovorans DS-17 (PhaCDa) in Escherichia coli JM109 leads to effective production of high-molecular-weight poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] [P(3HB)]. This study examined the effect of PhaCDa expression on P(3HB) production in E. coli JM109 (Da strain) by comparing with the strain expressing PHA synthase (PhaCRe) from Ralstonia eutropha (Re strain). First, the kinetic properties of PhaCDa were investigated. Among the five detergents examined, Triton X-100 remarkably activated PhaCDa, as well as PhaCRe. The affinity of PhaCDa for its substrate was lower than that of PhaCRe, whereas the maximum reaction rate of PhaCDa was higher than that of PhaCRe. However, the kinetic differences were not likely to influence P(3HB) production in the cells. Under conditions of P(3HB) production, the translational levels of monomer-supplying enzymes (PhaA and PhaB) were similar in both the Da and Re strains, whereas PhaC exhibited different expression levels: the abundance of soluble PhaCDa was lower than that of soluble PhaCRe. This observation suggests that the production of high-molecular-weight P(3HB) by the Da strain would be attributed to the low amounts of active PhaCDa in the cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCupriavidus necator 3aDelftia acidovorans 3aEscherichia coli 3adetergents 3aenzymes 3aheterologous gene expression 3aoctoxynol 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates 3atranslation (genetics) 0aPolyhydroxyalkanoate 0aPHA synthase 0aKinetic analysis 0aEnzyme expression levels 0aUltrahigh-molecular-weight1 aUshimaru, Kazunori1 aTsuge, Takeharu0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2013 June, v. 115 p.633-638dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, Japanx1389-17237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2012.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245009400159300001800253500002000271520152100291592002801812650002201840650002401862650001701886650002301903650001801926650001301944650001601957650001501973650001801988650003002006650001002036650001202046650001902058650002202077650001302099650001502112650001802127650001302145700001402158700001502172700002002187700001502207700001502222700002402237700001902261773013002280856007302410852000902483655001202492IND60571407920221121220804.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057140792DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.80602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jun‐wei10aProteomic analysis of peel browning of ‘Nanguo’ pears after low‐temperature storage  ap. 2460-2467.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Postharvest ripening of the ‘Nanguo’ pear (Pyrus ussuriensis Maxim.) can be impeded by low‐temperature storage. However, pears after long‐term refrigeration are prone to peel browning when returned to room temperature conditions. This study investigated the browning mechanism of ‘Nanguo’ pear stored at a low temperature by analysing the differentially expressed proteins between healthy fruit and fruit with peel browning. RESULTS: The results showed that 181 proteins underwent statistically significant changes. A categorisation of the disparately accumulated proteins was performed using gene ontology annotation. The results showed that the ‘metabolic process’, ‘cellular process’, ‘catalytic activity’, and ‘binding’ proteins were the most affected after low‐temperature storage. Further analysis revealed that the differentially expressed proteins, which are related to peel browning, are primarily involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway, linoleic acid pathways, fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, glutathione metabolism pathway, photosynthesis pathway, oxidative phosphorylation pathway, and glycolysis pathway. CONCLUSION: This study reveals that there are variations in key proteins in ‘Nanguo’ pear after low‐temperature storage, and the identification of these proteins will be valuable in future functional genomics studies, as well as provide protein resources that can be used in the efforts to improve pear quality. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aPyrus ussuriensis 3aambient temperature 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3agene ontology 3agenomics 3aglutathione 3aglycolysis 3alinoleic acid 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3apears 3apeeling 3aphotosynthesis 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3arefrigeration 3aripening1 aZhou, Xin1 aZhou, Qian1 aLiu, Zhi‐yong1 aSheng, Lei1 aWang, Long1 aCheng, Shun‐chang1 aJi, Shu‐juan0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2017 June, v. 97, no. 8 p.2460-2467dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.80603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245015500164520180900319592002802128650001102156650001702167650001302184650002002197650001302217650001102230650000902241650000902250650001702259700003102276700002302307700002202330773011902352856007702471852000902548655001202557IND60794237820221122053004.0220922e20220905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079423782DNAL7 a10.3390/land110914922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuryak, Zhanna A.10aSolutions for the Spatial Organization of Cropland with Increased Erosion Risk at the Regional Level: A Case Study of Belgorod Oblast, European Russia  aAmong the reasons for soil degradation, runoff-induced erosion causes the greatest damage to agriculture in European Russia. One of the effective tools for regulating soil erosion is changing the structure of sown areas and the composition of crops with a focus on soil conservation and rehabilitation land use. The aim of this paper is to present the results of the impact of the program on river-basin nature management and the adaptive landscape agriculture system (ALAS) on changes in soil losses due to storm erosion in one of the agriculturally most developed and, at the same time, most eroded administrative regions of European Russia—Belgorod Oblast. In this study, the calculation of potential soil washout was carried out for three cropland models: (1) The maximum erosion potential of the territory, expressed in terms of soil washout from bare (clean) fallow areas; (2) soil washout, considering the actual structure of sown areas over the past 10 years; and (3) soil washout, considering the full implementation of projects for the erosion-control organization of cropland within the framework of ALAS. The calculation of erosion-induced soil losses was carried out according to the USLE model adapted to regional environmental conditions, while the C-factor values were set separately for each model. For model 1, the average soil loss is 11.3 t/ha per year; for model 2, it is 3.5 t/ha per year; and for model 3, it is 2.2 t/ha per year. It was found that the current programs for the biologization of agriculture and the contour-reclamation organization of cropland would have a noticeable erosion-control effect. It is noteworthy that the greatest efficiency was modeled for areas with unfavorable relief conditions, with up to 40% reduction in soil losses as compared to actual ones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRussia 3acase studies 3acropland 3aerosion control 3aland use 3amodels 3arisk 3asoil 3asoil erosion1 aNarozhnyaya, Anastasiya G.1 aGusarov, Artyom V.1 aBeylich, Achim A.0 tLand.g2022 Sept. 05, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land110914923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01926naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003200148245008700180520049500267592002800762650002800790650001900818650001900837650001500856650001400871650001800885650001000903650001300913650001200926650001400938653002000952653002300972653001800995700003201013700003101045700003101076700002801107700002501135700004001160700003001200700002601230773012001256856008301376852000901459655001201468IND60688795120221120221435.0200804e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068879512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2020.1029962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamacho-Rozo, Cesar Augusto10aSudden Death by Ovarian Hemorrhage and Hemoperitoneum in a Pregnant Miniature Mare  aThis report describes a case of sudden death of a pregnant miniature mare due to an acute ovarian hemorrhage leading to fatal hemoperitoneum.

Awareness of the importance of sustainable practices’ implementation is currently greater than in the past. In this regard, leaders need to integrate sustainability into firm activities, making the business strategy’s sustainable development part. However, the understanding of leadership and its linkage to sustainable construction are still limited, thus more work is required to establish the leaders’ vital role in the implementation of sustainable practices. To our knowledge, the extant literature still lacks the empirical evidence to prove the relationships among sustainable practices, sustainability performance, and leadership competences of construction managers. Therefore, this study developed a survey questionnaire to collect data and used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to empirically investigate the relationships between sustainable practices (environmental, economic, and social) and sustainability performance and the moderating effect of construction managers’ leadership competences on these relationships. The findings revealed that environmental, economic, and social practices have the positive influences on sustainability performance. Moreover, this study also discovered that leadership competences strengthen the environmental practices-sustainability performance relationship. However, we did not find the empirical evidence to support the moderating effect of leadership competences on the relationships between economic, social practices and sustainability performance. This study attempts to fill the certain gaps of the sustainable construction literature and provides researchers and construction managers with a deeper understanding of the roles of sustainable practices and construction managers’ leadership competences in sustainable construction.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness planning 3acollective action 3aleadership 3amanagers 3aquestionnaires 3astructural equation modeling 3asurveys 3asustainable development 0aSustainable practices 0aLeadership competences 0aConstruction managers 0aSustainability performance1 aKim, Soo-Yong0 tSustainable Production and Consumption.g2019 Oct., v. 20 p.1-14dElsevier B.V.aInstitution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:23261x2352-55097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2019.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05342naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005400149245011000203520351500313592002803828596006903856596007503925650002504000650004104025650003204066650001404098650001404112650001204126650001804138650001804156650001204174650004504186650001604231650003304247650002504280650001604305650001104321650002104332650001704353650001804370650003104388650001404419651001004433653005404443700001104497700001204508700001504520700001304535700001604548773013104564856008404695852000904779655001204788IND60785902120221120032723.0220730e20220801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078590212DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-10-21-2139-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, H.

Ohwi, a traditional Chinese medicinal plant, is widely distributed in northeast China, such as in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning Provinces. In August 2019, C. terniflora var. mandshurica leaf blight was found in Harbin (45.72°N, 126.68°E), Heilongjiang, China. The incidence was up to 90% on the 0.4 ha plantation, and almost every plant leaf was withered. Initial symptoms were chlorosis at the leaf apex or margin, and the leaf apex gradually formed brown lesions. As the infection progressed, the lesions expanded, and leaves withered. Ten symptomatic leaves were randomly collected from 10 plants in a Clematis plantation. The leaves (5 × 5 mm) between symptomatic and healthy tissue were cut and disinfected with 75% ethanol for 1 min and 1% NaClO for 2 min, rinsed three times in distilled water, plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) on 90-mm-diameter Petri dishes, incubated for 7 days at 25°C, and further purified by the single-spore isolation method. The morphology of all 10 isolates was similar. The colonies were round or subround, 60- to 68-mm in diameter, velvety, and brownish green with distinct concentric rings. Conidiophores were solitary or clustered, suberect, brown, 30.3 to 82.4 × 2.5 to 5 μm (n = 150), and with a septum. Conidia were solitary or in chains, smooth surfaced, obclavate, ellipsoid, brown, 12.5 to 46.25 × 10 to 16.25 μm (n = 150), with two to seven transverse septa, and zero to three longitudinal septa. Conidia were produced continuously and extended in a synaxial manner. The morphological characters matched those of Alternaria alternata (Simmons 2007). Two representative strains, TXL0816 and TXL0916, were used for molecular identification. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1), RNA polymerase second largest subunit (RPB2), and Alternaria major allergen (Alt a 1) were amplified with the primers ITS1/ITS4 (Iturrieta-González et al. 2020), RPB2-5F2/RPB2-7CR (Khodaei and Arzanlou 2013), Alt-for/Alt-rev (Hong et al. 2005), gpd1/gpd2, and EF1-728F/EF1-986R (Nishikawa and Nakashima 2020), respectively. The obtained sequences were deposited in GenBank (ITS: MW403865 and MT508666, GAPDH: MZ298638 and MZ298639, tef1: MZ298640 and MZ298641, RPB2: MW432545 and MT510746, Alt a 1: MW432544 and MT501719). The phylogenetic tree of combined sequences showed that isolates TXL0816, TXL0916, and A. alternata CBS916.96 were clustered together with 100% bootstrap values. To verify pathogenicity, 20 leaves of eight plants were sprayed with spore suspensions (1 × 10⁶ spores/ml) of the 7-day-old isolates TXL0816 and TXL0916 (four plants were used as replicates for each isolate). As a control, four plants were sprayed with sterile distilled water. The plants were incubated at 25°C in a greenhouse. Twenty days after inoculation, brown lesions appeared on the leaf apex. The pathogenicity test was repeated three times. The fungi were reisolated from inoculated leaves with the same morphological and molecular traits as A. alternata, fulfilling Koch’s postulates. No fungi were isolated from the control group. To our knowledge, this is the first report of A. alternata causing leaf blight on C. terniflora var. mandshurica. This study provides a basis for the pathogenesis of the leaf blight on C. terniflora var. mandshurica and helps to formulate control measures to reduce future economic losses.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFC0500303-03cNational Key Research and Development Program  aGZY-KJS-2018-004cState Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine 3aAlternaria alternata 3aClematis terniflora var. mandshurica 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aallergens 3achlorosis 3aconidia 3aconidiophores 3aculture media 3aethanol 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3agreenhouses 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aisolation techniques 3aleaf blight 3aleaves 3amedicinal plants 3apathogenesis 3apathogenicity 3apeptide elongation factors 3aphylogeny 3aChina 0aClematis terniflora var. mandshurica (Rupr.)

In this work, we investigated oxidation of methionine-containing peptides during reversed-phase (RP) chromatographic separation. We first used a synthetic methionine-containing peptide to evaluate this artefactual phenomenon and then considered more complex samples (i.e., plasma and HeLa protein digests). The methionine oxidation levels of the peptides were systematically assessed and compared for the long-term use of the analytical column, the sample trapping time, the gradient length, the sample load and the nature of the stationary phase (HSS T3 from Waters, YMC Triart C18 from YMC Europe GmbH and BEH130 C18 from Waters). In addition to the oxidation of methionine in solution, we observed on the HSS T3 and the BEH130 stationary phases an additional broad peak corresponding to an on-column oxidized species. Considering the HSS T3 phase, our results highlight that the on-column oxidation level significantly increases with the age of the analytical column and the gradient length and reaches 56 % when a 1-year-old column set is used with a 180 min-long LC method. These levels go to 0 % and 18 % for the YMC Triart C18 and the BEH130 C18 phases respectively. Interestingly, the on-column oxidation proportion decreases as the injected sample load increases suggesting the presence of a discrete number of oxidation sites within the stationary phase of the analytical column. Those findings observed in different laboratories using distinct set of columns, albeit to varying degrees, strengthen the need for a standard of methionine-containing peptide that could be used as a quality control to appraise the status of the liquid chromatographic columns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aliquid chromatography 3amethionine 3aoxidation 3apeptides 3apost-translational modification 3aquality control 0aMethionine Oxidation 0aPeak Broadening 0aMass Spectrometry 0aComplex Samples 0aStationary Phases1 aHanozin, Emeline1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7717-99991 aBaiwir, Dominique1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1622-01181 aDecroo, Corentin1 aWattiez, Ruddy1 aDe Pauw, Edwin1 aEppe, Gauthier1 aMazzucchelli, Gabriel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8757-81330 tJournal of chromatography.g2021 Sept. 27, v. 1654 p.462449-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2021.4624493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04025naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245015800171520232200329592002802651650001902679650001802698650001802716650001502734650001902749650002302768650002002791650001502811650002602826650002702852650002502879650004202904650001802946650003402964650003402998650002703032650001803059650001003077650001103087650000903098653003903107653001703146653002003163653003203183700001503215700001803230700001703248700001703265773010703282856008503389852000903474655001203483IND60675545720221118235206.0200210e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067554572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2019.1135752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Dong Qing10aDistribution of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in aquatic plant-based systems: From soil adsorption and plant uptake to effects on microbial community  aThis study systematically explored the distribution of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) through soil adsorption and plant bioaccumulation in aquatic plant-based systems, derived from a surface flow constructed wetland (CW) planted with Typha angustifolia. The water-soil-plant systems were fortified with eight perfluoroalkyl subsntances (PFASs) at different concentrations. The potential for individual PFAS adsorption onto soil substrate and bioaccumulation in the plants increased with the increasing PFAS initial concentrations. Longer-chain PFASs exhibited higher affinity to soil substrate compared to shorter-chain PFASs. The highest concentration in the soil was observed for PFOS (51.3 ng g⁻¹), followed by PFHxS (9.39 ng g⁻¹), and PFOA (5.53 ng g⁻¹) at low PFAS level. The perfluoroalkyl chain length dependent trend was also seen in the roots with the highest individual PFAS concentration for PFOS (68.9 ng g⁻¹), followed by PFOA (18.5 ng g⁻¹) and PFHxS (13.4 ng g⁻¹). By contrast, shorter-chain PFASs were preferentially translocated from roots to shoots in Typha angustifolia. A significant (p < 0.05) positive correlation between bioaccumulation factor (BAFₚₗₐₙₜ/wₐₜₑᵣ) (whole plant) and perfluoroalkyl chain length was observed. PFASs content in the plant compartments increased with increasing PFAS concentrations in the soil. Mass balance analysis indicates that approximately 40.7–99.6% of PFAS mass added to the system was adsorbed onto the soil and bioaccumulated in the plant tissues of T. angustifolia. Soil adsorption played a vital role in PFAS mass distribution. The results of Illumina high-throughput sequencing show that the bacterial diversity decreased upon PFAS exposure. The most predominant phyla retrieved were Proteobacteria (24.7–39.3%), followed by Actinobacteria (4.2–41.1%), Verrucomicrobia (7.9–25.1%), Bacteroidetes (10.2–20.4%), Cyanobacteria (0.4–16.5%), and Firmicutes (1.1–6.4%). The PFAS enrichment caused the changes (p > 0.05) in the structure and composition of bacterial community. This study helps to gain insight into a better understanding of the potential for PFASs distribution in an aquatic plant-based system and the impact on dynamic of microbial community exposed to PFASs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aBacteroidetes 3aCyanobacteria 3aFirmicutes 3aProteobacteria 3aTypha angustifolia 3aVerrucomicrobia 3aadsorption 3abacterial communities 3abioaccumulation factor 3aconstructed wetlands 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aoverland flow 3aperfluorohexane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3aplant tissues 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoil 0aPerfluoroalkyl subsntances (PFASs) 0aPlant uptake 0aSoil adsorption 0aBacterial community dynamic1 aWang, Mo.,1 aHe, Qiaochong1 aNiu, Xiaojun1 aLiang, Yanna0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Feb., v. 257 p.113575-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.1135753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001900159245015000178520130800328592002801636650001801664650001501682650001601697650001301713650002101726650001701747650000901764650002001773650001301793650001501806650001301821650001001834650001101844653001601855653004601871653002101917653001601938653002601954700001701980700002101997700001802018700001702036700001602053700005802069773011502127856009402242852000902336655001202345IND60782086920221120094027.0220809e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078208692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2022.1100562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Ling-Xiang12aA versatile phosphorothioate bearing benzimidazole for the preparation of flame retardant, mechanically strong and high transparency epoxy resins  aIntegrating excellent flame retardancy, robust mechanical properties and high transparency into epoxy resin (EP) still remains challenging using available flame retardants at a super-low loading. S-benzimidazolyl diphenylphosphorothioate (DP-MBI) has been synthesized in an attempt to address this deficiency. The flammability of EP may be greatly diminished through incorporation of only 3 wt% DP-MBI. The resultant EP blend is self-extinguishing, displaying a V-0 rating and a LOI value of 32.6%. The release of heat and smoke during combustion is lower than those observed for combustion of pure EP. The improvement in flame retardancy is ascribed to the cooperation of phosphorus, nitrogen and sulfur moieties mainly in the gaseous phase. Moreover, by virtue of the incorporation of DP-MBI into the mainchain of epoxy macromolecules, the flexural and impact strength for an EP blend containing 3 wt% DP-MBI increased from 104.7 MPa and 31.1 kJ/m² for pure EP to 111.2 MPa and 37.1 kJ/m², respectively. Additionally, besides a good ultraviolet shielding effect, the transparency of the modified EP is 100% of that for pure EP. Generally, a versatile flame retardant for epoxy resins, effective at a super-low loading, with promising potential industrial promising application has been prepared.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzimidazole 3acombustion 3adegradation 3aepoxides 3aflame retardants 3aflammability 3aheat 3aimpact strength 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apolymers 3asmoke 3asulfur 0aEpoxy resin 0aS-benzimidazolyl diphenylphosphorothioate 0aFlame retardancy 0aTransparent 0aMechanical properties1 aLiu, Xin-Duo1 aZheng, Xian-Ting1 aDong, Ying-Qi1 aBai, Wei-Bin1 aLin, Yu-Cai1 aJian, Rong-Kun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6143-40190 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2022 Sept., v. 203 p.110056-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2022.1100563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245008200173300001600255500001500271520133200286592002801618650002201646650001501668650002701683650003201710650001301742650001301755650002601768650002501794650001201819650002101831650002101852653001601873653001001889653001101899653002301910653001001933700001601943700002001959700001901979700002101998700001902019700002402038773012302062856008502185852000902270655001202279IND60543291920221118102308.0190410e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054329192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2013.11.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIvanova, Desislava10aSmall RNA analysis of Potato Spindle Tuber Viroid infected Phelipanche ramosa  ap. 276-282.  a2019-12-06  aPlants defend themselves against virus/viroid infection by induction of a mechanism of viral RNA degradation or translation inhibition. This is achieved by the production of small RNAs referred to as small interfering RNAs and microRNA, the key molecules in establishment of RNA directed silencing. Potato Spindle Tuber Viroid (PSTVd) was the first viroid species to be identified as naturally infecting potato, and it was found to infect many other crop species, wild and ornamental plants. Recently the experimental host range of PSTVd was extended with the root non-photosynthetic parasitic weed - Phelipanche ramosa (L) Pomel. Here we examined the small RNA population in P. ramosa infected with PSTVd and we observed the presence of PSTVd derived small RNAs. The hotspot regions for production of those PSTVd specific small RNAs were defined by their mapping on the viroid genome sequence. Further, we evaluated the expression levels of selected conserved microRNA families in the viroid infected P. ramosa. Upon infection, two members of miRNA395 family were significantly accumulated, while several members of miRNA390, miRNA396, miRNA319, miRNA166, miRNA167 and miRNA159 were strongly down-regulated. All these findings imply the involvement of various small RNA classes in the P. ramosa response to PSTVd infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aornamental plants 3ahost range 3atranslation (genetics) 3aPotato spindle tuber viroid 3amicroRNA 3apotatoes 3asmall interfering RNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aviruses 3aOrobanche ramosa 3aparasitic plants 0aPSTVd sRNAs 0aPSTVd 0amiRNAs 0aPhelipanche ramosa 0acrops1 aMilev, Ivan1 aVachev, Tihomir1 aBaev, Vesselin1 aYahubyan, Galina1 aMinkov, Georgi1 aGozmanova, Mariyana0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2014 Jan., v. 74 p.276-282dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2013.11.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002300158245009100181300001600272520125600288592002801544650001101572650001401583650001901597650001501616650001201631650001401643650001601657650001201673650001201685650001101697650002001708650001701728650001501745650003501760650000901795650003001804650002701834650002401861650002701885700001801912700002401930700001801954773009401972856004002066852000902106655001202115IND50072181120221118123453.0140123e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007218112DNAL7 a243546762pmid7 a10.1111/mec.126182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhile, Geoffrey M.10aPromiscuity resolves constraints on social mate choice imposed by population viscosity  ap. 721-732.  aPopulation viscosity can have major consequences for adaptive evolution, in particular for phenotypes involved in social interactions. For example, population viscosity increases the probability of mating with close kin, resulting in selection for mechanisms that circumvent the potential negative consequences of inbreeding. Female promiscuity is often suggested to be one such mechanism. However, whether avoidance of genetically similar partners is a major selective force shaping patterns of promiscuity remains poorly supported by empirical data. Here, we show (i) that fine‐scale genetic structure constrains social mate choice in a pair‐bonding lizard, resulting in individuals pairing with genetically similar individuals, (ii) that these constraints are circumvented by multiple mating with less related individuals and (iii) that this results in increased heterozygosity of offspring. Despite this, we did not detect any significant effects of heterozygosity on offspring or adult fitness or a strong relationship between pair relatedness and female multiple mating. We discuss these results within the context of incorporating the genetic context dependence of mating strategies into a holistic understanding of mating system evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aevolution 3aheterozygosity 3ainbreeding 3alizards 3aphenotype 3aprobability 3aprogeny 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aGenetic Fitness 2aHeterozygote 2aInbreeding 2aLizardsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMale 2aMating Preference, Animal 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA1 aUller, Tobias1 aBordogna, Genevieve1 aWapstra, Erik0 tMolecular ecology.g2014 Feb., v. 23, no. 3 p.721-732dBlackwell Sciencex0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.12618  aDNAL 7aarticle02382naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245011400175300001200289520133800301592002801639650001401667650001101681650001601692650001001708700006101718700001801779700002101797700002901818773012901847856008301976852000902059655001202068IND60776608120221119061713.0220702e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077660812DNAL7 a10.1007/s13201-022-01665-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoghadam, Rahim Gerami10aEvaluation of discharge coefficient of triangular side orifices by using regularized extreme learning machine  ap. 145.  aThe present paper attempts to reproduce the discharge coefficient (DC) of triangular side orifices by a new training approach entitled “Regularized Extreme Learning Machine (RELM).” To this end, all parameters influencing the DC of triangular side orifices are initially detected, and then six models are extended by them. For training the RELMs, about 70% of the laboratory measurements are implemented and the remaining (i.e., 30%) are utilized for testing them. In the next steps, the optimal hidden layer neurons number, the best activation function and the most accurate regularization parameter are chosen for the RELM model. As a result of a sensitivity analysis, we figure out that the most important RELM model simulates coefficient values with high exactness. The best RELM model estimates coefficients of discharge using all input factors. The efficiency of the best RELM model is compared with ELM, and it is demonstrated that the former has a lower error and better correlation with the experimental measurements. The error and uncertainty examinations are executed for the RELM and ELM models to indicate that RELM is noticeably stronger. At the final stage, an equation is proposed for computing this coefficient for triangular side orifices and a partial derivative sensitivity analysis is also carried out on it.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3amodels 3auncertainty 3awater1 aYaghoubi, Behrouz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4575-92001 aRajabi, Ahmad1 aShabanlou, Saeid1 aIzadbakhsh, Mohammad Ali0 tApplied water science.g2022 July, v. 12, no. 7 p.145-145dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22883x2190-54877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-022-01665-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02144naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002500154245005500179300001600234506002800250520113900278592002801417506003701445653001501482653002101497653002801518653002601546700002601572700001701598773011701615856008901732852000901821655001201830IND60784942920221207130915.0201229e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078494292DNAL7 a10.21107/agriekonomika.v9i2.87872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHidayat, Syarif Imam10aKajian Food Waste untuk Mendukung Ketahanan Pangan  ap. 171-182.  aResource is Open Access  aKetahanan pangan dalam penelitian ini fokus pada aspek pemanfaatan pangan khususnya konsumsi pangan yang menyebabkan food waste, yaitu seluruh makanan yang layak dikonsumsi tetapi terbuang sia-sia.

Here, lettuce exposed to both perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) at different concentrations (500, 1000, 2000 and 5000 ng/L) in hydroponic media was investigated via metabolomics. Under the co-exposure conditions, the growth and biomass were not affected by PFOA and PFOS, but metabolic profiles of mineral elements and organic compounds in lettuce leaves were significantly altered. The contents of Na, Mg, Cu, Fe, Ca and Mo were decreased 1.8%–47.8%, but Zn was increased 7.4%–24.2%. The metabolisms of amino acids and peptides, fatty acids and lipids were down-regulated in a dose-dependent manner, while purine and purine nucleosides were up-regulated, exhibiting the stress response to PFOA and PFOS co-exposure. The reduced amounts of phytol (14.8%–77.0%) and abscisic acid (60.7%–73.8%) indicated the alterations in photosynthesis and signal transduction. The metabolism of (poly)phenol, involved in shikimate-phenylpropanoid pathway and flavonoid branch pathway, was strengthened, to cope with the stress of PFASs. As the final metabolites of (poly)phenol biosynthesis, the abundance of various antioxidants was changed. This study offers comprehensive insight of plant response to PFAS co-exposure and enhances the understanding in detoxifying mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactuca sativa 3aabscisic acid 3aamino acids 3aantioxidants 3abiomass 3abiosynthesis 3acalcium 3acopper 3adose response 3afatty acids 3aflavonoids 3ahydroponics 3airon 3alettuce 3amagnesium 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aminerals 3amolybdenum 3anucleosides 3apeptides 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytotoxicity 3aplant response 3apolyphenols 3arisk 3asignal transduction 3asodium 3astress response 3asulfonates 3azinc 0aPerfluorooctane sulfonate 0aMetabolic response1 aOyang, Xihui1 aXie, Xiaocan1 aGuo, Yang1 aLi, Zhifang1 aXi, Jialin1 aZhu, Dongxue1 aMa, Xiao1 aLiu, Bin1 aLi, Jiuyi1 aXiao, Zhiyong0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Jan., v. 256 p.113512-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.1135123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03398naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012000166300001600286500001500302520168400317592002802001650004302029650001602072650001602088650002602104650002002130650001502150650001202165650002202177650001402199650001402213650001202227650002202239650001202261650001002273650002102283650001302304650001002317653002402327653002602351653001202377653001002389653002202399653000802421653000802429653001602437653000702453653000802460653001302468700001602481700001602497700001302513700001302526700001602539773012302555856008502678852000902763655001202772IND60543292220221119134056.0190410e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054329222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2013.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Youjian10aGenome-wide identification and characterization of polygalacturonase genes in Cucumis sativus and Citrullus lanatus  ap. 263-275.  a2019-12-06  aPolygalacturonase (PG, EC3.2.1.15), one of the hydrolytic enzymes associated with the modification of pectin network in plant cell wall, has an important role in various cell-separation processes that are essential for plant development. PGs are encoded by a large gene family in plants. However, information on this gene family in plant development remains limited. In the present study, 53 and 62 putative members of the PG gene family in cucumber and watermelon genomes, respectively, were identified by genome-wide search to explore the composition, structure, and evolution of the PG family in Cucurbitaceae crops. The results showed that tandem duplication could be an important factor that contributes to the expansion of the PG genes in the two crops. The phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses suggested that PGs could be classified into seven clades, and that the exon/intron structures and intron phases were conserved within but divergent between clades. At least 24 ancestral PGs were detected in the common ancestor of Arabidopsis and Cucumis sativus. Expression profile analysis by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that most CsPGs exhibit specific or high expression pattern in one of the organs/tissues. The 16 CsPGs associated with fruit development could be divided into three subsets based on their specific expression patterns and the cis-elements of fruit-specific, endosperm/seed-specific, and ethylene-responsive exhibited in their promoter regions. Our comparative analysis provided some basic information on the PG gene family, which would be valuable for further functional analysis of the PG genes during plant development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aArabidopsis 3awatermelons 3aquantitative analysis 3aCucumis sativus 3acell walls 3apectins 3apolygalacturonase 3acucumbers 3aphylogeny 3aintrons 3aCitrullus lanatus 3atissues 3aexons 3apromoter regions 3afruiting 3acrops 0aExpression analysis 0aPhylogenetic analysis 0aQRT-PCR 0agenes 0aPolygalacturonase 0aEST 0aDAP 0aGene family 0aPG 0aORF 0aCucumber1 aLiang, Ying1 aLv, Meiling1 aWu, Jian1 aLu, Gang1 aCao, Jiashu0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2014 Jan., v. 74 p.263-275dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2013.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245015300210300001800363520124000381592002801621650001601649650001401665650001501679650001601694650001301710650002001723650001501743650001301758651000901771653001501780653002001795653001401815653001401829653001901843653001401862700001801876773013501894856008302029852000902112655001202121IND60785902620221120032752.0220730e20220801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078590262DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-10-21-2237-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKleczewski, Nathan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5671-672710aAssessment of Selected Commercially Available Seed Treatments on Suppressing the Effects of Red Crown Rot on Soybeans Under a Controlled Environment  ap. 2060-2065.  aCalonectria ilicicola is a soilborne fungus responsible for red crown rot (RCR) in soybeans. Recently, this disease has been detected in new areas within the United States and Asia, where it has been reported to cause significant yield losses. To date, no data on the efficacy of fungicide seed treatments for suppressing RCR in soybeans are available. We screened three commercially available soybean seed treatments (Acceleron STANDARD; Acceleron STANDARD + IleVO; Cruiser MAXX + Saltro) for impacts on germination, seedling growth, and disease caused by C. ilicicola under controlled laboratory conditions. The Cruiser MAXX + Saltro treatment improved final plant dry mass to levels similar to noninoculated controls. Both Acceleron STANDARD + IleVO and Cruiser MAXX + Saltro reduced percent root rot. Acceleron STANDARD alone did not impact root rot, indicating that the IleVO component was efficacious on C. ilicicola. These data indicate that IleVO and Cruiser MAXX + Saltro have potential for reducing early season impacts of RCR in soybeans. Future work assessing these seed treatments in field-grown soybeans is needed to better understand the role of seed treatments as components of an integrated management program for RCR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalonectria 3acrown rot 3afungicides 3agermination 3aroot rot 3aseedling growth 3asoil fungi 3asoybeans 3aAsia 0aascomycete 0aCylindrocladium 0afluopyram 0afungicide 0apydiflumetofen 0asoilborne1 aGeisler, Seth0 tPlant disease.g2022 Aug. 01, v. 106, no. 8 p.2060-2065dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-10-21-2237-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012500175300001600300520139200316592002801708650001801736650001201754650001901766650002501785650001101810650002201821653001401843653001701857653001201874653001501886653001501901653001201916653001501928700001701943700001801960700001801978773011701996856008602113852000902199655001202208IND60778956220221117224258.0220603e20220316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077895622DNAL7 a10.1080/17565529.2021.19117752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYates, Olivia E.

Yet, discussions of climate-related mobility often sideline Pacific understandings of well-being. This systematic qualitative review synthesizes the literature on the psychosocial and cultural impacts of climate-related mobility in the Pacific and outlines the methods employed in this field. We identified 36 relevant empirical studies from online databases and citations covering 28 cases of climate-related mobility. Our approach assessed studies against the Pacific Health Research Guidelines and the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. We conducted a thematic synthesis of qualitative findings, recognizing social factors influencing acculturation and relationship to land as superordinate themes for both cross-border and internal mobility. Eleven sub-themes were identified as outcomes of cross-border and internal mobility. Overall, climate-related mobility shifted people‘s relationships with their homelands, disrupting community and cultural continuities. People resisted disruptions through engaging with cultural practices, values, knowledge, and community life. Yet, even the least disruptive movements caused significant stress, suggesting that Pacific conceptualisations of well-being and land should be considered when developing climate policy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacculturation 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental policy 3apeople 3asystematic review 0amigration 0adisplacement 0aPacific 0awell-being 0apsychology 0aculture 0arelocation1 aManuela, Sam1 aNeef, Andreas1 aGroot, Shiloh0 tClimate and development.g2022 Mar. 16, v. 14, no. 3 p.250-267dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19683x1756-55377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2021.19117753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100003300186245007000219300002000289506007600309520133500385592002801720506003701748650002701785650001701812650002501829650001201854650001201866650001901878650002101897650002001918650001301938650001301951650001701964650002001981650002102001650001602022653002402038653001802062653002302080653001902103700001702122700002002139700002002159700001902179773017602198856007902374852000902453655001202462IND60172137620221207113642.0150602e20120626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017213762DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11087661092doi7 aPMC33870922pmcid7 a226453452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoronetti Mazzeo, Lorenza E.10aStress and aging induce distinct polyQ protein aggregation states  ap. 10587-10592.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMany age-related diseases are known to elicit protein misfolding and aggregation. Whereas environmental stressors, such as temperature, oxidative stress, and osmotic stress, can also damage proteins, it is not known whether aging and the environment impact protein folding in the same or different ways. Using polyQ reporters of protein folding in both Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian cell culture, we show that osmotic stress, but not other proteotoxic stressors, induces rapid (minutes) cytoplasmic polyQ aggregation. Osmotic stress-induced polyQ aggregates could be distinguished from aging-induced polyQ aggregates based on morphological, biophysical, cell biological, and biochemical criteria, suggesting that they are a unique misfolded-protein species. The insulin-like growth factor signaling mutant daf-2 , which inhibits age-induced polyQ aggregation and protects C. elegans from stress, did not prevent the formation of stress-induced polyQ aggregates. However, osmotic stress resistance mutants, which genetically activate the osmotic stress response, strongly inhibited the formation of osmotic polyQ aggregates. Our findings show that in vivo, the same protein can adopt distinct aggregation states depending on the initiating stressor and that stress and aging impact the proteome in related but distinct ways.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3acell culture 3aenvironmental impact 3amammals 3amutants 3aosmotic stress 3aoxidative stress 3aprotein folding 3aproteins 3aproteome 3asomatomedins 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3atemperature 0aprotein homeostasis 0apolyglutamine 0aHuntington disease 0aosmoregulation1 aDersh, Devin1 aBoccitto, Marco1 aKalb, Robert G.1 aLamitina, Todd0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 June 26, v. 109, no. 26 p.10587-10592dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11087661093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03457naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011200166520155900278592002801837650001901865650002901884650001601913650002401929650001301953650002101966650001501987650001102002650002002013650003002033650001502063650002002078650003102098650002002129650001702149650001702166650001502183650001902198650002702217650002102244650001602265650002802281650001302309650000902322650002502331653001702356653001602373653001502389700001302404700001802417700001302435700001702448700001502465700001802480700001802498700001502516700001902531700001502550700001702565773010702582856008502689852000902774655001202783IND60675546420221118235036.0200210e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067554642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2019.1134952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jiayang10aSelenium as a potential fungicide could protect oilseed rape leaves from Sclerotinia sclerotiorum infection  aSclerotinia sclerotiorum (S. sclerotiorum) is a soil-borne pathogen causing serious damage to the yield of oilseed rape. Selenium (Se) acted as a beneficial element for plants, and also proved to inhibit the growth of plant pathogens. However, whether Se could reduce S. sclerotiorum infection in oilseed rape, the related mechanism is still unclear. In this study, proper Se levels (0.1 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg) applied in soil decreased the lesion diameter and incidence of S. sclerotiorum in rape leaves. Se enfeebled the decrease of net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs) and transpiration rate (Tr), and maintained leaf cell structure. Se enhanced the antioxidant system of leaves, as evidenced by the maintenance of mitochondrial function, reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and the improvement of antioxidant enzyme activities including catalase (CAT), polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD). The upregulated defense gene expressions (CHI, ESD1, NPR1 and PDF1.2) of leaves were also observed under Se treatments. Furthermore, metabolome analysis revealed that Se promoted the metabolism of energy and amino acids in leaves infected with S. sclerotiorum. These findings inferred that Se could act as a potential eco-fungicide to protect oilseed rape leaves from S. sclerotiorum attack. The result arising from this study not only introduces an ecological method to control S. sclerotiorum, but also provides a deep insight into microelement for plant protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3aamino acids 3aantioxidant enzymes 3acatalase 3acatechol oxidase 3acrop yield 3aenergy 3aenzyme activity 3afungal diseases of plants 3afungicides 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3amalondialdehyde 3ametabolomics 3amitochondria 3aperoxidase 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aplant protection 3apolyphenols 3areactive oxygen species 3aselenium 3asoil 3astomatal conductance 0aOilseed rape 0aAntioxidant 0aMetabolism1 aJia, Wei1 aHu, Chengxiao1 aNie, Min1 aMing, Jiajia1 aCheng, Qin1 aCai, Miaomiao1 aSun, Xuecheng1 aLi, Xinran1 aZheng, Xiaoyan1 aWang, Jing1 aZhao, Xiaohu0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Feb., v. 257 p.113495-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.1134953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245010800176300001600284520123500300536011501535592002801650596009801678650003001776650001201806650001901818650002301837650001701860650001101877650002201888650002401910650001701934650001201951650001001963651001301973653003001986653002602016653002502042653003002067653001502097700001602112700002002128700002102148700002102169700002002190700001702210773011702227856008602344852000902430655001202439IND60778956420221117224254.0220603e20220316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077895642DNAL7 a10.1080/17565529.2021.20147772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSedebo, Dessalegn A.10aImpact of smallholder farmers’ climate-smart adaptation practices on wheat yield in southern Ethiopia  ap. 282-296.  aThis study explored factors that determine smallholder farmers’ climate change adaptation practices and their impact on wheat yield in the Lemo district of southern Ethiopia. Focus group discussions and stakeholder consultations were used to supplement survey data collected from 537 wheat smallholder producers. We performed an impact evaluation analysis by combining endogenous switching regression (ESR) with propensity score matching (PSM) model to address the issue of unobserved biases. The study indicates that gender, farmers’ education level, farming experience, cooperative membership, access to extension services, and weather information were significant determinants of smallholder household decisions for climate change adaptation practices. Both ESR and PSM models revealed that smallholder farmers’ adaptation practices significantly enhanced wheat yield by 34.35%. This implies that climate-smart practices adopted by smallholder farmers are vital for improving and sustaining wheat yield. Thus, our findings suggest that policy actions should consider existing smallholder farmers’ knowledge and practices in policy actions aimed at mitigating climate change impacts to sustain agricultural productivity.  aThis work was financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71873050].  aPublisher supplied data  a71873050cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3aagricultural productivity 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aeducational status 3afocus groups 3agender 3aissues and policy 3ameteorological data 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3awheat 3aEthiopia 0aClimate-smart agriculture 0aclimate change impact 0aendogenous switching 0apropensity score matching 0acrop yield1 aLi, Gucheng1 aEtea, Bekele G.1 aAbebe, Kidane A.1 aAhiakpa, John K.1 aArega, Yibeltal1 aAnran, Zhang0 tClimate and development.g2022 Mar. 16, v. 14, no. 3 p.282-296dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19683x1756-55377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2021.20147773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03177naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245010900163300002000272520185100292592002802143650002302171650002202194650002202216650001302238650002202251650001402273650002102287650001102308650001902319650001502338650001102353650001702364650001902381650003302400650001102433650003702444700003202481700002302513773012402536856007402660852000902734655001202743IND60640690120221118024937.0190504e20160613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064069012DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra09432e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajumder, Santanab10aNiO/Ag heterostructure: enhanced UV emission intensity, exchange interaction and photocatalytic activity  ap. 56503-56510.  aThe effect of direct Ag coating on the optical and catalytic properties of NiO flake-like structures has been investigated in detail in this work. Ag nanoparticle decorated NiO flakes were synthesized using a facile two-step process. The phases and crystal structure were examined using an X-ray diffractometer, whereas the morphologies of the synthesized nanostructures were investigated using FESEM and HRTEM. Interfacial interaction of the synthesized heterostructures was examined using Fourier transformation infrared and Raman spectroscopy. Importantly the LO phonon and magnon scattering mode of NiO are significantly affected by the Ag coating. The band gap of NiO is found to be lowered (direct band gap: 3.52 to 2.78 eV and indirect band gap: 2.72 to 0.50 eV) due to the change in valence band energy originating from the charge transfer process between NiO and Ag. A UV emission that depends on the crystal field splitting of the Ni d orbitals is observed to possess a blue shift along with their enhancement of intensity. Variation of the magnon scattering mode also reveals that the enhancement of exchange interaction with NiO nanoflakes causes the blue shift of the UV emission. The nonradiative part corresponding to this UV emission which is parameterized using the Huang-Rhys factor gets enhanced due to the lowering of the electron–phonon interaction. The photocatalytic activity of the synthesized heterostructures was evaluated using the catalytic decomposition of the dye methylene blue in aqueous solution. The results show that the NiO/Ag heterostructures exhibit a much higher degradation rate than virgin NiO flakes that might be from improved separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes. In particular, the pseudo-first-order degradation rate constant of NiO/Ag is found to be 10 times greater than bare NiO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaqueous solutions 3acoatings 3acrystal structure 3aelectrons 3aemissions factor 3aenergy 3amethylene blue 3ananosilver 3anickel 3anickel oxide 3aphotocatalysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilver 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aBhattacharjee, Swarupananda1 aGhosh, Chandan Kr.0 tRSC advances.g2016 June 13, v. 6, no. 61 p.56503-56510dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra09432e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245013000212300001600342520145900358592002801817596005701845650002401902650001901926650003601945650001801981650000901999650001202008650002902020650001002049650001602059650001202075650001302087650001902100650001702119650002302136650001502159650004302174650002002217650001302237773013502250856008302385852000902468655001202477IND60776609120221119063640.0220507e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077660912DNAL7 a10.1007/s13562-021-00688-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmutairi, Zainab M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7293-576710aMolecular characterization and expression profiling of NADH-ubiquinone reductase Complex 1 MLRQ Subunit in Pennisetum glaucum  ap. 361-369.  aMLRQ is a subunit of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydride (NADH)-ubiquinone reductase complex 1, the largest complex of the respiratory chain in the mitochondria. In this study, the PgMLRQ gene from pearl millet Pennisetum glaucum subsp. monodii (Maire) Brunken was sequenced and characterized to examine its expression under stress and during germination. The sequenced cDNA for PgMLRQ was 493 bp, containing an open reading frame of 282 bp. The translated protein is 94 amino acids length and contained a B12D domain from 5 to 73 amino acids. Transmembrane helix prediction revealed the deduced PgMLRQ protein accommodates transmembrane helix spanning from 14 to 30 amino acids embedded in the mitochondrion membrane. Transmembrane topology indicated that the hydrophobic N-terminal of the PgMLRQ protein was found outside the membrane while the C-terminal was inside the membrane. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed high expression of PgMLRQ in flowers during heading, whereas the expression in shoots, roots, and seeds of 5-day-old seedlings and spikes before ripening was low. Moreover, the expression of PgMLRQ in seedlings root under salt and short exposure to cold was substantially higher than shoots and seeds. However, exposure to drought during germination resulted in expression in roots lower than in shoots and seeds. The results of this study help to uncover of the role of the MLRQ in response to stress during P. glaucum growth.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019/01/9512cPrince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University 3aCenchrus americanus 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 3abiotechnology 3acold 3adrought 3aelectron transport chain 3agenes 3agermination 3aheading 3ahydrides 3ahydrophobicity 3amitochondria 3aplant biochemistry 3aprediction 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3astress response 3atopology0 tJournal of plant biochemistry and biotechnology.g2022 June, v. 31, no. 2 p.361-369dSpringer IndiawJournal:2089x0971-78117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13562-021-00688-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01339naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002700149245008400176300001600260520046700276592002800743650002600771650001000797650001500807650002200822650001900844650000900863773008300872856008500955852000901040655001201049IND4468976420221117180054.0141111e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446897642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodpol.2012.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGruère, Guillaume P.,10aImplications of nanotechnology growth in food and agriculture in OECD countries  ap. 191-198.  aThis article provides an analysis of the implications of the growth of nanotechnology in the agriculture and food sector in OECD countries.

X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to clarify the structures and morphologies of both the cubic In(OH)₃–InOOH precursor and cubic In₂O₃. The formation mechanisms of the In(OH)₃–InOOH precursor and cubic In₂O₃ were investigated. As an important semiconductor photocatalytic material, its photocatalytic properties have been tested. Under the irradiation of UV light, the cubic microporous In₂O₃ exhibits excellent photocatalytic properties to degrade eosin B (EB), which presents ∼95% degradation of EB after 3 hours and the degradation rates is 10.5 times that of commercial In₂O₃ powder. The high separation efficiency of electron–hole pairs results in high photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the photoluminescent properties of the cubic microporous In₂O₃ have been investigated as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aeosin 3airradiation 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotoluminescence 3aporous media 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asemiconductors 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet radiation1 aZhang, Xiao1 aHao, Zhen-wei1 aGao, Guan-dao1 aLi, Guang1 aLiu, Lu0 tRSC advances.g2014 July 21, v. 4, no. 59 p.31353-31361dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra03563a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245013500170300001600305520132100321592002801642650002101670650002901691650002101720650002301741650001301764650002001777650001301797650001301810650001701823650002201840650001501862650002501877650001601902650001001918653002201928653002201950653001901972653002701991653002502018700001702043700001502060700001602075700001802091700001702109700001602126700001402142773013502156856008702291852000902378655001202387IND60782088120221120093927.0220802e20220831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078208812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.06.1572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Huifang10aPreparation, characterization and food packaging application of nano ZnO@Xylan/quaternized xylan/polyvinyl alcohol composite films  ap. 635-645.  aXylan could be considered as a good potential candidate for food packaging film because of the vast source and biodegradability, however, its application was restricted by the drawbacks of poor film-forming property, humidity sensitivity, weak mechanical strength and poor antibacterial property. In this paper, xylan was firstly modified by quaternization to improve the film-forming property, then ZnO nanoparticles encapsulated by xylan (nano ZnO@Xylan) was prepared by nanoprecipitation method, finally a series of biodegradable composite films were prepared using quaternized xylan and polyvinyl alcohol with incorporation of nano ZnO@Xylan. The surface morphology, molecular structure and crystallography structure of the films were characterized. The addition of nano ZnO@Xylan decreased water vapor permeability and solubility, meanwhile obviously increased the ultraviolet shielding performance as well as the antibacterial properties of the films. The bacteriostasis rate of the films against E. coli and S. aureus reached up to 99 %. Furthermore, the preservation time of cherry tomatoes covered with ZnO@Xylan/QX/PVA films was extended to at least 21 days. In conclusion, all the results ensure that the fabricated composite films have considerable promising application in the food packaging industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibacterial properties 3abiodegradability 3achemical structure 3acherries 3acrystallography 3ahumidity 3aindustry 3apermeability 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3asolubility 3astrength (mechanics) 3awater vapor 3axylan 0aQuaternized xylan 0aPolyvinyl alcohol 0aNano ZnO@xylan 0aAntibacterial property 0aFood packaging films1 aXue, Tianren1 aWang, Shuo1 aJia, Xiaoli1 aCao, Shenghui1 aNiu, Baolong1 aGuo, Ruijie1 aYan, Hong0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Aug. 31, v. 215 p.635-645dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.06.1573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03770naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245022400170500002200394520215500416592002802571650002502599650001602624650001902640650001602659650002802675650001702703650001702720650001102737650002102748650003002769650003502799650001302834651001002847653000902857653001202866653001002878653002202888700001702910700001902927700001702946700001402963700001502977700001502992700001503007700001603022700001803038700001803056773008903074856005603163852000903219655001203228IND60795369320221122003817.0221004e20220925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079536932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1366392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Peiwei10aBreastfed infants’ exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances: A cross-sectional study of a municipal waste incinerator in China  aPre-press version  aA municipal waste incinerator (MWI) in Zhejiang, China, operating since 2008 was completely reconstructed from 2016 to 2019. In 2013, we conducted a cross-sectional study of breastfeeding mothers living near the MWI. We evaluated the concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) in the mothers' breast milk and their infants' estimated daily intake (EDI). To investigate the temporal variations of these pollutants, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 29 mothers in 2019. We assessed the levels of 18 PCB congeners, 17 PCDD/F congeners, and 21 per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) congeners in breast milk and estimated the EDI. The mean total concentrations of PCDD/Fs (ΣPCDD/Fs) and PCBs (ΣPCBs) were 81.2 and 4.90 ng/g lipid, respectively, while the toxic equivalent quantity (TEQ) levels of ΣPCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs (ΣDL-PCBs) were 2.7 and 1.4 pg WHO-TEQ/g lipid, respectively. Compared to our 2013 measurements, the mass concentrations of ΣPCDD/Fs and ΣPCBs decreased by 13% and 35%, respectively (3.361 vs. 2.915 pg/g wet weight [ww] and 269.1 vs. 175.0 pg/g ww, respectively). The TEQ-ΣPCDD/F levels decreased by 67% (0.241 vs. 0.080 pg/g ww), but the TEQ-ΣDL-PCB levels increased by 11% (0.046 vs. 0.051 pg WHO-TEQ/g ww). The median concentration of PFASs was 0.250 ng/mL, ranging from 0.151 to 0.833 ng/mL. The infants’ mean EDI of total PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs was 17.7 pg TEQ/kg body weight [bw], representing a 20% decline compared to 2013. The average EDI levels of PFOS, PFOA, and PFNA were 5.8, 17.9, and 1.7 ng/kg bw, respectively. A comprehensive comparison of the results with studies from around the world showed that the potential health risks posed by legacy PCDD/F and PCB pollutants were not as grave for mothers and infants living near this MWI, but the emerging PFAS pollutants represented a new cause for concern. The potential health risks posed by legacy PCDD/F and PCB pollutants were not particularly serious for mothers and infants living near the MWI, but the emerging PFAS pollutants raised new concerns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaverage daily intake 3abody weight 3abreast feeding 3abreast milk 3across-sectional studies 3adibenzofuran 3aincinerators 3alipids 3aperfluorocarbons 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3atoxicity 3aChina 0aPCBs 0aPCDD/Fs 0aPFASs 0aWaste incinerator1 aZheng, Yibin1 aWang, Xiaofeng1 aShen, Haitao1 aWu, Lizhi1 aChen, Yuan1 aXu, Dandan1 aXiang, Jie1 aCheng, Ping1 aChen, Zhijian1 aLou, Xiaoming0 tChemosphere.g2022 Sept. 25,  p.136639-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.136639  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100001900136245012700155300001600282520103900298592002801337650001201365650000901377650001201386650001501398650001501413650001001428650001901438650002101457650002301478650001701501650002301518650001801541650001401559650002201573650001401595650001601609650001001625651001801635700001901653773012901672856007001801852000901871655001201880IND60481498220221116225658.0160205e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048149822DNAL7 a10.1890/0801912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrelich, Lee E10aWill environmental changes reinforce the impact of global warming on the prairie–forest border of central North America?  ap. 371-378.  aWithin the next 50–100 years, the warming climate will have major effects on boreal and northern hardwood forests situated near the prairie–forest border of central North America. This biome boundary shifted to the northeast during past episodes of global warming, and is expected to do so again. The climate of the future will likely lead to higher mortality among mature trees, because of the greater frequency of droughts, fires, forest‐leveling windstorms, and outbreaks of native and exotic insect pests and diseases. In addition, increasing populations of native deer and European earthworm invasions will inhibit the establishment of tree seedlings. The expected net impact of these factors will be a “savannification” of the forest, owing to the loss of adult trees at a rate faster than that at which they can be replaced. This will cause a greater magnitude and more rapid northeastward shift of the prairie–forest border, as compared with a shift solely attributable to the direct effects of temperature change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adeer 3adrought 3aearthworms 3aecosystems 3afires 3aglobal warming 3ahardwood forests 3aindigenous species 3ainsect pests 3aintroduced species 3amature plants 3amortality 3apopulation growth 3aseedlings 3atemperature 3atrees 3aNorth America1 aReich, Peter B0 tFrontiers in ecology and the environment.g2010 Sept., v. 8, no. 7 p.371-378dEcological Society of Americax1540-92957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0801913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245009000167300001600257520107900273592002801352650001601380650001301396650002601409650002801435650001101463650001401474650001301488650001601501653002601517653002201543653001801565653001501583653001801598700001901616700001801635700001801653700001801671700001601689700001801705700001501723773010901738856008601847852000901933655001201942IND60095739820221117180318.0161021e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009573982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2013.03.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarzec, E.10aDielectric phenomena associated with the keratin–glucose interactions of nail plate  ap. 143-146.  aIn this study, we analyzed the effect of water and frequency on the dielectric properties of the nail plate in healthy individuals and in diabetic patients. The temperature dependencies of the loss tangent for both healthy and diabetic nail represent the relation between the electrical energy lost and stored in keratin–glucose–water complexes of this tissue. The differences between these materials concern the temperature ranges in which there appears the decomposition of loosely bound water. The effect of glycation on the loss tangent of the wet and the dry nail is supported by higher values of this parameter than in those describing the healthy samples in the whole temperature range and above 100°C, respectively. In addition, glycation lead to distinct increase in the dielectric relaxation decrement in permittivity and dielectric loss between the frequency of 500Hz and 100kHz for the wet and the dry nail. The results of this study indicate that the dielectric spectroscopy may be useful in observing the decomposition of water in the diabetic nail plate.  aPublisher supplied data 3abound water 3acolloids 3adielectric properties 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aenergy 3aglycation 3apatients 3atemperature 0aDielectric properties 0aActivation energy 0aHydrogen-bond 0aMacro-ions 0aDiabetic nail1 aWierzbicki, K.1 aOlszewski, J.1 aSamborski, W.1 aSkorupska, E.1 aBahloul, K.1 aKrzywicka, A.1 aKrauss, H.0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2013 Sept. 01, v. 109 p.143-146dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2013.03.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011300170300001400283520110800297592002801405650002701433650001201460650001201472650002001484650002301504650001601527650001101543650002101554650001401575650002001589650001301609650002501622653001101647653002401658653001701682700001701699700001401716700001801730700001301748700001701761700001301778700001701791773013401808856008701942852000902029655001202038IND60782088320221120093839.0220816e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078208832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.06.1602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Pi-Xian10aStructure and hypoglycemic effect of a neutral polysaccharide isolated from sea cucumber Stichopus japonicus  ap. 14-23.  aIn addition to its high nutritious value, sea cucumber has been recognized by folk medicine for a long time. This study investigated the structure and hyperglycemic activity of a neutral polysaccharide (NPsj) from sea cucumber Stichopus japonicus, whose molecular weight was determined as 301.75 kDa by HPGPC method. Monosaccharide composition analysis indicated that NPsj is a glucan. The structure of NPsj was obtained by combining the analysis of methylation analysis, FTIR, NMR, periodate oxidation, Smith degradation and ESI-MS, which is mainly composed of (1 → 4)-α-d-glucoses with β-d-glucose(1→) branches substituted at O-6 every 7–9 of 1,4 linked glucoses. An in vitro insulin resistance Hep G2 cells model and a 3 T3-L1 cells model were established, and the NPsj has significant effect to increase glucose consumption with no toxicity at 10–100 μg/mL. Furthermore, NPsj upregulates the phosphorylation of Akt1 and down-regulated GSK3β, and then reduces the phosphorylation of GS, indicating its mechanism of ameliorating insulin resistance via Akt/GSK3β/GS signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApostichopus japonicus 3aglucans 3aglucose 3aglycemic effect 3ainsulin resistance 3amethylation 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3aoxidation 3aphosphorylation 3atoxicity 3atraditional medicine 0aGlucan 0aStichopus japonicus 0aAntidiabetic1 aWu, Yan-Chao1 aLiu, Ying1 aLv, Shi-Zhong1 aYou, Yue1 aZhou, Ze-Lin1 aChen, Xi1 aLi, Hui-Jing0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 216 p.14-23dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.06.1603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245014300166300001600309520109800325592002801423650002001451650002601471650001201497650002601509650001101535650001801546650001801564650001301582650001701595650001501612650001101627650001101638651001001649653001101659653001201670653001701682653001201699653002101711700002101732700002401753773015501777856007801932852000902010655001202019IND60795369620221122003742.0221004e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079536962DNAL7 a10.18805/IJARe.A-57712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLallawmzuali, P.C.10aEffect of levels and sources of sulphur on growth and yield attributes of sesamum (Sesamum indicum L.) under rainfed condition of Nagaland  ap. 439-441.  aSulphur is an important component of plant amino acids, proteins, vitamins as well as enzyme structures which influence the productivity, quality of oil seed and its total oil content.

From all the treatments, T₁₀ (40 kg elemental sulphur ha⁻¹) recorded the highest plant height (cm), plant dry weight (g plant:¹), crop growth rate (g m⁻² day⁻¹), number of capsule plant⁻¹, length of capsule (cm), number of seed capsule⁻¹, stover yield (kg ha⁻¹), seed yield (kg ha⁻¹) and harvest index (%).  aPublisher supplied data 3aSesamum indicum 3aagricultural research 3aenzymes 3afield experimentation 3agypsum 3aharvest index 3alipid content 3aoilseeds 3aplant height 3aseed yield 3astover 3asulfur 3aIndia 0aGrowth 0aSesamum 0aStover yield 0aSulphur 0aYield attributes1 aTzudir, Lanunola1 aNongmaithem, Debika0 tIndian journal of agricultural research.g2022 Aug., v. 56, no. 4 p.439-441dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2026x0976-058X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18805/IJARe.A-57713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01775naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245007300159300002000232520081600252592002801068650001401096650001101110650001301121650001401134650000701148650001501155700002001170700002201190700002201212700001801234773010101252856007501353852000901428655001201437IND60577145920221121183754.0170806e20141125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057714592DNAL7 a10.1021/la503765a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIlly, Benoit N.10aUnderstanding the Selective Etching of Electrodeposited ZnO Nanorods  ap. 14079-14085.  aZnO nanotubes were prepared by selective dissolution of electrodeposited nanorods. The effect of solution pH, rod morphology, and chloride ion concentration on the dissolution mechanism was studied. The selective etching was rationalized in terms of the surface energy of the different ZnO crystal faces and reactant diffusion. The nanorod diameter and chloride concentration are the most influential parameters on the dissolution mechanism because they control homogeneous dissolution or selective etching of the (110) and (002) surfaces. Bulk solution pH only has an effect on the rate of dissolution. By accurate control of the dissolution process, the nanomorphology can be tailored, and the formation of rods with a thin diameter (10–20 nm), cavity, or ultra-thin-walled tubes (2–5 nm) can be achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorides 3aenergy 3ananorods 3ananotubes 3apH 3azinc oxide1 aIngham, Bridget1 aToney, Michael

Its fine structure was characterized by GPC, HPLC, FT-IR, GC–MS,¹HNMR and ¹³CNMR together with two-dimensional (2D) NMR spectra. The results revealed that in situ-EPS1 was a new heteropolysaccharide with molecular weight of 1.06 × 10⁵ Da, and was composed of mannose, rhamnose, glucose, galactose and fucose with the following repeating units. [Display omitted] Furthermore, the in situ-EPS1 exhibited significant antibiofilm effect against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Notably, the in situ-EPS1 did not interfere with the planktonic growth of MRSA strain, whereas inhibited its cell metabolic activity and the transcription of genes related to biofilm formation. This unique antibiofilm but non-antibacterial mechanism supposedly prevented the development of bacterial drug resistance, which may open a new door to fight against these drug-resistant microorganisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus helveticus 3abiochemical pathways 3abiofilm 3aexopolysaccharides 3afucose 3agalactose 3aglucose 3amannose 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3amolecular weight 3aplankton 3arhamnose 3ayogurt 0aIn situ exopolysaccharide 0aSayram ketteki yoghurt 0aMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)1 aChen, Xiaohong1 aYang, Renqin1 aLi, Wei1 aYin, Baixing1 aLi, Zhiyu1 aDong, Mingsheng0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 216 p.643-654dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.06.1643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04358naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012500166300001600291520261600307592002802923650002702951650002102978650001802999650002203017650002603039650002403065650002603089650001003115650004203125650002103167650002103188650001303209650002903222650002103251650002003272650002403292650001903316650001203335650002903347653003003376653002703406653002403433653002703457653004203484700001703526700001303543700001503556700001503571773012603586856008303712852000903795655001203804IND60573388620221119204859.0190318e20170901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057338862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2017.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Congyan10aResponses of soil N-fixing bacteria communities to Amaranthus retroflexus invasion under different forms of N deposition  ap. 329-336.  aSoil N-fixing bacteria communities (SNB) can increase soil N availability, which can facilitate invasions of many kinds of invasive plant species. Meanwhile, variability in the forms of anthropogenic N deposition can mediate obvious shifts in both soil physicochemical properties and soil microbial communities (especially SNB). This can alter the soil micro-ecological mechanisms of plant invasions via changes in soil characteristics and soil microbial communities, especially SNB. This study uses next-generation high throughput sequencing technology to provide insight into the effects of invasion by Amaranthus retroflexus L. on the structure and diversity of SNB under different forms of simulated N deposition (SND). Soil pH under A. retroflexus invasion under various forms of SND was 8.08% lower than controls under a NH4-N treatment (P<0.05), 15.15% lower than controls under a NO3-N treatment (P<0.05), and 6.57% lower than controls under CO(NH2)2-N and Mix-N treatments (P<0.05). Meanwhile, soil pH was one of the most important environmental variables explaining changes in the structure and diversity of SNB. The total number of species of SNB under A. retroflexus invasion was approximately 13.13% higher than controls for the NH4-N treatment (P>0.05), 11.00% higher than controls for the NO3-N treatment (P>0.05), 39.42% higher than controls for the CO(NH2)2-N treatment (P<0.05), and 27.67 higher than controls for the Mix-N treatment (P<0.05). The positive effects mediated by the combined treatments of A. retroflexus invasion and SND may be ascribed to enhanced soil nutrient content (especially N), which can enhance the abundance of the nifH gene. The effects of A. retroflexus invasion on the total number of species of SNB under organic and mixed-N addition were greater than under inorganic N addition. This may be a consequence of a disturbance of the balance of inorganic to organic N for SND, as a result of the addition of a single form of inorganic N, which can diminish the stimulatory effects of soil nutrient content on SNB under inorganic N. Another potential cause of this pattern may be stronger acidification under inorganic N addition, which can exert more pronounced effects on SNB. LEfSe analysis showed that some species changed significantly under A. retroflexus invasion in the presence of SND (i.e., Rhodobacteraceae under NH4-N and Proteobacteria under CO(NH2)2-N). Thus, A. retroflexus invasion in the presence of SND caused obvious shifts in certain species of SNB and increased the total number of species of SNB in particular, to facilitate its further invasion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthus retroflexus 3aRhodobacteraceae 3aacidification 3aammonium nitrogen 3abacterial communities 3aecological invasion 3aenvironmental factors 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ainvasive species 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrogen 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3anutrient content 3aplants (botany) 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil nutrients 3asoil pH 3asoil physical properties 0aAmaranthus retroflexus L. 0aInvasive plant species 0aNitrogen deposition 0aSoil N-fixing bacteria 0aHigh throughput sequencing technology1 aZhou, Jiawei1 aLiu, Jun1 aJiang, Kun1 aDu, Daolin0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2017 Sept. 01, v. 247 p.329-336dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2017.07.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245010700161300001800268500002000286520133000306592002801636650001201664650001501676650003101691650001001722650001601732700002501748700001901773700002401792700002501816773012901841856007301970852000902043655001202052IND60571405220221120153229.0170712e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057140522DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.80302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBojanić, Nemanja10aUsing the breakage matrix approach for monitoring the break release in the wheat flour milling process  ap. 2205-2214.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The breakage matrix approach is a mathematical tool to relate input and output particle size distribution from a milling operation. Adjustment of the break release in the flour milling process is extremely important because it affects granulation and quality characteristics of the stock and hence the total results and balance of the mill. In this study the breakage matrix approach has been used for the purpose of controlling the release on the front passages of the break system in the flour milling process. RESULTS: It has been established that, for any particle size distribution of wheat, it is possible to predict break releases together with the distribution of the release size fractions by using the breakage matrices. Also, the reversibility of this approach is examined, that is the possibility to identify the wheat particle size distribution that would result in desired break releases and/or the desired yields of different sized intermediate stocks under the given set of milling conditions. CONCLUSION: It is confirmed that the breakage matrix approach can be successfully used to predict the break releases. The reverse breakage matrix concept allows the determination of the wheat particle size distribution which would result in a targeted break release. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3amilling 3amonitoring 3aparticle size distribution 3awheat 3awheat flour1 aFišteš, Aleksandar1 aRakić, Dušan1 aTakači, Aleksandar1 aDošenović, Tatjana0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2017 May, v. 97, no. 7 p.2205-2214dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.80303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03644naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100006100188245012900249300001800378506007600396520224600472592002802718506003702746650001902783650002502802650002502827650002202852650001302874650004302887650002802930700002002958700001802978700001802996700002303014773011803037856008203155852000903237655001203246IND60622135620221207133902.0210311e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062213562DNAL7 aPMC62671582pmcid7 a305464862pmid7 a10.1007/s11625-018-0582-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBengtsson, Magnus1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3493-842210aTransforming systems of consumption and production for achieving the sustainable development goals: moving beyond efficiency  ap. 1533-1547.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe United Nations formulated the sustainable development goals (SDGs) in 2015 as a comprehensive global policy framework for addressing the most pressing social and environmental challenges currently facing humanity. In this paper, we analyse SDG 12, which aims to “ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.” Despite long-standing political recognition of this objective, and ample scientific evidence both on its importance and on the efficacy of various ways of promoting it, the SDGs do not provide clear goals or effective guidance on how to accomplish this urgently needed transformation. Drawing from the growing body of research on sustainable consumption and production (SCP), the paper identifies two dominant vantage points—one focused on promoting more efficient production methods and products (mainly through technological improvement and informed consumer choice) and the other stressing the need to consider also overall volumes of consumption, distributional issues, and related social and institutional changes. We label these two approaches efficiency and systemic. Research shows that while the efficiency approach contains essential elements of a transition to sustainability, it is by itself highly unlikely to bring about sustainable outcomes. Concomitantly, research also finds that volumes of consumption and production are closely associated with environmental impacts, indicating a need to curtail these volumes in ways that safeguard social sustainability, which is unlikely to be possible without a restructuring of existing socioeconomic arrangements. Analysing how these two perspectives are reflected in the SDGs framework, we find that in its current conception, it mainly relies on the efficiency approach. On the basis of this assessment, we conclude that the SDGs represent a partial and inadequate conceptualisation of SCP which will hamper implementation. Based on this determination, this paper provides some suggestions on how governments and other actors involved in SDGs operationalisation could more effectively pursue SCP from a systemic standpoint and use the transformation of systems of consumption and production as a lever for achieving multiple sustainability objectives.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aUnited Nations 3aconsumer preferences 3aenvironmental impact 3aissues and policy 3apolitics 3asustainability science and engineering 3asustainable development1 aAlfredsson, Eva1 aCohen, Maurie1 aLorek, Sylvia1 aSchroeder, Patrick0 tSustainability science.g2018 Nov., v. 13, no. 6 p.1533-1547dSpringer JapanwJournal:J000001136x1862-40657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11625-018-0582-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03365naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245013200164300001400296520190600310592002802216650004202244650001502286650002302301650002302324650001602347650001702363650001802380650001402398650001502412650001102427650001502438650000802453650001202461650001402473650002202487650002302509650002202532650001302554650001002567650001102577650001202588650001602600700001502616700002102631700001502652700001802667773009302685856004802778852000902826655001202835IND4471490520221120174120.0140426e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447149052DNAL7 a10.1007/s10457-011-9420-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGetnet Assefa,10aEffect of pre-feeding forage treatments, harvesting stage, and animal type on preference of tagasaste (Chamaecytisus palmensis)  ap. 25-34.  aTagasaste (Chamaecytisus palmensis), a multipurpose fodder tree, is highly productive in the tropical highlands. The forage has high crude protein (CP) concentrations but is reported to have low intake by ruminants. This study investigated the effects of plant harvest stage and feeding management (wilted, dried and fresh) on levels of tannins in tagasaste and on preference and intake by Menz sheep and cattle fed during the dry season. The treatments were (1) fresh tagasaste, (2) wilted tagasaste, (3) dried tagasaste and (4) native hay. There were three preference experiments using sheep (20.2 ± 0.66 kg) to investigate intake under ad libitum or restricted offering of the forages, and to assess effect of harvest age (6- or 10-month regrowth age) on ad libitum intake. In two further experiments ad libitum offerings of the forages were evaluated using young steers (131.2 ± 19.6 kg) and heifers (156.3 ± 5.4 kg). The CP (201 g/kg), hydrolysable tannin (150.2 g/kg) and condensed tannin (8.97abs measured as absorbance at 550 nm wavelength/g NDF) contents of tagasaste forage were not affected by the physical treatments and harvesting stage. When fed ad libitum, sheep preferred (P < 0.01) fresh forage to wilted or dry tagasaste (24.5 vs. 22.9 and 7.9 g dry matter (DM)/kg metabolic body weight (MBW). The restricted offering increased intake of the less preferred dried form. Regrowth age (6 vs. 10 months) did not affect sheep preference. Unlike sheep, steers and heifers preferred (P < 0.01) dried tagasaste rather than the fresh or wilted forage.

Methods to improve intake (for cattle), effects of long-term feeding and evaluation on the subsequent effect of anti-nutritional compounds during digestion and animal performance should be further investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChamaecytisus prolifer var. palmensis 3aabsorbance 3aanimal performance 3aanimal preferences 3abody weight 3acattle feeds 3acrude protein 3adigestion 3adry season 3aforage 3aharvesting 3ahay 3aheifers 3ahighlands 3along term effects 3amultipurpose trees 3aproanthocyanidins 3aregrowth 3asheep 3asteers 3atannins 3awavelengths1 aKijora, C.1 aKehaliew, Aemiro1 aSonder, K.1 aPeters, K.

Merr.]. The aims of this research were to compare planting pattern in soybean, evaluating soil moisture content (SMC), yield and water use efficiency (WUE). A 2-year field experiment (2006&ndash;2007) was carried out in the north of China. The summer soybean (cv. Ludou 4) experiment consisted of 5 planting patterns under the same plant population density (3.09 &times; 105 plant/ha), and row spacing (cm) &times; plant spacing (cm) was 18 &times; 18 cm (A), 27 &times; 12 cm (B), 36 &times; 9 cm (C), 45 &times; 7.2 cm (D), 54 &times; 6 cm (E). The results showed that SMC and soil storage water (SSW) decreased with evapotranspiration (ETa) increments after reproductive growth stage, and there were remarkable differences between treatments with decreasing rainfall. SMC curve characteristics in the 0&ndash;0 cm soil profile were related to rain; the scope changes of shallow SMC were higher than those of deep SMC. The study revealed that yield and WUE had a negative correlation with row spacing, and they were statistically greater in narrow rows, which approximated equidistant plant spacings, compared to wider rows (P < 0.05). The study also indicates that enhanced productivity and WUE of rainfed summer soybean can be achieved via row spacing reduction and plant spacing widening under uniform planting density.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3adevelopmental stages 3aenvironment 3aevapotranspiration 3afield experimentation 3arain 3asoil profiles 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asoybeans 3asummer 3asustainable agriculture 3awater use efficiency 3aChina1 aYang, G.M.1 aSun, S.J.1 aChen, Y.H.0 tPlant, Soil and Environment.g, v. 56, no. 1 p.1-7dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:17122x1214-11787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/73/2009-pse3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04066naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012100169300001100290520162700301592002801928596008801956596008302044596008302127596008302210596008802293596009502381650002502476650001602501650002302517650001802540650000902558650001202567650001202579650001702591650001302608650001202621650001102633700002402644700002502668700002602693700001902719700001802738700006102756700006002817700006602877700006002943700005903003700006103062700006103123700007103184773014103255856008303396852000903479655001203488IND60762084120221118192630.0220120e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076208412DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-021-03221-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTadioto, Viviani10aAnalysis of glucose and xylose metabolism in new indigenous Meyerozyma caribbica strains isolated from corn residues  ap. 35.  aAiming to broaden the base of knowledge about wild yeasts, four new indigenous strains were isolated from corn residues, and phylogenetic-tree assemblings on ITS and LSU regions indicated they belong to Meyerozyma caribbica. Yeasts were cultivated under full- and micro-aerobiosis, starting with low or high cell-density inoculum, in synthetic medium or corn hydrolysate containing glucose and/or xylose. Cells were able to assimilate both monosaccharides, albeit by different metabolic routes (fermentative or respiratory). They grew faster in glucose, with lag phases ~ 10 h shorter than in xylose. The hexose exhaustion occurred between 24 and 34 h, while xylose was entirely consumed in the last few hours of cultivation (44–48 h). In batch fermentation in synthetic medium with high cell density, under full-aerobiosis, 18–20 g glucose l⁻¹ were exhausted in 4–6 h, with a production of 6.5–7.0 g ethanol l⁻¹. In the xylose medium, cells needed > 12 h to consume the carbohydrate, and instead of ethanol, cells released 4.4–6.4 g l⁻¹ xylitol. Under micro-aerobiosis, yeasts were unable to assimilate xylose, and glucose was more slowly consumed, although the ethanol yield was the theoretical maximum. When inoculated into the hydrolysate, cells needed 4–6 h to deplete glucose, and xylose had a maximum consumption of 57%. Considering that the hydrolysate contained ~ 3 g l⁻¹ acetic acid, it probably has impaired sugar metabolism. Thus, this study increases the fund of knowledge regarding indigenous yeasts and reveals the biotechnological potential of these strains.  aPublisher supplied data  a454215/2014-2cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (BR)  a305258/2018-4cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a308389/2019-0cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a303735/2018-0cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a749/2016cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa e Inovação do Estado de Santa Catarina  aT.O. 2016TR2188cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa e Inovação do Estado de Santa Catarina 3aMeyerozyma caribbica 3aacetic acid 3abatch fermentation 3abiotechnology 3acorn 3aethanol 3aglucose 3ahydrolysates 3ainoculum 3axylitol 3axylose1 aMilani, Letícia M.1 aBarrilli, Évelyn T.1 aBaptista, Cristina W.1 aBohn, Letícia1 aDresch, Aline1 aHarakava, Ricardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1431-26651 aFogolari, Odinei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3055-24901 aMibielli, Guilherme M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8287-23171 aBender, João P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9822-31001 aTreichel, Helen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3810-30001 aStambuk, Boris U.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7507-10201 aMuller, Caroline,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0507-93551 aAlves, Sérgio L., Jr.cJr.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7787-971X0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2022 Feb., v. 38, no. 2 p.35-35dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44995x0959-39937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-021-03221-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03324naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100006200188245005200250300001800302506007600320520138400396592002801780506003701808650001701845650001201862650002201874650001501896650001701911650002201928650001801950650001001968650002201978650002102000650002502021650001902046650001502065650001102080650002002091650001702111650004302128650002002171650001702191650002502208650001502233651001002248651001002258700002202268700002102290700002702311700002502338700002102363700001702384700002302401700002402424700001702448773011802465856008202583852000902665655001202674IND60622135820221207133904.0210311e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062213582DNAL7 aPMC62671662pmcid7 a305464842pmid7 a10.1007/s11625-018-0586-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindgren, Elisabet1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8886-085410aSustainable food systems—a health perspective  ap. 1505-1517.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMalnutrition in all forms, ranging from undernourishment to obesity and associated diet-related diseases, is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, while food systems often have major environmental impacts. Rapid global population growth and increases in demands for food and changes in dietary habits create challenges to provide universal access to healthy food without creating negative environmental, economic, and social impacts. This article discusses opportunities for and challenges to sustainable food systems from a human health perspective by making the case for avoiding the transition to unhealthy less sustainable diets (using India as an exemplar), reducing food waste by changing consumer behaviour (with examples from Japan), and using innovations and new technologies to reduce the environmental impact of healthy food production. The article touches upon two of the challenges to achieving healthy sustainable diets for a global population, i.e., reduction on the yield and nutritional quality of crops (in particular vegetables and fruits) due to climate change; and trade-offs between food production and industrial crops. There is an urgent need to develop and implement policies and practices that provide universal access to healthy food choices for a growing world population, whilst reducing the environmental footprint of the global food system.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amalnutrition 3aobesity 3apopulation growth 3atechnology 3ahuman health 3aissues and policy 3asocial impact 3adeath 3aconsumer behavior 3aindustrial crops 3aecological footprint 3aclimate change 3afood waste 3afruits 3anutritive value 3ahealthy diet 3asustainability science and engineering 3afood production 3afood choices 3aenvironmental impact 3avegetables 3aIndia 3aJapan1 aHarris, Francesca1 aDangour, Alan D.1 aGasparatos, Alexandros1 aHiramatsu, Michikazu1 aJavadi, Firouzeh1 aLoken, Brent1 aMurakami, Takahiro1 aScheelbeek, Pauline1 aHaines, Andy0 tSustainability science.g2018 Nov., v. 13, no. 6 p.1505-1517dSpringer JapanwJournal:J000001136x1862-40657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11625-018-0586-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03742naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245013500172500001900307520208900326592002802415650002302443650002902466650002202495650002202517650002302539650002702562650001602589650001202605650001502617650001002632650001602642650003102658650001602689650002302705650004302728650002302771650002302794650001302817650001602830650002302846650001602869650001402885650002202899650001802921651001002939653001802949653001602967700002302983773008903006856008403095852000903179655001203188IND60688792220221120110226.0200607e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068879222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2020.1515932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassan, Mahmoud O.10aAllelopathic interference of the exotic naturalized Paspalum dilatatum Poir. threatens diversity of native plants in urban gardens  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUrban greening may enhance the distribution of exotic species that represent a threat for the native species in new urban systems. Paspalum dilatatum Poir. is one of the exotic naturalized species dominating in gardens of new urban ecosystems in Egypt. This study was conducted to evaluate the allelopathic interference of such species on the native plants in these habitats. The field study showed that the plots infested with Paspalum attained lower coverage, diversity and biomass of native plants than those free from it. Amaranthus viridis and Dactyloctenium aegyptium were completely absent from the sites involving P. dilatatum. Moreover, Paspalum-infested soils were of more water content, available nitrogen and extremely higher nitrogenase activity. In a greenhouse experiment, the rhizosphere soil under Paspalum reduced germination and growth of some native species, namely, Amaranthus viridis, Medicago lupulina, Melilotus indicus and Plantago amplexicaulis. Moreover, growth inhibition was inversely related to the seed size of these tested species. The spectrophotometric analysis revealed that higher contents of phenolics and flavonoids were detected in the Paspalum-infested soils in comparison with free ones. Besides, the high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis indicated the presence of some free phenolics and flavonoids with higher concentrations in Paspalum-infested soils. The results indicate that the exotic naturalized P. dilatatum had negative effects on coverage, biomass and diversity of the native species in urban gardens. The obtained inhibition in these criteria was not attributed to soil characteristics. Furthermore, the significant reduction in germination and growth of the target species under greenhouse conditions could be attributed to the higher phenolic and flavonoid contents in the Paspalum-infested soils. These findings suggest that allelopathy had, at least, partial role in the negative impact caused by P. dilatatum. This species may also represent a threat for the native plant communities in new urban ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthus viridis 3aDactyloctenium aegyptium 3aMedicago lupulina 3aMelilotus indicus 3aPaspalum dilatatum 3aPlantago amplexicaulis 3aallelopathy 3abiomass 3aflavonoids 3aflora 3agermination 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agreenhouses 3agrowth retardation 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3anitrogen 3anitrogenase 3aphenolic compounds 3arhizosphere 3aseed size 3aspectral analysis 3awater content 3aEgypt 0aExotic plants 0aUrban flora1 aMohamed, Howida Y.0 tFlora.g2020 May, v. 266 p.151593-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl51878x0367-25307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2020.1515933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01662naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245010300156300001600259520067500275592002800950650001800978650001200996650001801008650002201026650001001048700001401058700001501072700001701087700001601104773013001120856007701250852000901327655001201336IND60765431420221120232914.0220904e20101201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076543142DNAL7 a10.17221/73/2010-jfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVacek, S.10aStructure and development of forest stands on permanent research plots in the Krkono&scaron;e Mts.  ap. 518-530.  aThe research is focused on structure and development of forest stands from 5th to 8th forest vegetation zone in the Krkono&scaron;e Mts.

This quest, triggered by the 2030 Agenda, has however pointed to a gap in current research and policy analysis regarding how to think systematically about interactions across the SDGs. This paper synthesizes experiences and insights from the application of a new conceptual framework for mapping and assessing SDG interactions using a defined typology and characterization approach. Drawing on results from a major international research study applied to the SDGs on health, energy and the ocean, it analyses how interactions depend on key factors such as geographical context, resource endowments, time horizon and governance. The paper discusses the future potential, barriers and opportunities for applying the approach in scientific research, in policy making and in bridging the two through a global SDG Interactions Knowledge Platform as a key mechanism for assembling, systematizing and aggregating knowledge on interactions.  aPublisher supplied data  a642147cHorizon 2020 Framework Programme0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adecision making 3aenergy 3agovernance 3apolicy analysis 3asustainability science and engineering 3asustainable development1 aChisholm, Elinor1 aGriggs, David1 aHowden-Chapman, Philippa1 aMcCollum, David1 aMesserli, Peter1 aNeumann, Barbara1 aStevance, Anne-Sophie1 aVisbeck, Martin1 aStafford-Smith, Mark0 tSustainability science.g2018 Nov., v. 13, no. 6 p.1489-1503dSpringer JapanwJournal:J000001136x1862-40657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11625-018-0604-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245010500173520178800278592002802066650001202094650001502106650001702121650001102138650002202149650001102171650002102182650001502203650001302218650001502231650002502246650001002271651000902281653001302290653002902303653002702332653002602359653002202385653002502407700002502432700001902457700002202476700002302498700001902521773011202540856008402652852000902736655001202745IND60644361220221119131637.0210121e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064436122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e006622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToosi, Neda Bihamta10aComparing different classification algorithms for monitoring mangrove cover changes in southern Iran  aMangrove forests in Iran are highly productive and complex ecosystems since they represent the interface between land and sea. They are a unique environment for supporting biodiversity, and they provide direct and indirect benefits to humans. Investigating changes in mangrove forests is essential for ecologists and forest managers to improve the assessment and conservation of natural ecosystems. The goals of the present study include: (I) to evaluate and compare four supervised classification algorithms based on Landsat time series imagery to detect mangrove cover in southern Iran, (II) to detect changes in mangrove cover between 1985, 1998, and 2017; and (III) to compare the four different predictions resulting from the applied classification algorithms. An accuracy assessment was conducted using k-fold cross-validation and independent validation, and differences between the classification techniques were analyzed. Although all four algorithms produced high overall accuracy (ranging from 81% to 93%) and Kappa values (from 0.81 to 0.92), visual comparisons of the predictions revealed that Random Forest (RF) performed best. The results of the change analysis showed that mangrove cover areas decreased by approximately 4% from 1985 to 1998 and then increased by approximately 8.9% from 1998 to 2017. A change detection map shows a decrease in mangrove cover in near coastal regions, such as the Tabl and Gavarzin areas, and an increase in mangrove cover at a distance from the Qeshm coastline that involves open spaces between the trees. Rising water levels and human development are important factors in the decline of mangroves. The findings of this research are useful for the management, restoration and conservation planning of mangrove forest in southern Iran.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aalgorithms 3abiodiversity 3acoasts 3ahuman development 3ahumans 3amangrove forests 3amonitoring 3aplanning 3aprediction 3atime series analysis 3atrees 3aIran 0aMangrove 0aRandom forest classifier 0aSupport vector machine 0aDiscriminant analysis 0aLand cover change 0aStatistical analysis1 aSoffianian, Ali Reza1 aFakheran, Sima1 aPourmanafi, Saeid1 aGinzler, Christian1 aWaser, Lars T.0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2019 July, v. 19 p.e00662-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e006623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02168naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011100166300001800277520079200295592002801087650001001115650001801125650001801143650001101161650001401172650001901186650002401205650001901229650002001248653001001268653001001278653001701288653001901305700001801324700001601342700001401358700001301372700001501385700001301400700001401413700002001427773015601447856008601603852000901689655001201698IND60539294220221117053451.0190215e20141128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053929422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2014.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Jinxia10aFERM domain-containing protein FRMD5 regulates cell motility via binding to integrin β5 subunit and ROCK1  ap. 4348-4356.  aFRMD5 is a novel FERM domain-containing protein depicted in tumor progression. However, the mechanisms underlying FRMD5 inhibition of cell migration is largely unknown. Here, we show that FRMD5 regulates cell migration by interacting with integrin β5 cytoplasmic tail and ROCK1 in human lung cancer cells. FRMD5 promotes cell–matrix adhesion and cell spreading on vitronectin, and thus inhibits cell migration. Furthermore, FRMD5 interacts with ROCK1 and inhibits its activation that leads to the inhibition of myosin light chain phosphorylation and the actin stress fiber formation. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the putative tumor suppressive protein FRMD5 regulates tumor cell motility via a dual pathway involving FRMD5 binding to integrin β5 tail and to ROCK1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3acell adhesion 3acell movement 3ahumans 3aintegrins 3alung neoplasms 3amyosin light chains 3aneoplasm cells 3aphosphorylation 0aFRMD5 0aROCK1 0aIntegrin β5 0aCell migration1 aNiu, Miaomiao1 aLi, Xueying1 aLu, Danyu1 aCui, Jia1 aXu, Weizhi1 aLi, Gang1 aZhan, Jun1 aZhang, Hongquan0 tFEBS letters.g2014 Nov. 28, v. 588, no. 23 p.4348-4356dElsevier B.V.aFederation of European Biochemical SocietieswJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2014.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03795naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245015300163300001800316520231900334592002802653650001502681650001702696650001502713650001102728650001502739650000902754650001202763650002202775650001102797650001602808650001402824650002002838650002602858650001802884650001102902650002102913650001302934650000902947653001202956653001002968653001502978653001802993700002003011700001603031773015403047856007903201852000903280655001203289IND60567961220221123000003.0190318e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056796122DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2016-120962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaulkner, M.J.10aEffect of source of trace minerals in either forage- or by-product–based diets fed to dairy cows: 2. Apparent absorption and retention of minerals  ap. 5368-5377.  aEighteen multiparous cows were used in a split-plot replicated Latin square with two 28-d periods to evaluate the effects of source of supplemental Cu, Zn, and Mn (sulfates or hydroxy) on apparent absorption of minerals when fed in either a forage- or by-product–based diet. The by-product diets were formulated to have greater concentrations of NDF and lesser concentrations of starch, and specific ingredients were chosen because they were good sources of soluble fiber and β-glucans, which bind trace minerals in nonruminants. We hypothesized that hydroxy trace minerals would interact less with digesta and have greater apparent absorption compared with sulfate minerals, and the difference in apparent absorption would be greater for the by-product diet compared with the forage-based diet. During the 56-d experiment, cows remained on the same fiber treatment but source of supplemental trace mineral was different for each 28-d period; thus, all cows were exposed to both mineral treatments. During each period cows were fed no supplemental Cu, Zn, or Mn for 16 d, followed by 12 d of feeding supplemental minerals from either sulfate or hydroxy sources. Supplemental minerals for each of the mineral sources fed provided approximately 10, 35, and 32 mg/kg of supplemental Cu, Zn, and Mn, respectively, for both fiber treatments. Total Cu, Zn, and Mn dietary concentrations, respectively, were approximately 19, 65, and 70 mg/kg for the forage diets and 21, 85, and 79 for the by-product diets. Treatment had no effect on dry matter intake (24.2 kg/d) or milk production (34.9 kg/d). Cows consuming the by-product diets had greater Zn (1,863 vs. 1,453 mg/d) and Mn (1,790 vs. 1,588 mg/d) intake compared with cows fed forage diets, but apparent Zn absorption was similar between treatments. Manganese apparent absorption was greater for the by-product diets compared with the forage diets (16 vs. 11%). A fiber by mineral interaction was observed for Cu apparent absorption, as cows fed hydroxy minerals with forage diets had greater apparent absorption compared with cows fed sulfate minerals; however, the opposite was observed with the by-product diets. Source of supplemental trace minerals and type of fiber in diets affected availability of Cu and Mn and should be considered in ration formulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abeta-glucans 3abyproducts 3acopper 3adairy cows 3adiet 3adigesta 3adry matter intake 3aforage 3aingredients 3amanganese 3amilk production 3amonogastric livestock 3asoluble fiber 3astarch 3asulfate minerals 3asulfates 3azinc 0amineral 0afiber 0aby-product 0adigestibility1 aSt-Pierre, N.R.1 aWeiss, W.P.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2017 July, v. 100, no. 7 p.5368-5377dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2016-120963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012400164300001600288520119300304592002801497596005901525596007601584650002001660650001601680650002601696650002101722650001501743650001201758650000901770650000901779650002201788650001001810700005301820700002001873700001801893773013201911856008302043852000902126655001202135IND60780640820221120103800.0220621e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078064082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10333-022-00894-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Liyan10aEffects of no-tillage practice for late-rice on rice yield and global warming potential in double-cropping rice systems  ap. 441-447.  aDouble-cropping rice systems lead to intensive greenhouse gas emissions. No-tillage in late-rice season may be a viable practice to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions without compromising rice yield. A field experiment was conducted with two treatments: tillage for both early-and late-rice (T-T) and tillage for early-rice whereas no-tillage for late-rice (T-NT). The mitigation effect of no-tillage on CH₄ was mainly observed in the early vegetative stage. The difference of N₂O fluxes between the treatments was mainly observed after fertilization. For the T-T and the T-NT in late-rice season, respectively, seasonal CH₄ emissions were 575.1 and 502.9 kg ha⁻¹, seasonal N₂O emissions were 0.074 and 0.218 kg ha⁻¹, and rice yields were 5687 and 5169 kg ha⁻¹. CH₄ emission was responsible for more than 99% of the global warming potential (GWP). As a result, the T-NT decreased area-scaled GWP by 12.3%, but only decreased yield-scaled GWP by 3.0% due to yield decline by 9.1%. These results reveal that the T-NT is an effective practice in mitigating area-scaled GWP, the risk of yield loss, however, will undermine farmers’ willingness to adopt the practice.  aPublisher supplied data  a41401292cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a202104i07020005cKey Research and Development Program of Anhui Province 3adouble cropping 3aenvironment 3afield experimentation 3agreenhouse gases 3ano-tillage 3apaddies 3arice 3arisk 3avegetative growth 3awater1 aWang, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0542-661X1 aDeng, Zhengmiao1 aXie, Yonghong0 tPaddy and water environment.g2022 July, v. 20, no. 3 p.441-447dSpringer Nature SingaporewJournal:J000000129x1611-24907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10333-022-00894-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011100167520134200278592002801620650002801648650003001676650002301706650001201729650002801741650002301769650002401792650001401816650002701830650002001857650001401877650001501891650002501906650002201931650001601953653002801969653001201997653001002009653005702019700001202076700001502088700001602103700001702119700001602136773011202152856008402264852000902348655001202357IND60644361420221119131712.0210121e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064436142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e006602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yuyang10aMorphological and physiological response of Acer catalpifolium Rehd. Seedlings to water and light stresses  aAs a critically endangered species, Acer catalpifolium Rehd. is included in the wild plants with extremely small populations (WPESP) rescue and protection plan. Understanding of the responses of A. catalpifolium to various resource and environment conditions could help identify potentially suitable environments for its conservation. We used an orthogonal experiment design to evaluate the growth, morphological and physiological responses of A. catalpifolium and a widespread same-genus species A. mono to diverse water and light stresses. The results showed that a 75% soil water holding capacity and moderate shade are suitable for seedling growth. Drought and shade had significant negative effects on plant growth, biomass accumulation, and physiological functions. Lowering specific leaf areas (SLA), increasing root biomass allocation, and pigment content were the main strategies for enhancing water and light capturing abilities to acclimate to the limited ambient resources. The general plasticity index of plant growth, biomass, and physiological characteristics were higher in A. mono than in A. catalpifolium. We also explored the suitable light and water requirements for A. catalpifolium seedling growth. Our research would be useful for population regeneration and could aid in biodiversity conservation of Acer species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer pictum subsp. mono 3abiodiversity conservation 3abiomass production 3adrought 3adry matter partitioning 3aendangered species 3aexperimental design 3aleaf area 3aphysiological response 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3asoil water 3asoil water retention 3awater requirement 3awild plants 0aAcer catalpifolium Rehd 0aDrought 0aShade 0aWild plants with extremely small populations (WPESP)1 aYu, Tao1 aMa, Wenbao1 aTian, Cheng1 aSha, Zhipeng1 aLi, Junqing0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2019 July, v. 19 p.e00660-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e006603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02093naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012500172300001800297520071800315592002801033650003201061650000801093650001301101650001501114650002301129650001501152650002201167653002201189653001001211653001001221653001101231653002401242653002401266700001801290700005801308700003001366700002401396773015601420856008601576852000901662655001201671IND60539294420221117053630.0190215e20141128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053929442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2014.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRebehmed, Joseph10aExpanding the SRI domain family: A common scaffold for binding the phosphorylated C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II  ap. 4431-4437.  aThe SRI domain is a small three-helix domain originally discovered near the C-terminus of both histone methyltransferase SETD2 and helicase RECQL5.

Combining sequence analysis with structural prediction, we show that this domain family is more diverse than previously thought and we predict critical structural and functional features.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aRNA 3ahistones 3ametabolism 3amethyltransferases 3aprediction 3asequence analysis 0aSequence analysis 0aPHRF1 0aSCAF1 0aSCAF11 0aFRIGIDA-ESSENTIAL 1 0aLSD1-like homolog 31 aRevy, Patrick1 aFaure, Guilhem1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9537-22771 ade Villartay, Jean-Pierre1 aCallebaut, Isabelle0 tFEBS letters.g2014 Nov. 28, v. 588, no. 23 p.4431-4437dElsevier B.V.aFederation of European Biochemical SocietieswJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2014.10.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03421naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245008900172520215500261592002802416650001702444650001502461650002402476650002602500650001502526650001502541650001902556650002402575650001002599650002202609650001202631700001802643700002302661700002002684700002702704700001902731700002302750700002102773773011202794856008402906852000902990655001202999IND60644361520221119131847.0210121e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064436152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e006512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelant, Jerrold L.10aTrack surveys do not provide accurate or precise lion density estimates in serengeti  aMore than 60% of the world's large carnivore species are threatened with extinction. Enumerating species abundance is critical for assessing their conservation status in response to anthropogenic threats and environmental stochasticity. Track surveys are commonly used to estimate abundance and density of large carnivore species, including lions (Panthera leo), but their suitability for estimating species abundance has been challenged. Recently developed regression models for track surveys of African large carnivores offer improvements over previous density estimators but have not been independently validated. We conducted weekly track surveys for lions in southeastern Serengeti National Park during 2015–2016 and applied one of these recent regression models, comparing corresponding lion densities to an independent density estimate in 2015 derived from a repeated call-in survey conducted during the same season. We surveyed 3289 km for tracks in total with overall lion densities of 41.2 (95% confidence limits [CL] = 31.9–57.9)/100 km² in 2015 and 34.6 (26.8–46.0)/100 km² in 2016. Within year point estimates of lion density varied up to 56% among weeks, though 95% CLs overlapped. Overall annual CLs from the track survey in 2015 did not overlap with the 95% credible interval from the estimate of lion density using a repeated call-in survey (14.36 lions/100 km²; 95% CrI = 9.04–29.31), suggesting overestimation of lion densities using track surveys in 2015. High between-year and among-week variation in density estimates from track surveys suggests that lion use of roads for movement varied over time and that other factors (e.g., prey distribution, luminosity) influenced lion movements independent of road distributions. We recommend caution when applying current track survey methods for estimating lion density and support application of survey designs that include direct observation of lions (e.g., call-in surveys), account for imperfect detection in a spatially-explicit framework, and incorporate environmental variables (e.g., prey, land cover) that can influence lion space use and movements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanthera leo 3acarnivores 3aconservation status 3aenvironmental factors 3aextinction 3aland cover 3anational parks 3aregression analysis 3aroads 3aspecies abundance 3asurveys1 aBled, Florent1 aMkasanga, Imani J.1 aWilton, Clay M.1 aMwampeta, Stanslaus B.1 aBeyer, Dean E.1 aMwakilema, William1 aFyumagwa, Robert0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2019 July, v. 19 p.e00651-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e006513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03486naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001300188245008900201300001800290520171100308592002802019650001702047650001402064650001902078650002002097650002502117650001002142650002002152650003102172650001002203650001502213650001602228650001602244650000902260650001202269650007702281650001402358650003702372650008202409650003402491650003002525650004302555650004202598650000902640650005202649700001602701773010202717856008102819990002302900852000902923655001202932IND60089850920221122055203.0141102e20110415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008985092DNAL7 a213000312pmid7 aPMC34803312pmcid7 a10.1016/j.bcp.2011.01.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, J.10aDose-dependent differential effects of risedronate on gene expression in osteoblasts  ap. 1036-1042.  aBisphosphonates have multiple effects on bone. Their actions on osteoclasts lead to inhibition of bone resorption, at least partially through apoptosis. Effects on osteoblasts vary, with modifications in the molecule and concentration both resulting in qualitatively different responses. To understand the mechanism of the differential effects of high and low bisphosphonate concentrations on osteoblast activity, we compared the effects of 10⁻⁸M and 10⁻⁴M risedronate on gene expression in UMR-106 rat osteoblastic cells. Two targeted arrays, an 84-gene signaling array and an 84-gene osteogeneic array were used. Gene expression was measured at 1 and 24h. Although some genes were regulated similarly by low and high concentrations of the drug, there was also differential regulation. At 1h, 11 genes (1 signaling and 10 osteogenesis) were solely regulated by the low concentration, and 7 genes (3 signaling, 4 osteogenesis) were solely regulated by the high concentration. At 24h, 8 genes (3 signaling, 5 osteogenesis) were solely regulated by the low concentration and 30 genes (16 signaling and 14 osteogenesis) were solely regulated by the high concentration. Interestingly, the low, but not the high concentration of risedronate transiently and selectively upregulated several genes associated with cell differentiation. A number of genes related to apoptosis were regulated, and could be involved in effects of bisphosphonates to promote osteoblast apoptosis. Also, observed gene changes associated with decreased angiogenesis and decreased metastasis could, if they occur in other cell types, provide a basis for the effectiveness of bisphosphonates in the prevention of cancer metastases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3aapoptosis 3abone formation 3abone resorption 3acell differentiation 3adrugs 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ametastasis 3aosteoblasts 3aosteoclasts 3arats 2aAnimals 2aBone Density Conservation Agentsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aCell Line 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEtidronic Acidxadministration & dosagexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aOsteoblastsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aOsteogenesisxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aRats 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction1 aStern, P.H.0 tBiochemical pharmacology.g2011 Apr. 15, v. 81, no. 8 p.1036-1042dElsevier Inc.x0006-29527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2011.01.0253Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02574naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245009300163520137600256592002801632650001701660650001401677650001901691650001901710650002401729650002401753650001401777650002001791650001701811650001201828650002001840650002001860650001701880650001401897700001801911700001601929773014601945856007602091852000902167655001202176IND60794235220221121233840.0220922e20220727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079423522DNAL7 a10.3390/jdb100300312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalloran, Daniel 14aThe Role of Protein Kinase CK2 in Development and Disease Progression: A Critical Review  aProtein kinase CK2 (CK2) is a ubiquitous holoenzyme involved in a wide array of developmental processes. The involvement of CK2 in events such as neurogenesis, cardiogenesis, skeletogenesis, and spermatogenesis is essential for the viability of almost all organisms, and its role has been conserved throughout evolution. Further into adulthood, CK2 continues to function as a key regulator of pathways affecting crucial processes such as osteogenesis, adipogenesis, chondrogenesis, neuron differentiation, and the immune response. Due to its vast role in a multitude of pathways, aberrant functioning of this kinase leads to embryonic lethality and numerous diseases and disorders, including cancer and neurological disorders. As a result, CK2 is a popular target for interventions aiming to treat the aforementioned diseases. Specifically, two CK2 inhibitors, namely CX-4945 and CIBG-300, are in the early stages of clinical testing and exhibit promise for treating cancer and other disorders. Further, other researchers around the world are focusing on CK2 to treat bone disorders. This review summarizes the current understanding of CK2 in development, the structure of CK2, the targets and signaling pathways of CK2, the implication of CK2 in disease progression, and the recent therapeutics developed to inhibit the dysregulation of CK2 function in various diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipogenesis 3aadulthood 3abone formation 3achondrogenesis 3adisease progression 3aembryonic mortality 3aevolution 3aimmune response 3aneurogenesis 3aneurons 3aprotein kinases 3aspermatogenesis 3atherapeutics 3aviability1 aPandit, Venu 1 aNohe, Anja 0 tJournal of developmental biology.g2022 July 27, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27144x2221-37597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jdb100300313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02275naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011200171300001400283520114700297592002801444650002001472650001301492650001601505650002201521650001201543650001301555650001101568650001901579653001801598653003001616653002301646653001901669700001901688773009801707856008701805852000901892655001201901IND60525934920221119210945.0190402e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052593492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.05.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllan, Matthew10aComparison of methods for determining the deliquescence points of single crystalline ingredients and blends  ap. 29-38.  aMany crystalline food ingredients undergo dissolution at a critical relative humidity known as the deliquescence point (RH0). Blends of crystalline ingredients exhibit deliquescence lowering, resulting in a deliquescence point (RH0mix) lower than the individual ingredient RH0s. To determine the effects of method type and data collection parameters, these deliquescence measurement methods were compared: saturated solution water activity, dynamic vapor sorption profiles (DVS), and dynamic dewpoint sorption profiles (DDI). Water activity measurements were broadly applicable for measuring deliquescence points when 1–4g sample, 50–125μL/g water:solid ratio, and 24–48h equilibration were used. DVS and DDI techniques should be limited to samples containing 1–2 ingredients due to crystal contact point effects on RH0mix measurement. Recommended DVS parameters are: 1% RH step, 0.01% equilibrium criteria, and 3h maximum time. DDI profiles were consistent with 50–150mL/min vapor flow rates. Ingredient mutarotation, solute interactions in solution, and contact point limitations affect the determination of deliquescence points.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adewpoint 3aingredients 3arelative humidity 3asolutes 3asorption 3avapors 3awater activity 0aDeliquescence 0aMoisture sorption methods 0aCrystalline solids 0aWater activity1 aMauer, Lisa J.0 tFood chemistry.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 195 p.29-38dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.05.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03832naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009500167300001600262520247600278592002802754650002502782650001902807650001702826650001302843650001602856650001602872650001202888650001302900650001102913650001202924650001502936650002402951650001102975650002402986650002503010650001603035700005703051700002403108700003003132773013203162856008303294852000903377655001203386IND60780641120221120103824.0220621e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078064112DNAL7 a10.1007/s10333-022-00903-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEslami, Parisa10aGroundwater estimation of Ghayen plain with regression-based and hybrid time series models  ap. 429-440.  aGroundwater estimation to be aware of groundwater level and its decline, as well as the well discharge rate in different time periods, is one of the important and practical issues in the field of groundwater level management and abstraction management. Quantitative information on groundwater resources is essential to manage those best and to propose solutions and constraints on aquifer abstraction. Accurate modeling and prediction of this information also helps avoid financial losses and contributes to the protection of natural resources. Regarding the importance of knowing the groundwater level in the region in future periods, in the present study, the time series of groundwater levels in seven wells in the Ghayen plain on a monthly scale in the statistical period 1997–2018 was used. Contemporaneous Autoregressive Moving Average (CARMA) multivariate and time series models, integrated time series model with isotropy (CARMA-ARCH), multivariate regression and support vector regression were used aiming for the aforementioned. Ant colony optimization algorithms, ant-trap optimization strategies, salp swarm methods, dragonfly algorithms and multiverse algorithms were investigated in order to optimize the parameters of the support vector regression model. The results of simulations showed that in terms of the involvement of different optimization algorithms in SVR-based simulations, the accuracy of groundwater estimation in all wells is appropriate and acceptable. The lowest error rate in groundwater estimation of Shir Morgh Road, Pahnai, Firoozabad Road and Sineh-Kooh-Aboozar wells in terms of support vector regression method optimized with dragonfly algorithm–support vector regression, ant colony optimization–support vector regression, antlion optimizer–support vector regression, antlion optimizer–support vector regression algorithms was estimated at 0.192, 0.46, 0.091 and 0.63 m, respectively. Moreover, multivariate regression method in Birjand Ghayen Road, Northern Kalateh Khan and Northern Esfashad wells obtained the lowest error of 0.412, 0.163 and 0.238, respectively. The best efficiency extracted from the Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient in most wells is also related to CARMA method, whose efficiency improvement was over 97%. Since this study aims to provide an optimal method in groundwater quantity studies, the results indicate the proper performance of optimized and hybrid models that include different family models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnisoptera (Odonata) 3aMyrmeleontidae 3aant colonies 3aaquifers 3aenvironment 3agroundwater 3ahybrids 3aisotropy 3amodels 3apaddies 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3aswarms 3asystem optimization 3atime series analysis 3awater table1 aNasirian, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1813-06771 aAkbarpour, Abolfazl1 aNazeri Tahroudi, Mohammad0 tPaddy and water environment.g2022 July, v. 20, no. 3 p.429-440dSpringer Nature SingaporewJournal:J000000129x1611-24907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10333-022-00903-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245008700175300001400262520117100276592002801447650002101475650002501496650002301521650002101544650001601565650001401581650003301595650001201628650002301640650002101663650002401684650001701708650001201725653002601737653002701763653003001790653002501820653002101845700002001866700002301886700002001909700005801929773011201987856008602099852000902185655001202194IND60628377220221120220249.0190725e20180610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062837722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.04.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraun, Alexandra C.10aBioresponsive release of insulin-like growth factor-I from its PEGylated conjugate  ap. 17-28.  aPEGylation of protein ligands, the attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymers to a therapeutic protein, increases therapeutics' half-life but frequently comes at the cost of reduced bioactivity. We are now presenting a bioinspired strategy leading out of this dilemma. To this end, we selected a position within insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) for decoration with a PEG30kDa-modified protease-sensitive peptide linker (PSL) using a combination of enzymatic and chemical bioorthogonal coupling strategies. The PSL sequence responded to matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) to provide a targeted release in diseased tissue. The IGF-PSL-PEG conjugate had different binding protein affinity, cell proliferation, and endocytosis patterns as compared to the wild type. Exposure of the conjugate to elevated levels of activated MMPs, as present in inflamed tissues, fully reestablished the wild type properties through effective PSL cleavage. In conclusion, this bioinspired approach provided a blueprint for PEGylated therapeutics combining the pharmacokinetic advantages of PEGylation, while locally restoring the full suite of biological potential of therapeutics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding proteins 3abioactive properties 3acell proliferation 3achemical bonding 3aendocytosis 3ahalf life 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3aligands 3ametalloproteinases 3apharmacokinetics 3apolyethylene glycol 3atherapeutics 3atissues 0aBioresponsive release 0aGrowth factor delivery 0aProtease-sensitive linker 0aProtein modification 0aTransglutaminase1 aGutmann, Marcus1 aMueller, Thomas D.1 aLühmann, Tessa1 aMeinel, Lorenz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7549-76270 tJournal of controlled release.g2018 June 10, v. 279 p.17-28dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.04.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03438naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245020700171300001100378520161500389592002802004650000802032650001602040650002602056650002102082650004402103650002202147650001602169650002902185650001202214650001802226650001302244650002502257650001202282650002402294650001902318650001802337650001102355650002902366650002102395650001302416650001302429650002802442650003702470700002102507700001802528700002402546700002302570700005802593773014102651856008302792852000902875655001202884IND60762084820221118193135.0220120e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076208482DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-021-03187-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanerjee, Satarupa10aOxidative stress, DNA, and membranes targets as modes of antibacterial and antibiofilm activity of facile synthesized biocompatible keratin-copper nanoparticles against multidrug resistant uro-pathogens  ap. 20.  aEscherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis are two of the most prevalent uro-pathogens and are difficult to treat as they acquire multidrug-resistant traits. In this study, the main objective was to develop biocompatible copper nanoparticles using chicken feather keratin protein (CuNPs-K) and to investigate their impact on multidrug-resistant (MDR) uro-pathogens, E. coli and E. faecalis, under both single and mixed culture conditions. CuNPs-K were characterised by UV–Vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and docking experiments. The MIC values of CuNPs-K against single and mixed planktonic cultures were 50 μg/ml and 75 μg/ml, respectively. CuNPs-K efficiently disrupted the biofilm of single and mixed uro-pathogen cultures by eliminating sessile cells. This biofilm disruption may be attributed to a decline in the production of extracellular polymeric substances in both single and mixed bacterial cultures treated with CuNPs-K. Moreover, selective antimicrobial activity was determined by selectivity assays using T24 cells. CuNPs-K targets both the bacterial membrane and DNA with elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) as their bactericidal mode of action. This comprehensive antimicrobial activity of CuNPs-K was further confirmed in vivo by using the zebra fish model. In this study, CuNPs-K effectively reduced bacterial load with increased survivability of infected zebrafish. All these results suggest that CuNPs-K can be explored as an exceptional antibacterial agent against MDR uro-pathogenic E. coli and E. faecalis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDanio rerio 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantibiotics 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiofilm 3abiotechnology 3achickens 3acopper nanoparticles 3akeratin 3amechanism of action 3amicrobial load 3amixed culture 3amodels 3amultiple drug resistance 3aoxidative stress 3aplankton 3apolymers 3areactive oxygen species 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aVishakha, Kumari1 aDas, Shatabdi1 aSangma, Priyanka D.1 aMondal, Sandhimita1 aGanguli, Arnab1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9939-027X0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2022 Feb., v. 38, no. 2 p.20-20dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44995x0959-39937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-021-03187-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245011300162520183600275592002802111650001102139650001902150650000902169650001402178650001102192650001202203650001502215650001002230651002502240700001902265700002002284773012002304856007402424852000902498655001202507IND60757995920221123021016.0211125e20211112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075799592DNAL7 a10.3390/w132232012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJardine, Donald E.10aHighwater Mark Collection after Post Tropical Storm Dorian and Implications for Prince Edward Island, Canada  aPrince Edward Island (PEI), Canada has been experiencing the consequences of a rising sea level and intense storms on its coasts in recent years. The most recent severe event, Post Tropical Storm Dorian (Dorian), began impacting Prince Edward Island on 7 September 2019 and lasted for over 20 h until the morning of 8 September 2019. The measurement of highwater marks (HWM) from the storm was conducted between 25 September and 25 October 2019 using a high precision, survey grade methodology. The HWM measured included vegetation lines, wrack lines, beach, cliff, and dune morphological features, and tide gauge data at 53 locations in the Province along coastal areas that are exposed to high tides, storm surge, high winds, and wave runup. Photos were taken to provide evidence on the nature of the HWM data locations. The data reveal that Dorian caused extensive coastal floods in many areas along the North and South Coast of Prince, Queens and Western Kings Counties of Prince Edward Island. The floods reached elevations in excess of 3.4 m at some locations, posing threats to local infrastructure and causing damage to natural features such as sand dunes in these areas. The HWM data can provide useful information for community and emergency response organizations as plans are developed to cope with the rising sea level and increased frequency of highwater events as predicted by researchers. As Dorian has caused significant damage in several coastal areas in PEI, better planning using an enhanced storm forecasting and coastal flood warning system, in conjunction with flood stage values, could possibly have reduced the impacts of the storm in the impacted areas. This could help enhance public understanding of the potential impacts in local areas and how they can prepare and adapt for these events in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3ainfrastructure 3asand 3asea level 3astorms 3asurveys 3avegetation 3awater 3aPrince Edward Island1 aWang, Xiuquan 1 aFenech, Adam L.0 tWater.g2021 Nov. 12, v. 13, no. 22dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w132232013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014000163300001000303520166400313592002801977650002902005650002702034650001202061650001102073650001402084650001202098650002602110650001402136650002202150650001702172650001702189650001102206650002302217650002302240651001002263700001502273700001302288700001702301700001602318700001802334700001402352700001202366700001202378700001602390773014602406856008202552852000902634655001202643IND60622136420221121203947.0200323e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062213642DNAL7 a10.1007/s11783-019-1087-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jiajun10aSource attribution for mercury deposition with an updated atmospheric mercury emission inventory in the Pearl River Delta Region, China  ap. 2.  aWe used CMAQ-Hg to simulate mercury pollution and identify main sources in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) with updated local emission inventory and latest regional and global emissions. The total anthropogenic mercury emissions in the PRD for 2014 were 11,939.6 kg. Power plants and industrial boilers were dominant sectors, responsible for 29.4 and 22.7%. We first compared model predictions and observations and the results showed a good performance. Then five scenarios with power plants (PP), municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI), industrial point sources (IP), natural sources (NAT), and boundary conditions (BCs) zeroed out separately were simulated and compared with the base case. BCs was responsible for over 30% of annual average mercury concentration and total deposition while NAT contributed around 15%. Among the anthropogenic sources, IP (22.9%) was dominant with a contribution over 20.0% and PP (18.9%) and MSWI (11.2%) ranked second and third. Results also showed that power plants were the most important emission sources in the central PRD, where the ultra-low emission for thermal power units need to be strengthened. In the northern and western PRD, cement and metal productions were priorities for mercury control. The fast growth of municipal solid waste incineration were also a key factor in the core areas. In addition, a coordinated regional mercury emission control was important for effectively controlling pollution. In the future, mercury emissions will decrease as control measures are strengthened, more attention should be paid to mercury deposition around the large point sources as high levels of pollution are observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aatmospheric deposition 3aboilers 3acement 3aemissions 3amercury 3amunicipal solid waste 3apollution 3apollution control 3apower plants 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3asource attribution 3awaste incineration 3aChina1 aWang, Long1 aZhu, Yun1 aLin, Che-Jen1 aJang, Carey1 aWang, Shuxiao1 aXing, Jia1 aYu, Bin1 aXu, Hui1 aPan, Yuzhou0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2019 Feb., v. 13, no. 1 p.2-2dHigher Education PresswJournal:J000001686x2095-22017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-019-1087-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03082naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002900146245012400175300001800299520189500317592002802212650001902240650001402259650002102273650001702294650000902311650001302320650002302333650001602356700006302372700001502435700005702450773013602507856008002643852000902723655001202732IND60606137320221117061148.0180724e20180412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060613732DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b016912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhorshidi, Zeinab Naderi10aMolecular Dynamics Study of the Role of Water in the Carbon Dioxide Intercalation in Chloride Ions Bearing Hydrotalcite  ap. 9507-9514.  aMolecular dynamics simulation was used to study the role of water in the intercalation of CO₂ with a model Mg–Al–Cl-hydrotalcite mineral at ambient pressure and temperature. The ClayFF force field was used along with a model Mg–Al–Cl-hydrotalcite containing different amounts of water (H₂O) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) molecules in its interlayer spacing. It was observed that high CO₂ content, say 3.85 mmol g–¹, could be achieved at low water concentrations or even without the presence of water. However, high water concentrations (e.g., 2 H₂O molecules/hydrotalcite unit cell, the maximum allowed water concentration observed experimentally) could also yield similar CO₂ content, but in this case, the presence of water led to a significant interlayer spacing expansion (from 23.0 Å (no water) to 28.5 Å). The expansion was likely due to the change in the orientation distribution of the CO₂ molecules. Analyzing the orientation of CO₂ molecules revealed that they preferred to orientate parallel to the mineral surface at low water concentrations. However, as water concentration increased, CO₂ molecules exhibited a wider range of orientations with a significant fraction of them orienting more or less perpendicular to the mineral surface, especially at high CO₂ contents. The observed change in the orientation of CO₂ was attributed to the dipole interaction between H₂O and CO₂ molecules and the reduced interaction between CO₂ and the hydroxyl groups on hydrotalcite. Also, it was observed that water molecules formed extensive hydrogen bond networks. All of the above findings seem to explain the contradicting results reported in the literature that water is needed under certain conditions to increase the amount of CO₂ captured by hydrotalcites. Here, we showed that high amounts of CO₂ can be intercalated with the presence of water.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3achlorides 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrotalcite 3aions 3amoieties 3amolecular dynamics 3atemperature1 aKhalkhali, Mohammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9583-120X1 aZhang, Hao1 aChoi, Phillip1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6411-79670 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Apr. 12, v. 122, no. 17 p.9507-9514dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b016913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245012000174300001600294520175000310592002802060650002102088650001402109650001702123650001302140650001102153650001002164650001502174650001002189650002002199650001102219650000902230650001302239650001302252650002302265650001802288650000902306651001102315653001202326653000902338653000902347653001202356653001002368700003302378700001902411700001902430700002102449773013102470856009002601852000902691655001202700IND60573389420221119204842.0190318e20170918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057338942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2017.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasella, Tiago10aHigh prevalence of ESBLs in retail chicken meat despite reduced use of antimicrobials in chicken production, France  ap. 271-275.  aExtended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs) are critically important antibiotics for humans and their use in animals poses a potential threat for public health. Chicken represents an increasing part of the human diet and has also been regarded as a source of ESC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae because of the worldwide off-label use of ceftiofur, a broad-spectrum cephalosporin. Thus, numerous studies pointed out chicken as a reservoir of ESBL/pAmpC genes, plasmids and/or clones at risk for humans. In France, late 2011, strong political pressure led to a drastic reduction of ceftiofur use and all other antibiotics in chicken production. Here, we ascertained the potential impact of those efforts on the prevalence of ESC-resistant E. coli in retail chicken. From October 2015 to January 2016, of 48 unrelated pieces of meat (chicken legs) belonging to four different brands, 44 (91.7%) were positive for ESC-resistant E. coli. The blaCTX-M-1 gene was highly prevalent (68/74, 91.9%), mostly located on IncI1/ST3 plasmids (65/68, 95.6%). Other ESBL/pAmpC genes (blaTEM-52, blaSHV-12, blaCMY-2) were carried by IncX1, IncI1/ST36, IncI1/ST95, IncA/C or IncK plasmids. The positive isolates were non-clonal, suggesting a horizontal spread of the ESBL/pAmpC genes. Obviously, the strong decrease of antimicrobial use in chicken farms had no impact yet on the ESBL/pAmpC prevalence in retail chicken meat in France. A human source of these ESBL/pAmpC genes is unlikely as blaCTX-M-1 IncI1/ST3 plasmids are dominant in animals and rare in humans. Our data question the real impact of the decrease of antimicrobial use in chicken production on ESBL contamination of chicken meat and point out the risk of ESBL/AmpCs human transfer through the food chain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aceftiofur 3achicken meat 3achickens 3aclones 3afarms 3afood chain 3agenes 3ahuman nutrition 3ahumans 3alegs 3aplasmids 3apolitics 3apoultry production 3apublic health 3arisk 3aFrance 0aChicken 0aMeat 0aESBL 0aCTX-M-1 0aIncI11 aNogueira, Mara Correa Lelles1 aSaras, Estelle1 aHaenni, Marisa1 aMadec, Jean-Yves0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2017 Sept. 18, v. 257 p.271-275dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2017.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007300168300001600241520100900257592002801266650001101294650002101305650001801326650003201344650001401376650004401390650002001434653002401454653004701478653001501525653001301540653001401553653001001567653000901577653000901586653001101595653000901606653000701615653000801622653000801630700001901638700001701657700002001674700001701694700001801711700001201729700001801741773014401759856008401903852000901987655001201996IND60112796320221122190410.0161024e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011279632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2012.11.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Mei-Hua10aInhibitory kinetics of DABT and DABPT as novel tyrosinase inhibitors  ap. 514-517.  a4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde-thiosemicarbazone (DABT) and 4-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde-N-phenyl-thiosemicarbazone (DABPT) were synthesized and established by 1H and 13C NMR and mass spectrum.

The inhibition type of DABT was mix-type with inhibition constants KI = 1.77 μM and KIS = 6.49 μM, while that of DABPT displays non-competitive with the inhibition constant KI = 0.77 μM.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatechol oxidase 3adose response 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amushrooms 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3astable isotopes 0aMushroom tyrosinase 0aBenzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone derivatives 0aInhibition 0aKinetics 0aSynthesis 0aDABPT 0aDABT 0aDMSO 0al-DOPA 0aIC50 0aKI 0aKIS 0aTyr1 aChen, Chih-Min1 aHu, Yong-Hua1 aZheng, Cheng-Yi1 aLi, Zhi-Cong1 aNi, Lian-Lian1 aSun, Li1 aChen, Qing-Xi0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2013 May, v. 115 p.514-517dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, Japanx1389-17237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2012.11.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03656naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245011100164300001800275520197200293592002802265650002302293650003102316650001802347650002702365650001902392650002202411650001702433650001902450650001102469650001602480650002502496650002202521650000902543650002702552650001502579650001202594650001302606650001202619650002502631650001102656653001502667653001502682653001902697653002502716700001502741700001702756700001702773700001502790700001702805700001402822773015402836856007902990852000903069655001203078IND60567961620221123000139.0190318e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056796162DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2016-122142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKimoto-Nira, H.10aEffects of rare sugar D-allulose on acid production and probiotic activities of dairy lactic acid bacteria  ap. 5936-5944.  aIt has recently been reported that the rare sugar d-allulose has beneficial effects, including the suppression of postprandial blood glucose elevation in humans, and can be substituted for sucrose as a low-calorie food ingredient. To examine the applications of d-allulose in the dairy industry, we investigated the effects of d-allulose on the acid production of 8 strains of yogurt starter (Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus) and 4 strains of lactococci, including potential probiotic candidates derived from dairy products. Acid production by 2 L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus yogurt starter strains in milk was suppressed by d-allulose, but this phenomenon was also observed in some strains with another sugar (xylose), a sugar alcohol (sorbitol), or both. In contrast, among the dairy probiotic candidates, Lactococcus lactis H61, which has beneficial effects for human skin when drunk as part of fermented milk, was the only strain that showed suppression of acid production in the presence of d-allulose. Strain H61 did not metabolize d-allulose. We did not observe suppression of acid production by strain H61 with the addition of xylose or sorbitol, and xylose and sorbitol were not metabolized by strain H61. The acid production of strain H61 after culture in a constituted medium (tryptone–yeast extract–glucose broth) was also suppressed with the addition of d-allulose, but growth efficiency and sugar fermentation style were not altered. Probiotic activities—such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activity of H61-fermented milk and the superoxide dismutase activity of H61 cells grown in tryptone–yeast extract–glucose broth—were not affected by d-allulose. d-Allulose may suppress acid production in certain lactic acid bacteria without altering their probiotic activity. It may be useful for developing new probiotic dairy products from probiotic strains such as Lactococcus lactis H61.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactococcus lactis 3aStreptococcus thermophilus 3ablood glucose 3acultured milk starters 3adairy industry 3aenzyme inhibition 3afermentation 3afermented milk 3ahumans 3aingredients 3alactic acid bacteria 3alow calorie foods 3amilk 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3aprobiotics 3apsicose 3asorbitol 3asucrose 3asuperoxide dismutase 3axylose 0arare sugar 0ad-allulose 0afermented milk 0alactic acid bacteria1 aMoriya, N.1 aHayakawa, S.1 aKuramasu, K.1 aOhmori, H.1 aYamasaki, S.1 aOgawa, M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2017 July, v. 100, no. 7 p.5936-5944dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2016-122143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03795naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001800192245011800210300001400328506007600342520178400418592002802202506003702230650001702267650001602284650001902300650003202319650001002351650001302361650001702374650001702391650001002408650001802418650001202436650001402448650001102462650003102473650000902504650001102513650001502524650001802539650001702557650001402574650001502588650002302603650004002626653002402666653003802690653002502728653001702753653001702770653001702787700001602804700002802820700002302848700005502871773011202926856008603038852000903124655001203133IND60628377420221207095250.0190725e20180610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062837742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.04.0112doi7 aPMC59720662pmcid7 a296495292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Qingqing10aMesoporous silicate nanoparticles/3D nanofibrous scaffold-mediated dual-drug delivery for bone tissue engineering  ap. 69-78.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aControlled delivery systems play a critical role in the success of bone morphogenetic proteins (i.e., BMP2 and BMP7) for challenged bone repair. Instead of single-drug release that is currently and commonly prevalent, dual-drug delivery strategies are highly desired to achieve effective bone regeneration because natural bone repair process is driven by multiple factors. Particularly, angiogenesis is essential for osteogenesis and requires more than just one factor (e.g., Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, VEGF). Therefore, we developed a novel mesoporous silicate nanoparticles (MSNs) incorporated-3D nanofibrous gelatin (GF) scaffold for dual-delivery of BMP2 and deferoxamine (DFO). DFO is a hypoxia-mimetic drug that can activate hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), and trigger subsequent angiogenesis. Sustained BMP2 release system was achieved through encapsulation into large-pored MSNs, while the relative short-term release of DFO was engineered through covalent conjugation with chitosan to reduce its cytotoxicity and elongate its half-life. Both MSNs and DFO were incorporated onto a porous 3D GF scaffold to serve as a biomimetic osteogenic microenvironment. Our data indicated that DFO and BMP2 were released from a scaffold at different release rates (10 vs 28 days) yet maintained their angiogenic and osteogenic ability, respectively. Importantly, our data indicated that the released DFO significantly improved BMP2-induced osteogenic differentiation where the dose/duration was important for its effects in both mouse and human stem cell models. Thus, we developed a novel and tunable MSNs/GF 3D scaffold-mediated dual-drug delivery system and studied the potential application of the both FDA-approved DFO and BMP2 for bone tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aangiogenesis 3abiomimetics 3abone formation 3abone morphogenetic proteins 3abones 3achitosan 3acytotoxicity 3adeferoxamine 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3agelatin 3ahalf life 3ahumans 3ahypoxia-inducible factor 1 3amice 3amodels 3ananofibers 3ananoparticles 3aporous media 3asilicates 3astem cells 3atissue engineering 3avascular endothelial growth factors 0aDual release system 0aMesoporous silicate nanoparticles 0aNanofibrous scaffold 0aAngiogenesis 0aOsteogenesis 0aDeferoxamine1 aLiu, Yangxi1 aSelvaratnam, Balaranjan1 aKoodali, Ranjit T.1 aSun, Hongli1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8398-30110 tJournal of controlled release.g2018 June 10, v. 279 p.69-78dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02107naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245011600175300001800291520106800309592002801377650001901405650001501424650000901439650001201448650002901460650001401489700002501503700002601528700002201554773011001576856008601686852000901772655001201781IND60530463620170413000000.0160721e20160405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053046362DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.5b045372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmalian, Jean-Arthur10aMS/MS Digital Readout: Analysis of Binary Information Encoded in the Monomer Sequences of Poly(triazole amide)s  ap. 3715-3722.  aTandem mass spectrometry was evaluated as a reliable sequencing methodology to read codes encrypted in monodisperse sequence-coded oligo(triazole amide)s. The studied oligomers were composed of monomers containing a triazole ring, a short ethylene oxide segment, and an amide group as well as a short alkyl chain (propyl or isobutyl) which defined the 0/1 molecular binary code. Using electrospray ionization, oligo(triazole amide)s were best ionized as protonated molecules and were observed to adopt a single charge state, suggesting that adducted protons were located on every other monomer unit. Upon collisional activation, cleavages of the amide bond and of one ether bond were observed to proceed in each monomer, yielding two sets of complementary product ions. Distribution of protons over the precursor structure was found to remain unchanged upon activation, allowing charge state to be anticipated for product ions in the four series and hence facilitating their assignment for a straightforward characterization of any encoded oligo(triazole amide)s.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethylene oxide 3aionization 3aions 3aprotons 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atriazoles1 aTrịnh, Thanh Tâm,1 aLutz, Jean-François,1 aCharles, Laurence0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2016 Apr. 05, v. 88, no. 7 p.3715-3722dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.5b045373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01609naa a2200229 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245011200162520078500274592002801059650001301087650001601100700002001116773014601136856007601282852000901358655001201367IND60794235620221121233843.0220922e20220826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079423562DNAL7 a10.3390/jdb100300352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichiue, Tatsuo 10aFeedback Regulation of Signaling Pathways for Precise Pre-Placodal Ectoderm Formation in Vertebrate Embryos  aIntracellular signaling pathways are essential to establish embryonic patterning, including embryonic axis formation. Ectodermal patterning is also governed by a series of morphogens. Four ectodermal regions are thought to be controlled by morphogen gradients, but some perturbations are expected to occur during dynamic morphogenetic movement. Therefore, a mechanism to define areas precisely and reproducibly in embryos, including feedback regulation of signaling pathways, is necessary. In this review, we outline ectoderm pattern formation and signaling pathways involved in the establishment of the pre-placodal ectoderm (PPE). We also provide an example of feedback regulation of signaling pathways for robust formation of the PPE, showing the importance of this regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aectoderm 3avertebrates1 aTsukano, Kohei 0 tJournal of developmental biology.g2022 Aug. 26, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27144x2221-37597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jdb100300353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03347naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006400138245009200202300001600294500002000310520213100330592002802461650001402489650001402503650001302517650003002530650001302560650001902573650002002592650002602612650002202638650002102660700002702681700006102708773012302769856007202892852000902964655001202973IND60747597620221119185622.0210816e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074759762DNAL7 a10.1002/pca.30232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdekenov, Sergazy M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7588-617410aAnalysis of arglabin and its derivatives using high‐performance liquid chromatography  ap. 780-784.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aINTRODUCTION: The chemical modification of arglabin, a natural sesquiterpene lactone, has garnered significant attention because it comprises a guaianolide structure that exhibits antitumour and immunomodulating properties. Its primarily derived from Artemisia glabella Kar. et Kir. Physicochemical characterisation of commercial anititumour drugs based on arglabin can be time‐consuming and expensive; thus, high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is an optimal method to identify arglabin and its derivatives. AIM: This study has a two‐fold objective: to develop a unified HPLC method for quality control of arglabin and its new hybrid molecules with alkaloids (cytisine, anabasine), and to study the relationship between their structures and chromatographic behaviours. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To develop a selective method that ensures the quality of arglabin and its derivatives, HPLC was used with the Zorbax SB‐C18 analytical column. Dipole moments were calculated via the restricted Hartree–Fock method (RHF/6‐31G(d, p)) and the B3LYР density functional theory with full geometry optimisation by using the GAUSSIAN 03 W program. RESULTS: A novel analytical method has been developed using reversed‐phase (RP) HPLC, which is selective and allows reliable as well as quantitative determination of arglabin and its derivatives. To confirm the selectivity of the developed method, the chromatographic capacity factors and column selectivity were calculated. The relationship between retention time and structure (particularly, the nature of the substituent) was studied for the first time for arglabin and its derivatives using the B3LYP/6‐31G(d) quantum chemical method. The influence of the dipole moment on the retention time of arglabin and its derivatives was confirmed. CONCLUSION: A novel unified quality control method using HPLC was developed to analyse arglabin, and its new hybrid molecules with alkaloids (cytisine and anabasine). For the first time, the relationship between the chromatographic behaviour in RP‐HPLC and the dipole moment for arglabin and its derivatives was revealed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia 3aanabasine 3acytisine 3adensity functional theory 3ageometry 3aphytochemicals 3aquality control 3aquantitative analysis 3aquantum mechanics 3asesquiterpenoids1 aShamilova, Saltanat T.1 aKhabarov, Ilya A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6727-88700 tPhytochemical analysis.g2021 Sept., v. 32, no. 5 p.780-784dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58272x0958-03447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pca.30233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03369naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002100192245015700213300001600370506007600386520171100462592002802173506003702201650001402238650002502252650001802277650002702295650001102322650002002333650001102353650000902364650001702373650001702390651001802407653001802425653001502443653001602458653001002474653002702484700001902511700001802530700001702548700001902565700005802584773011402642856008602756852000902842655001202851IND60628377520221207095238.0190725e20180610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062837752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.04.0122doi7 aPMC61102642pmcid7 a297021432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTran, Dominic M.10aProlonging pulse duration in ultrasound-mediated gene delivery lowers acoustic pressure threshold for efficient gene transfer to cells and small animals  ap. 345-354.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWhile ultrasound-mediated gene delivery (UMGD) has been accomplished using high peak negative pressures (PNPs) of 2 MPa or above, emerging research showed that this may not be a requirement for microbubble (MB) cavitation. Thus, we investigated lower-pressure conditions close to the MB inertial cavitation threshold and focused towards further increasing gene transfer efficiency and reducing associated cell damage. We created a matrix of 21 conditions (n = 3/cond.) to test in HEK293T cells using pulse durations spanning 18 μs–36 ms and PNPs spanning 0.5–2.5 MPa. Longer pulse duration conditions yielded significant increase in transgene expression relative to sham with local maxima between 20 J and 100 J energy curves. A similar set of 17 conditions (n = 4/cond.) was tested in mice using pulse durations spanning 18 μs–22 ms and PNPs spanning 0.5–2.5 MPa. We observed local maxima located between 1 J and 10 J energy curves in treated mice. Of these, several low pressure conditions showed a decrease in ALT and AST levels while maintaining better or comparable expression to our positive control, indicating a clear benefit to allow for effective transfection with minimized tissue damage versus the high-intensity control. Our data indicates that it is possible to eliminate the requirement of high PNPs by prolonging pulse durations for effective UMGD in vitro and in vivo, circumventing the peak power density limitations imposed by piezo-materials used in US transducers. Overall, these results demonstrate the advancement of UMGD technology for achieving efficient gene transfer and potential scalability to larger animal models and human application.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacoustics 3aalanine transaminase 3aanimal models 3aaspartate transaminase 3aenergy 3agene expression 3ahumans 3amice 3amicrobubbles 3atransfection 3aUnited States 0aGene transfer 0aUltrasound 0aMicrobubble 0aLiver 0aNonviral gene delivery1 aHarrang, James1 aSong, Shuxian1 aChen, Jeremy1 aSmith, Bryn M.1 aMiao, Carol H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6520-23730 tJournal of controlled release.g2018 June 10, v. 279 p.345-354dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03747naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005200151245009300203300001600296520196900312592002802281650001302309650001602322650002102338650001402359650001802373650001902391650002102410650002602431650001402457650002102471650002402492650003302516650001702549653002202566653003002588653002902618653002602647653001702673653004702690700002002737700002402757700002202781700002602803700002002829700001902849700001502868700001502883700002702898700002002925700001502945773011402960856008603074852000903160655001203169IND60628377620221120220322.0190725e20180610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062837762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5580-101110aTumor uptake of pegylated diabodies: Balancing systemic clearance and vascular transport  ap. 126-135.  aThe accumulation, dissemination and clearance of monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics or imaging reagents targeting tumor associated antigens is governed by several factors including affinity, size, charge, and valency. Tumor targeting antibody fragments have distinct advantages over intact monoclonal antibodies such as enhanced penetration within the tumor and rapid accumulation but are subject to rapid clearance. Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified antibody fragments can provide a way to balance tumor penetration and accumulation with improved serum persistence. In this study, we use a diabody, the dimeric antibody fragment, targeting the 5T4 antigen to assess the impact of PEGs of distinct size and shape on tumor accumulation and pharmacokinetics (PK). We show that PEG-modified diabodies improved the PK of the parental diabody from a half-life of 40 min to over 40 h for the higher molecular weight PEG conjugated diabodies. This improvement correlates with the increasing hydrodynamic size of pegylated diabodies, and can serve as a better predictor of the PK behavior of pegylated molecules than molecular weight alone. Tumor uptake profiles determined by quantitative PET imaging differed significantly based on PEG size and shape with diabody-PEG5K showing peak accumulation early on, but with the larger diabody-PEG20K showing better sustained tumor uptake at later time points. In addition, we demonstrate that a diabody-PEG20K-B with a hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of 6 nm had superior tumor uptake than the larger diabody-PEG40K-B with Rh of 12 nm, indicating that beyond 6 nm, larger pegylated diabodies have a slower tumor uptake rate while having comparable clearance kinetics. Our data demonstrate that pegylated diabodies with Rh of ~6 nm have an optimal size and PK profile for tumor uptake. Understanding the impact of pegylation on PK and tumor uptake could facilitate the development of pegylated diabodies as therapeutics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3achemical bonding 3ahalf life 3ahydrodynamics 3aimage analysis 3amolecular weight 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aneoplasms 3apharmacokinetics 3apolyethylene glycol 3apositron-emission tomography 3atherapeutics 0aAntibody fragment 0aPolyethylene glycol (PEG) 0aHydrodynamic radius (Rh) 0aPharmacokinetics (PK) 0aTumor uptake 0aPositron emission tomography (PET) imaging1 aWhite, Jason B.1 aPeterson, Norman C.1 aRickert, Keith W.1 aLloyd, Christopher O.1 aAllen, Kevin L.1 aRosenthal, Kim1 aGao, Xizhe1 aWu, Herren1 aDall'Acqua, William F.1 aBorrok, M.

D. A.10aQuantitative Detection of PEGylated Biomacromolecules in Biological Fluids by NMR  ap. 3730-3738.  a2019-12-06  aThe accumulation, biodistribution, and clearance profiles of therapeutic agents are key factors relevant to their efficacy. Determining these properties constitutes an ongoing experimental challenge. Many such therapeutics, including small molecules, peptides, proteins, tissue scaffolds, and drug delivery vehicles, are conjugated to poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as this improves their bioavailability and in vivo stability. We demonstrate here that ¹H NMR spectroscopy can be used to quantify PEGylated species in complex biological fluids directly, rapidly, and with minimal sample preparation. PEG bears a large number of spectroscopically equivalent protons exhibiting a narrow NMR line width while resonating at a ¹H NMR frequency distinct from most other biochemical signals. We demonstrate that PEG provides a robust signal allowing detection of concentrations as low as 10 μg/mL in blood. This PEG detection limit is lowered by another order of magnitude when background proton signals are minimized using ¹³C-enriched PEG in combination with a double quantum filter to remove ¹H signals from non-¹³C-labeled species. Quantitative detection of PEG via these methods is shown in pig blood and goat serum as examples of complex biological fluids. More practically, we quantify the blood clearance of ¹³C-PEG and PEGylated-BSA (bovine serum albumin) following their intravenous injection in live rats. Given the relative insensitivity of line width to PEG size, we anticipate that the biodistribution and clearance profiles of virtually any PEGylated biomacromolecule from biological fluid samples can be routinely measured by ¹H NMR without any filtering or treatment steps.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ablood serum 3aintravenous injection 3abioavailability 3adrugs 3agoats 3apeptides 3aethylene glycol 3atissue scaffolds 3apolyethylene glycol 3aprotons 3arats 3abovine serum albumin 3aswine 0atherapeutics1 aHasabnis, Advait1 aProsser, R.

The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate the effects of feeding CM with different RUP contents on ruminal fermentation, nutrient digestion, and microbial growth using a dual-flow continuous culture system (experiment 1) and (2) evaluate ruminal gas production kinetics, in vitro organic matter (OM) digestibility, and methane (CH4) production of soybean meal (SBM) and CM with low or high RUP in the diet or as a sole ingredient using a gas production system (experiments 2 and 3). In experiment 1, diets were randomly assigned to 6 fermentors in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square. The only ingredient that differed among diets was the protein supplement. The treatments were (1) solvent-extracted SBM, (2) low-RUP solvent-extracted CM (38% RUP as a percentage of crude protein), and (3) high-RUP solvent-extracted CM (50% RUP). Diets were prepared as 3 concentrate mixtures that were combined with 25% orchardgrass hay and 15% wheat straw (dry matter basis). Experiments 2 and 3 had the same design with 24 bottles incubated 3 times for 48 h each. During the 48-h incubation, the cumulative pressure was recorded to determine gas production kinetics, in vitro OM digestibility, and CH4 production. In experiment 1, N flow (g/d), efficiency of N use, efficiency of bacterial N synthesis, total volatile fatty acids (mM), and molar proportion of acetate, propionate, and isobutyrate were not affected by treatments. There were tendencies for a decrease in ruminal NH3-N and an increase in molar proportion of butyrate for the SBM diet compared with both CM diets. The molar proportion of valerate was greater in both CM diets, whereas the molar proportion of isovalerate and total branched-chain volatile fatty acids was lower for the CM diets compared with the SBM diet. In experiments 2 and 3, the SBM diet had a greater gas pool size than both CM diets. The SBM diet increased in vitro OM digestibility; however, it also tended to increase CH4 production (mM and g/kg of DM) compared with both CM diets. Based on the results of this study, CM with RUP varying from 38 to 50% of crude protein does not affect ruminal fermentation, nutrient digestion, and microbial growth when CM is included at up to 34% of the diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDactylis glomerata 3aacetates 3aammonium nitrogen 3abottles 3abutyrates 3acanola meal 3acrude protein 3adigestibility 3afermenters 3ahay 3aingredients 3amethane 3amethane production 3amicrobial growth 3anutritive value 3aorganic matter 3apropionic acid 3aprotein supplements 3arumen fermentation 3asoybean meal 3avolatile fatty acids 3awheat straw 0aammonia nitrogen 0arumen-degradable protein 0arumen nitrogen metabolism 0avolatile fatty acid1 aMonteiro, H.F.1 aSilva, L.G.1 aBenedeti, P.D.B.1 aDaniel, J.L.P.1 aShenkoru, T.1 aBroderick, G.A.1 aFaciola, A.P.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2017 July, v. 100, no. 7 p.5281-5292dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2016-123013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01976naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245011000211300001600321520078100337592002801118596008001146650002501226650001601251650001001267650001601277650001201293650001001305700002201315700002101337700002201358700002201380773013201402856008301534852000901617655001201626IND60780641720221120103931.0220621e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078064172DNAL7 a10.1007/s10333-022-00890-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMyrzakhmetov, Akhan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1299-501X10aLevel regime of Balkhash Lake as the indicator of the state of the environmental ecosystems of the region  ap. 315-323.  aThe article presents the results of studies of the level regime of Lake Balkhash, which has a characteristic, consisting in the change in the average lake horizon, the changes in the magnitudes of the seasonal and inter-annual amplitudes of the levels, as well as their annual and long-term ones.

Based on intracellular erythritol accumulation and gene expression profiles, er3 seemed to be highly responsive to stress than er1 or er2. Under hyper-osmotic conditions, intracellular glycerol production, increased significantly within 1.5 h together with glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (gpd1) expression; in contrast, neither er gene expression nor the corresponding production of intracellular erythritol increased significantly within the first 1.5 h of hyper-osmotic culture. However, within 24 h of hyper-osmotic culture, erythritol production and er3 gene expression increased significantly and in parallel. Thus, we concluded that, as an initial response to hyper-osmotic growth conditions, T. megachiliensis produces glycerol as an osmoregulatory compatible solute via GPD; however, within 24 h, it begins to produce erythritol, mainly via ER3, as the preferred compatible solute. Heterologous expression of ers in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant indicated that any of three ers might not function in S. cerevisiae for erythritol biosynthesis in spite of ers and corresponding ERs expression. Hence, although er is annotated as a galactose-inducible crystalline–like yeast protein gene (gcy1) homolog, er may be functionally different from gcy1 in glycolytic metabolism.

At high and medium dsRNA levels, China-9 isolates exhibit reduced mycelia growth rate and conidiation capacity, abnormal colony morphology, disorganized cytoplasm, as well as reduced virulence for wheat and maize plants. At low dsRNA levels the fungus shows no symptoms, however, the RNA segments can be detected by RT-PCR. Transfection of the virulent F. graminearum PH-1 isolate with purified Virus-like Particles (VLPs) of FgV-ch9 reduced its conidiation capacity, perithecia formation, and pathogenicity for wheat and maize several folds. These results further demonstrate that FgV-ch9 is associated with hypovirulence of F. graminearum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium graminearum 3avirus-like particles 3acorn 3avirulence 3atransfection 3awheat 3acytoplasm 3adouble-stranded RNA 3amycelium 3afungi 0aGibberella zeae1 aAdam, Günter,1 aSchäfer, Wilhelm,0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2012 Sept., v. 134, no. 1 p.181-189dSpringer-Verlagx0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-012-9977-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009700166300001600263520167200279592002801951650002001979650001701999650001202016650001202028650001002040650002102050650001502071650002202086650001502108650001402123650002502137650001202162650003002174650001102204651001302215700001902228700001902247773010302266856004802369852000902417655001202426IND50073071620221121234729.0140215e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007307162DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-014-0447-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelaku, Ermias10aNon-timber forest products and household incomes in Bonga forest area, southwestern Ethiopia  ap. 215-223.  aWe identified the major non-timber forest products (NTFPs), their contributions to household incomes, and the determinants influencing engagement of households in using NTFPs in the Bonga forest area of Gimbo and Decha Districts of Kaffa Zone, southwest Ethiopia. Six Kebeles (the lowest administrative unit in Ethiopia) were sampled from two Districts and 150 households were randomly sampled using proportional-to-size techniques based on the number of farm households in each Kebele. Secondary data were collected from and focus group discussions were conducted with selected individuals. The farmers diversified livelihood activities such as crop and livestock production, collection of NTFPs and off-farm activities. NTFPs played a significant role in household incomes. The contribution from the major NTFPs (forest coffee, honey and spices) accounted for 47% of annual household income. The role of NTFPs was influenced by a number of factors. Variables including being native to the area (+), total land holding (+), possession of livestock (+) and access to extension (+) significantly affected forest coffee production. Age of household head (−), land holding (+) and distance of the market from the residence (−) significantly affected honey production. Size of landholding (+), distance to market (−) and distance of the forest from the residence (−) were significant variables determining the NTFP incomes derived by the households. Attention is needed in the design of policies and strategies for the well-being of households to the contribution of NTFPs to local incomes and the variables that affect the collection of NTFPs must be considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop production 3afarm numbers 3afarmers 3aforests 3ahoney 3ahousehold income 3ahouseholds 3aissues and policy 3alivelihood 3alivestock 3alivestock production 3amarkets 3anontimber forest products 3aspices 3aEthiopia1 aEwnetu, Zeleke1 aDemel Teketay,0 tJournal of forestry research.g2014 Mar., v. 25, no. 1 p.215-223dSpringer-Verlagx1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-014-0447-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009000170500002200260520133900282592002801621650003101649650002801680650002701708650002201735650001501757650001701772650001501789650001901804650001101823650001201834650001901846650001401865650002201879650002601901653000901927653001401936653003101950653000901981653000901990700002001999700001802019773007002037856008502107852000902192655001202201IND60573389920221119205116.0170724s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057338992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2017.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchulte, Julia10aDevelopment of a single-cell GlxR-based cAMP biosensor for Corynebacterium glutamicum  aPre-press version  aCyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) plays a regulatory role as second messenger in many species. In the industrial model organism Corynebacterium glutamicum, cAMP acts as effector of the global transcriptional regulator GlxR, a homolog of enterobacterial Crp. The cAMP-GlxR complex activates or represses the expression of about 200 target genes. CyaB, a membrane-bound class III adenylate cyclase, synthesizes cAMP from ATP, but another yet unknown cAMP-forming enzyme is likely present in C. glutamicum. Recently, we identified the cAMP phosphodiesterase CpdA, which catalyzes the conversion of cAMP to AMP. As a tool to search for additional cAMP-forming and degrading enzymes, we constructed a plasmid-based cAMP biosensor by fusing the promoter of cg3195, a gene strongly repressed by GlxR, to the eyfp reporter gene. In control experiments, the biosensor showed the predicted responses to increased levels of cAMP or GlxR. The biosensor was able to distinguish between C. glutamicum wild type and mutants with defects in cAMP biosynthesis or degradation. Most importantly, the sensor allowed successful sorting of mixtures of wild type and mutant strains by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), thus meeting the requirements for high-throughput screening of libraries for single mutant cells with an altered cAMP level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynebacterium glutamicum 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadenylate cyclase 3abiosensors 3abiosynthesis 3acyclic AMP 3aflow cytometry 3amodels 3amutants 3areporter genes 3ascreening 3asecond messengers 3atranscription factors 0acAMP 0abiosensor 0aCorynebacterium glutamicum 0aGlxR 0aFACS1 aBaumgart, Meike1 aBott, Michael0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2017.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012400160300001800284500002000302520156900322592002801891650001801919650002001937650002201957650001901979650001801998650001802016650001002034650001802044650002402062650001702086650001802103650001302121650002402134700001602158700002102174773012902195856007302324852000902397655001202406IND60571406320221120122411.0170712e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057140632DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.80332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Xi‐Xiang10aSoy protein isolate as a nanocarrier for enhanced water dispersibility, stability and bioaccessibility of β‐carotene  ap. 2230-2237.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The incorporation of β‐carotene, one of the most common pigments or bioactives, into food formulations has attracted increasing interest from the food industry, due to its good nutrition and potential health effects. However, it is poorly soluble and unstable in water, which greatly limits its applications in foods. This work presented an effective approach to improve the water dispersibility, stability and even bioaccessibility of β‐carotene, using soy protein isolate (SPI) to perform as effective nanocarriers for this molecule. RESULTS: The complexation with SPI remarkably improved the water dispersibility and stability against heating and freeze‐drying of β‐carotene. However, the encapsulation efficiency and stability of β‐carotene in the nanocomplexes with SPI were closely dependent on the applied β‐carotene‐to‐protein ratio, at which the complexation occurred. The best improvement of stability was observed at appropriate β‐carotene‐to‐protein ratios, e.g. 10–20 g kg⁻¹. The complexation with β‐carotene mainly occurred on the surface of SPI nanoparticles, through hydrophobic interactions. The complexation resulted in inter‐particle aggregation, in a concentration‐dependent manner. Almost all of the β‐carotene molecules in the nanocomplexes could be progressively released into the aqueous phase. CONCLUSION: SPI exhibits a good potential to perform as a nanocarrier for enhanced water dispersibility, stability and bioaccessibility of β‐carotene. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-carotene 3abioavailability 3achemical elements 3adispersibility 3aencapsulation 3afood industry 3afoods 3afreeze drying 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ananocarriers 3ananoparticles 3apigments 3asoy protein isolate1 aZhang, Ning1 aTang, Chuan‐He0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2017 May, v. 97, no. 7 p.2230-2237dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.80333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03047naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245012000164500001900284520165200303592002801955650001301983650004801996650002402044650001902068650002602087650001402113650001302127650002302140650002402163650001002187650001902197650002002216650002102236650001702257650001302274653002202287653001702309653002102326653002202347700002002369773010602389856008502495852000902580655001202589IND60688793320221120075616.0200515e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068879332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.1086652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Lucy10aInducing cellular immune responses with a marked Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis strain in dairy calves  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the etiological agent of Johne’s disease, a chronic granulomatous enteritis with a high global prevalence in dairy cattle. This disease causes significant economic loss in the dairy industry and has been challenging to control, as current diagnostic assays are low in sensitivity and specificity, and previously developed vaccines do not prevent infection and face regulatory concerns due to interference with bovine tuberculosis diagnostics. To remediate this issue, positive and negative immune markers were created in a MAP strain as a step towards a vaccine capable of differentiating infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA). A gene coding for an immunogenic protein (MAP1693c) in the MAP genome was replaced with a library of epitope-tagged immunogenic genes (pepA) via a stable allelic exchange method. These markers were evaluated in a calf infection trial, where Holstein-Friesian dairy calves were inoculated at two weeks of age with either the marked strain or the parent strain, or remained uninfected controls. Cellular immune responses to the markers were measured using an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA). There were no MAP1693c marker-specific differences in cellular immune responses between infection groups. A scrambled version of the HA (human influenza hemagglutinin) epitope, but not the actual HA epitope, induced a significant IFN-γ response in marker-infected calves compared to WT-infected and uninfected groups at 4.5 months post-inoculation. This scrambled HA epitope thus holds potential as a diagnostic tool as part of a DIVA vaccine for Johne’s disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3abovine tuberculosis 3adairy industry 3adiagnostic techniques 3aenteritis 3aepitopes 3aetiological agents 3afinancial economics 3agenes 3ahemagglutinins 3ahuman influenza 3ainterferon-gamma 3amicrobiology 3avaccines 0aJohne’s disease 0aDIVA vaccine 0aAllelic exchange 0aImmunodiagnostics1 aDe Buck, Jeroen0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2020 May, v. 244 p.108665-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.1086653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01881naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245007200172300001600244520071500260592002800975650002301003650002301026650002201049650002001071650001201091653000801103653000801111653002101119653002201140653001601162653002101178653002601199653000901225700002201234700002001256773011201276856008601388852000901474655001201483IND60621696220221119192342.0190206e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062169622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2018.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguimkeu, Pierre10aOn the estimation of treatment effects with endogenous misreporting  ap. 487-506.  aParticipation in social programs is often misreported in survey data, complicating the estimation of treatment effects.

We present an expression for the asymptotic bias of both OLS and IV estimators and discuss the conditions under which sign reversal may occur. We provide a method for eliminating this bias when researchers have access to information regarding participation and misreporting. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of our proposed estimator and assess its small sample performance through Monte Carlo simulations.

While detailed spatial databases of these and also detailed ecological databases built on field data are still lacking for many regions, satellite data are an indispensable source of spatially distributed detailed ecological information. Digital elevation models and multi-spectral images are especially useful for the acquisition of detailed, up-to-date and cheap spatial data. In this study, principal component analysis and canonical correlation analysis were used to reveal the structure of the relationships between the land surface reflectance values in different wavelength ranges and to investigate relationships between the principal components and the set of topographic characteristics and indexes for the study area in the Ukrainian Carpathians. The most important factor that influences the land and vegetation cover structure was found to be elevation, while other factors included a set of topographic characteristics and indices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3acorrelation 3adatabases 3adigital elevation models 3aecosystems 3amorphometry 3amountains 3aplanning 3aprincipal component analysis 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data 3aspectral analysis 3avegetation cover 3awavelengths 3aUkraine 0amultispectral imagery 0adigital elevation models 0aNDVI 0atopographic variables0 tEkológia (Bratislava).g2013 Aug. 24, v. 32, no. 1 p.87-94dVersitax1337-947X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/eko-2013-00073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245014100173300001400314520105600328592002801384650003001412650001101442650002601453650002201479650002001501650003801521650001801559650001401577650003001591650002701621650002201648650003501670651001401705651001701719653002501736653001101761653002101772653001701793653002401810700002301834700001701857700005901874700002001933700002401953700002101977700002001998700002102018700002202039700002402061700002502085773008802110856008302198990002302281852000902304655001202313IND60697567220221119084801.0200605e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069756722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2018.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChothe, Shubhada K.10aWhole-genome sequence analysis reveals unique SNP profiles to distinguish vaccine and wild-type strains of bovine herpesvirus-1 (BoHV-1)  ap. 27-36.  aBovine herpesvirus-1 (BoHV-1) is a major pathogen affecting cattle worldwide causing primarily respiratory illness referred to as infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), along with reproductive disorders including abortion and infertility in cattle. While modified live vaccines (MLVs) effectively induce immune response against BoHV-1, they are implicated in disease outbreaks in cattle. Current diagnostic methods cannot distinguish between MLVs and field strains of BoHV-1. We performed whole genome sequencing of 18 BoHV-1 isolates from Pennsylvania and Minnesota along with five BoHV-1 vaccine strains using the Illumina Miseq platform. Based on nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) the sequences were clustered into three groups with two different vaccine groups and one distinct cluster of field isolates. Using this information, we developed a novel SNP-based PCR assay that can allow differentiation of vaccine and clinical strains and help accurately determine the incidence of BoHV-1 and the association of MLVs with clinical disease in cattle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBovine alphaherpesvirus 1 3acattle 3adiagnostic techniques 3adisease outbreaks 3aimmune response 3ainfectious bovine rhinotracheitis 3alive vaccines 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3areproductive disorders 3asequence analysis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aMinnesota 3aPennsylvania 0aBovine Herpesvirus-1 0aBoHV-1 0aComplete genomes 0aSNP profiles 0aSNP based PCR assay1 aSebastian, Aswathy1 aThomas, Asha1 aNissly, Ruth H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3102-74471 aWolfgang, David1 aByukusenge, Maurice1 aMor, Sunil Kumar1 aGoyal, Sagar M.1 aAlbert, István,1 aTewari, Deepanker1 aJayarao, Bhushan M.1 aKuchipudi, Suresh V.0 tVirology.g2018 Sept., v. 522 p.27-36dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2018.06.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03547naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009200166300001800258520168500276592002801961650000801989650001501997650002102012650002902033650002602062650001602088650002702104650001302131650001302144650001502157650001002172650001802182650002002200650001602220650001102236650002202247650002002269650001202289650001702301650001402318650002102332650001402353650001002367650002102377653002502398653002602423653000902449653001702458653002102475653000802496653000802504653000902512653001402521653000902535653000802544653001202552653001102564653001102575653000802586653001002594700001802604773012102622856008502743852000902828655001202837IND60637985420221121065855.0190523e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063798542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2019.04.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Suhyun10aPMAP-23 triggers cell death by nitric oxide-induced redox imbalance in Escherichia coli  ap. 1187-1195.  aAntibiotic resistance is a global problem and there is an urgent need to augment the arsenal against pathogenic bacteria. The emergence of different drug resistant bacteria is threatening human lives to be pushed toward the pre-antibiotic era. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a host defense component against infectious pathogens in response to innate immunity. PMAP-23, an AMP derived from porcine myeloid, possesses antibacterial activity. It is currently not clear how the antibacterial activity of PMAP-23 is manifested.The disruptive effect of nitric oxide (NO) on the catalase activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, DNA oxidation and apoptosis-like death were evaluated using the NO generation inhibitor.In this investigation, PMAP-23 generates NO in a dose dependent manner. NO deactivated catalase and this antioxidant could not protect Escherichia coli against ROS, especially hydroxyl radical. This redox imbalance was shown to induce oxidative stress, thus leading to DNA strand break. Consequently, PMAP-23 treated E. coli cells resulted in apoptosis-like death. These physiological changes were inhibited when NO generation was inhibited. In the ΔdinF mutant, the levels of DNA strand break sharply increased and the cells were more sensitive to PMAP-23 than wild type.Our data strongly indicates that PMAP-23 mediates apoptosis-like cell death through affecting intracellular NO homeostasis. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that DinF functioned in protection from oxidative DNA damage.The identification of PMAP-23 antibacterial activity and mechanism provides a promising antibacterial agent, supporting the role of NO in cell death regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3aantimicrobial peptides 3abacteria 3acatalase 3acell death 3adeath 3adose response 3aenzyme activity 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3ahydroxyl radicals 3ainnate immunity 3amutants 3anitric oxide 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3apathogens 3aswine 3avirulent strains 0aApoptosis-like death 0aAntimicrobial peptide 0aDinF 0aNitric oxide 0aOxidative stress 0aAMP 0aCAT 0aCLSI 0aDAF-FM DA 0aFITC 0aHPF 0aH2DCFDA 0aL-NAME 0a8-OHdG 0aROS 0aTUNEL1 aLee, Dong Gun0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2019 July, v. 1863, no. 7 p.1187-1195dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2019.04.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01639naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012400154300002000278500001900298520050300317592002800820650001700848650002000865650001800885650001700903650001400920700001600934700001300950700001700963700001800980700001600998700001601014700001501030773013701045856007401182852000901256655001201265IND60710549820221119084145.0200911e20200910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071054982DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc03829f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yuchu12aA magnetically responsive drug-loaded nanocatalyst with cobalt-involved redox for the enhancement of tumor ferrotherapy  ap. 10533-10536.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHerein, cobalt-involved redox in a magnetically responsive drug-loaded nanocatalyst (PTX/Co-Lips@Fe₃O₄) was used to convert Fe(iii) to Fe(ii) for enhancing tumor ferrotherapy for the first time.

The type, extent, and cumulative effects of multiple developments must be quantified to enable mitigation. OBJECTIVES: We quantified anthropogenic development footprints in a globally significant and relatively intact region. We identified the proportion accounted for by linear infrastructure (e.g. roads) including infrastructure that is currently unmapped; investigated the importance of key landscape drivers; and explored potential ramifications of offsite impacts (edge effects). METHODS: We quantified direct development footprints of linear and ‘hub’ infrastructure in the Great Western Woodlands (GWW) in south-western Australia, using digitisation and extrapolation from a stratified random sample of aerial imagery. We used spatial datasets and literature resources to identify predictors of development footprint extent and calculate hypothetical ‘edge effect zones’. RESULTS: Unmapped linear infrastructure, only detectable through manual digitisation, accounts for the greatest proportion of the direct development footprint. Across the 160,000 km² GWW, the estimated development footprint is 690 km², of which 67% consists of linear infrastructure and the remainder is ‘hub’ infrastructure. An estimated 150,000 km of linear infrastructure exists in the study area, equating to an average of ~1 km per km². Beyond the direct footprint, a further 4000–55,000 km² (3–35% of the region) lies within edge effect zones. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the pervasiveness of linear infrastructure and hence the importance of managing its cumulative impacts as a key component of landscape conservation. Our methodology can be applied to other relatively intact landscapes worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aedge effects 3aenvironmental impact 3alandscapes 3aremote sensing 3aroads 3asand 3aspatial data 3awoodlands 3aAustralia1 aProber, Suzanne M.1 aHobbs, R.

Specifically, cashiers were trained to suggestive sell pre-packaged, convenient, low-cost, pairs of fruits or vegetables located at the checkout aisle end-cap. Overall and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program participant purchases of targeted fruits and vegetables significantly increased within treatment stores and between the treatment stores relative to the control store. A significant decreasing trend in overall produce sales in the control store was found, but not for treatment stores.

These two processes are not mutually exclusive and may either dampen or strengthen each other's effects, depending on the genetic correlation between trait values and the slopes of their norms of reaction. To examine the effect of adaptation to heat stress on the plasticity of heat tolerance, we hybridized populations of the crustacean Tigriopus californicus that show divergent phenotypes for heat tolerance. We then selected for increased heat tolerance in hybrids and measured heat tolerance and the phenotypic plasticity of heat tolerance in both selected lines and unselected controls. To test whether the changes in phenotypic plasticity were associated with changes in the plasticity of gene expression, we also sequenced transcriptomes of selected and unselected lines, both under heat shock and at ambient temperatures. We observed increased heat tolerance in selected lines, but also lower phenotypic and transcriptional plasticity in response to heat stress. The plastic response to heat stress was highly enriched for hydrolytic and catalytic activities, suggesting a prominent role for degradation of misfolded proteins. Our findings have important implications for biological responses to climate change: if adaptation to environmental stress reduces plasticity, then plasticity and adaptive evolution will make overlapping, rather than additive contributions to buffering populations from environmental change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTigriopus californicus 3aambient temperature 3acatalytic activity 3aclimate change 3aevolutionary adaptation 3agenetic correlation 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3ahybrids 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aproteins 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome1 aPankey, M.

However, no test methodology for wooden components exposed above ground reflecting the variety of different loads has been established so far. Many test protocols were modified in different ways throughout the years and results were often published only in an encoded or incomplete way. This makes it difficult to obtain comparable results to work on a comprehensive above-ground test methodology. Therefore, a comparative study on moisture performance and the resulting decay response was conducted. Five different wood species were exposed according to 24 different test methods representing a wide range of different exposure situations including in- and on-ground exposure. After three years of exposure the moisture load as well as decay development differed between the test methods and tested materials. Different parameters were identified influencing the moisture performance of wood in the respective test set-ups and finally an attempt was made to set up a test methodology providing sets of test methods for differently severe applications within use class 3.1 and 3.2 as defined in the European standard EN 335 (2013).  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica 3aPicea abies 3aPinus sylvestris 3aQuercus robur 3adecayed wood 3alumber 3amethodology 3awood beams 3awood moisture1 aBrischke, Christian1 aKällander, Björn0 tEuropean journal of wood and wood products.g2017 May, v. 75, no. 3 p.291-304dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0018-37687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00107-016-1137-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01422naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007700166300001800243520065200261592002800913650001900941650001700960650002700977773010701004856004801111852000901159655001201168IND50069987020221119204752.0131019e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006998702DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-013-0550-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJørgensen, D.10aEcological restoration in the Convention on Biological Diversity targets  ap. 2977-2982.  aEcological restoration has been incorporated into several Multilateral Environmental Agreements, including the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).

The dual net draft tube bioreactor had higher kLa value (7.3h⁻¹) than the solid tube bioreactor (5.5h⁻¹). The fungus was cultured at 25°C for 12days, then elicited with chemicals and physical factors. It was found that comparing to calcium chloride, chitosan was a more potent chemical elicitor. At dosage level of 100mg/L, it not only resulted in more biomass production but also yielded higher crude triterpenoids production. The triterpenoids production could be significantly enhanced by means of the oxygen limitation and temperature fluctuation strategies. The maximum triterpenoids production could be achieved by using static culture (oxygen limitation) with temperature fluctuation between 25°C (for 10h) and 10°C (for 14h). The in vitro anticancer activity assay indicated that the crude triterpenoids produced by A. cinnamomea using the developed elicited two-stage cultivation protocol effectively inhibited proliferation of human cervical epithelioid carcinoma HeLa cells in a dosage dependent manner. The IC₅₀ of the crude triterpenoids from the mycelium of A. cinnamomea after 21days cultivation for HeLa cells was 25μg/mL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTaiwanofungus camphoratus 3aantineoplastic agents 3abiomass production 3abioreactors 3acalcium chloride 3acarcinoma 3achitosan 3aelicitors 3afungi 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amycelium 3aoxygen 3asubmerged fermentation 3atemperature 3atriterpenoids1 aChiang, Chien-Chi1 aChiang, Been-Huang0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2012 May 15, v. 64 p.48-54dElsevier B.V.x1369-703X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2012.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245010400166520142500270592002801695650001301723650001701736650002301753650002301776650003201799650001601831650001901847650001101866650001201877651001101889700002101900773012201921856008002043852000902123655001202132IND60651351720221120135753.0190711e20160106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065135172DNAL7 a10.3390/resources50100032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVassileva, Iana10aConsumers’ Perspective on Full-Scale Adoption of Smart Meters: A Case Study in Västerås, Sweden  aLarge-scale deployment of reliable smart electricity metering networks has been considered as the first step towards a smart, integrated and efficient grid. On the consumer’s side, however, the real impact is still uncertain and limited. This paper evaluates the consumer’s perspective in the city of Västerås, Sweden, where full implementation of smart meters has been reached. New services, such as consumption feedback and the possibility to choose dynamic electricity pricing contracts, have been available from the adoption of this infrastructure. A web-based survey evaluating customers’ perception of these new services was carried out. The survey included consumers’ personal information, preferences about the type of information and the frequency of delivery and the preference for electricity pricing contracts. The results showed that the electricity consumption information offered by distribution system operators (DSOs) today is not detailed enough for customers to react accordingly. Additionally, while variable pricing contracts are becoming more popular, the available pricing schemes do not encourage customers to increase their consumption flexibility. Therefore, more detailed information from the smart meters should be made available, including disaggregated electricity consumption per appliance that would allow consumers to have more control over their energy consumption activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3acase studies 3aconsumer attitudes 3aconsumers (people) 3aelectric energy consumption 3aelectricity 3ainfrastructure 3aprices 3asurveys 3aSweden1 aCampillo, Javier0 tResources.g2016 Jan. 06, v. 5, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21558x2079-92767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/resources50100033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245007800172520183000250592002802080650002902108650001102137650002802148650001302176650001002189650001102199650000902210650003102219650001402250650001302264650002002277650002002297653001902317653001302336653002202349653002202371653001302393700002302406700002102429700002302450700002102473773011802494856008602612852000902698655001202707IND60781843220221117191522.0220802e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078184322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2022.1064162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCouch, Claire E.10aScope of the cortisol stress response in Chinook salmon during maturation  aIn semelparous Pacific salmon, increased cortisol levels accompany sexual maturation and may be related to the rapid senescence and death that occur after spawning. In fish with extremely high cortisol, pre-spawning mortality is more likely. This may be because elevated cortisol is accompanied by energy depletion and reduces the immune capacity of sexually maturing individuals, thus increasing their susceptibility to parasites and pathogens. Several studies have measured cortisol levels in Pacific salmon during the last few weeks prior to spawning, but there is a lack of information regarding longer-term changes in resting and stressed cortisol levels of migrating adult Pacific salmon. A better understanding of the scope of the cortisol response during sexual maturation could contribute to understanding the extremely high pre-spawning mortality experienced by some threatened populations of Pacific salmon. The objective of this study was to determine the scope of the cortisol stress response in spring Chinook salmon as well as the dynamics of resting cortisol during maturation. We conducted a laboratory experiment in which plasma cortisol in adult Chinook salmon was measured before and after application of a standardized stressor applied at monthly intervals during the last three months prior to spawning. We found that resting and stressed cortisol levels increased during the last three months prior to spawning. We also found that sexually maturing Chinook salmon are able to mount a cortisol response to acute stressors when resting levels are elevated during maturation. Additionally, the effects of stress and time on cortisol dynamics differed between males and females as well as between individuals, which has implications for population resilience to anthropogenic stressors in wild populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus tshawytscha 3aadults 3aanthropogenic stressors 3acortisol 3adeath 3aenergy 3afish 3alaboratory experimentation 3amortality 3aresearch 3asexual maturity 3astress response 0aPacific salmon 0aCortisol 0aStress physiology 0aSexual maturation 0aSpawning1 aColvin, Michael E.1 aChitwood, Rob L.1 aPeterson, James T.1 aSchreck, Carl B.0 tFisheries research.g2022 Oct., v. 254 p.106416-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2022.1064163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02218naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245010500214300001600319520099700335592002801332650000801360650002001368650001601388650001201404650001501416650003701431650002201468651001901490651001701509651001801526653001501544653000801559653000901567653002001576653001001596700002001606773008901626856008401715852000901799655001201808IND60546041220221121022918.0160903e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054604122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2014.09.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCerezo, Maria Isabel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5534-982X10aPAHs reduce DNA synthesis and delay cell division in the widespread primary producer Prochlorococcus  ap. 147-155.  aThe cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus is the most abundant primary producer in the ocean. In a global study across the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, we tested the effect of organic pollutants on the growth and cell division of natural Prochlorococcus populations. Sub-lethal concentrations of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) altered Prochlorococcus cell division by reducing DNA synthesis and decreasing the percentage of cells entering mitosis. Cell division time increased with PAHs dosage by 1.2 h per μg L−1 of mixture added. At PAHs dosages >1 μg L−1, Prochlorococcus cell division tended to arrest at S-phase (DNA synthesis). As a consequence, population growth was significantly reduced in the presence of PAHs. The presence of PAHs resulted in a predictable alteration of the cell cycle of the widespread cyanobacteria. The dosages tested are above concentrations in the open ocean, but found in the coastal ocean, where Prochlorococcus growth must be inhibited.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aProchlorococcus 3acell growth 3amitosis 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apopulation growth 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aIndian Ocean 3aPacific Ocean 0aCell cycle 0aDNA 0aPAHs 0aProchlorococcus 0aOcean1 aAgustí, Susana0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2015 Jan., v. 196 p.147-155dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2014.09.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009500172300001600267520183500283592002802118650002202146650001202168650001402180650002502194650001402219650000902233650001302242650001402255650001802269650001402287700002502301700002102326700002202347700002002369700002302389773013002412856008402542852000902626655001202635IND60123409420221120044149.0150325e20120801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012340942DNAL7 a10.1080/02755947.2012.6869552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFredricks, Kim T.10aFeeding Response of Sport Fish after Electrical Immobilization, Chemical Sedation, or Both  ap. 679-686.  aFishery managers frequently capture wild fish for a variety of fishery management activities. Though some activities can be accomplished without immobilizing the fish, others are accomplished more readily, humanely, and safely (for both the handler and the fish) when fish are immobilized by physical (e.g., electrical immobilization) or chemical sedation. A concern regarding the use of chemical sedatives is that chemical residues may remain in the fillet tissue after the fish recovers from sedation. If those residues are harmful to humans, there is some risk that a postsedated fish released to public waters may be caught and consumed by an angler. To characterize this risk, a series of four trials were conducted. Three trials assessed feeding activity after hatchery-reared fish were electrically immobilized, chemically sedated, or both, and one trial assessed the likelihood of an angler catching a wild fish that had been electrically immobilized and chemically sedated. Results from the first trial indicated that the feeding activity of laboratory habituated fish was variable among and within species after electrical immobilization, chemical sedation, or both. Results from the second trial indicated that the resumption of feeding activity was rapid after being mildly sedated for 45 min. Results from the third trial indicated that the feeding activity of outdoor, hatchery-reared fish was relatively aggressive after fish had been chemically sedated. Results from the fourth trial indicated that the probability of capturing wild fish in a more natural environment by angling after fish had been electrically immobilized and chemically sedated is not likely, i.e., in a group of five fish caught, 3 out of 100 times one would be a fish that had been sedated.

The manner in which cracking occurs is controlled by various environmental factors and determines dimension, shape, and orientation of polygons. Analogous small-scale features are ubiquitous in Martian mid- and high-latitudes, and they are also inferred to originate from thermal contraction cracking. We studied the geomorphometry of polygonally-patterned ground on Svalbard to draw a terrestrial analogy to small-scale polygonal structures in scalloped terrain in Martian mid-latitudes. We performed a comparative quantitative terrain analysis based on high-resolution stereo remote-sensing data (HRSC-AX and HiRISE) in combination with terrestrial field data and multivariate statistics to determine the relationship of polygon geomorphometry to local environmental conditions. Results show that polygonal structures on Svalbard and in Utopia Planitia on Mars are similar with respect to their size and shape. A comparable thermal contraction cracking genesis is likely. Polygon evolution, however, is strongly related to regional and local landscape dynamics. Individual polygon dimensions and orthogonality vary according to age, thermal contraction cracking activity, and local subsurface conditions. Based on these findings, the effects of specific past and current environmental conditions on polygon formation on Mars must be considered. On both Earth and Mars, the smallest polygons represent young, recently-active low-centered polygons that formed in fine-grained ice-rich material. Small, low-centered Martian polygons show the closest analogy to terrestrial low-centered ice-wedge polygons. The formation of composite wedges could have occurred as a result of local geomorphological conditions during past Martian orbital configurations. Larger polygons reflect past climate conditions on both Earth and Mars. The present degradation of these polygons depends on relief and topographical situation. On Svalbard the thawing of ice wedges degrades high-centered polygons; in contrast, the present appearance of polygons in Utopia Planitia is primarily the result of contemporary dry degradation processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3acracking 3aenvironmental factors 3ageomorphology 3aice 3alandscapes 3alatitude 3amultivariate analysis 3aremote sensing 3athawing 3aNorway1 aHauber, E.1 aHerzschuh, U.1 aHärtel, S.1 aSchirrmeister, L.0 tGeomorphology.g2011 Nov. 15, v. 134, no. 3-4 p.197-216dElsevier B.V.x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02260naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245014500163300001600308520116800324592002801492650000801520650002001528650001101548650004301559650001401602650001701616650001901633700001601652700001801668700001701686773012801703856008201831852000901913655001201922IND60089515520221116150252.0141102e20120120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008951552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.12.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPei, Zheng10aCopy number of adenoviral vector genome transduced into target cells can be measured using quantitative PCR: Application to vector titration  ap. 945-950.  aBoth transfection and adenovirus vectors are commonly used in studies measuring gene expression. However, the real DNA copy number that is actually transduced into target cells cannot be measured using quantitative PCR because attached DNA present on the cell surface is difficult to distinguish from successfully transduced DNA. Here, we used Cre/loxP system to show that most of the transfected DNA was in fact attached to the cell surface; in contrast, most of the viral vector DNA used to infect the target cells was present inside the cells after the cells were washed according to the conventional infection protocol. We applied this characteristic to adenoviral vector titration. Current methods of vector titration using the growth of 293 cells are influenced by the effect of the expressed gene product as well as the cell conditions and culture techniques. The titration method proposed here indicates the copy numbers introduced to the target cells using a control vector that is infected in parallel (relative vector titer: rVT). Moreover, the new titration method is simple and reliable and may replace the current titration methods of viral vectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3agene expression 3agenome 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atitration 3atransfection 3avector control1 aKondo, Saki1 aKanegae, Yumi1 aSaito, Izumu0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Jan. 20, v. 417, no. 3 p.945-950dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02269naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245005100168300001600219500001400235520108300249592002801332650001501360650001501375650001001390650001601400650001701416650001001433650001301443650001901456650001701475650001401492650001501506650001201521650003001533650001301563650002101576650001401597650001201611700001901623773009501642856007701737852000901814655001201823IND60689956120221119221401.0200424e20100415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068995612DNAL7 a10.4161/fly.4.2.116742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArchambault, Vincent10aFree centrosomes: Where do they all come from?  ap. 172-177.  aNAL-light  aCentrosomes act as major microtubule-organizing centers in most cell types. Their functions in interphase and mitosis are usually facilitated by their association with the nucleus. This may be particularly true in very large cells. Several papers report free centrosomes in syncytial Drosophila embryos. However, this phenotype often remains little explored. Yet, free centrosomes can occur by multiple mechanisms, including functional defects of the mitotic spindle, detachment of centrosomes from the nuclear envelope, centrosome inactivation upon DNA damage, and de novo centrosome genesis. Deciphering the cellular mechanism leading to free centrosomes upon a given perturbation such as a mutation or injection of a drug, can provide valuable clues regarding the nature of the molecular pathway affected. To this end, genetic and cytological tests, as well as time-lapse imaging are available. These studies can inform on the biology of centrosomes, cell cycle regulation and cytoskeletal dynamics. Here we briefly discuss what to make of free centrosomes in the fly embryo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aDrosophila 3acells 3acentrosomes 3acytoskeleton 3adrugs 3adynamics 3aimage analysis 3ainactivation 3ainjection 3ainterphase 3amitosis 3amitotic spindle apparatus 3amutation 3anuclear membrane 3aphenotype 3atesting1 aPinson, Xavier0 tFly.g2010 Apr. 15, v. 4, no. 2 p.172-177dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2251x1933-69427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/fly.4.2.116743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02178naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245006600205300001500271520092700286592002801213650001301241650002001254650002001274650001201294650001601306650002801322650000701350650001801357650000901375650001701384650001401401653001201415653001801427653002001445653002401465653001201489700001801501700002601519773010601545856008401651852000901735655001201744IND60606886620221119001212.0180730e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060688662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2015.11.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSizmur, Tom1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9835-719510aEffects of coastal managed retreat on mercury biogeochemistry  ap. 99-106.  aWe investigated the impact of managed retreat on mercury (Hg) biogeochemistry at a site subject to diffuse contamination with Hg. We collected sediment cores from an area of land behind a dyke one year before and one year after it was intentionally breached. These sediments were compared to those of an adjacent mudflat and a salt marsh. The concentration of total mercury (THg) in the sediment doubled after the dyke was breached due to the deposition of fresh sediment that had a smaller particle size, and higher pH. The concentration of methylmercury (MeHg) was 27% lower in the sediments after the dyke was breached. We conclude that coastal flooding during managed retreat of coastal flood defences at this site has not increased the risk of Hg methylation or bioavailability during the first year. As the sediment becomes vegetated, increased activity of Hg-methylating bacteria may accelerate Hg-methylation rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abioavailability 3abiogeochemistry 3amercury 3amethylation 3amethylmercury compounds 3apH 3aparticle size 3arisk 3asalt marshes 3asediments 0aMercury 0aMethylmercury 0aBiogeochemistry 0aSediment deposition 0aCoastal1 aGodfrey, Adam1 aO'Driscoll, Nelson J.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2016 Feb., v. 209 p.99-106dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2015.11.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245016000161300001800321520169000339592002802029650004402057650001502101650001902116650001102135650002102146650001602167650002002183650001402203650001302217650002102230650001302251650002302264650001302287650003302300650001102333650001602344650002102360700002502381700001902406700001702425773013502442856008202577852000902659655001202668IND60549143520221119193932.0160907e20160907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054914352DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.6b023192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbedi, Ali10aGraft Copolymerization of Glycidyl Methacrylate and Ethylene Glycol Dimethacrylate on Alumina for the Removal of Nitrogen and Sulfur Compounds from Gas Oil  ap. 9408-9415.  aFunctionalized polymers were synthesized and applied in removing nitrogen and sulfur compounds from gas oils. In this work, the polyglycidyl methacrylate-co-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate polymer incorporated with tetranitrofluorenone, PGMA-DAP-TENF, was synthesized with and without alumina support. Different techniques were used to characterize the synthesized polymers including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method, dynamic light scattering, thermogravimetry/differenial thermal analyzer, carbon hydrogen nitrogen sulfur elemental analysis, and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The performance of the polymer with alumina, Al-PGMA-DAP-TENF, was compared to that without alumina using light gas oil. In addition, heavy gas oil feed was used to confirm the adsorption behavior of both polymers in a higher nitrogen and sulfur environment. The effect of adsorption time and temperature was tested using a 1:5, by weight, polymer to feed ratio. Results have shown that alumina particles enhanced the nitrogen removal efficiency of PGMA-DAP-TENF polymer while sulfur removal efficiency was not affected. The nitrogen removal efficiency of Al-PGMA-DAP-TENF polymer was more than twice that of PGMA-DAP-TENF polymer in LGO feed, and twice that in HGO feed. This was due to the higher surface area of Al-PGMA-DAP-TENF polymer, 202 m²/g, compared to that of PGMA-DAP-TENF polymer, 27 m²/g. In addition, Al-PGMA-DAP-TENF polymer removed more basic nitrogen compounds than PGMA-DAP-TENF polymer. This was attributed to the acidic nature of alumina particles that enhance the adsorption of basic nitrogen compounds present in gas oil feeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aaluminum oxide 3acarbon 3acopolymerization 3aengineering 3aethylene glycol 3afuel oils 3ahydrogen 3alight scattering 3anitrogen 3anitrogen compounds 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asulfur 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry1 aChitanda, Jackson

European hake has been rated as overexploited in the Mediterranean, thus careful management is advisable. Mediterranean hake is well-differentiated from Atlantic hake, but sub-population structure within the Mediterranean, and how this structure could be translated into stocks (operative management units), is still an elusive topic. Otolith shape and chemistry (concentration of trace elements) have been systematically used to distinguish fish stocks. Our aim was therefore to assess the discrimination capability (assigning fish to the correct geographical unit) of otolith shape and microchemistry at two geographical scales within the Mediterranean: (1) the official geographical subareas (GSAs), and (2) three larger units previously suggested by genetic markers (i.e., Western Mediterranean, Adriatic with Central Mediterranean, and Eastern Mediterranean). Two complementary analyses were completed because shape is more easily analyzed than chemistry. First, a large sample of juvenile hake (n = 1656) from 40 Mediterranean GSAs subunits was used for shape analysis. Second, a subsample of those fish (n = 154) from 10 GSAs was analyzed for both otolith shape and microchemistry. Irrespective of the type of data (shape and/or chemistry) and geographical scale (GSAs versus the 3-units), between-unit differences were always statistically significant. However, according to the large within-unit variability, discrimination capability was always poor but better at the GSA scale, and even better when both shape and microchemistry were combined. Moreover, unsupervised clustering methods (the number and limits of the units are data-driven and not a priori defined as above) failed to find an optimal structure. Overall, these results are fully compatible with the hypothesis of a continuous gradient, within which discrete spatial units cannot be safely recognized.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMerluccius merluccius 3achemistry 3ahake 3ajuveniles 3aotoliths 3aresearch 0aMerluccius merluccius 0aPopulation 0aSagittal otolith 0aShape 0aGeotags 0aMediterranean Sea1 aPérez-Mayol, Sílvia1 aMacKenzie, Kirsteen1 aCatalán, Ignacio A.1 aPalmer, Miquel1 aKersaudy, Thibault1 aMahé, Kélig0 tFisheries research.g2022 Oct., v. 254 p.106419-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2022.1064193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03754naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003500145245015600180300001600336500002000352520236300372592002802735650001802763650002402781650001902805650002302824650002302847650001302870650003102883650001402914650001502928650001402943650001502957650001002972650001702982651002102999700002303020700002303043700003203066700002203098773010003120856007903220852000903299655001203308IND60571792620221119162746.0170712e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057179262DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.127292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeanniard‐du‐Dot, Tiphaine10aAccelerometers can measure total and activity‐specific energy expenditures in free‐ranging marine mammals only if linked to time‐activity budgets  ap. 377-386.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEnergy expenditure is an important component of foraging ecology, but is extremely difficult to estimate in free‐ranging animals and depends on how animals partition their time between different activities during foraging. Acceleration data have emerged as a new way to determine energy expenditure at a fine scale but this needs to be tested and validated in wild animals. This study investigated whether vectorial dynamic body acceleration (VeDBA) could accurately predict the energy expended by marine predators during a full foraging trip. We also aimed to determine whether the accuracy of predictions of energy expenditure derived from acceleration increased when partitioned by different types of at‐sea activities (i.e. diving, transiting, resting and surface activities). To do so, we equipped 20 lactating northern (Callorhinus ursinus) and 20 lactating Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) with GPS, time‐depth recorders and tri‐axial accelerometers and obtained estimates of field metabolic rates using the doubly labelled water (DLW) method. VeDBA was derived from tri‐axial acceleration, and at‐sea activities (diving, transiting, resting and surface activities) were determined using dive depth, tri‐axial acceleration and travelling speed. We found that VeDBA did not accurately predict the total energy expended by fur seals during their full foraging trips (R² = 0·36). However, the accuracy of VeDBA as a predictor of total energy expenditure increased significantly when foraging trips were partitioned by activity and when activity‐specific VeDBA was paired with time‐activity budgets (R² = 0·70). Activity‐specific VeDBA also accurately predicted the energy expenditures of each activity independent of each other (R² > 0·85). Our study confirms that acceleration is a promising way to estimate energy expenditures of free‐ranging marine mammals at a fine scale never attained before. However, it shows that it needs to be based on the time‐activity budgets that make up foraging trips rather than being derived as a single measure of VeDBA applied to entire foraging trips. Our activity‐based method provides a cost‐effective means to accurately calculate energy expenditures of fur seals using acceleration and time‐activity budgets, that can be transfered to studies on other species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArctocephalus 3aCallorhinus ursinus 3aaccelerometers 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy expenditure 3aforaging 3aglobal positioning systems 3alactation 3ametabolism 3apredators 3aprediction 3aseals 3awild animals 3aAntarctic region1 aGuinet, Christophe1 aArnould, John P.Y.1 aSpeakman, J.

Using the cloned genomic DNAs of faba bean necrotic stunt virus (FBNSV) for reconstituting nanovirus infections we analyzed the necessity of different virus components for infection and transmission by aphids. We found that in the absence of DNA-U1 and DNA-U2 symptom severity decreased, and in the absence of DNA-U1 the transmission efficiency decreased. Most significantly, we demonstrated that the protein encoded by DNA-N (NSP) is mandatory for aphid transmission. Moreover, we showed that the NSP of FBNSV could substitute for that of a distantly related nanovirus, pea necrotic yellow dwarf virus. Altering the FBNSV NSP by adding 13 amino acids to its carboxy-terminus resulted in an infectious but non-transmissible virus. We demonstrate that the NSP acts as a nanovirus transmission factor, the existence of which had been hypothesized earlier.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphidoidea 3aNanovirus 3afaba beans 3agenome 3agenomics 3apeas 3asingle-stranded DNA 3avirology 3aviruses 0aPlant virus 0aSegmented single-stranded DNA genome 0aTransmission helper factor 0aReassortment 0aFaba bean 0aAphis craccivora 0aAcyrthosiphon pisum1 aVetten, Heinrich-Josef1 aCommandeur, Ulrich1 aZiebell, Heiko1 aGronenborn, Bruno1 aTimchenko, Tatiana0 tVirology.g2018 Sept., v. 522 p.281-291dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2018.07.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002800143245012800171300001500299500001400314520149900328592002801827650001501855650001201870650001001882650001601892650001501908650002801923650000901951650001201960650001301972650001901985650002202004650001302026650002502039650002202064700001902086773009402105856007702199852000902276655001202285IND60689956220221119221253.0200424e20100415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068995622DNAL7 a10.4161/fly.4.2.118612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanxaridis, Parthena D.12aA forward genetic screen in Drosophilamelanogaster to identify mutations affecting INAD localization in photoreceptor cells  ap. 95-103.  aNAL-light  aIn Drosophila photoreceptors, the multivalent PDZ protein INAD interacts with multiple signaling components and localizes complexes to the rhabdomere, a subcellular compartment specialized for phototransduction. Since this localization is critical for signaling, we conducted a genetic screen of the third chromosome for mutations that result in mislocalization of an INAD-GFP fusion protein. We identified seven mutant lines that fall into two complementation groups, idl (INAD localization) -A and idl-B. We show that idl-A mutants fail to complement with chaoptic (chp) mutants. Since chaoptin is a structural component of the rhabdomere, mislocalization of INAD may be a secondary effect of the retinal degeneration in chp and idl-A mutants. Genetic complementation and DNA sequencing reveal that the two idl-B mutants represent new alleles of trp, a gene encoding the major light-activated channel. The molecular change in each allele affects a highly conserved residue in either an ankyrin domain on the N-terminus or in the S6 transmembrane domain of TRP. These changes lead to the loss of TRP protein. TRP has previously been shown to anchor INAD in the rhabdomeres, therefore the independent identification of two trp alleles validates our screen for INAD-GFP localization. One possibility is that a limited number of proteins are required for localizing INAD-signaling complexes. A similar screen of the X and second chromosomes may be required to find the remaining players involved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aalleles 3acells 3achromosomes 3acomplement 3agenetic complementation 3alead 3amutants 3amutation 3aphotoreceptors 3aphototransduction 3aproteins 3aretinal degeneration 3asequence analysis1 aTsunoda, Susan0 tFly.g2010 Apr. 15, v. 4, no. 2 p.95-103dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2251x1933-69427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/fly.4.2.118613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02970naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245014000169300001600309520156000325592002801885650002001913650001501933650001401948650002201962650002201984650001802006650003702024650002702061650001702088650002202105650001302127650002202140650001302162651001802175700002702193700002502220700002002245700005902265773012102324856008202445852000902527655001202536IND60717466620221119002932.0201111e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071746662DNAL7 a10.1007/s10709-020-00106-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHibbets, Eric M.10aGenetic evidence of hybridization between Magellanic (Sphensicus magellanicus) and Humboldt (Spheniscus humboldti) penguins in the wild  ap. 215-228.  aThe process of hybridization between closely related species plays an important role in defining the genetic integrity and overall genetic diversity of species. The distribution range of Magellanic (Spheniscus magellanicus) and Humboldt (Spheniscus humboldti) penguins is predominantly allopatric; however, the species share a region of sympatry where they may hybridize. We analyzed four types of genetic markers (including nuclear and mitochondrial markers) to assess their utility in detecting hybridization events between Magellanic and Humboldt penguins. Genetic assessment of non-introgressed reference samples allowed us to identify three types of informative markers (microsatellites, major histocompatibility complex, and mitochondrial DNA) and detect positive evidence of introgressive hybridization in the wild. Four out of six putative hybrids showed positive evidence of hybridization, revealed by the detection of Humboldt mitochondrial DNA and Magellanic species-specific alleles from nuclear markers. Bayesian Structure analysis, including samples from the sympatric region of the species in the southern Pacific Ocean, confirmed the use of nuclear markers for detecting hybridization and genetic admixture of putative hybrids, but revealed relatively low levels of genetic introgression at the population level. These findings provide insights into the role of hybridization in regions of species sympatry and its potential consequences on the levels of genetic introgression, genetic diversity, and conservation of these penguin species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aSpheniscus 3aallopatry 3agenetic stability 3agenetic variation 3aintrogression 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3apenguins 3aspecies diversity 3asympatry 3aPacific Ocean1 aSchumacher, Katelyn I.1 aScheppler, Hannah B.1 aBoersma, P.

The borepin synthesis features streamlined Ti-mediated alkyne reduction, leading to Z-olefins, followed by direct lithiation and borepin formation. These molecules allow for an assessment of aromatic competition between the fused rings and the central borepin core. Crystallographic, magnetic, and computational studies yielded insights about the aromaticity of novel, differentially fused [b,f]borepins and allowed for comparison to literature compounds. Multiple borepin motifs were also incorporated into polycyclic aromatics with five or six rings in the main backbone, and their properties were also evaluated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3amagnetism 3aorganic chemistry1 aSiegler, Maxime A.1 aTovar, John D.0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2016 July 01, v. 81, no. 13 p.5595-5605dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.6b009273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01458naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011400159300002000273500001900293520039500312592002800707650001500735650001200750650001200762650001400774700001700788700001600805700001900821700001400840700001700854700001700871773013700888856007401025852000901099655001201108IND60710550320221122064918.0200911e20200910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071055032DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc04007j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiurong10aOptimizing zirconium metal–organic frameworks through steric tuning for efficient removal of Cr₂O₇²⁻  ap. 10513-10516.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA ligand with a flexible conformation can be obtained by modifying functional groups.

Most canine-related sources (66%; n = 19) were case studies reporting a decrease of learner undesired behavior when using oral instruction (21%; n = 6). Most human-related research used single-case designs (57%; n = 26) reporting an increase in desired learner behavior (22%; n = 10) when caregivers received multi-component training packages (17%, n = 8). The meta-analysis (n = 18) revealed that interventions had a large effect (Hedges’ g = 0.88, 95%CI [0.68–1.07]), with packages yielding a slightly larger moderate effect (Hedges’ g = 0.76, 95%CI [0.60–0.91]) than oral instruction alone (Hedges’ g = 0.74, 95%CI [0.32–1,15]). Although the effectiveness of caregiver training is promising, the results should be interpreted cautiously. Due to the preponderance of case studies within canine literature and the insufficient reporting of data across sources, only few studies could be included in the meta-analysis. Overall, more systematic and comparative research regarding the efficacy of caregivers in behavior change programs across species is needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3abehavior change 3acaregivers 3acase studies 3adogs 3ahumans 3ameta-analysis 3asystematic review 0aSystematic-review 0ahuman-dog relationship 0acaregiver-training 0ainterventions1 aMedina, Lucia1 aDillenburger, Karola1 aHurtado-Parrado, Camilo0 tJournal of applied animal welfare science.g2020 July 02, v. 23, no. 3 p.265-301dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56472x1532-76047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10888705.2019.16461343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141100001800159245009800177300001600275500000900291520160600300592002801906650003101934650002401965650001801989650002402007700001802031700001802049773014802067852000902215856009602224655001202320IND2036618920221120222208.0191125e199307  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203661892DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1993.03615995005700040004x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuchan, G. D.10aImproved Models of Particle-Size Distribution: An Illustration of Model Comparison Techniques  ap. 901-908.  aepub  aWe investigated a relatively unexplored area of soil science: the fitting of parameterized models to particle-size distribution (a subject more thoroughly explored in sedimentology). Comparative fitting of different models requires the use of statistical indices enabling rational selection of an optimum model, i.e., a model that balances the improvement in fit often achieved by increasing the number of parameters, p, against model simplicity retained by minimizing p. Five models were tested on cumulative mass-size data for 71 texturally diverse New Zealand soils: a one-parameter (p = 1) Jaky model borrowed from geotechnics; the standard lognormal model (p = 2); two modified lognormal models (each with p = 3); and the bimodal lognormal model (p = 3). The Jaky and modified lognormal models have not previously been introduced into the soil science literature. Three statistical comparators were used: the coefficient of determination, R²; the F statistic; and the Cₚ statistic of Mallows. The bimodal model and one modified lognormal model (denoted ORL) best fit the data. The bimodal model gave a marginally better fit, but incorporates a sub-clay mode (untestable with the present data), so we adopted the ORL model as the physically best benchmark for comparison of other models. The simple Jaky one-parameter model gave a good fit to data for many of the soils, better than the standard lognormal model for 23 soils. The model comparison methods described have potential utility in other areas of soil science.

Mutations in gfr disrupt patterns of cell differentiation in the eye and increase eye size through a proliferative mechanism that can be enhanced by a block in apoptosis. gfr mutant cells show several features of deregulated Ras/MAP kinase activity, including reduced expression of the Capicua growth suppressing transcription factor and synthetically lethality with alleles of the Jun N-terminal kinase phosphatase puckered. gfr alleles also upreguate Notch activity in the eye. Thus, gfr alleles appear to elicit growth and patterning phenotypes via effects on multiple signaling pathways. Moreover, the gfr alleles behave as gain-of-function lesions and overexpress the gene bruno-3 (bru-3), which is located at the genomic region to which gfr lesions map. Genetic reduction of bru-3 suppresses phenotypes caused by gfr alleles, and like gfr alleles, overexpression of bru-3 depresses levels of Cic protein, indicating that overexpression of bru-3 is central to gfr mutant phenotypes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aalleles 3aapoptosis 3acell differentiation 3acells 3adeath 3aeyes 3afruit flies 3again-of-function mutation 3agenomics 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amutants 3aphenotype 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factors1 aMoberg, Kenneth H.0 tFly.g2010 Apr. 15, v. 4, no. 2 p.104-116dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2251x1933-69427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/fly.4.2.118903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03868naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245014500168300001600313520249700329592002802826650001802854650002402872650001702896650002002913650001602933650002302949650002002972650002902992650001503021650001103036650001703047650001403064650001203078650001403090650001503104650001503119650001603134700001903150700001503169700001603184773011303200856008803313852000903401655001203410IND4477166620221118010029.0150812e20111222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447716662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2011.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatte, J.J.10aInteraction between dietary tryptophan and pyridoxine on tryptophan metabolism, immune responses and growth performance in post-weaning pigs  ap. 256-264.  aSeveral aspects of tryptophan (Trp) metabolism are dependent upon pyridoxine (B₆) status. The present experiment aimed to determine if Trp metabolism and the eventual growth responses to dietary supplementation of Trp is modulated by dietary B₆. Exploratory measurements related to the modulation of the immune system were also made. Piglets weaned at 15 to 18 days of age (n=544) were grouped in 32 pens of 17 animals and distributed in a factorial arrangement of treatments with two dietary additions of B₆ [0 (B₆−) or 5mg/kg (B₆+)] and two dietary additions of synthetic Trp [0 (Trp−) or 0.5g/kg (Trp+)]. Basal dietary concentrations of B₆ varied according to age, between 2.1 and 3.5mg/kg, and for Trp, between 1.9 and 2.5g/kg. Growth performance was recorded every week from 2 to 9 weeks of age. Blood samples were taken from two piglets in each pen at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of age. Another piglet in each pen was immunized twice with ovalbumin emulsified with incomplete Freund adjuvant to evaluate the antibody response. No treatment effect was observed on feed intake, body weight gain or feed conversion ratio for the whole experimental period but feed conversion increased more drastically in Trp− than in Trp+ piglets during the last week of experiment (B₆×Trp×age, P<0.05). Pyridoxal, an active B₆ vitamer, was 19% lower in red blood cells of B₆− than B₆+ piglets (B₆×age, P<0.01). Plasma Trp and kynurenine (an intermediate metabolite of Trp oxidation) decreased with age (P<0.01). Plasma nicotinamide, an indicator of niacin status, increased with age and remained approximately 45% higher in Trp+ piglets than in Trp− piglets (Trp×age, P<0.01). Antibody response to ovalbumin was enhanced in Trp− piglets (Trp×age, P<0.01). The lymphocyte proliferative response to Concavalin A was lower (P<0.05) in B₆+ than in B₆− piglets. The percentage of B lymphocyte population at 4 and 6 weeks of age dropped in B₆− animals whereas it remained stable in B₆+ piglets (B₆×age, P<0.05). In spite of late and short changes of feed conversion ratio (interaction B₆×Trp×age), the results indicate that, globally, within the present dietary levels, pyridoxine is not a major factor for Trp metabolism and therefore, for Trp requirements of post-weaning piglets. The absence of interaction between B₆ and Trp on the present immunological indicators suggest that each nutrient modulates the immune response through independent mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3adietary supplements 3aerythrocytes 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3agrowth performance 3aimmune response 3alymphocyte proliferation 3ametabolism 3aniacin 3anicotinamide 3aovalbumin 3apiglets 3apyridoxal 3apyridoxine 3atryptophan 3aweight gain1 aLeFloc’h, N.1 aPrimot, Y.1 aLessard, M.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2011 Dec. 22, v. 170, no. 3-4 p.256-264dElsevier B.V.x0377-84017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2011.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02068naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007300166300001600239500001900255520080000274592002801074650000801102650002001110650002001130650003001150650002201180650001701202653002301219653002501242653002201267653003701289653001701326653001801343700002101361700001601382700001701398700002301415773011601438856008301554852000901637655001201646IND60720072520221122062830.0210312e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072007252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibs.2020.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDumas, Leïla10aG-Quadruplexes in RNA Biology: Recent Advances and Future Directions  ap. 270-283.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRNA G-quadruplexes (RG4s) are four-stranded structures known to control gene expression mechanisms, from transcription to protein synthesis, and DNA-related processes.

This is particularly evident across large portions of the High Plains Aquifer where groundwater levels have declined at unsustainable rates despite improvements in both the efficiency of water use and water productivity in agricultural practices. Improved technology and land use practices have not mitigated groundwater level declines, thus water management strategies must adapt accordingly or risk further resource loss. In this study, we analyze the water-energy-food nexus over the High Plains Aquifer as a framework to isolate the major drivers that have shaped the history, and will direct the future, of water use in modern agriculture. Based on this analysis, we conclude that future water management strategies can benefit from: (1) prioritizing farmer profit to encourage decision-making that aligns with strategic objectives, (2) management of water as both an input into the water-energy-food nexus and a key incentive for farmers, (3) adaptive frameworks that allow for short-term objectives within long-term goals, (4) innovative strategies that fit within restrictive political frameworks, (5) reduced production risks to aid farmer decision-making, and (6) increasing the political desire to conserve valuable water resources. This research sets the foundation to address water management as a function of complex decision-making trends linked to the water-energy-food nexus. Water management strategy recommendations are made based on the objective of balancing farmer profit and conserving water resources to ensure future agricultural production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3adecision making 3afarmers 3aland use 3apolitics 3awater management 3awater supply 3awater table 3awater use efficiency 0aHigh Plains Aquifer 0aWater management 0aIrrigation 0aAgriculture 0aEconomics 0aPolicy1 aHaacker, Erin M.K.1 aKendall, Anthony D.1 aDeines, Jillian M.1 aPei, Lisi1 aCotterman, Kayla A.1 aLi, Haoyang1 aLiu, Xiao1 aBasso, Bruno1 aHyndman, David W.0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 566-567 p.988-1001dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.05.1273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009000160300001800250520173800268592002802006650001502034650001802049650001502067650001602082650001702098650001902115650001902134650001302153650002302166650004102189650001102230650002502241700002202266700002402288773011102312856007502423852000902498655001202507IND60529856720221119003136.0160720e20141007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052985672DNAL7 a10.1021/ac50264182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMabry, Joshua
N.10aSingle-Molecule Insights into Retention at a Reversed-Phase Chromatographic Interface  ap. 9451-9458.  aThe efficiency of chromatographic separations decreases markedly when peaks exhibit asymmetry (e.g., “peak tailing”). Theoretically, these effects can arise from heterogeneous adsorption kinetics. To investigate the nature and consequences of such heterogeneity, we used a combination of single-molecule imaging and reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). In both single-molecule and macroscopic RPLC experiments, the stationary phase was hydrophobic end-capped (trimethylsilyl-functionalized) silica, which we exposed to different methanol/water solutions (50%–62% methanol), containing a fluorescent fatty acid analyte. Super-resolution maps based on single-molecule observations revealed rare, strong adsorption sites with activity that varied significantly with methanol concentration. The adsorption and desorption kinetics on the strong sites were heterogeneous and positively correlated, suggesting a broad underlying distribution of site binding energies. Adsorption equilibrium on the strong sites was more sensitive to solution conditions than overall retention measured in RPLC experiments, suggesting that the effect of strong sites on the overall adsorption kinetics should change with solution conditions. Interestingly, in RPLC experiments, peak tailing had a nonmonotonic dependence on methanol concentration within the range studied. Using the stochastic model of chromatography, we showed quantitatively that our single-molecule kinetic results were consistent with this macroscopic trend. This approach to identifying and quantifying adsorption sites should be useful for designing better chromatographic separations and for identifying the role of heterogeneous surface chemistry in molecular dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abinding sites 3adesorption 3afatty acids 3afluorescence 3ahydrophobicity 3aimage analysis 3amethanol 3amolecular dynamics 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3asilica 3astochastic processes1 aSkaug, Michael J.1 aSchwartz, Daniel K.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 Oct. 07, v. 86, no. 19 p.9451-9458dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac50264183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03652naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001700189245007700206300002000283506007600303520113800379592002801517506003701545650001801582650001401600650001001614650003101624650002901655650001301684650001801697650002401715650001301739650002601752650001301778650001301791650002301804650001801827653001301845653002701858653002501885653001801910653001401928653001501942653004601957653002002003653003802023653003102061700002302092700002202115700002302137700002002160700002202180700002102202700003002223700002002253700002502273700002302298700001702321700002402338700002402362700001902386700002702405700001602432700001702448700001802465700002102483700002502504700002502529700002402554700001902578700002102597773010002618856008302718852000902801655001202810IND60585361420221207140137.0181120e20171102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058536142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2017.09.0282doi7 aPMC56855502pmcid7 a290331302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiaz, Nadeem10aTumor and Microenvironment Evolution during Immunotherapy with Nivolumab  ap. 934-949.e16.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe mechanisms by which immune checkpoint blockade modulates tumor evolution during therapy are unclear. We assessed genomic changes in tumors from 68 patients with advanced melanoma, who progressed on ipilimumab or were ipilimumab-naive, before and after nivolumab initiation (CA209-038 study). Tumors were analyzed by whole-exome, transcriptome, and/or T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing. In responding patients, mutation and neoantigen load were reduced from baseline, and analysis of intratumoral heterogeneity during therapy demonstrated differential clonal evolution within tumors and putative selection against neoantigenic mutations on-therapy. Transcriptome analyses before and during nivolumab therapy revealed increases in distinct immune cell subsets, activation of specific transcriptional networks, and upregulation of immune checkpoint genes that were more pronounced in patients with response. Temporal changes in intratumoral TCR repertoire revealed expansion of T cell clones in the setting of neoantigen loss. Comprehensive genomic profiling data in this study provide insight into nivolumab's mechanism of action.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3aevolution 3aexons 3agene expression regulation 3agene regulatory networks 3agenomics 3aimmunotherapy 3amechanism of action 3amelanoma 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amutation 3apatients 3atemporal variation 3atranscriptome 0amelanoma 0atumor microenvironment 0atumor immune evasion 0aimmunotherapy 0anivolumab 0aipilimumab 0atumor mutation load/tumor mutation burden 0aneoantigen load 0aclonal evolution/clonal selection 0aT cell receptor repertoire1 aHavel, Jonathan J.1 aMakarov, Vladimir1 aDesrichard, Alexis1 aUrba, Walter J.1 aSims, Jennifer S.1 aHodi, F.

The NM09 isolate was characterized by RT-PCR and nucleotide sequence analysis. Its complete genome was 15,456 nucleotides in length. Similar to other sequenced PIV strains, the NM09 virus consisted of six non-overlapping genes, which were predicted to encode nine proteins with conserved and complementary 3′ leader and 5′ trailer regions, conserved gene starts, gene stops, and trinucleotide intergenic sequences. Nucleotide phylogenetic analysis of matrix and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene demonstrated that this NM09 isolate belonged to BPIV3 genotype A instead of the previously reported BPIV3 genotype C in China. It is implicated that the different genotypes A and C might coexist infection for a long time in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3anose 3asequence analysis 3aproteins 3aherds 3acell culture 3acattle 3anucleotides 3aphylogeny 3aviruses 3agenes 3agenotype 3aintergenic DNA 3aBovine respirovirus 3 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCattlexvirology 2aCell Line 2aGenes, Viral 2aGenome Size 2aGenotype 2aHN Proteinxgenetics 2aParainfluenza Virus 3, Bovinexclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aPhylogeny 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aViral Matrix Proteinsxgenetics 2aVirus Cultivationxmethods 3aChina 0aChina 0aBovine parainfluenza virus 31 aShi, Xin-Chuan1 aWang, Feng-Xue1 aWang, Wei1 aZhang, Shu-Qin1 aLi, Guo1 aSong, Ni1 aChen, Li-Zhi1 aCheng, Shi-Peng1 aWu, Hua0 tVirus genes.g2012 Dec., v. 45, no. 3 p.542-547dSpringer-Verlagx0920-85697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-012-0810-1  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001900146245012700165300001600292500002400308500001500332520129100347650001901638650001501657650001801672650002301690650001301713650002201726650001401748650001501762650001901777650002601796650002101822650003101843651002101874653001401895653002901909653002401938653002401962653001501986653002502001653002802026653003002054653001802084653002302102700001702125773011702142852000902259856007602268856008602344930003302430945001302463946001302476961001202489655001202501IND2332307720221119081315.0030429e200210  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233230772DNAL7 a10.1603/0046-225X-31.5.7662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindgren, B.S.10aEffect of verbenone on attraction of predatory and woodboring beetles (Coleoptera) to kairomones in lodgepole pine forests  ap. 766-773.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe response of bark beetle predators and woodboring beetles to the bark beetle anti-aggregation pheromone, verbenone, was tested in the field with multiple-funnel traps baited with attractant kairomones. Catches of the predators Thanasimus undatulus (Say), Enoclerus sphegeus (F.), Enoclerus lecontei (Wolcott) (Coleoptera: Cleridae), and Lasconotus complex LeConte (Coleoptera: Colydiidae) declined significantly with increasing release rates of verbenone. Lasconotus subcostulatus Kraus, and Corticeus praetermissus (Fall) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) (in two of three experiments), showed no significant response to verbenone. In a third experiment, catches of C. praetermissus increased with verbenone dose. Likewise, catches of the striped ambrosia beetle, Trypodendron lineatum (Olivier) (Coleoptera: Scolytidae), increased with verbenone dose in one experiment, but there was no effect in two other experiments. Verbenone had no effect on the response of Spondylis upiformis Mannerheim (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae). We hypothesize that predators specializing on early successional bark beetles are repelled by verbenone since this compound indicates a late stage attack. Generalist predators and woodborers either do not respond to verbenone at all, or they may be attracted by it. 3aboring insects 3akairomones 3adose response 3ainsect attractants 3atrapping 3apredatory insects 3averbenone 3abait traps 3aPinus contorta 3aTrypodendron lineatum 3achemical ecology 3aantiaggregation pheromones 3aBritish Columbia 0apredators 0alasconotus subcostulatus 0aenoclerus lecontiei 0aspondylis upiformis 0aColeoptera 0athanasimus undatulus 0acorticeus praetermissus 0apredators of insect pests 0arelease rates 0aenoclerus sphegeus1 aMiller, D.R.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2002 Oct., v. 31, no. 5 p.766-773dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.entsoc.org/pubs/periodicals/ee/index.htm3Tables on contents40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X-31.5.7663Available from publisher's Web site  a20050410b20050501c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle02647naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245016800165300002000333520151700353592002801870650001601898650002001914650001101934650001101945650001301956650001001969650001501979650001501994700001602009700001602025700001702041700001902058773011302077856008602190852000902276655001202285IND60558461520221120163841.0161115e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055846152DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.6b030692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhn, Sujin10aUltrasensitive Detection of α-Fetoprotein by Total Internal Reflection Scattering-Based Super-Resolution Microscopy for Superlocalization of Nano-Immunoplasmonics  ap. 11070-11076.  aSuperlocalization of immunoplasmonic nanotags on antibody-bound gold-nanoislands (GNIs) along the x and y coordinates was determined using total internal reflection scattering-based super-resolution microscopy (TIRS-SRM) at subdiffraction limit resolution. Individual immunoplasmonic nanotags (20 nm silver nanoparticles) and 100 nm GNIs were selectively acquired in the evanescent field layer by wavelength-dependent plasmonic scattering using two illumination lasers (405 and 635 nm, respectively). α-Fetoprotein (AFP), a liver cancer-related model protein, was immobilized as a target molecule on the GNI arrays. The centroid position of a localized immunoplasmonic nanotag on the GNI was resolved at less than 10 nm of spatial resolution by applying 2D Gaussian fitting to its point spread function. This method showed enhanced sensitive quantification with a limit of detection (LOD) of 7.04 zM (1–2 molecules of AFP/GNI), which was 100–5000000000 times lower than detection limits obtained with previous AFP detection methods. Furthermore, the method was also successfully applied to quantify AFP molecules at the single-molecule level in human serum samples. The wavelength-dependent TIRS-SRM method was demonstrated to be an effective tool for superlocalizing individual protein molecules and interactions in nanoscale regions and was a reliable method for the ultrasensitive quantitative detection of disease-related protein molecules as a nanosensor and for diagnosis at the single-molecule level.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3ahumans 3alasers 3alighting 3aliver 3amicroscopy 3ananosilver1 aZhang, Peng1 aYu, Hyunung1 aLee, Seungah1 aKang, Seong Ho0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 88, no. 22 p.11070-11076dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.6b030693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03968naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245007400206300001200280500001500292506007600307520200300383592002802386506003702414650000902451650001002460650001802470650001702488650000902505650000902514650002202523650001102545650001202556650001002568650001202578650002002590650000902610650002602619650001502645650001002660650002402670650001002694650004502704650001102749650000902760650001202769650001302781650004302794650000902837650002602846650001202872650005202884650001702936650002002953650001102973653002902984700001503013700001603028700001903044700001303063773009203076856008103168852000903249655001203258IND60555543620221207101958.0161029e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055554362DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-015-1175-92doi7 aPMC46254462pmcid7 a265151692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaoyun10aReference gene stability of a synanthropic fly, Chrysomya megacephala  ap. 565.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Stable reference genes are essential for accurate normalization in gene expression studies with reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). A synanthropic fly, Chrysomya megacephala, is a well known medical vector and forensic indicator. Unfortunately, previous studies did not look at the stability of reference genes used in C. megacephala. RESULTS: In this study, the expression level of Actin, ribosomal protein L8 (Rpl8), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), elongation factor 1α (EF1), α-tubulin (α-TUB), β-tubulin (β-TUB), TATA binding box (TBP), 18S rRNA (18S) and ribosomal protein S7 (Rps7) were evaluated for their stability using online software RefFinder, which combines the normal software of the ΔCt method, BestKeeper, Normfinder, and geNorm. Moreover the number of suitable reference gene pairs was also suggested by Excel-based geNorm. The expression levels of these reference genes were evaluated under different experimental conditions with special perspectives of forensic applications: developmental stages (eggs, first, second and third instar larvae, pupae and adults); food sources of larvae (pork, fish and chicken); feeding larvae with drugs (untreated control, Estazolam and Marvelon); feeding larvae with heavy metals (untreated control, cadmium and zinc); tissues of adults (head, thorax, abdomen, legs and wings). According to RefFinder, EF1 was the most suitable reference gene of developmental stages, food and tissues; 18S and GAPDH were the most suitable reference genes for drugs and heavy metals, respectively, which could be widely used for quantification of target gene expression with qPCR in C. megacephala. Suitable reference gene pairs were also suggested by geNorm. CONCLUSION: This fundamental but vital work should facilitate the gene studies of related biological processes and deepen the understanding in physiology, toxicology, and especially medical and forensic entomology of C. megacephala.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3apork 3apupae 3aribosomal RNA 3aheavy metals 3afish 3alegs 3aforensic sciences 3aadults 3atubulin 3adrugs 3acadmium 3agene expression 3ahead 3areverse transcription 3atoxicology 3aactin 3aforensic entomology 3awings 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3alarvae 3aeggs 3aabdomen 3achickens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3azinc 3aChrysomya megacephala 3ainstars 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asynanthropes 3aessential genes 3athorax 0atranscription (genetics)1 aXiong, Mei1 aWang, Jialu1 aLei, Chaoliang1 aZhu, Fen0 tParasites & vectors.g2015 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.565-565dBioMed Centralx1756-33057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-015-1175-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03140naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012100158300002000279520148700299592002801786650002201814650003701836650001301873650001401886650001601900650001101916650001401927650002301941650001501964650001701979650001401996650001802010650003702028650001502065650001202080650001402092650000902106650001902115650001202134650001302146650001102159650001302170650001402183650001402197650003302211650001602244700002302260700001302283700001502296700002302311773014502334856007402479852000902553655001202562IND60671124020221118023127.0191002e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067112402DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta02570b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarzorati, S.10aTemplate-free ultraspray pyrolysis synthesis of N/Fe-doped carbon microspheres for oxygen reduction electrocatalysis  ap. 18920-18927.  aUltrasonic spray pyrolysis was used in a continuous flow apparatus for the template-free synthesis of iron- and nitrogen-doped porous carbon materials. Solutions of glucose, histidine and Fe(CH₃COO)₂ were nebulized and pyrolyzed yielding carbon microspheres. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and Focused Ion Beam (FIB) milling revealed that microspheres initially possess empty cores and a smooth shell. Further annealing leads to a collapse of this shell, and formation of porous microspheres with high roughness and iron-rich aggregates. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) were used to investigate bulk and surface chemistry: microspheres were found to undergo graphitization; Fe and Fe₃C particles form and become encapsulated within the carbon phase, while the nitrogen present in the precursor solution results in the formation of pyridinic/pyrrolic N-centers. The microspheres were tested as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic solution. Polarization curves using a Rotating Disk Electrode (RDE) yielded electrocatalytic behavior, and the number of exchanged electrons n = 3.7 ± 0.2 calculated from Koutecky–Levich plots suggests that direct formation of H₂O is the preferred ORR mechanism. These results indicate that this synthetic approach offers a simple and scalable strategy for the preparation of electrode materials for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aacetates 3aannealing 3aatomization 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aelectrons 3aencapsulation 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afuel cells 3aglucose 3ahistidine 3airon 3amicroparticles 3amilling 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3apolymers 3apyrolysis 3aroughness 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aultrasonics1 aVasconcelos, J.

The combination of NiCl₂·DME and a newly developed C₂-symmetric oxazoline ligand plays a key role in selective ring opening of several 3,4-epoxy alcohols at the C4 position. This general protocol furnishes a new type of enantioenriched 4,4-diaryl alkane which also incorporates an additional 1,3-diol that can be easily transformed to a variety of functional groups.

Allelopathy has been the subject of a great deal of research in chemical ecology since the 1930s. The characterization of the factors that influence this phenomenon has barely been explored, mainly due to the complexity of this area. The main aim of the research carried out to date has been to shed light on the importance of these interactions in agroecosystems, especially in relation to the interactions between crops and weeds. Herein we report the characterization of a complete allelochemical pathway involving benzoxazinones, which are known to participate in allelopathic plant defense interactions of several plants of high agronomic interest. The production of the defense chemicals by a donor plant (crop), the route and transformations of the chemicals released into the environment, and the uptake and phytotoxic effects on a target plant (weed) were all monitored. The results of this study, which is the first of its kind, allowed a complete dynamic characterization of the allelopathic phenomenon for benzoxazinones. 3aagroecosystems 3aallelopathy 3abenzoxazinoids 3achemical ecology 3acrops 3aoats 3aphytotoxicity 3areproduction 3arye 3aweeds1 aOliveros-Bastidas, Alberto1 aMarín, David,1 aChinchilla Albiol, Ma.

The present study evaluated the use of rice bran as a carbon source and determined the medium components for optimum growth and lipid production for this organism. RESULTS: Optimization of medium components by response surface methodology showed that rice bran and yeast extract had significant influences on lipid and biomass production. The optimum medium consisted of 37.5 g/L rice bran, 0.79 g/L yeast extract and 12.5 g/L agar, and this yielded 7.5 g/L dry biomass and 0.9 g/L lipid after 5 days. The biomass and lipid production profiles revealed that these parameters increased over time and reached their maximum values (10.5 and 1.26 g/L, respectively) after 7 days. Physarum polycephalum growth decreased on the spent medium but using the latter increased total biomass and lipid concentrations to 14.3 and 1.72 g/L, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: An effective method for inoculum preparation was developed for biomass and lipid production by P. polycephalum on a low-cost medium using rice bran as the main carbon source. These results also demonstrated the feasibility of scaling up and reusing the medium for additional biomass and lipid production.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPhysarum polycephalum 3aagar 3abiodiesel 3abiomass production 3acarbon 3afuel production 3ainoculum 3alipid content 3alipids 3aresponse surface methodology 3arice bran 3ayeast extract1 aStephenson, Steven1 aPollock, Erik0 tBMC biotechnology.g2015 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.67-67dBioMed CentralwJournal:19124x1472-67507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12896-015-0188-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100003200149245009700181300001600278520114100294592002801435650001101463650001601474650002301490650002301513650002201536650002001558650001901578650001001597650002101607650001001628650001601638650001801654700002501672700002001697773009901717856008501816852000901901655001201910IND4469655720221120135358.0141111e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446965572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2012.05.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParaskevopoulou, Adamantini10aCharacterisation of volatile compounds of lupin protein isolate‐enriched wheat flour bread  ap. 568-577.  aThe influence of lupin protein isolate (LPI) on the volatile fraction of wheat flour (WF) bread was investigated. Headspace solid-phase microextraction technique (HS-SPME) coupled to the gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis was applied to characterise volatile compounds of both crust and crumb. In a preliminary sensory experiment, LPI was found to have a modifying effect on the odour of WF-bread. The most important odorants of WF and LPI-containing wheat flour (LWF) breads were evaluated on the basis of detection frequency analysis. Fifty three compounds were detected by more than five judges, ten of which were detected only in LWF bread. The most important compounds of LPI-containing crumb and crust were vinylpyrazine, hexanal, 2-propylpyrazine, 2-octenal, 2,3-butanedione, 2,5-dimethylpyrazine, non-identified compounds with green, mushroom-like or pleasant odour and pyrazines. Their presence was attributed either to oxidative degradation of fatty acids or thermal reactions. Most of these compounds contributed to the aroma character of LPI-bread with green, earthy, malty, buttery and roasted notes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreads 3afatty acids 3agas chromatography 3aheadspace analysis 3amass spectrometry 3amicroextraction 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3aprotein isolates 3awheat 3awheat flour 3awheat protein1 aChrysanthou, Andreas1 aKoutidou, Maria0 tFood research international.g2012 Oct., v. 48, no. 2 p.568-577dElsevier Ltdx0963-99697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2012.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002700152245015800179300001600337520136100353592002801714650002001742650001801762650003301780650001301813650001301826650001301839650001201852650001801864650000901882650001001891650002001901650002601921650001101947650001801958650001701976650001601993700002702009700002302036700002302059773010402082856005502186852000902241655001202250IND4465373620221119174427.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446537362DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2109.2011.02848.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEmerenciano, Maurício10aBiofloc technology application as a food source in a limited water exchange nursery system for pink shrimp Farfantepenaeus brasiliensis (Latreille, 1817)  ap. 447-457.  aIn a 30‐day experiment, Farfantepenaeus brasiliensis PL25 (25 ± 10 mg; 17.9 ± 1.6 mm) were raised in nine circular floating cages with a stocking density of 1000 shrimp m−3. Three treatments were evaluated: (1) culture in BFT system plus a commercial feed supply (BFT+CF); (2) culture in BFT system without feed supply (BFT) and (3) culture in clear water with feed supply (control). Post‐larvae (PL) final weight (218.9, 236.5 and 176.0 mg, for BFT+CF, BFT and control respectively), final biomass (17.9, 15.7 and 8.2 g) and weight gain (193.9, 211.5 and 151.0 mg) were similar in the BFT regardless of whether they were fed a commercial diet (P>0.05), but were both significantly higher than the control (P<0.05). Survival (81.5%, 67.0% and 84.8% respectively) and final length did not differ between treatments (P>0.05). The biofloc analysis identified five main microorganism groups: protozoa (ciliate and flagellate), rotifers, cyanobacteria (filamentous and unicellular) and pennate diatoms. Free living bacteria and attached bacteria in bulk were 25.73 ± 8.63 and 0.86 ± 3.17 × 106 mL−1 respectively. Proximate analysis in the biofloc indicated high levels of crude protein (30.4%). Results confirmed favourable nutritional quality of biofloc, and enhanced growth and production of F. brasiliensis PL in biofloc systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyta 3aCyanobacteria 3aFarfantepenaeus brasiliensis 3aProtozoa 3aRotifera 3abacteria 3abiomass 3acrude protein 3adiet 3afeeds 3anutritive value 3aproximate composition 3ashrimp 3astocking rate 3awater supply 3aweight gain1 aBallester, Eduardo L C1 aCavalli, Ronaldo O1 aWasielesky, Wilson0 tAquaculture research.g2012 Feb., v. 43, no. 3 p.447-457dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2011.02848.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024001700113024002100130024003100151040001800182100002000200245007500220300001600295506017300311520126900484650002001753650002801773650002301801650001601824650002101840650002301861650001301884650001801897650002401915650001201939650002801951650002301979650002702002650002202029650001102051650002302062650004002085650002302125650001802148650001002166650001602176650001402192650005302206700002202259773010402281856011202385856004402497956008602541961000902627852000902636655001202645IND50070620920221214224729.0130920s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007062092DNAL7 a236279292pmid7 a2843422aris7 a10113/579452hdl7 a10.1089/fpd.2012.13572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhaduri, Saumya10aGrowth of a pYV-Bearing Yersinia pestis KIM5 in Retail Raw Ground Pork  ap. 467-471.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aYersinia pestis can cause oropharyngeal plague as a result of consumption or handling of meat from infected animals. Thus, food naturally or intentionally contaminated can have a role in the dissemination of oropharyngeal plague. The growth of a conditionally virulent pYV-bearing rifampicin-resistant Y. pestis KIM5 (rif-Y. pestis KIM5) in retail raw ground pork (RGP) was studied at temperatures ranging from 4 to 30C. At 4C, rif-Y. pestis KIM5 did not grow but survived. In RGP, rif-Y. pestis KIM5 grew at refrigerated temperatures of 10 and 15C with growth rates of 0.05 and 0.16 log10 colony-forming units (CFU)/h. The growth rates at abusive temperatures of 20, 25, and 30C were 0.26, 0.30, and 0.77 log10 CFU/h. The growth rate was increased 15.4-fold with the increase of storage temperatures from 10C to 30C. The maximum population density ranged from 6.76 to 8.66 log10 CFU/g. Furthermore, there was no detectable loss of pYV in surviving rif-Y. pestis KIM5 at any of the temperatures tested in retail RGP. This suggests that under these conditions, Y. pestis could cause oropharyngeal plague if the meat was not properly cooked. The individual infected by Y. pestis in food is a potential reservoir who can infect others, leading to outbreaks of plague. 3aYersinia pestis 3abacterial contamination 3afood contamination 3aground pork 3amicrobial growth 3apopulation density 3araw meat 3arefrigeration 3astorage temperature 2aAnimals 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDisease Reservoirs 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Microbiology 2aHumans 2aMeatxmicrobiology 2aPlaguexmicrobiologyxtransmission. 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aRefrigeration 2aSwine 2aTemperature 2aVirulence 2aYersinia pestisxgeneticsxgrowth & development.1 aPhillips, John G.0 tFoodborne pathogens and disease.g2013, v. 10, no. 5 p.467-471wJournal:jnl3973649x1556-71257nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/579453Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2012.1357  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/284342.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245013100175500001900306520127000325592002801595650002201623650002401645650001401669650001201683650001901695650001701714650002001731650001601751650001901767650003701786653001201823653001501835653002301850653002401873653002701897700003001924773008701954856008502041852000902126655001202135IND60720072920221122042818.0201230e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072007292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micron.2020.1029932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSivanandan, Vibhu T.10aCrystallographic and micro-structural investigations in C-phase spinels of CuFe2O4 synthesized through C12H22O11.H2O mediation  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNanocrystalline CuFe₂O₄ was synthesized through stotiometric mixing of aqueous solutions of Cu(NO₃)₂. 3H₂O and Fe(NO₃)₃. 9H₂O mediated by α-Lactose monohydrate (C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁.H₂O) as reductant.

Conflicting network objectives may affect the adequacy of the design in terms of sampling frequency and the spatial distribution of the monitoring stations which in turn affect the accuracy of the data and the information extracted. The first step in resolving this problem is to identify the uncertainty inherent in the network as the result of the vagueness of the design objective. Entropy has been utilized and adopted over the past decades to identify uncertainty in similar water data sets. Therefore it is used to identify the uncertainties inherent in the water quality monitoring network of Bahr El-Baqar drain located in the Eastern Delta. Toward investigating the applicability of the Entropy methodology, comprehensive analysis at the selected drain as well as their data sets is carried out. Furthermore, the uncertainty calculated by the entropy function will be presented by the means of the geographical information system to give the decision maker a global view to these uncertainties and to open the door to other researchers to find out innovative approaches to lower these uncertainties reaching optimal monitoring network in terms of the spatial distribution of the monitoring stations.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adecision making 3aentropy 3aenvironmental monitoring 3ageographic information systems 3auncertainty 3awater quality 0aEntropy theory 0aWater quality 0aMonitoring network 0aUncertainty0 tWater Science.g2013 Oct., v. 27 p.48-56dElsevier B.V.aNational Water Research Centerx1110-49297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wsj.2013.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01963naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011500156300002000271520079100291592002801082650001501110650001101125650001101136650001301147650001601160650001601176650002201192700001601214700001801230700001901248700001401267700001301281700001301294700001401307700001801321773014301339856007401482852000901556655001201565IND60671124320221118023002.0191002e20150609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067112432DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta02589c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jiayu10aOligothiophene-bridged perylene diimide dimers for fullerene-free polymer solar cells: effect of bridge length  ap. 13000-13010.  aA series of perylene diimide (PDI) dimers (PnTP, n = 0–3) with oligothiophenes as bridges were designed, theoretically calculated, synthesized, and developed as electron acceptors for polymer solar cells (PSCs).

CA/SHP had been extensively used as a green crosslinking agent for enhancement of cellulose and other carbohydrate polymers without in-depth understanding of the mechanisms. The current study investigated all identifiable secondary polycarboxylic acids from CA decomposition in the CA/SHP-cellulose system under various curing conditions. It was found that CA decomposition was more sensitive to temperature compared with the desirable esterification reaction. Two crosslinking mechanisms, namely ester crosslinking and SHP crosslinking were responsible for the observed improvement in crease resistance of CA/SHP treated cotton fabrics. An oligomer of citraconic acid (CCA) and/or itaconic acid (IA) was identified as a possible contributor to fabric yellowing. Finally, the crease resistance of fabrics correlated strongly with CA preservation in polyol-added CA/SHP crosslinking systems. The dosage of polyol should be held below an inflexion point to keep the undesirable competition against cellulose minimum. The combination of HPLC and conductometric titration was demonstrated to be useful in studying the CA/SHP-cellulose crosslinking system. The findings have implications for better application of CA/SHP in polysaccharide modifications in general.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3acitric acid 3acotton 3acotton fabric 3across-linking reagents 3acrosslinking 3aesterification 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3apolymers 3apolyols 3aquantitative analysis 3atemperature 3atitration 0aEster crosslinking 0aCellulose 0aCitric acid 0aSodium hypophosphite 0aHPLC 0aConductometric titration 0aCA 0aPCA 0aBTCA 0aCisAA 0aTransAA 0a2MSA 0aCCA 0aIA 0aWRA1 aWang, Bijia1 aLiu, Jian1 aChen, Jiangang1 aYang, Yiqi0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2015 May 05, v. 121 p.92-98dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.12.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245013500175300002000310520168300330592002802013650001602041650001302057650002002070650001402090650001802104650001102122650002602133650002202159650001802181700002002199700002002219700002802239773013102267856008402398852000902482655001202491IND60558461820221120184040.0161115e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055846182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.6b031162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinanian, Melanie M.10aMultivariate Curve Resolution-Alternating Least Squares Analysis of High-Resolution Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry Data  ap. 11092-11099.  aMethods such as liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) are crucial for differentiating compounds with highly similar masses. This is a necessity when analyzing highly complex samples; however, the size of high-resolution LC-HRMS data sets can cause difficulties when applying advanced data analysis techniques. In this work, LC-HRMS analyses of known amphetamine samples and unknown bacterial lipid samples were carried out, and multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) was applied to the data to obtain mathematical separation of overlapped analyte signals. In order to minimize computational strain, a novel strategy was developed which minimizes the number of irrelevant masses analyzed at full resolution. To do this, data were first binned to unit mass resolution, and MCR-ALS was performed. This provided mathematical components for each analyte present plus background components. In the resolved spectral profiles of analyte components, masses above a preset intensity threshold were extracted, discarding all other masses, and expanded to successively higher levels of resolution, applying MCR-ALS at each level. These steps were repeated until 0.001 amu resolution was achieved, as dictated by the resolution of the instrument--in this case, a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. This strategy allowed for the accurate recovery of all known amphetamine compounds and select bacterial lipid extracts while minimizing the size of the data, therefore minimizing computational analysis time and data storage requirements. This relatively simple strategy enables the effective coupling of LC-HRMS with MCR-ALS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamphetamine 3abacteria 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aleast squares 3alipids 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aspectrometers1 aCook, Daniel W.1 aRutan, Sarah C.1 aWijesinghe, Dayanjan S.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 88, no. 22 p.11092-11099dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.6b031163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002200148245010000170300001600270520146700286592002801753650001501781650001701796650001101813650001901824650002301843650001401866650001101880650001101891650001501902650002101917651001001938700002101948700002201969700002101991700002702012700002202039773009602061856008402157852000902241655001202250IND4450075220221118015424.0150808e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445007522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2010.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD’Amen, Manuela10aWill climate change reduce the efficacy of protected areas for amphibian conservation in Italy?  ap. 989-997.  aAmphibians are an important and imperiled component of biodiversity.

The predicted distributions were used to perform gap and irreplaceability analyses. Our findings show that the current Italian reserve network incompletely represents current amphibian diversity and its geographic pattern. The combination of the nationally designated protected areas and the Natura 2000 sites improves current representation of amphibians, but conservation targets based on geographic range extent are achieved for only 40% of species. Under the future scenarios, Natura 2000 sites become a crucial component of the protected areas system. Nonetheless, we predict that climate change decreases for many species the amount of suitable range falling into reserves, regardless of our assumptions about dispersal. We identify some currently unprotected areas that have high irreplaceability scores for species conservation and that maintain their importance under all the future scenarios we considered. We recommend designation of new reserves in these areas to help guarantee long-term amphibian conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamphibians 3abiodiversity 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3aconservation areas 3aemissions 3amodels 3aniches 3aprediction 3areserve networks 3aItaly1 aBombi, Pierluigi1 aPearman, Peter B.1 aSchmatz, Dirk R.1 aZimmermann, Niklaus E.1 aBologna, Marco A.0 tBiological conservation.g2011 Mar., v. 144, no. 3 p.989-997dElsevier Ltdx0006-32077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2010.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245019300173300001600366520146700382592002801849650002401877650003101901650002201932650001401954650002801968650001401996650001302010650002102023650001202044650001402056653001402070653003002084653002002114653002402134653003102158653002802189700002602217700001902243773010202262856008702364852000902451655001202460IND60112501520221116222116.0190408e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011250152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.04.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Tong-hyŏn,10aInhibitory effects of high-hydrostatic-pressure treatments on histamine production in mackerel (Scomber japonicus) muscle inoculated with Morganella morganii and Photobacterium phosphoreum  ap. 307-311.  aHistamine or scombroid fish poisoning is caused by ingestion of histamine in spoiled fish, which arises because of the activity of bacterial histidine decarboxylase (HDC), resulting in allergy-like symptoms. To investigate the inhibitory effects of HHP on the activity of HDC, crude HDC extracts were prepared from Morganella morganii and Photobacterium phosphoreum, and subjected to HHP (100–400 MPa) or were left untreated (controls). Pressure levels of up to 200 MPa did not significantly affect the activity of crude HDC in M. morganii (<5%); however, HHP treatments of 300 and 400 MPa showed inhibitory activity at 19.4% and 23.2%, respectively. HHP treatments of 100, 200, 300, and 400 MPa considerably inhibited the crude HDC activities of P. phosphoreum at 46.1, 57.0, 63.3, and 84.5%, respectively. HHP treatment was then applied to mackerel muscle inoculated with M. morganii and P. phosphoreum in situ. We observed that HHP significantly delayed the overall microbial growth in mackerel muscle, regardless of the inoculated species. Moreover, histamine production in mackerel muscle inoculated with M. morganii was strongly inhibited by both 200 and 300 MPa (but not 100 MPa). Furthermore, in the sample inoculated with P. phosphoreum, all of the HHP treatment conditions at 100–400 MPa strongly inhibited histamine production. Taken together, the findings of this study might be helpful to enhance the safety of mackerel consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMorganella morganii 3aPhotobacterium phosphoreum 3aScomber japonicus 3ahistamine 3ahistidine decarboxylase 3aingestion 3amackerel 3amicrobial growth 3amuscles 3apoisoning 0aHistamine 0aHigh hydrostatic pressure 0aMackerel muscle 0aMorganella morganii 0aPhotobacterium phosphoreum 0aHistidine decarboxylase1 aKim, Koth-Bong-Woo-Ri1 aAhn, Dong-Hyun0 tFood control.g2013 Dec., v. 34, no. 2 p.307-311dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.04.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03378naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245015400174300001600328520194000344592002802284596006002312596004402372650001602416650002202432650001102454650001202465650001102477650002902488650001802517650001202535650000702547650002002554650001902574650001902593650001602612650001702628700002502645700006102670773012202731856008202853852000902935655001202944IND60645174020221116184703.0190523e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064517402DNAL7 a10.1007/s00299-019-02403-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhuong, Thi Thu Huong10aPhotoprotection and growth under different lights of Arabidopsis single and double mutants for energy dissipation (npq4) and state transitions (pph1)  ap. 741-753.  aKEY MESSAGE: Arabidopsis single and double mutants for energy dissipation (npq4) and state transitions (pph1, blocked in State II) show enhanced growth and flowers + siliques production under controlled low-light conditions. Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) is a short-term regulation important to maintain efficient photosynthesis and to avoid photooxidative damages by dissipation of excess energy. Full activation of NPQ in plants requires the protonation of the PsbS protein, which is the sensor of the low lumenal pH triggering the thermal dissipation. State transitions are a second important photosynthetic regulation to respond to changes in light quality and unbalanced excitation of photosystems. State transitions allow energy redistribution between PSI and PSII through the reversible exchange of LHCII antenna complexes between photosystems thanks to the opposite action of the STN7 kinase and PPH1 phosphatase: phosphorylation of LHCII promotes its mobilization from PSII to PSI, while dephosphorylation has the opposite effect. In this work, we produced the pph1/npq4 double mutant and characterized some photosynthetic, growth and reproduction properties in comparison with wild-type and single-mutant plants in high- and low-light conditions. Results indicate that in high light, the pph1 mutant maintains good photoprotection ability, while npq4 plants show more susceptibility to photodamages. The pph1/npq4 double mutant showed a resistance to high-light stress similar to that of the single npq4 mutant. In low-light condition, the single mutants showed a significant increase of growth and flowering compared to wild-type plants and this effect was further enhanced in the pph1/npq4 double mutant. Results suggest that photosynthetic optimisation to improve crop growth and productivity might be possible, at least under controlled low-light conditions, by modifying NPQ and regulation of state transitions.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR-2012-JCJC-0001-01cAgence Nationale de la Recherche  a322cMinistry of Science and Technology 3aArabidopsis 3adephosphorylation 3aenergy 3aflowers 3afruits 3alight harvesting complex 3alight quality 3amutants 3apH 3aphosphorylation 3aphotostability 3aphotosystem II 3aprotonation 3areproduction1 aRobaglia, Christophe1 aCaffarri, Stefano1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4729-76790 tPlant cell reports.g2019 June, v. 38, no. 6 p.741-753dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl33565x0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-019-02403-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245017400159300001800333520090500351592002801256650001401284650001801298650002101316650002401337650001801361650001301379650002201392650001701414653003601431653001701467653002701484653003301511653002301544700001301567700001801580700001701598700001601615700001401631700001701645700001401662700001601676700001901692700005201711773013901763856007801902852000901980655001201989IND60595609120221122132610.0180605e20180131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059560912DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b186712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhihe10aMetallic Intermediate Phase Inducing Morphological Transformation in Thermal Nitridation: Ni3FeN-Based Three-Dimensional Hierarchical Electrocatalyst for Water Splitting  ap. 3699-3706.  aTransition-metal nitrides have attracted a great deal of interest as electrocatalysts for water splitting due to their super metallic performance, high efficiency, and good stability. Herein, we report a novel design of hierarchical electrocatalyst based on Ni₃FeN, where the presence of carbon fiber cloth as a scaffold can effectively alleviate the aggregation of Ni₃FeN nanostructure and form three-dimensional conducting networks to enlarge the surface area and simultaneously enhance the charge transfer. The composition and morphological variations of NiFe precursors during annealing in different atmospheres were investigated. Such Ni₃FeN/CC hierarchical electrocatalyst shows much improved electrochemical properties for water splitting in terms of overpotentials (105 and 190 mV at 10 mA/cm² for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively) and stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acarbon fibers 3aelectrochemistry 3ahydrogen production 3ananomaterials 3anitrides 3aoxygen production 3asurface area 0aelectrochemical water splitting 0aintermediate 0a3D conductive networks 0ahierarchical electrocatalyst 0asynergistic effect1 aTan, Hua1 aXin, Jianping1 aDuan, Jiazhi1 aSu, Xiaowen1 aHao, Bin,1 aXie, Junfeng1 aZhan, Jie1 aZhang, Jing1 aWang, Jian-Jun1 aLiu, Hong1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1640-96200 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Jan. 31, v. 10, no. 4 p.3699-3706dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b186713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009200168300001600260520131100276592002801587650001401615650001401629650002801643650001901671650001101690650001601701650002101717650001501738650001301753650001701766650003301783650001601816650001801832653001601850653002401866653002201890653002001912700001901932700001701951700001801968700001901986700001902005773010702024856008602131852000902217655001202226IND60540868820221121230921.0190318e20150505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054086882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.12.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Sangjun10aEffects of the addition of dimer acid alkyl esters on the properties of ethyl cellulose  ap. 284-294.  aIn this study, we synthesized dimer acid (DA) esters, having short to long alkyl chains, (DA-Cn) by the Diels–Alder reaction and subsequent esterification reaction of fatty acids that were prepared by the hydrolysis of waste vegetable oil. It was found that the DA-Cn were thermally more stable than common petroleum-based plasticizer DOP. When the DOP, DA, or DA-Cn with short alkyl chains were added to ethyl cellulose (EC), the optical clarity and SEM images of the samples showed their good miscibility with those additives in a micro-scale. It was also found that the rubbery modulus of the EC decreased with increasing amount of additives; the type of the additives did not affect the rates of the decrease in the rubbery modulus. The main transition temperatures of the EC containing either DA or DA-C1 or DA-C4 decreased with increasing amounts of those additives and were comparable to that of the DOP-containing EC. The above findings suggested that the DA and its esters with short alkyl chains could act as effective plasticizer and, thus, could be used instead of the DOP. In addition, the results obtained from tensile testing and leaching experiments implied that the DA might be better plasticizer than the DA-C1 and DA-C4, at least in some cases, because of hydrogen-bonding with the EC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3acellulose 3acycloaddition reactions 3aesterification 3aesters 3afatty acids 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrolysis 3aleaching 3aplasticizers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3avegetable oil 0aPlasticizer 0aWaste vegetable oil 0aDimer acid esters 0aEthyl cellulose1 aKo, Kwang-Hwan1 aShin, Jihoon1 aKim, Nam-Kyun1 aKim, Young-Wun1 aKim, Joon-Seop0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2015 May 05, v. 121 p.284-294dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.12.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04022naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245015300167520259500320592002802915650003802943650003002981650001803011650000903029650001703038650001403055650000903069650000903078650002103087650001203108650001703120650002803137651001103165651001103176651002003187653001903207653001303226653001103239653001103250653001203261700001803273700001503291700001903306700001703325773009203342856008503434852000903519655001203528IND60745894920221121223058.0211213e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074589492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.animal.2021.1002872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenchion, M.10aReview: Trends for meat, milk and egg consumption for the next decades and the role played by livestock systems in the global production of proteins  aMeeting the food demands of a growing global population within planetary boundaries is a challenge. Sustainably producing animal-sourced foods while supplying sufficient protein to meet the requirements of a healthy diet is a particular challenge. This paper informs the development of pathways to sustainable animal production by examining trends in animal-sourced foods since 2000, including the significance of animal- relative to plant-protein sources. Drawing on three distinct scenarios defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), (i.e. Business As Usual (BAU), a continuation of historical trends of food preferences including initiatives to address Sustainable Development Goal targets; Stratified Societies (SSs), leaving challenges unattended; and Towards Sustainability (TS); a more equitable global society and more sustainable food system due to effective polices), future demand for animal-sourced foods is projected. Analysis is based on FAO Food Balance Sheet data (2000–2017) and projected national protein demand per capita (2012–2050). Analysis is disaggregated to five global regions defined by the World Health Organization. It finds that patterns of past demand for animal-sourced foods vary by food (e.g. red vs white meat) and region. However, the European region consistently has the highest levels of consumption of animal-sourced foods, while the South-East Asian and African regions have the lowest. The ratio of animal to plant-sourced protein varies across regions, ranging from 0.29 in Africa to 1.08 in Europe in 2017. Over time, the ratio is relatively stable or moderately increasing, driven by rising incomes in low- or middle-income countries. Under the future scenarios, all World Health Organization regions show a marked increase in demand for animal-sourced protein across BAU and SS. The TS scenario, however, projects notable declines in consumption across Europe and the Americas when compared to the 2012 BAU baseline, with a decline in milk also in the Western Pacific. In contrast, meat and milk consumption in Africa and South-East Asia is projected to increase, reflecting their far lower starting consumption levels. The analysis and subsequent discussion highlight the importance of having regional-specific strategies to deal with the challenge of sustainable livestock production and consumption, with a requirement to consider the impact of actions in one region on others. Clearly, the challenge is not merely one for science and technology but one based on wider aspects of the food system and its diverse stakeholders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aWorld Health Organization 3abalance sheet 3aeggs 3ahealthy diet 3alivestock 3ameat 3amilk 3amilk consumption 3asociety 3astakeholders 3asustainable agriculture 3aAfrica 3aEurope 3aSouth East Asia 0aAnimal-sourced 0aConsumer 0aDemand 0aGlobal 0aProtein1 aMoloney, A.P.1 aHyland, J.1 aZimmermann, J.1 aMcCarthy, S.0 tAnimal.g2021 Dec., v. 15 p.100287-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3938811x1751-73117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.animal.2021.1002873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245006200177300001600239520110800255592002801363650002001391650001401411650002101425650000901446650001501455650001301470650001801483650001601501650001301517650002201530650001401552650000901566650001501575650001201590650001501602650001601617653002201633653001601655653003101671700001801702773012901720856008101849852000901930655001201939IND60677718120221121050346.0191213e20191202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067771812DNAL7 a10.1017/S00220299190007732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoudhary, Bishwa Bhaskar10aSensitivity of buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) to heat stress  ap. 399-405.  aBased on ten years of data (2001–10), consisting of 12 673 observations on fortnightly milk yield of buffaloes reared in a dairy farm located in the Northern sub-tropics (29°41′0″N, 76°59′0″E), the present study establishes the relationship between weather conditions and production performance of lactating buffaloes. The critical threshold level of maximum temperature-humidity index (THI) was estimated to be 74, which is higher than that of crossbred cows. The duration of discomfort period for buffaloes begins in mid-March and lasts up to early November. During the aggravated stress condition (THI > 82) prevailing in the region for about 5 months starting from early May, milk productivity declines by more than 1% per unit increase in maximum THI over 82. The maximum temperature and minimum humidity (viz. maximum THI) are the most critical weather parameters causing thermal stress in animals, however, the climatic conditions in the region are such that not only maximum but also minimum THI crosses the critical threshold providing little relief to the animals during the night.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBubalus bubalis 3abuffaloes 3aclimatic factors 3acows 3acrossbreds 3acrossing 3adairy farming 3aheat stress 3ahumidity 3alactating females 3alactation 3amilk 3amilk yield 3arearing 3asubtropics 3atemperature 0aMilk productivity 0asub-tropics 0atemperature-humidity index1 aSirohi, Smita0 tJournal of dairy research.g2019 Nov., v. 86, no. 4 p.399-405dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45499x1469-76297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299190007733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02970naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245013100170500001900301520161800320592002801938650002401966650002201990650001602012650001402028650002202042650000902064650001902073653002102092653002802113653003002141700001202171700001202183700001902195700001802214700001402232700001702246700001802263700001802281700002302299773010602322856008702428852000902515655001202524IND60702653620221116192930.0201024e20201105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070265362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1253092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Wenyan10aPreparation of stable inverse emulsions of hydroxyethyl methacrylate and their stability evaluation by centrifugal coefficient  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSeveral inverse emulsions were prepared with different hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) values using different water/oil ratios, temperatures and monomer and emulsifier concentrations by uniform stirring for more than 30 min. The stability of inverse emulsion was characterized by centrifugal coefficient. The emulsion form, either oil/water (O/W) or water/oil (W/O) was characterized by optical microscope and conductivity measurements. The results showed that HLB value, water/oil ratio and temperature could have an effect on the emulsion stability and emulsion form. When the HLB value of emulsifier is about 8.4, the water to oil ratio is about 1:1 and the temperature is at about 25 °C, inverse emulsion in the form of water in oil (W/O) was found to be the most stable. Here, the stablilty of emulsions was studied in relation to temperature and we found that 25 °C (room temperature) is the best for obtaining the most stable inverse emulsion, which is also most suitable for the redox initiation in this system. In the present study, we showed that temperature has a significant influence on the structure morphology and stability of inverse emulsion and hence, it is necessary to select the appropriate reaction temperature for inverse emulsion polymerization. This is a novel result. A decrease of the content of hydroxyethyl methacrylate in aqueous solution with an increase of emulsifier concentration in emulsion was found to elevate the stability of inverse emulsion. The addition of trace electrolytes in the emulsion, however, led to greatly reduced stability of the inverse emulsion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aaqueous solutions 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsions 3alight microscopes 3aoils 3apolymerization 0aInverse emulsion 0aCentrifugal coefficient 0aHydroxyethyl methacrylate1 aZhu, Di1 aFan, Yi1 aXue, Xiaoqiang1 aYang, Hongjun1 aJiang, Li1 aJiang, Qimin1 aChen, Jianhai1 aJiang, Bibiao1 aKomarneni, Sridhar0 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Nov. 05, v. 604 p.125309-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1253093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04029naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100002100160245012100181300001800302520242800320592002802748650001302776650000902789650001102798650001602809650002202825650001402847650001002861650001002871650001102881650001302892650001802905650001602923650003002939650004702969650001203016650002103028650001103049650003303060650000903093650003203102650001603134700001803150700002003168700001903188700001703207700002103224700001803245773012203263856008103385852000903466655001203475IND4477378820221119174412.0120419e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447737882DNAL7 a219340282pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2010-31542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchneider, J.

To confirm these earlier responses, we used finishing pigs as a model in two 42-d trials and two 28-d trials to evaluate the effects of restricted feed intake and feeding frequency (2 vs. 6 times/d, floor fed) on pig performance between 68 and 114 kg. In all experiments, pigs (10/pen) were housed in 1.8 x 3.1 m pens with a half-solid, half-slatted concrete floor. Pigs were fed a corn- and soybean meal-based diet formulated to 1.15% standardized ileal digestible Lys and 3,294 kcal of ME/kg. In Exp. 1 to 3, energy and Lys were supplied to pigs according to NRC (1998) calculations to target an ADG of 0.80 kg. In Exp. 4, the diet was supplied to pigs to target an ADG of 0.80 kg (low feed intake) or 0.95 kg (high feed intake) to determine if the amount of energy above the maintenance requirement and feeding frequency affected pig performance. Pigs were fed by dropping similar amounts of feed onto the solid concrete floor either 2 (0700 or 1400 h) or 6 times (3 meals within 2 h at the morning and afternoon feedings) per day with an Accu-Drop Feed Dispenser (AP Systems, Assumption, IL). In Exp. 1 and 2, pigs fed 6 times daily had increased (P < 0.02) ADG and G:F compared with pigs fed 2 times per day. Greater feeding frequency increased (P < 0.05) the duration of time spent feeding and standing and reduced the lying time. In Exp. 3, a third treatment was included to determine whether the improvements in performance were due to decreased feed wastage. This treatment was designed to minimize feed wastage by dropping feed closer to the floor for pigs fed 2 times per day. Pigs fed 6 times daily had improved (P < 0.05) ADG and G:F compared with pigs in either treatment fed 2 times per day. No difference (P > 0.05) in performance was observed between pigs fed 2 times per day when feed was dropped from the feed drop or by the modified method. In Exp. 4, increasing the feeding frequency from 2 to 6 times per day improved (P < 0.01) ADG and G:F for pigs fed the low feed intake and tended to increase (P < 0.06) ADG and improved (P < 0.05) G:F for pigs fed the high feed intake. In limit-feeding situations, increasing the frequency of feeding from 2 to 6 times per day improved pig performance, which confirmed our earlier findings in gestating gilts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconcrete 3adiet 3aenergy 3afeed intake 3afeeding frequency 3afinishing 3agilts 3aileum 3amodels 3asoybeans 3aswine feeding 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aDietxveterinary 2aFemale 2aFood Deprivationxphysiology 2aMale 2aSwinexgrowth & development 2aWeight Gain1 aTokach, M.

This also disclosed the application of RHS to visualize various qualitative and pseudo-qualitative morphological characteristics of vegetative and generative parts of plants. The performed chronological monitoring of stag-by-stage introduction of standardization of living biological items enabled to establish a customized gradation of colors and their hues expression. Ensuring completeness of the morphological code formula for plant varieties requires compulsory identification of their colors and hues, as the Guidelines for the conduct of test on distinctness, uniformity and stability so provide for relevant botanical taxon.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acolor 3acorolla 3aleaves 3apericarp 3avibration 0acoloration 0ahue 0aplant 0acolor scale 0aidentification 0acode of expression 0arange 0ascale 0aRHS 0avariety 0amorphological description 0aartificial lightning 0aUK Standard1 aТкаченко, В.

It is widely accepted that lysosomes do not function exclusively as a digestive organelle. It is also involved in the process of immune cells against pathogens. However, the changes in the lysosomal proteome caused by infection with various microbes are still largely unknown, and our understanding of the proteome of the purified lysosome is another obstacle that needs to be resolved. Here, we performed a proteomic study on lysosomes enriched from THP1 cells after infection with Listeria monocytogenes (L.m), Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) and Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV). In combination with the gene ontology (GO) analysis, we identified 284 lysosomal-related proteins from a total of 4,560 proteins. We also constructed the protein-protein interaction networks for the differentially expressed proteins and revealed the core lysosomal proteins, including SRC in the L. m treated group, SRC, GLB1, HEXA and HEXB in the HSV-1 treated group and GLB1, CTSA, CTSB, HEXA and HEXB in the VSV treated group, which are involved in responding to diverse microbial infections. This study not only reveals variable lysosome responses depending on the bacterial or virus infection, but also provides the evidence based on which we propose a novel approach to proteome research for investigation of the function of the enriched organelles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aprotein synthesis 3aHuman alphaherpesvirus 1 3alysosomes 3aadaptive immunity 3agene ontology 3aviruses 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aVesiculovirus 3aproteomics 3aprotein-protein interactions 3apathogens 0aHuman herpesvirus 1 0aLysosome 0amicroorganisms 0amicrobes 0ahypoxia1 aGao, Yanpan1 aZhan, Shaohua1 aGe, Wei0 tMolecular Immunology.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2017.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245014600152300002000298500001500318520131600333592002801649650002401677650003401701650001401735650003301749650003001782650002401812650001901836650000801855650001701863650001301880650002601893650001701919650002201936650001201958651001001970653001101980700001201991700001602003700001802019700001802037700001402055700001802069700001502087700001602102700001602118700001502134773012702149856007502276852000902351655001202360IND60535757820221121230612.0160805e20141216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053575782DNAL7 a10.1021/es50416882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xin10aForest Filter Effect versus Cold Trapping Effect on the Altitudinal Distribution of PCBs: A Case Study of Mt. Gongga, Eastern Tibetan Plateau  ap. 14377-14385.  a2019-12-06  aMountains are observed to preferentially accumulate persistent organic pollutants (POPs) at higher altitude due to the cold condensation effect. Forest soils characterized by high organic carbon are important for terrestrial storage of POPs. To investigate the dominant factor controlling the altitudinal distribution of POPs in mountainous areas, we measured concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in different environmental matrices (soil, moss, and air) from nine elevations on the eastern slope of Mt. Gongga, the highest mountain in Sichuan Province on the Tibetan Plateau. The concentrations of 24 measured PCBs ranged from 41 to 510 pg/g dry weight (dw) (mean: 260 pg/g dw) in the O-horizon soil, 280 to 1200 pg/g dw (mean: 740 pg/g dw) in moss, and 33 to 60 pg/m³ (mean: 47 pg/m³) in air. Soil organic carbon was a key determinant explaining 75% of the variation in concentration along the altitudinal gradient. Across all of the sampling sites, the average contribution of the forest filter effect (FFE) was greater than that of the mountain cold trapping effect based on principal components analysis and multiple linear regression. Our results deviate from the thermodynamic theory involving cold condensation at high altitudes of mountain areas and highlight the importance of the FFE.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil organic carbon 3apersistent organic pollutants 3amountains 3aprincipal component analysis 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aregression analysis 3athermodynamics 3aair 3aforest soils 3aaltitude 3amosses and liverworts 3acase studies 3atopographic slope 3aforests 3aChina 0acarbon1 aLi, Jun1 aZheng, Qian1 aBing, Haijian1 aZhang, Ruijie1 aWang, Yan1 aLuo, Chunling1 aLiu, Xiang1 aWu, Yanhong1 aPan, Suhong1 aZhang, Gan0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2014 Dec. 16, v. 48, no. 24 p.14377-14385dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes50416883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02298naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245011200164300001600276520098400292592002801276650001301304650001201317650001201329650001301341650002001354650001401374650001301388650001101401650002001412650001401432650001601446653001301462653001001475653001201485653001101497653002101508653002901529700001801558700001801576700001801594700001401612773010701626856008601733852000901819655001201828IND60540868920221121231034.0190318e20150505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054086892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.12.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Long10aEffects of inorganic cations on the rheology of aqueous welan, xanthan, gellan solutions and their mixtures  ap. 147-154.  aThe effects of different inorganic cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Al3+) on the rheological properties of single and mixture polysaccharide solutions have been systematically investigated. The apparent viscosity and viscoelasticity of welan solutions decrease with the addition of inorganic cations. Meanwhile, the addition of Al3+ and K+, respectively, enhances the apparent viscosity and viscoelasticity of xanthan and gellan solutions by promoting the gelation. The viscosity retention rate of welan/xanthan mixtures is higher than that of the single components in Na+, K+ and Ca2+ solutions, and the viscosity retention rate of welan/gellan mixtures is higher than that of the single components in Ca2+ solutions. The salt induced gelation expands the application for polysaccharides, and it is also believed that the method of combining welan and xanthan (or gellan) is an effective strategy to control the rheology and morphology of solutions in the presence of inorganic salts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acalcium 3acations 3agelation 3ainorganic salts 3apotassium 3arheology 3asodium 3aviscoelasticity 3aviscosity 3axanthan gum 0aRheology 0aWelan 0aXanthan 0aGellan 0aInorganic cation 0aViscosity retention rate1 aDong, Mingzhe1 aGong, Houjian1 aSun, Mengjiao1 aLi, Yajun0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2015 May 05, v. 121 p.147-154dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.12.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005300150245007900203520174900282592002802031650002602059650002002085650002102105650001102126650001402137650002502151650002402176650002802200653001602228653001902244653001902263653001902282700001602301773009202317856008502409852000902494655001202503IND60745895020221121211327.0211213e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074589502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.animal.2021.1002882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoran, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8147-574210aReview: Sustainable livestock systems: anticipating demand-side challenges  aA sustainable livestock economy depends on both production and consumption, inextricably linked in local, national and global markets. At each scale, technical innovation and production practices need to respond to evolving demand for both market and non-market attributes of livestock systems. This review considers recent and evolving demand-side challenges focussing on emerging preferences related to environmental, dietary and health impacts, arising from both production and consumption. It suggests that these attributes need to be integral to any definition of high-producing animal systems. This discussion is mostly framed using neoclassical economic theory, which highlights market failure and the role of negative and positive external effects or social costs. It examines how our understanding of the demand for these attributes is evolving, leading to market segmentation in some cases, and an existential threat to livestock production as consumption decisions change, investors seek to avoid potential liabilities related to greenhouse gas emissions and potentially antimicrobial resistance, and governments intervene to control other undesirable social costs. The discussion distinguishes between market imperatives in high- and lower-income countries, and how income and consumption trajectories may be less deterministic in a more hyperlinked world where product information may accelerate the evolution of preferences towards and away from livestock products. The review acknowledges the limits of a neoclassical approach, drawing attention to more fundamental concepts of biophysical limits to growth and value pluralism, which indicates values (e.g. intrinsic) that lie beyond the neoclassical framing of demand and value.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3aeconomic theory 3agreenhouse gases 3aincome 3alivestock 3alivestock production 3amarket segmentation 3amulticultural diversity 0aConsumption 0aExternal costs 0aMarket failure 0aSustainability1 aBlair, K.J.0 tAnimal.g2021 Dec., v. 15 p.100288-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3938811x1751-73117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.animal.2021.1002883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245013500131300001600266506002800282520147000310592002801780506003701808650001801845650002101863650001501884650001801899650001401917650001701931650002701948650001201975650001801987650001102005650002802016650001202044650000902056650001302065650001302078651001102091653006802102700002602170700002202196700001802218700001602236773013402252852000902386655001202395IND60785590820221207055618.0150519e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078559082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, MC dos10aEffect of silicon on the morphology of the midgut and mandible of tomato leafminer Tuta absoluta (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) larvae  ap. 158-165.  aResource is Open Access  aTuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) is an important insect pest causing serious losses to tomato plantations in Brazil. Some populations of T. absolute are reported to present insecticide resistance resulting in its control failure and the use of alternative control based on silicon, which is clean and sustainable, can reduce pesticide use, increasing fruit quality and protecting the environment. This study evaluated changes in the morphology of the midgut and the mandibles of T. absoluta larvae caused by feeding with compounds containing silicon. Larvae of T. absoluta were fed on tomato leaves with different compounds containing silicon and the histology of the midgut of fourth instar larvae was analyzed. The mandibles of all larval stages were dissected and analysed by scanning electron microscopy. There were no changes in the morphology of the mandibles of the larvae of T. absoluta fed on silicon compared to the control group. Larvae of T. absoluta from the control group and the treatments where the calcium silicate was applied to the soil had not differences in the morphology of the midgut epithelial cells, which had four cell types: digestive, goblet, regenerative and mycetocyte cells. In larvae of T. absoluta obtained from silicon-based treatments applied to the leaves, the midgut epithelium showed detachment of the basal membrane, which can characterize the possible effect of this toxic element to larvae of T. absoluta.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTuta absoluta 3acalcium silicate 3aepithelium 3afruit quality 3ahistology 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticide resistance 3ainstars 3ainvertebrates 3amidgut 3apesticide use reduction 3asilicon 3asoil 3atomatoes 3atoxicity 3aBrazil 0aLycopersicon esculetum; fertilization; morphology; pest control1 aJunqueira, AM Resende1 aVG, Mendes de Sá1 aZanúncio, JC1 aSerrão, JE0 tInvertebrate survival journal.g2015 May, v. 12 p.158-165dUniversity of Modena and Reggio EmiliawJournal:27775x1824-307X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03201naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245016200165300001600327520147800343592002801821650001401849650001401863650002601877650002401903650001901927650001201946650000801958650002501966650001901991650002202010650001702032650001702049650003602066650001902102650001502121650001202136650002502148650001902173650001702192651001002209653002202219653001702241653001902258653001702277653001702294653002702311700001702338700001602355700001702371700001702388700001402405773010202419856008102521852000902602655001202611IND60547173620221117002854.0160903e20150801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054717362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2015.03.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Chunmei10aInteractive response of photosynthetic characteristics in Haloxylon ammodendron and Hedysarum scoparium exposed to soil water and air vapor pressure deficits  ap. 184-196.  aC4 plants possess better drought tolerance than C3 plants. However, Hedysarum scoparium, a C3 species, is dominant and widely distributed in the desert areas of northwestern China due to its strong drought tolerance. This study compared it with Haloxylon ammodendron, a C4 species, regarding the interactive effects of drought stress and different leaf–air vapor pressure deficits. Variables of interest included gas exchange, the activity levels of key C4 photosynthetic enzymes, and cellular anatomy. In both species, gas exchange parameters were more sensitive to high vapor pressure deficit than to strong water stress, and the net CO2 assimilation rate (An) was enhanced as vapor pressure deficits increased. A close relationship between An and stomatal conductance (gs) suggested that the species shared a similar response mechanism. In H. ammodendron, the activity levels of key C4 enzymes were higher, including those of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-malate enzyme (NADP-ME), whereas in H. scoparium, the activity level of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-malate enzyme (NAD-ME) was higher. Meanwhile, H. scoparium utilized adaptive structural features, including a larger relative vessel area and a shorter distance from vein to stomata, which facilitated the movement of water. These findings implied that some C4 biochemical pathways were present in H. scoparium to respond to environmental challenges.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC3 plants 3aC4 plants 3aHaloxylon ammodendron 3aHedysarum scoparium 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aadenine 3aair 3abiochemical pathways 3acarbon dioxide 3adrought tolerance 3agas exchange 3anicotinamide 3aphosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 3aphotosynthesis 3asoil water 3astomata 3astomatal conductance 3avapor pressure 3awater stress 3aChina 0aC4 photosynthesis 0aGas exchange 0aH. ammodendron 0aH. scoparium 0aWater stress 0aVapor pressure deficit1 aWang, Jiajia1 aHu, Congxia1 aWang, Junhui1 aNing, Pengbo1 aBai, Juan0 tJournal of Environmental Sciences.g2015 Aug. 01, v. 34 p.184-196dElsevier B.V.x1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2015.03.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01706naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024002200136024001900158040001800177100002400195245006400219300001800283520051900301592002800820650001900848650001600867650002400883650001700907650001000924700002300934700002300957700001600980700002400996700002201020700002301042700002201065773010101087856008801188990002301276852000901299655001201308IND60098540520221117230843.0141104e20110630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009854052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2011.05.0512doi7 aPMC31634052pmcid7 a217042162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaw, Christiana M.10aSerum antimüllerian hormone in healthy premenopausal women  ap. 2718-2721.  aAntimüllerian hormone (AMH) is extensively studied in ovarian aging and pathology; however, little is known about correlates in healthy premenopausal women.

Currently accepted models of ions, especially for divalent ions, do not necessarily reproduce the right physiological behavior of Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ ions. Saxena and Sept (J. Chem. Theor. Comput. 2013, 9, 3538–3542) described a model, called the multisite-ion model, where instead of treating the ions as an isolated sphere, the charge was split into multiple sites with partial charge. This model provided accurate inner shell coordination of the ion with biomolecules and predicted better free energies for proteins and nucleic acids. Here, we expand and refine the multisite model to describe the behavior of divalent ions in concentrated MgCl₂ and CaCl₂ electrolyte solutions, eliminating the unusual ion–ion pairing and clustering of ions which occurred in the original model. We calibrate and improve the parameters of the multisite model by matching the osmotic pressure of concentrated solutions of MgCl₂ to the experimental values and then use these parameters to test the behavior of CaCl₂ solutions. We find that the concentrated solutions of both divalent ions exhibit the experimentally observed behavior with correct osmotic pressure, the presence of solvent separated ion pairs instead of direct ion pairs, and no aggregation of ions. The improved multisite model for (Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺) can be used in classical simulations of biomolecules at physiologically relevant salt concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acalcium chloride 3aphysical chemistry 3aproteins 3amagnesium chloride 3acalcium 3aosmotic pressure 3amodels 3acations 3amagnesium 3asolvents 3anucleic acids 0aelectrolytes1 aGarcía, Angel E.,0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2015 Jan. 08, v. 119, no. 1 p.219-227dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp507008x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245005500165520142800220592002801648650002201676650001101698650001401709650001101723650001801734650001101752650001501763650001401778650001601792650002201808653001301830653001201843653002201855653001601877700001601893700001501909700001201924700001701936773011401953856008602067852000902153655001202162IND60758183220221118224557.0220110e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075818322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.1143242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Sen10aPyrolysis behaviors during banyan root development  aThe various tissues at different growth stages of banyan, including aerial root (AR), prop root (PR), banyan root (BR) and banyan branch (BB), were subjected to pyrolysis via TGA, Py-GC/MS and fixed bed pyrolysis experiments. Their pyrolysis behaviors and kinetics were investigated comprehensively, and their application potentials for bio-oil and bio-gas fuels were also studied. With the growth of tissues from AR to PR, the lignin and cellulose contents increased from 43.09 wt% and 24.92–33.26 wt% and 40.77 wt%, respectively, while the hemicellulose content decreased first and then increased. The AR and BR exhibited lower thermal stability because of higher extractive contents. The activation energy of all the samples but BB were decreased first and then increased with the increasing of conversion rates, while that of BB monotonically decreased. Phenols were the dominant products for the four tissues. As the tissues grew from AR to PR, the contents of linear acids and phenols in bio-oil decreased from 15.67% and 25.99–13.70% and 17.94%, respectively and that of linear carbonyls, linear ketones and furans increased from 8.13%, 11.63% and 8.43–14.83%, 13.40% and 11.15%, respectively.

Highly monodisperse oil droplets were generated, immobilized in an array of traps and monitored in real time by fluorescence using a confocal microscopy method. The device was used to study the kinetics of beta-carotene release during tricaprylin digestion (intestinal lipolysis and micellar solubilization). The effect of the gastric phase on beta-carotene degradation was also investigated using the same method.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-carotene 3abioavailability 3aconfocal microscopy 3adroplets 3afluorescence 3ahydrophilicity 3aintestines 3alab-on-a-chip technology 3alipolysis 3alipophilicity 3aoils 3apolydimethylsiloxane 3asolubilization 3atriacylglycerols 0aTriglycerides 0aFat-soluble vitamins 0aDigestion 0aKinetics 0aDroplets 0aMicrofluidics1 aMarquis, Mélanie1 aAnton, Marc1 aMarze, Sébastien0 tFood chemistry.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 275 p.523-529dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.09.0963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05268naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245010500165300001300270520340800283592002803691650001603719650002503735650001403760650000903774650001603783650001103799650001103810650001203821650002303833650001403856650001303870650001203883650001203895650001003907650002203917650001603939650001303955650001503968650001303983650002303996650001304019650003304032650001404065650001104079650001304090650001804103650001704121650003004138650002204168650001804190650001504208650002204223650002104245651001004266651001004276651002104286651001104307700001504318700001604333700001604349773011304365856008304478852000904561655001204570IND60549068420221119080928.0160906e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054906842DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-03-12-0247-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, J. H.10aFirst Report of Anthracnose of Tricyrtis macropoda Caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides in Korea  ap. 1070.  aTricyrtis macropoda Miq. (syn. T. dilatata Nakai), known as speckled toadlily, is a perennial herb native to China, Japan, and Korea. The plant has been highly praised for its beautiful flowers and rare populations in natural habitats. In September 2006, several dozen plants were heavily damaged by leaf spots and blight in cultivated plantings in the city of Pocheon, Korea. The infections with the same symptoms were repeated every year. In July 2011, the same symptoms were found on T. macropoda in the cities of Gapyeong and Osan, Korea. The leaf lesions began as small, water-soaked, pale greenish to grayish spots, which enlarged to form concentric rings and ultimately coalesced. A number of blackish acervuli were formed in the lesions. Acervuli were mostly epiphyllous, circular to ellipsoid, and 40 to 200 μm in diameter. Setae were two- to three-septate, dark brown at the base, paler upwards, acicular, and up to 100 μm long. Conidia (n = 30) were long obclavate to oblong-elliptical, sometimes fusiform-elliptical, guttulate, hyaline, and 12 to 20 × 4 to 6.5 μm (mean 15.4 × 5.2 μm). These morphological characteristics of the fungus were consistent with the description of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. (2). Voucher specimens (n = 7) were deposited in the Korea University herbarium (KUS). Two isolates, KACC46374 (ex KUS-F25916) and KACC46405 (ex KUS-F26063), were deposited in the Korean Agricultural Culture Collection. Fungal DNA was extracted and the complete internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA was amplified with the primers ITS1/ITS4 and sequenced. The resulting sequences of 549 bp were deposited in Genbank (Accession Nos. JQ619480 and JQ619481). They showed 100% similarity with a sequence of C. gloeosporioides (EU32619). Isolate KACC46374 was used in a pathogenicity test. Inoculum was prepared by harvesting conidia from 3-week-old cultures on potato dextrose agar. A conidial suspension (2 × 10⁶ conidia/ml) was sprayed onto 15 leaves of three plants. Three noninoculated plants served as controls. Plants were covered with plastic bags to maintain 100% relative humidity for 24 h and then kept in a greenhouse (22 to 28°C and 70 to 80% RH). After 5 days, typical leaf spot symptoms, identical to the ones observed in the field, started to develop on the leaves of inoculated plants. No symptoms were observed on control plants. C. gloeosporioides was reisolated from the lesions of inoculated plants, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates. An anthracnose associated with C. tricyrtii (Teng) Teng was recorded on T. formosana and T. latifolia in China (3) and on T. formosana in Taiwan (1), respectively, without etiological studies. The morphological features of C. tricyrtii are within the variation of C. gloeosporioides (2). To our knowledge, this is the first report of anthracnose of T. macropoda. This report has significance to indigenous plant resource conservation managers and scientists because T. macropoda has been listed as one of the 126 “Rare and Endangered Plants” by the Korea Forest Service since 1991.References: (1) K.

We aimed to determine the patterns of chorusing of the invasive cane toad, Rhinella marina, in a tropical savanna region in Australia where they are common and investigate the influence of environmental variables. We collected continuous acoustic recordings over 19 months at multiple sites and used call recognition software and graphical visualisation of sound files to detect toad calling. Our results revealed that cane toads are continuous breeders with chorus activity highest in the wet season but frequently occurring throughout the dry season. Daily temperatures influenced chorus activity – negatively in the wet season and positively in the dry season. Daily rainfall was positively associated with chorusing in the wet season but was not a factor in the dry season. Nightly cane toad chorus occurrence was autocorrelated on successive nights, and patterns varied among study sites under the influence of similar weather conditions, indicating factors other than weather are important in driving chorus activity of cane toads. We show that, with semi-automated analysis tools, continuous recording allows sampling to be extended over greater temporal and spatial scales, revealing patterns in the behaviour of an invasive anuran.  aThis work was supported by the Australian Research Council (Linkage grant number LP150100675 ‘Call Out and Listen In: A New Way to Detect and Control Invasive Species’) and an Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship.  aPublisher supplied data  aLinkage grant number LP150100675 3aRhinella marina 3aautocorrelation 3abioacoustics 3acomputer software 3adry season 3arain 3asavannas 3atoads 3awet season 3aAustralia 0aAnuran 0aautomated call detection 0abioacoustic monitoring 0abreeding phenology 0acane toad 0afrog chorusing1 aYasumiba, Kiyomi1 aTowsey, Michael1 aRoe, Paul1 aSchwarzkopf, Lin0 tBioacoustics.g2021 Mar. 04, v. 30, no. 2 p.125-141dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21583x2165-05867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09524622.2019.17051833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03464naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010200163300001600265520231300281592002802594650002702622650001802649650002002667650001902687650002302706650001202729650001502741650001102756650002202767650001902789650002002808650002102828650001502849651001002864773011402874856008102988852000903069655001203078IND60523480520221118233526.0160619e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052348052DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-015-0193-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Hailong10aEvapotranspiration estimation of Platycladus orientalis in Northern China based on various models  ap. 871-878.  aPlatycladus orientalis is one of the most popular afforestation species and greening species for water management in arid and semi-arid regions of northern China. We applied various models to estimate and validate artificial P. orientalis forest evapotranspiration features with the goal of accurately estimating the water use of a P. orientalis plantation. The American Society of Civil Engineers Evapotranspiration–Penman–Monteith model (APM) and FAO56–Penman–Monteith model (FPM) are extensively applied for vegetation evapotranspiration estimation because their reliability has been validated by many scholars. The Priestley–Taylor model (PT) and Hargreaves model (HS) require only the daily maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature and solar radiation to estimate evapotranspiration and are thus widely applied to grasslands but not to forests. We used the Energy Balance Bowen Ratio (EBBR) system to validate the accuracy of the four models. The results indicated that: (1) Compared to the EBBR measurement annual value, APM was the most accurate, followed by FPM, and PT; (2) During the year, the accuracies of the four models varied. APM and FPM underestimated evapotranspiration during June, July and August, whereas PT and HS overestimated evapotranspiration during this period. In the rest of the year, the estimation accuracies were reversed; (3) An analysis of the possible reasons indicated that wind speed, air temperature and precipitation were the most important contributors. High temperatures were measured in June, July and August, which led to an overestimation by PT and HS because these two models only calculated the temperature and radiation without vegetation information. Underestimation also occurred when a low temperature was recorded. Though APM and FPM addressed both meteorological and vegetation factors, slight deviations still existed; and (4) The two models were modified based on EBBR-measured data. Relative humidity was introduced into PT, and parameter “A” in the HS estimation model was amended to 1.41. The accuracy of the modified models significantly increased. The study highlighted the application, comparison and improvement of four models in estimating evapotranspiration and offers more approaches to assess forest hydrological functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlatycladus orientalis 3aafforestation 3aair temperature 3aenergy balance 3aevapotranspiration 3aforests 3agrasslands 3amodels 3arelative humidity 3asemiarid zones 3asolar radiation 3awater management 3awind speed 3aChina0 tJournal of forestry research.g2016 Aug., v. 27, no. 4 p.871-878dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-015-0193-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03537naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002900153245017600182520178500358592002802143650002702171650000902198650002802207650001102235650002202246650002002268650001002288650001402298650002502312650001402337650002502351650003002376650001502406650002302421650001402444650001302458650001102471650001502482650001602497650001002513650001302523650002502536650002202561650001002583651001502593651001802608653001502626653001902641653003902660653002602699653002702725773011002752856008802862852000902950655001202959IND60720071720221120101349.0210401e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072007172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.1054752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaranjo-Madrigal, Helven13aAn uncommon guest is masked in fisheries landings: The case of the endemic sub-population of red spiny lobster Panulirus penicillatus (Decapoda: Palinuridae) in Costa Rica  aFishery landings composition in tropical developing countries is formed of high diversity of species and some of them are not well-reported in landings or national fisheries statistics. This is particularly the case of the endemic red spiny lobster Panulirus penicillatus (Olivier, 1791) on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. The red spiny lobster is a circumtropical species which has the most extensive global distribution of all the species of spiny lobsters. In order to fill the gap of knowledge regarding the spatial distribution of this species in the eastern Pacific Ocean and highlight its importance to fishing communities, this study focused on data collected from a dive-based bentho-demersal fishery on the northern Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Environmental and fishing effort data were recorded as an input for fitting site-occupancy models to get estimates of occurrence and probability of detection. The most parsimonious model structure for detection suggested that the covariates of diving time and water column visibility had an important effect on detection probability. For the occupancy part of the model, the depth gradient had the strongest effect, with high probability of lobster encounters in shallow rocky reefs near the coastline. These findings point towards an enlargement of the area of occurrence of the endemic sub-population of P. penicillatus to which sampled animals belong. Further, it is discussed potential ecological and fishery factors that explain the low occurrence of the red spiny lobster at this restricted area of the eastern Pacific continental shelf. As a result, a set of research guidelines and management recommendations are suggested for promoting the conservation and sustainable use of this endemic species within the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanulirus penicillatus 3aarea 3acoastal zone management 3acoasts 3acontinental shelf 3adata collection 3adepth 3adetection 3adeveloping countries 3afisheries 3afisheries statistics 3ageographical distribution 3aguidelines 3aindigenous species 3aknowledge 3alobsters 3amodels 3aoccurrence 3aprobability 3areefs 3aresearch 3aspatial distribution 3aspecies diversity 3awater 3aCosta Rica 3aPacific Ocean 0aCosta Rica 0aSite-occupancy 0aDive-based bentho-demersal fishery 0aEastern Pacific ocean 0aPanulirus penicillatus0 tOcean & coastal management.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 204 p.105475-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.1054753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03454naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002400188245010800212300001100320506007600331520183100407592002802238506003702266650002602303650001502329650002102344650001602365650002002381650001602401650001802417650002402435650001402459650001502473700001502488700001602503700001902519700002102538700002102559700002002580700002102600700002102621700002402642700002302666700002002689700002102709773010402730856008102834852000902915655001202924IND60664399920221207084052.0190910e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066439992DNAL7 a10.1186/s12896-015-0142-z2doi7 aPMC44721772pmcid7 a260882022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiratsuka, Masaharu10aRetargeting of microcell fusion towards recipient cell-oriented transfer of human artificial chromosome  ap. 58.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Human artificial chromosome (HAC) vectors have some unique characteristics as compared with conventional vectors, carrying large transgenes without size limitation, showing persistent expression of transgenes, and existing independently from host genome in cells. With these features, HACs are expected to be promising vectors for modifications of a variety of cell types. However, the method of introduction of HACs into target cells is confined to microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT), which is less efficient than other methods of vector introduction. Application of Measles Virus (MV) fusogenic proteins to MMCT instead of polyethylene glycol (PEG) has partly solved this drawback, whereas the tropism of MV fusogenic proteins is restricted to human CD46- or SLAM-positive cells. RESULTS: Here, we show that retargeting of microcell fusion by adding anti-Transferrin receptor (TfR) single chain antibodies (scFvs) to the extracellular C-terminus of the MV-H protein improves the efficiency of MV-MMCT to human fibroblasts which originally barely express both native MV receptors, and are therefore resistant to MV-MMCT. Efficacy of chimeric fusogenic proteins was evaluated by the evidence that the HAC, tagged with a drug-resistant gene and an EGFP gene, was transferred from CHO donor cells into human fibroblasts. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that no perturbation of either the HAC status or the functions of transgenes was observed on account of retargeted MV-MMCT when another HAC carrying four reprogramming factors (iHAC) was transferred into human fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Retargeted MV-MMCT using chimeric H protein with scFvs succeeded in extending the cell spectrum for gene transfer via HAC vectors. Therefore, this technology could facilitate the systematic cell engineering by HACs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMeasles morbillivirus 3aantibodies 3acell engineering 3achromosomes 3adrug resistance 3afibroblasts 3agene transfer 3apolyethylene glycol 3areceptors 3atransgenes1 aUeda, Kana1 aUno, Narumi1 aUno, Katsuhiro1 aFukuhara, Sayaka1 aKurosaki, Hajime1 aTakehara, Shoko1 aOsaki, Mitsuhiko1 aKazuki, Yasuhiro1 aKurosawa, Yoshikazu1 aNakamura, Takafumi1 aKatoh, Motonobu1 aOshimura, Mitsuo0 tBMC biotechnology.g2015 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.58-58dBioMed CentralwJournal:19124x1472-67507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12896-015-0142-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245011300177300001600290520131200306592002801618650001301646650001501659650001101674650001901685650004301704650001401747650000901761650001501770650001301785650001101798650001101809650001101820651001301831653001701844653002701861653000901888653002401897700002601921700001401947773010201961856008702063852000902150655001202159IND60112500420221116222605.0190408e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011250042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIqbal, Shahzad Zafar10aVariation of aflatoxin M1 contamination in milk and milk products collected during winter and summer seasons  ap. 714-718.  aTotal 221 samples of milk and milk products were collected during winter (November 2011–February 2012) and 212 samples were collected during summer (May–August 2012) from central areas of Punjab, Pakistan. The samples were analyzed for the presence of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) with a validated HPLC method equipped with florescence detector. The results revealed that from winter season almost 45% samples of milk and milk products were found to be contaminated with AFM1 i.e. 40% of raw milk, 51% of UHT milk, 37% of yogurt, 60% of butter and 43% of ice cream samples and 27, 24, 25, 34 and 17% of samples were found above the recommended limit for AFM1, respectively. However, from summer season 32% samples of milk and milk products were found to be contaminated i.e. 36% of raw milk, 31% of UHT milk, 29% of yogurt, 40% of butter and 24% of ice cream and 23, 23, 18, 20 and 5% of samples were found above the permissible limit for AFM1, respectively. The levels of contamination in winter milk and milk product samples were significantly higher (α ≤ 0.05) than in summer season. The occurrence of AFM1 in milk and milk products were higher, demanding to implement strict regulations and also urged the need for continuous monitoring of milk and milk products in order to minimize the health hazards.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUHT milk 3aaflatoxins 3abutter 3ahealth hazards 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aice cream 3amilk 3amonitoring 3araw milk 3asummer 3awinter 3ayogurt 3aPakistan 0aAflatoxin M1 0aMilk and milk products 0aHPLC 0aSeasonal variations1 aAsi, Muhammad Rafique1 aJinap, S.0 tFood control.g2013 Dec., v. 34, no. 2 p.714-718dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03567naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001900191245008300210300001600293506007600309520188500385592002802270506003702298650001702335650002602352650001502378650002202393650002302415650001902438650001502457650001202472650001202484650003502496650003702531650002302568650002102591650001702612651001302629651001202642653001202654653001202666653003102678653001102709653002302720653002102743700002102764700002702785773010702812856008502919852000903004655001203013IND60536111320221207094308.0190215e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053611132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2014.12.0222doi7 aPMC43023402pmcid7 a256208052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGray, Clark L.10aDeclining use of wild resources by indigenous peoples of the Ecuadorian Amazon  ap. 270-277.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWild product harvesting by forest-dwelling peoples, including hunting, fishing, forest product collection and timber harvesting, is believed to be a major threat to the biodiversity of tropical forests worldwide. Despite this threat, few studies have attempted to quantify these activities across time or across large spatial scales. We use a unique longitudinal household survey (n=480) to describe changes in these activities over time in 32 indigenous communities from five ethnicities in the northern Ecuadorian Amazon. To provide insight into the drivers of these changes, we also estimate multilevel statistical models of these activities as a function of household and community characteristics. These analyses reveal that participation in hunting, fishing, and forest product collection is high but declining across time and across ethnicities, with no evidence for a parallel decline in resource quality. However, participation in timber harvesting did not significantly decline and there is evidence of a decline in resource quality. Multilevel statistical models additionally reveal that household and community characteristics such as ethnicity, demographic characteristics, wealth, livelihood diversification, access to forest, participation in conservation programs and exposure to external markets are significant predictors of wild product harvesting. These characteristics have changed over time but cannot account for declining participation in resource harvesting. This finding suggests that participation is declining due to changes in the regional-scale social and economic context, including urbanization and the expansion of government infrastructure and services. The lesson for conservationists is that macro-scale social and economic conditions can drive reductions in wild product harvesting even in the absence of successful conservation interventions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiodiversity 3aconservation programs 3aharvesting 3ahousehold surveys 3aindigenous peoples 3ainfrastructure 3alivelihood 3alogging 3amarkets 3anatural resources conservation 3asociodemographic characteristics 3astatistical models 3atropical forests 3aurbanization 3aAmazonia 3aEcuador 0aHunting 0aFishing 0aNon-timber forest products 0aTimber 0aIndigenous peoples 0aHousehold survey1 aBozigar, Matthew1 aBilsborrow, Richard E.0 tBiological conservation.g2015 Feb., v. 182 p.270-277dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2014.12.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245004500156300001800201520145800219592002801677650002201705650001001727650001101737650000901748650001701757650001101774650001601785650001401801650002101815650001301836650001101849650001601860700002101876700002301897773012001920856007502040852000902115655001202124IND60559462920221118054158.0161216e20140306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055946292DNAL7 a10.1021/jp412806y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHara, Yusuke10aGenerative Force of Self-Oscillating Gel  ap. 2576-2581.  aWe succeeded in measuring the generative force of a self-oscillating polymer gel in an aqueous solution comprising the three substrates of the Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction (malonic acid, sodium bromate, and nitric acid) under constant temperature. In this study, we developed an apparatus with a microforce sensor for measuring the generative force of small-sized gels (1 mm³). The self-oscillating polymer gel directly converts the chemical energy of the BZ reaction into mechanical work. It was determined that the generative force of the self-oscillating gel was 972 Pa, and the period of self-oscillation was 480 s at 18 °C. We demonstrated that the generative force of the gel was about a hundredth the generative force of a muscle in the body. We analyzed the time dependence of the color change in the self-oscillating polymer gel. The color of the gel changed periodically owing to the cyclic change in the redox state of the Ru moiety, induced by the BZ reaction. The peaks of the waveforms of the generative force and color change were almost identical. This result showed that the generative force was synchronized with the periodical change in the oxidation number of the Ru catalytic moiety in the gel. To understand a theoretical basis for the generative force of a self-oscillating gel, we considered a general theory that is based on the volume phase transition of gel and the two-parameter Oregonator model of the BZ reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acolor 3aenergy 3agels 3amalonic acid 3amodels 3anitric acid 3aoxidation 3aphase transition 3apolymers 3asodium 3atemperature1 aMayama, Hiroyuki1 aMorishima, Keisuke0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2014 Mar. 06, v. 118, no. 9 p.2576-2581dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp412806y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03512naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245007000210300001100280506007600291520180400367592002802171506003702199650002802236650002402264650002102288650001502309650001302324650001602337650002102353650002502374650002002399650001002419650004202429650002902471650002302500650001202523650002302535650001902558650001902577650002102596650001502617650001402632650001902646650002702665700001802692700002202710700002002732773010402752856008102856852000902937655001202946IND60664400020221207142413.0190910e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066440002DNAL7 a10.1186/s12896-015-0175-32doi7 aPMC44776102pmcid7 a260999392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArora, Arinder K.12aA delivery system for field application of paratransgenic control  ap. 59.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: As an alternative to chemical pesticides, paratransgenesis relies on transformation of symbiotic bacteria of an arthropod vector to deliver molecules that disrupt pathogen transmission. For over a decade paratransgenesis has remained a laboratory-based endeavor owing to regulatory concerns regarding introduction of transformed microorganisms into the environment. To facilitate field application of paratransgenic strategies, risk mitigation approaches that address environmental contamination and gene spread must be developed. RESULTS: Using biopolymer manipulation, we introduce a novel microencapsulation platform for containment and targeted delivery of engineered bacteria to the gut of a disease-transmitting arthropod. We demonstrate the first proof of principle of targeted delivery of EPA-approved Pantoea agglomerans E325 in a paratransgenic system to control spread of Pierce’s Disease by glassy-winged sharpshooters, (Homalodisca vitripennis) under simulated field conditions. Engineered microcapsules may address regulatory concerns regarding containment of recombinant bacteria and environmental spread of foreign genetic material and may represent an important step in translating paratransgenic science beyond the lab and into the field. CONCLUSIONS: We present, for the first time, a microencapsulation strategy to deliver recombinant bacteria to an insect and demonstrate targeted release of bacteria into the physiologically relevant region of the insect gut. This is a first step toward addressing concerns related to field application of recombinant bacteria. Engineered microparticles may decrease environmental contamination, horizontal gene transfer and competition with native species by acting as a barrier between recombinant bacteria and the environment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHomalodisca vitripennis 3aPantoea agglomerans 3aPierce's disease 3aarthropods 3abacteria 3abiopolymers 3adigestive system 3adisease transmission 3adisease vectors 3agenes 3agenetically engineered microorganisms 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3aindigenous species 3ainsects 3amicroencapsulation 3amicroparticles 3amicrosymbionts 3aparatransgenesis 3apesticides 3apollution 3arisk reduction 3atranslation (genetics)1 aForshaw, Adam1 aMiller, Thomas A.1 aDurvasula, Ravi0 tBMC biotechnology.g2015 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.59-59dBioMed CentralwJournal:19124x1472-67507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12896-015-0175-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245009500160300001400255520102800269592002801297650002401325650001901349650001901368650002401387650001801411650002501429650001401454650001701468650000901485653001901494653001701513653001401530653001601544653002301560653000901583700001801592700001501610700001701625700001801642700001401660773010101674856008101775852000901856655001201865IND60547172320221117003228.0160903e20150901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054717232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2015.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Wei10aEffects of surfactants on graphene oxide nanoparticles transport in saturated porous media  ap. 12-19.  aTransport behaviors of graphene oxide nanoparticles (GONPs) in saturated porous media were examined as a function of the presence and concentration of anionic surfactant (SDBS) and non-ionic surfactant (Triton X-100) under different ionic strength (IS). The results showed that the GONPs were retained obviously in the sand columns at both IS of 50 and 200mmol/L, and they were more mobile at lower IS. The presence and concentration of surfactants could enhance the GONP transport, particularly as observed at higher IS. It was interesting to see that the GONP transport was surfactant type dependent, and SDBS was more effective to facilitate GONP transport than Triton X-100 in our experimental conditions. The advection–dispersion–retention numerical modeling followed this trend and depicted the difference quantitatively. Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) interaction calculations also were performed to interpret these effects, indicating that secondary minimum deposition was critical in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanionic surfactants 3agraphene oxide 3aionic strength 3amathematical models 3ananoparticles 3anonionic surfactants 3aoctoxynol 3aporous media 3asand 0aGraphene oxide 0aPorous media 0aTransport 0aSurfactants 0aNumerical modeling 0aDLVO1 aJiang, Xuehui1 aLü, Ying,1 aHuo, Mingxin1 aLin, Shanshan1 aGeng, Zhi0 tJournal of Environmental Sciences.g2015 Sept. 01, v. 35 p.12-19dElsevier B.V.x1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2015.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01938naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245013300177300001600310520066600326592002800992650002401020650001701044650001601061650003001077650001701107650001001124650002201134650003001156650002701186653002701213653001901240653001501259700002201274700002001296700002601316773010201342856008701444852000901531655001201540IND60112500520221116222436.0190408e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011250052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.04.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDalmasso, Alessandra12aA novel minisequencing test for species identification of salted and dried products derived from species belonging to Gadiformes  ap. 296-299.  aThe aim of the present study is to develop an assay for the specific identification of Gadus morhua, Gadus macrocephalus, Gadus ogac, Molva molva and Brosme brosme targeting sequences of the cytochrome b (cyt b) gene of mitochondrial DNA.

Here we demonstrate that the L-conformation of DNA (L-DNA), the enantiomer of D-DNA, can also be used for the preparation of aptamer-Ag NCs. The extraordinary resistance of L-DNA to nuclease digestion confers much higher biostability to these NCs than those templated by D-DNA, thus making cell-type-specific imaging possible at physiological temperatures, using at least 100-times lower Ag NC concentration than reported D-DNA-templated ones. The L-DNA-templated metal NC probes with enhanced biostability might promote the applications of metal nanocluster probes in complex biological systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aenantiomers 3aimage analysis 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3anucleases 3asilver 3atemperature1 aJia, Zhen-Zhen1 aZhu, Yan-Jun1 aJiao, Jia-Jia1 aKong, De-Ming1 aFeng, Xi-Zeng0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 88, no. 22 p.10800-10804dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.6b028713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006600147245009400213520132600307592002801633650001801661650001501679650001601694650001001710650001501720650003501735650001901770650001801789651000901807653003201816653004001848653003401888653001301922653001701935653002101952700002101973700005801994773011702052856008202169852000902251655001202260IND60745893720221120165549.0210915e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074589372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnc.2021.1260432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Saffar, Mohammed A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1547-115010aIdentifying and prioritizing aquatic habitats for conservation in a poorly studied region  aSetting conservation priorities is an important step when resources are finite. Indeveloping countries such as Iraq, information about aquatic habitats is quite limited and prioritizing such habitats for conservation requires a multidisciplinary approach to utilize available types of data efficiently. We divided aquatic ecosystems of the Kurdistan Region of northern Iraq into 76 planning units. Next, we compiled mayfly, stonefly, and caddisfly (Insecta: Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera (EPT)) data for 33 of them; these units were ranked for EPT conservation using a combination of indices. We selected the subset of units with the highest priority for EPT conservation and considered them to represent samples of healthy aquatic habitats in the region; we used these units, along with various landscape predictor variables, in correlative distribution modeling for healthy aquatic habitats across the entire region. Our approach resulted in identifying one lake and 23 riverine units as healthy aquatic habitats of conservation priority in the region. Our research shows that in developing countries where knowledge about aquatic habitats and species is minimal, conservation studies can still be conducted using water quality bioindicators along with a combination of conservation indices and spatial modeling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEphemeroptera 3aPlecoptera 3aTrichoptera 3alakes 3alandscapes 3anatural resources conservation 3ariparian areas 3awater quality 3aIraq 0aWater quality bioindicators 0aSpatial conservation prioritization 0aHabitat distribution modeling 0aEPT Taxa 0aTigris River 0aKurdistan region1 aAlwash, Azzam J.1 aBerg, David J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2537-07590 tJournal for nature conservation.g2021 Oct., v. 63 p.126043-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:J000000095x1617-13817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2021.1260433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02530naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245011300164520114600277592002801423650002501451650002901476650001901505650001201524650001801536650001201554650001101566650001301577650002001590653001401610653002501624653001201649653001801661653002101679700001701700700002001717700001801737700001601755700005201771700001201823700001601835773012801851856008401979852000902063655001202072IND60720071920221122062349.0210619e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072007192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2020.1051352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Yuwen10ad-leucine enhances antibiofilm activity of chlorhexidine against caries-causing Streptococcus mutans biofilm  aChlorhexidine (CHX) mouthwash is widely used clinically to remove the established Streptococcus mutans biofilm and prevent caries. However, the long-term use with high concentration of CHX leads to the staining of tooth and mucous membrane. In this study, d-leucine (d-leu) was used as an antimicrobial enhancer for CHX against mature S. mutans biofilm. The biocidal efficacy was evaluated by means of quantitative antibacterial test and biofilm observation. The results indicated that 100 ppm d-leu alone was ineffective to remove the S. mutans biofilm. Moreover, the biocidal effect of 1 ppm CHX was also inadequate to eradicate the biofilm. When 100 ppm d-leu was mixed with 1 ppm CHX, most of the mature S. mutans biofilm on 316L stainless steel coupon surfaces were successfully removed, and the removal efficacy was equivalent to that of 10 ppm CHX alone. The results confirmed that d-leu significantly enhanced the antibiofilm effect of CHX, dissembling the tenacious biofilm into easily killed planktonic counterparts. d-leu represents a novel strategy to reduce the dosage of CHX with a guaranteed effect for caries prevention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus mutans 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiodegradation 3abiofilm 3achlorhexidine 3aleucine 3amucosa 3aplankton 3astainless steel 0ad-leucine 0aStreptococcus mutans 0aBiofilm 0aChlorhexidine 0aBiocide enhancer1 aZheng, Bowen1 aLekbach, Yassir1 aLiu, Xiaomeng1 aZheng, Ying1 aXu, Dake1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0931-71891 aLiu, Yi1 aWang, Fuhui0 tInternational biodeterioration & biodegradation.g2021 Feb., v. 157 p.105135-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12418x0964-83057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2020.1051353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010400171300001600275520142700291592002801718650002101746650001601767650002901783650001601812650001401828650001701842650001201859650001001871650001201881650001301893650001901906650001801925650001001943650001601953653002701969653000901996700002502005700002002030700002302050700001802073773012902091856008102220852000902301655001202310IND60677717020221121003301.0191213e20191114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067771702DNAL7 a10.1017/S00220299190006572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuiz-Diaz, Maria D.10aInfluence of treatment and refrigeration time on antimicrobial activity of goat and sheep colostrum  ap. 450-453.  aThe aim of the studies presented in this research communication was to compare species of origin (goat and sheep) and the effect of treatment (pasteurization at 56, 63 and 72 °C, skimming and curding) and refrigeration time on colostrum antimicrobial activity (AnAc). Two experiments were performed. In experiment 1, twenty-four first milking colostrum samples were obtained (12 goats, 12 sheep) and an aliquot of each sample was subjected to 6 different treatments, control (untreated), pasteurization at 56, 63 and 72 °C, skimming and curding. Colostrum AnAc was tested directly against E. coli using disks in a Petri dish and Enrofloxacin (antibiotic) and saline serum as positive and negative control, respectively. Species had no effect (P > 0.05) on colostrum AnAc, and neither did pasteurization at different temperatures or skimming. However, curding showed the lowest colostrum AnAc (P < 0.05) in both species. In the second experiment, four treatments were assayed, control, pasteurization at 56 and 63 °C and skimming. An aliquot of twelve goat colostrum samples were refrigerated after treatments for 10 d at 4 °C. Colostrum AnAc was measured at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 d. A reduction in colostrum AnAc was observed due to refrigeration time. The results suggest that if farmers use frozen colostrum for neonates, the process of curding colostrum or refrigeration at 4 °C longer than 4 d is not recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibiotics 3aantimicrobial properties 3ablood serum 3acolostrum 3aenrofloxacin 3afarmers 3agoats 3amilking 3aneonates 3apasteurization 3arefrigeration 3asheep 3atemperature 0aAntimicrobial activity 0agoat1 aArgüello, Anastasio1 aPadilla, Daniel1 aEarley, Bernadette1 aCastro, Noemi0 tJournal of dairy research.g2019 Nov., v. 86, no. 4 p.450-453dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45499x1469-76297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299190006573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03142naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011700168300001300285520162400298592002801922650004001950650002101990650001802011650001602029650001402045650001502059650001002074650001702084650001302101650002502114650001502139650001302154650000902167650001202176650002702188650001402215650001302229650001102242653001402253653002202267653002302289700001802312700001502330700001302345700001302358700005602371773009502427856008102522852000902603655001202612IND60606314920221118211304.0180725e20160401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060631492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2016.02.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zheng-Zhen10aMemantine mediates neuroprotection via regulating neurovascular unit in a mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia  ap. 8-14.  aMemantine is a low-moderate affinity and uncompetitive N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, which is also a potential neuroprotectant in acute ischemic stroke for its particular action profiles. The present study was to reveal the mechanisms involved in the neuroprotection of memantine.We used a mouse model of permanent focal cerebral ischemia via middle cerebral artery occlusion to verify our hypothesis. 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining was used to compare infarct size. The amount of astrocytes and the somal volume of the microglia cell body were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and stereological estimates. Western blotting was used to determine the protein expressions.Memantine prevented cerebral ischemia-induced brain infarct and neuronal injury, and reduced oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced cortical neuronal apoptosis. Moreover, memantine reduced the amount of the damaged astrocytes and over activated microglia after 24h of ischemia. In the early phase of ischemia, higher production of MMP-9 was observed, and thereby collagen IV was dramatically disrupted. Meanwhile, the post-synaptic density protein 95(PSD-95) was also severely cleavaged. Memantine decreased MMP-9 secretion, prevented the degradation of collagen IV in mouse brain. PSD-95 cleavage was also inhibited by memantine.These results suggested that memantine exerted neuroprotection effects in acute ischemic brain damage, partially via improving the functions of neurovascular unit. Taking all these findings together, we consider that memantine might be a promising protective agent against ischemic stroke.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride 3aWestern blotting 3aanimal models 3aantagonists 3aapoptosis 3aastrocytes 3abrain 3abrain damage 3acollagen 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainfarction 3aischemia 3amice 3aneurons 3aneuroprotective effect 3asecretion 3astaining 3astroke 0aMemantine 0aCerebral ischemia 0aNeurovascular unit1 aYang, Dan-Dan1 aZhao, Zhan1 aYan, Hui1 aJi, Juan1 aSun, Xiu-Lan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8741-38330 tLife sciences.g2016 Apr. 01, v. 150 p.8-14dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2016.02.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245011700163300001800280520132600298592002801624650001201652650001401664650002101678650002301699650001301722650001301735650001201748650001101760650001401771650001201785650001301797700002501810700003101835700002601866700001701892700002001909700002301929700001701952773013101969856007502100852000902175655001202184IND60538532120170426000000.0160815e20120516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053853212DNAL7 a10.1021/ja300396h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Giuseppe, Andrea10aLigand-Controlled Regioselectivity in the Hydrothiolation of Alkynes by Rhodium N-Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysts  ap. 8171-8183.  aRh–N-heterocyclic carbene compounds [Rh(μ-Cl)(IPr)(η²-olefin)]₂ and RhCl(IPr)(py)(η²-olefin) (IPr = 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-carbene, py = pyridine, olefin = cyclooctene or ethylene) are highly active catalysts for alkyne hydrothiolation under mild conditions. A regioselectivity switch from linear to 1-substituted vinyl sulfides was observed when mononuclear RhCl(IPr)(py)(η²-olefin) catalysts were used instead of dinuclear precursors. A complex interplay between electronic and steric effects exerted by IPr, pyridine, and hydride ligands accounts for the observed regioselectivity. Both IPr and pyridine ligands stabilize formation of square-pyramidal thiolate–hydride active species in which the encumbered and powerful electron-donor IPr ligand directs coordination of pyridine trans to it, consequently blocking access of the incoming alkyne in this position. Simultaneously, the higher trans director hydride ligand paves the way to a cis thiolate–alkyne disposition, favoring formation of 2,2-disubstituted metal–alkenyl species and subsequently the Markovnikov vinyl sulfides via alkenyl–hydride reductive elimination. DFT calculations support a plausible reaction pathway where migratory insertion of the alkyne into the rhodium–thiolate bond is the rate-determining step.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3acatalysts 3achemical bonding 3achemical reactions 3aethylene 3ahydrides 3aligands 3aolefin 3apyridines 3arhodium 3asulfides1 aCastarlenas, Ricardo1 aPérez-Torrente, Jesús J.1 aCrucianelli, Marcello1 aPolo, Victor1 aSancho, Rodrigo1 aLahoz, Fernando J.1 aOro, Luis A.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 May 16, v. 134, no. 19 p.8171-8183dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja300396h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03488naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245011700161300001800278520193100296592002802227650001602255650001902271650001402290650002002304650001502324650002202339650002202361650001402383650002802397650002102425650000902446653002402455653003302479653004002512653002002552653002202572653000802594700001902602700002102621700006002642700002202702700005602724773013902780856007802919852000902997655001203006IND60595608320180622000000.0180605e20180207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059560832DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b186462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrey, Marion10aDelignified and Densified Cellulose Bulk Materials with Excellent Tensile Properties for Sustainable Engineering  ap. 5030-5037.  aToday’s materials research aims at excellent mechanical performance in combination with advanced functionality. In this regard, great progress has been made in tailoring the materials by assembly processes in bottom-up approaches. In the field of wood-derived materials, nanocellulose research has gained increasing attention, and materials with advanced properties were developed. However, there are still unresolved issues concerning upscaling for large-scale applications. Alternatively, the sophisticated hierarchical scaffold of wood can be utilized in a top-down approach to upscale functionalization, and one can profit at the same time from its renewable nature, CO₂ storing capacity, light weight, and good mechanical performance. Nevertheless, for bulk wood materials, a wider multipurpose industrial use is so far impeded by concerns regarding durability, natural heterogeneity as well as limitations in terms of functionalization, processing, and shaping. Here, we present a novel cellulose bulk material concept based on delignification and densification of wood resulting in a high-performance material. A delignification process using hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid was optimized to delignify the entire bulk wooden blocks and to retain the highly beneficial structural directionality of wood. In a subsequent step, these cellulosic blocks were densified in a process combining compression and lateral shear to gain a very compact cellulosic material with entangled fibers while retaining unidirectional fiber orientation. The cellulose bulk materials obtained by different densification protocols were structurally, chemically, and mechanically characterized revealing superior tensile properties compared to native wood. Furthermore, after delignification, the cellulose bulk material can be easily formed into different shapes, and the delignification facilitates functionalization of the bioscaffold.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3acarbon dioxide 3acellulose 3adelignification 3adurability 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amaterials science 3aprotocols 3asustainable engineering 3atensile strength 3awood 0acellulose scaffolds 0ashear-assisted densification 0anatural fiber-reinforced composites 0adelignification 0awood modification 0aAFM1 aWidner, Daniel1 aSegmehl, Jana S.1 aCasdorff, Kirstin1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0431-93131 aKeplinger, Tobias1 aBurgert, Ingo1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0028-072X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Feb. 07, v. 10, no. 5 p.5030-5037dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b186463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02415naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245007300161300001600234500001100250520082300261592002801084596005901112596005901171596005901230596009101289596006101380650002001441650002501461650002901486650001801515650001701533650001201550650001501562650002001577650001301597651001001610700001601620700001801636700001401654700005501668773014301723856008201866852000901948655001201957IND60645173220221116185321.0190523e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064517322DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-019-02563-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ping10aHuman Biological Monitoring of Mercury Through Hair Samples in China  ap. 701-707.  aReview  aMercury (Hg) is a global pollutant that affects environmental and human health.

In this review paper, we summarized data obtained through regional and small-scaled human biomonitoring (HBM) program for Hg in hair samples in China, which can deliver scientific data to make decisions on environmental health policy. Besides, the major conclusions got from this study and perspectives for future works through these HBM program in China were presented. To better understand the current situation of hair Hg levels in China, a well-coordinated and designed national HBM program is urgently needed considering the requirements of the Minamata Convention on Mercury for effectiveness evaluation.  aPublisher supplied data  a11475196cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41573132cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41622208cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016YFA0201600cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People’s Republic of China  aQKH-2016-2804cGuizhou Science and Technology Department 3adecision making 3aenvironmental health 3aenvironmental monitoring 3ahealth policy 3ahuman health 3amercury 3apollutants 3arisk management 3atoxicity 3aChina1 aGuo, Shuhui1 aZhao, Jiating1 aGao, Yuxi1 aLi, Yu-Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5013-58490 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2019 May, v. 102, no. 5 p.701-707dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46145x0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-019-02563-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02021naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245009900160300001800259520105300277592002801330650002001358650001501378650001601393650001701409650001901426650001701445650001401462650001301476700002101489773009901510856007701609852000901686655001201695IND50088796220221120201512.0151024e199810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008879622DNAL7 a10.1007/s0070500504422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManiloff, J.10aTaxonomy of bacterial viruses: establishment of tailed virus genera and the other Caudovirales  ap. 2051-2063.  aBacterial viruses have been classified into 13 families and 1 unassigned genus.

In addition, genera have been established for some species in each tailed virus family, based on properties involving viral DNA replication and packaging, and on some features specific to particular genera (e.g., DNA-termini linked proteins, virus-encoded polymerases, and ability to establish temperate infections). At present, there are six genera in the family Myoviridae (viruses with contractile tails), six in the family Siphoviridae (viruses with long, noncontractile tails), and three in the family Podoviridae (viruses with short noncontractile tails).

Accurate evaluation of seed quality and related field performance are difficult to obtain with this test since it determines germinability of seed under optimum conditions. Additional seed quality evaluations such as vigor tests, are often valuable in estimating seed quality. Common tests of seed vigor such as germination at cool temperatures, accelerated aging, cold soil, seedling vigor classification, seedling growth rates, seed leachate electrical conductivity, tetrazolium, and mitochondrial efficiency were evaluated to determine their applicability for evaluating sunflower seed quality. Percent seedling emergence in the field was compared with laboratory vigor test results to determine which laboratory method(s) most accurately evaluated seed-seedling vigor of sunflower. Seed leachate electrical conductivity tests, seedling vigor classification, germination at 10°C, and accelerated aging tests resulted in significantly higher correlations with percent seedling emergence in the field than did the germination test at 21°C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus1 aSchneiter, A.

We previously established SH2 profiling, a phosphoproteomic approach based on membrane binding assays that utilizes purified Src Homology 2 (SH2) domains as a molecular tool to profile the global tyrosine phosphorylation state of cells. However, in order to use this method to investigate SH2 binding sites on a specific target in cell lysate, additional procedures such as pull-down or immunoprecipitation which consume large amounts of sample are required. RESULTS: We have developed PLA-SH2, an alternative in-solution modular domain binding assay that takes advantage of Proximity Ligation Assay and real-time PCR. The SH2-PLA assay utilizes oligonucleotide-conjugated anti-GST and anti-EGFR antibodies recognizing a GST-SH2 probe and cellular EGFR, respectively. If the GST-SH2 and EGFR are in close proximity as a result of SH2-phosphotyrosine interactions, the two oligonucleotides are brought within a suitable distance for ligation to occur, allowing for efficient complex amplification via real-time PCR. The assay detected signal across at least 3 orders of magnitude of lysate input with a linear range spanning 1–2 orders and a low femtomole limit of detection for EGFR phosphotyrosine. SH2 binding kinetics determined by PLA-SH2 showed good agreement with established far-Western analyses for A431 and Cos1 cells stimulated with EGF at various times and doses. Further, we showed that PLA-SH2 can survey lung cancer tissues using 1 μl lysate without requiring phospho-enrichment. CONCLUSIONS: We showed for the first time that interactions between SH2 domain probes and EGFR in cell lysate can be determined in a microliter-scale assay using SH2-PLA. The obvious benefit of this method is that the low sample requirement allows detection of SH2 binding in samples which are difficult to analyze using traditional protein interaction assays. This feature along with short assay runtime makes this method a useful platform for the development of high throughput assays to determine modular domain–ligand interactions which could have wide-ranging applications in both basic and translational cancer research.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant code:ID0ETZAE68cNational Institutes of Health  aGrant code:ID0EBAAG69cLeukemia and Lymphoma Society0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibodies 3abinding sites 3adetection limit 3aenzymes 3alung neoplasms 3aoligonucleotides 3aphosphorylation 3aprecipitin tests 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asurveys 3atyrosine1 aBloom, Lee R.1 aOgiue-Ikeda, Mari1 aMachida, Kazuya0 tBMC biotechnology.g2015 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.60-60dBioMed CentralwJournal:19124x1472-67507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12896-015-0169-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01734naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245015300177300002100330520040300351592002800754650001500782650002200797650001600819650001700835650001600852650000800868650001000876650001600886700002500902700002200927700002000949700002400969700002400993700002501017700002201042700002401064773010401088856008801192990002301280852000901303655001201312IND60098539120221121015122.0141104e20110630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009853912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2011.05.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPelliccione, Fiore10aActivation of the immune system and sperm DNA fragmentation are associated with idiopathic oligoasthenoteratospermia in men with couple subfertility  ap. 2676-2679.e3.  aEjaculates from men without known causes for male subfertility and asymptomatic for genital tract inflammation showed infiltration of macrophages, and their activation state (HLA-DR⁺) was negatively correlated with semen parameters and positively correlated with sperm DNA damage.

The number, size, and mass of progeny relative to parent size were investigated in three asterinid sea star species that incubate their young in the gonads. Cryptasterina hystera has intragonadal planktonic-type lecithotrophic larvae with development supported by large eggs (440-µm diameter) and the juveniles are similar in size (655-µm diameter; coefficient of variation, CV = 6.89%). By contrast, Parvulastra vivipara and P. parvivipara have small vestigial larvae and small eggs (135–150-µm diameter) with offspring development supported by sibling cannibalism (matrotrophy). The juveniles in the gonads vary in size (500–5000-µm diameter, CV = 63.87 and 53.27%, respectively). All three species show a positive relationship between parent size and the number and size of juveniles. The allometry of brooding hypothesis that the number of progeny that can be cared for is (paradoxically) constrained in large adults due to space limitation was tested. In all species, the number of progeny increased with adult size, indicating that there are no allometric constraints on offspring incubation. To compare parental investment across the two modes of provisioning, the juvenile weight of C. hystera was used as a pro rata progeny unit. The matrotrophs had a higher reproductive output than similarly sized C. hystera. Of the hypotheses proposed to explain the evolution of parental care in marine invertebrates, none are broadly applicable to the viviparous asterinids because of the marked differences in their reproductive strategies.  aPublisher supplied data  aUniversity of Sydney International Scholarship (SC0853)cUniversity of Sydney  aNot specific to this researchcAustralian Research Council 3aAsteroidea 3aadults 3aallometry 3aaquatic invertebrates 3acannibalism 3aeggs 3agonads 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3aprogeny 3areproductive performance1 aWhittington, Camilla M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5765-96991 aThompson, Michael B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2496-992X1 aByrne, Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8902-98080 tMarine biology.g2019 June, v. 166, no. 6 p.81-81dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-019-3507-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245013900156300001800295520163300313592002801946650002401974650001101998650001702009650001802026650001902044650002302063650001402086700002102100700001602121700001702137773012002154856007502274852000902349655001202358IND60559463020221118054240.0161216e20140306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055946302DNAL7 a10.1021/jp500281z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManna, Arpan10aAtypical Energetic and Kinetic Course of Excited-State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) in Room-Temperature Protic Ionic Liquids  ap. 2487-2498.  aThe excited-state intramolecular proton-transfer (ESIPT) process in 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone (18DHAQ) dye has been investigated in protic ionic liquid (PIL) solvents using photochemical measurements. The results demonstrate noteworthy modulations in both steady-state and time-resolved emission characteristics of excited normal (N*) and tautomeric (T*) forms of the dye. That the emission of T* increases unexpectedly upon increasing solvent viscosity indicates that subsequent to the initial forward ESIPT, there is also a relatively slower back ESIPT process involved for the excited dye. It is inferred that the propensity of this back ESIPT process is determined by the dynamics of the diffusive solvent relaxation, a process that is known to be strongly viscosity-dependent in ionic liquids. Evidence of both forward and back ESIPT for the dye has been obtained from femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion measurements. While an unusually fast forward ESIPT is clearly observed in all of the PILs studied, the uncommon back ESIPT process is distinctly indicated in PIL solvents having lower viscosities, certainly due to reasonably fast diffusive solvent relaxation in these solvents that causes a temporal modulation in the energies of the normal and tautomeric forms within a reasonably short time and thereby brings down the energy of N* compared to that of T*, triggering the back ESIPT process. Observation of solvent-viscosity-dependent back ESIPT is an intriguing finding for the present study as to the best of our knowledge, such a behavior has so far not been reported in the literature for the ESIPT reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3aionic liquids 3aphotochemistry 3aphysical chemistry 3aviscosity1 aSayed, Mhejabeen1 aAnil Kumar,1 aPal, Haridas0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2014 Mar. 06, v. 118, no. 9 p.2487-2498dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp500281z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245013500173300001600308520125600324592002801580650001901608650001401627650001501641650002501656650001201681650001501693650001701708650001601725650001601741650001201757650001301769651001401782651001601796700002301812773010701835856005501942852000901997655001202006IND4477827620221119110340.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447782762DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-1984.2011.00319.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFAGUA, J.

We sought to determine if the bees and ants significantly alter the pollination of M. intortus by measuring pollinator effectiveness. Using traditional estimates of effectiveness (visitation rate and seed set), our results show that hummingbirds were the most effective pollinators as expected. Bees and ants were less effective, and their contributions were one‐fourth to one‐tenth of that observed for hummingbirds. We then modified this measure of effectiveness by adding two components, fitness of progeny and temporal availability of visitors, both of which refine estimates of flower visitor effectiveness. With these new estimations, we found that the effectiveness values of all three animal visitors decreased; however, the role of hummingbirds as the principal pollinator was maintained, whereas the effectiveness values of bees and ants approached zero. By these new measures of overall pollinator effectiveness, the invasive honeybees and ants have little effect on the reproductive success of M. intortus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aCactaceae 3aSolenopsis 3acacti and succulents 3aflowers 3ahoney bees 3ahummingbirds 3apollination 3apollinators 3aprogeny 3aseed set 3aCaribbean 3aPuerto Rico1 aACKERMAN, JAMES D.0 tPlant species biology.g2011 Sept., v. 26, no. 3 p.193-204dBlackwell Publishing Asiax0913-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-1984.2011.00319.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245017400172520131400346592002801660650001901688650002101707650002201728650001301750650001301763650000901776650001401785650001701799650001301816650001301829650001101842653001801853653002301871653001201894653001201906653001201918653001601930653001201946653002101958700006301979700006202042700006202104700001502166700006202181773012802243856008402371852000902455655001202464IND60720072120221122062837.0210619e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072007212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2020.1051542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeshareh, Moein J.10aNitrite is a more efficient inhibitor of microbial sulfate reduction in oil reservoirs compared to nitrate and perchlorate: A laboratory and field-scale simulation study  aMicrobial sulfate reduction is the most significant source of hydrogen sulfide (souring) as oil reservoirs are flooded with seawater (with mM concentrations of sulfate) for secondary oil recovery. Nitrate (nitrite) injections into the reservoirs are routinely used to constrain souring. Perchlorate was proposed as an alternative souring mitigation agent, however its effectiveness remains to be determined on a field scale. We used a combination of laboratory-based experiments and field scale numerical models to compare the efficacy of nitrate, nitrite, and perchlorate in inhibiting sulfide production in offshore oil reservoirs. Our results suggest that on a field scale perchlorate inhibits sulfide accumulation by inhibiting sulfate reduction and promoting sulfide oxidation. Elemental sulfur production was observed during nitrate reduction by Archaeglobus fulgidus confirming previous suggestions that the process is coupled to the oxidation of sulfide. Finally, nitrite was the most efficient inhibitor of sulfide accumulation, further confirmed by our field scale simulations. Our field scale simulations predict that injection of 1 mM of nitrite can reduce souring by 92%, while perchlorate (1 mM) or nitrate (1 mM) have the potential to reduce sulfide accumulation by 57% and 80% respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3ahydrogen sulfide 3anitrate reduction 3anitrates 3anitrites 3aoils 3aoxidation 3aperchlorates 3aseawater 3asulfates 3asulfur 0aOil reservoir 0aSulfide inhibition 0aSulfate 0aNitrate 0aNitrite 0aPerchlorate 0aSouring 0aElemental sulfur1 aKjeldsen, Kasper U.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7805-56051 aFindlay, Alyssa J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9214-19911 aNick, Hamidreza M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0623-60951 aRøy, Hans1 aMarietou, Angeliki1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4756-00670 tInternational biodeterioration & biodegradation.g2021 Feb., v. 157 p.105154-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12418x0964-83057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2020.1051543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100001800162245008200180300002000262520123800282650003301520650001701553650002201570650001901592650002701611650002401638650003301662650002901695650003101724650004001755650002401795650002801819650003101847650003501878650004101913653001601954653001501970700002001985773009902005852000902104856008402113930003302197945001302230946001302243990002302256655001202279IND2057349520221119021114.0970529e19950922mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205734952DNAL7 a76732212pmid7 a10.1074/jbc.270.38.223682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHof, R. van't10aCharacterization of the import process of a transit peptide into chloroplasts  ap. 22368-22373.  aIn order to get insight into the functioning of transit sequences in chloroplast protein transport, the import of the full-length transit peptide of ferredoxin (bid) was investigated. trfd rapidly associated with chloroplasts under import conditions and becomes protected against externally added proteases. Import of radiolabeled trfd is inhibited equally efficiently by nonlabeled trfd as well as by the intact precursor of ferredoxin. This strongly suggests that trfd enters the general import pathway of proteins into chloroplasts. trfd import was stimulated by ATP, which is the first demonstration that ATP is involved in membrane translocation of a targeting signal. Imported trfd was membrane-associated but was also partially degraded by internal proteases, most likely present in the stroma, indicating that the membrane-associated fraction of trfd is en route to its functional localization. The degradation products are exported out of the organelle. In contrast to the import of the precursor of ferredoxin, the import of trfd was independent of protease-sensitive components on the chloroplast surface, indicating that the initial binding of precursor proteins may be facilitated by transit sequence-lipid interactions. 3aSilene latifolia subsp. alba 3achloroplasts 3aprotein transport 3asignal peptide 3aadenosine triphosphate 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBiological Transport, Active 2aChloroplastsxmetabolism 2aEndopeptidasesxmetabolism 2aFerredoxinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aProtein Precursorsxmetabolism 2aProtein Sorting Signalsxmetabolism. 0astimulation 0aferredoxin1 aKruijff, B. de.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1995 Sept. 22, v. 270, no. 38 p.22368-22373x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.270.38.223683Available from publisher's Web site  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03920naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100001600162245015400178300002000332520214400352650001102496650001402507650001602521650002202537650001602559650002602575650001802601650001602619650002802635650001802663650002002681650004702701650002202748650003702770650002802807650001102835650003402846650002802880650002602908650003002934650003102964653001502995653001503010653001203025700001703037700001603054773009703070852000903167856008403176930003303260945001303293946001303306990002303319655001203342IND2057350120221119021234.0970529e19961108mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205735012DNAL7 a89104972pmid7 a10.1074/jbc.271.45.286412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, W.Y.10aApolipoprotein E produced by human monocyte-derived macrophages mediates cholesterol efflux that occurs in the absence of added cholesterol acceptors  ap. 28641-28646.  aHuman monocyte-derived macrophages can efflux accumulated cholesterol without exogenously added cholesterol acceptors (Kruth, H. S., Skarlatos, S. I., Gaynor, W. M., and Gamble, W. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 24511-24518). Most of the effluxed cholesterol accumulates in the medium as apolipoprotein E-discoidal lipid particles. In the current study, we determined whether and to what degree cholesterol efflux from human monocyte-macrophages depended on apolipoprotein E secretion. Unexpectedly, 2-week-old differentiated monocyte-macrophages secreted similar amounts of apolipoprotein E without or with cholesterol enrichment. Apolipoprotein E mRNA levels in these macrophages were not increased by cholesterol enrichment and were comparable with levels in HepG2 cells. Without cholesterol enrichment, monocyte-macrophages secreted lipid-poor apolipoprotein E with a density > 1.21 g/ml. By contrast, cholesterol enrichment of monocyte-macrophages induced the association of apoE with phospholipid and cholesterol to form discoidal particles that floated at densities of 1.08-1.10 g/ml. An anti-apolipoprotein E monoclonal antibody added to the culture medium significantly inhibited cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from the monocyte-macrophages. This showed that apolipoprotein E was required for most of the cholesterol efflux, and that apolipoprotein E did not leave macrophages with lipid but rather associated with lipid after it was secreted. Thus 1) apolipoprotein E was constitutively secreted by differentiated human monocyte-macrophages, 2) apolipoprotein E only formed discoidal particles following macrophage cholesterol enrichment, 3) apolipoprotein E was necessary for cholesterol efflux to occur in the absence of added cholesterol acceptors and, in addition, 4) the level of macrophage unesterified cholesterol was not rate-limiting for this cholesterol efflux, and 5) net phospholipid synthesis occurred in macrophages secondary to apoE-mediated loss of macrophage phospholipid. In conclusion, apolipoprotein E functions in a autocrine pathway that mediates cholesterol efflux from human monocyte-derived macrophages. 3ahumans 3amonocytes 3amacrophages 3aprotein secretion 3acholesterol 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aphospholipids 3alipogenesis 3alow density lipoprotein 3amessenger RNA 3aapolipoproteins 2aApolipoproteins Exbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aBlotting, Western 2aCentrifugation, Density Gradient 2aCholesterolxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aLipoproteins, LDLxmetabolism 2aMacrophagesxmetabolism 2aMonocytesxmetabolism 2aPhospholipidsxmetabolism 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 0ainhibition 0aregulation 0arelease1 aGaynor, P.M.1 aKruth, H.S.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1996 Nov. 8, v. 271, no. 45 p.28641-28646x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.271.45.286413Available from publisher's Web site  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02234naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245011700164300001800281500002400299520117700323650001001500650001001510650002401520650002301544653003201567653002401599653003101623653003101654653002901685700001701714773010801731852000901839856004801848655001201896IND4420301020221119020732.0090508e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442030102DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-008-9337-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiberatore, S.10aLocation and Calibration of Valves in Water Distribution Networks Using a Scatter-Search Meta-heuristic Approach  ap. 1479-1495.  aIncludes references  aRecently, there has been an increase in the use of meta-heuristic techniques addressing water distribution network design and management optimization problems. The meta-heuristic approach applied to water distribution systems has provided interesting results both for optimum pipe diameter sizing and for the location and management of network pressure control devices (i.e., pumps and valves). Regarding the insertion and calibration of pressure regulation valves, the use of meta-heuristic techniques is relatively recent. We search to strategically placing the valves in order to achieve pressure control in the network and, therefore, the valves must be calibrated in relation to water demand trends over time. In the Pressure Reference Method (PRM) described in this paper, the search for valve location is restricted to pipe-branch sets defined on the basis of hydraulic analysis and considering the range between minimum and maximum acceptable pressures in the network. In the PRM approach, the Scatter-Search (Glover and Laguna, 1997) meta-heuristic procedures are applied to obtain the optimal location and calibration of valves in the water distribution network. 3apipes 3apumps 3asystem optimization 3awater distribution 0aWater distribution networks 0aPressure management 0aPressure regulating valves 0aMetaheuristic optimization 0aScatter search technique1 aSechi, G.

Here, direct measurements of ATP flux through VDAC channels reconstituted into planar phospholipid membranes establish that VDAC is sufficient to provide passage for ATP efflux from mitochondria. Further, the gating of the channel can shut down ATP flux completely while, simultaneously, allowing the flow of small ions. Thus, these channels are ideally suited to control ATP flux through the mitochondrial outer membrane and, consequently, mitochondrial function. The block to ATP flow through the cloned state is likely to be not steric but electrostatic. 3aNeurospora crassa 3amitochondria 3acell membranes 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aactive transport 3aproteins 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aIntracellular Membranesxmetabolism 2aIon Channelsxmetabolism 2aMembrane Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMitochondriaxmetabolism 2aNeurospora crassa 2aPorins 2aVoltage-Dependent Anion Channels 0amembranes 0aplanar phospholipid membranes1 aColombin, M.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1996 Nov. 8, v. 271, no. 45 p.28006-28008x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.271.45.280063Available from publisher's Web site  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03843naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245015900144300001800303520243100321650001602752650001102768650001702779650002702796650000902823650000902832650001702841650001402858650002002872650003002892650005602922650001202978650001102990650005403001653001303055653001103068653001903079653001803098653001103116653001403127700001303141700001603154700001303170773008603183852000903269930003303278945001303311946001303324655001203337IND2208853220221119021042.0010108e200012  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220885322DNAL7 a111328122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConill, C.10aEffects of injection position and transponder size on the performances of passive injectable transponders used for the electronic identification of cattle  ap. 3001-3009.  aA total of 686 Tiris half-duplex passive injectable transponders (PIT) of two sizes (23 and 32 mm) were randomly injected s.c. in three positions, armpit, ear scutulum, and upper lip, in 343 fattening calves (1 to 3 mo old). Injections were performed by two trained and two untrained operators. Losses and breakages on the farm were recorded at wk 1, 3, 7, 11, and 15 in restrained animals using two types of hand-held transceivers with a stick antenna. Dynamic reading efficiency (DRE) in animals running through a raceway was also evaluated at wk 1 and 3 and monthly until slaughter, using a stationary transceiver working at 137 dB(.)microvolt(.)m-1 at 3 m. The total number of PIT that fell or broke in the slaughtering line, the location method, and the recovery time were also recorded. Results on the farm showed low breakages on average (0.4%) and differences (P < 0.05) in losses according to position (armpit, 1.7%; ear, 5.2%; and lip, 14.0%). An interaction (P < 0.05) between position x size was observed, and losses were greatest using a 32-mm PIT in the lip. The DRE was affected (P < 0.05) by PIT position and size, and values were greater for the 32-mm PIT in all positions (armpit: 99.9 +/- 0.1 vs 95.8 +/- 4.9%; ear: 93.8 +/- 2.2 vs 81.9 +/- 4.6%; lip: 66.8 +/- 4.9 vs 53.4 +/- 4.7%, respectively, for 32 vs 23 mm). Recovery of PIT in the abattoir was on average 96.7, 96.7, and 99.2% for armpit, ear, and lip, respectively (P > 0.05). Most of the PIT injected in the armpit were recovered by sight or palpation, but 31.9% were recovered after cutting the muscles around the area and 10.7% were recovered on the internal side of the hide, which jeopardized carcass identification. Recovery of PIT injected in the ear was 23.4% in the hide and 76.6% in the auricular muscles of the head. The easiest recovery was in the lip, 8.9% of PIT were located in the hide and 91.1% in the head. Recovery time was affected (P < 0.05) by position: the quickest was lip (27 +/- 2 s), followed by ear (52 +/- 5 s) and armpit (78 +/- 7 s). In conclusion, taking into account retention and reading performances, injection of a 32-mm PIT into the armpit showed the best results on the farm, but a careful and longer recovery was needed in the abattoir. Improvement of recovery methodology and time would be necessary in order to recommend injection of PIT in the armpit instead of in the ear for cattle tracking or monitoring. 3abeef cattle 3acalves 3atransponders 3asubcutaneous injection 3aears 3alips 3abody regions 3adetection 3aslaughterhouses 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimal Identification Systemsxmethodsxveterinary. 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aInjectionsxinstrumentationxmethodsxveterinary. 0arecovery 0alosses 0aidentification 0aear scutellum 0aarmpit 0aupper lip1 aCaja, G.1 aNehring, R.1 aRibo, O.0 tJournal of animal science.g2000 Dec., v. 78, no. 12 p.3001-3009x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a20010301b20010313c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle04288naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100001700162245016300179300002000342520237500362650001102737650001602748650002102764650002102785650001802806650001802824650001402842650001902856650002302875650002702898650001802925650002202943650007702965650003903042650003703081650001203118650001103130650001803141650003303159650001103192650002803203650003703231650002703268650004103295650002603336653001603362653001703378700001703395773009903412852000903511856008403520930003303604945001303637946001303650990002303663655001203686IND2057348620221119021019.0970529e19950922mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205734862DNAL7 a76732142pmid7 a10.1074/jbc.270.38.223142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoriyama, Y.10aVesicular L-glutamate transporter in microvesicles from bovine pineal glands. Driving force, mechanism of chloride anion activation, and substrate specificity  ap. 22314-22320.  aPinealocytes, endocrine cells that synthesize and secrete melatonin, possess a large number of synaptic-like microvesicles (MVs) containing the L-glutamate transporter (Moriyama, Y., and Yamamoto, A. (1995) FEBS Lett., 367, 233-236). In this study, the L-glutamate transporter in MVs isolated from bovine pineal glands was characterized as to its driving force, requirement of anions, and substrate specificity. Upon the addition of ATP, the MVs accumulated L-glutamate. The uptake was significantly dependent on the extravesicular Cl- concentration, being negligible in the absence of Cl- and maximum at 2-5 mM and decreasing gradually at 20-100 mM. The membrane potential (inside positive) was maximum at 0-10 mM Cl- and then decreased gradually depending on the Cl- concentration, whereas a pH gradient was practically absent without Cl- and increased gradually up to 100 mM Cl-. Ammonium acetate or nigericin plus K+, a dissipator of a pH gradient, had little effect on or was slightly stimulatory toward the uptake, whereas valinomycin plus K+ inhibited both formation of the membrane potential and the glutamate uptake to similar extents. The ATP- and Cl--dependent glutamate uptake was inhibited by fluoride, iodide, or thiocyanate, without vacuolar H+-ATPase being affected. An anion channel blocker, 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2' disulfonic acid, similarly inhibited the glutamate uptake in a Cl- protectable manner. Furthermore, ATP- and glutamate-dependent acidification of MVs was observed when 4 mM Cl- was present. Among more than 50 kinds of glutamate analogues tested, only a few compounds, including 1-aminocyclohexane-trans-1,3-dicarboxylic acid, caused similar acidification. A good correlation was observed between the acidification and the inhibition of glutamate uptake by glutamate analogues. These results indicated that 1) the major driving force of the glutamate uptake is the membrane potential, 2) Cl- regulates the glutamate uptake, probably via anion-binding site(s) on the transporter, and 3) the transporter shows strict substrate specificity. Hence, the overall properties of the vesicular glutamate transporter in the MVs well matched those of the synaptic vesicle glutamate transporter. We concluded that the vesicular glutamate transporter, being similar if not identical to the neuronal counterpart, operates in endocrine cells. 3acattle 3apineal body 3abinding proteins 3aactive transport 3aglutamic acid 3aion transport 3achlorides 3acell membranes 3amembrane potential 3aamino acid derivatives 3ahydrogen ions 3amembrane proteins 2aATP-Binding Cassette Transportersxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aAmino Acid Transport System X-AG 2aAnimals 2aAnions 2aBinding Sites 2aBiological Transport, Active 2aCattle 2aChloridesxpharmacology 2aCytoplasmic Granulesxmetabolism 2aGlutamatesxmetabolism 2aPineal Glandxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSubstrate Specificity 0astimulation 0apinealocytes1 aYamamoto, A.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1995 Sept. 22, v. 270, no. 38 p.22314-22320x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.270.38.223143Available from publisher's Web site  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01377naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001900138245006800157300001600225520060100241651001200842700001800854700001900872773008700891852000900978856007800987939003301065946001301098655001201111IND8302274720221119020812.0830307e198210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND830227472DNAL7 a10.1007/BF028626952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xianjie,10aQualitative evaluation of fuelwood in Florida--a summary report  ap. 381-388.  aThis report summarizes qualitative information on 5 potential Florida fuelwood species: slash pine, sand pine, melaleuca, eucalypt, and casuarina.

With holo-CRBP as substrate in the absence of apo-CRBP microsomal retinol dehydrogenases have the higher specific activity and capacity to generate retinal used for RA synthesis by cytosolic retinal dehydrogenases. In the presence of apo-CRBP, a potent inhibitor of cytosolic retinol dehydrogenases (IC50 = approximately 1 micromolar), liver microsomes provide 93% of the total retinal synthesized in a combination of microsomes and cytosol. Cytosolic retinol dehydrogenases) and the isozymes of alcohol dehydrogenase expressed in rat liver had distinct enzymatic properties; yet ethanol inhibited cytosolic retinol dehydrogenase(s) (IC50 = 20 micromolar) while stimulating RA synthesis in a combination of microsomes and cytosol. At least two discrete forms of cytosolic retinol dehydrogenase were observed: NAD- and NADP-dependent forms. Multiple retinal dehydrogenases also were observed and were inhibited partially by apo-CRBP. These results provide new insights into pathways of RA biogenesis and provide further evidence that they consist of multiple enzymes that recognize both liganded and nonliganded states of CRBP. 3avitamin A 3abinding proteins 3aretinoic acid 3abiosynthesis 3aoxidoreductases 3acytosol 3amicrosomes 3arats 2aAlcohol Oxidoreductasesxmetabolism 2aAldehyde Oxidoreductasesxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aApoproteinsxmetabolism 2aCytosolxmetabolism 2aIsoenzymesxmetabolism 2aKidneyxmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aLungxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMicrosomesxmetabolism 2aMicrosomes, Liverxmetabolism 2aOrgan Specificity 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aRetinal Dehydrogenase 2aRetinol-Binding Proteinsxmetabolism 2aRetinol-Binding Proteins, Cellular 2aTestisxmetabolism 2aTime Factors 2aTretinoinxmetabolism1 aNapoli, J.L.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1996 Mar. 8, v. 271, no. 10 p.5610-5616x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.271.10.56103Available from publisher's Web site  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03308naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100003100141245016700172300001800339520186700357650002402224650002802248650003102276650001302307650000902320650000902329650001502338650000802353650002302361650001802384650002502402650001702427650001802444650001802462651001802480653001602498653002802514700001502542700001602557700001402573773009002587852000902677856008102686930003302767945001302800946001302813655001202826IND2198647620221119020828.0990511e199812  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219864762DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/91.6.13202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSweeney, Judith Hennemuth.10aEffect of mulches on persistence of entomopathogenic nematodes (Steinernema spp.) and infection of Strobilomyia neanthrana (Diptera: Anthomyiidae) in field trials  ap. 1320-1330.  aThe effect of mulches on the persistence of entomopathogenic nematodes. Steinernema spp., for infecting larvae of the spruce cone maggot, Strobilomyia neanyhracina Michelsen, was tested in a series of field trials conducted in New Brunswick, Canada. Peat mulch increased the percentage of maggots infected with Steinernema feltiae strain 27 (=bibionis) (Filipjev) strain 27, S. feltiae Umea and Steinernema carpocapsae (Weiser) All strain, when maggots were placed on nematode-treated soil beneath the peat layer. However, when maggots were placed on the surface of the peat (to simulate larvae dropping) in a subsequent experiment, the percentage of maggots infected by S. feltiae strain 27 was less than half of that for maggots placed beneath the peat. Significantly fewer maggots were infected in peat than in either sand or potting soil in a laboratory experiment. Mean percentage of maggots infected by S. feltiae strain 27 over a 21-d period after application was not increased by retaining a natural vegetative cover, or by mulching with hay, wood-bark chips, or bark. Bark mulch, however, did reduce the rate of decline in percentage of infection over time. The numbers of S. feltiae infective juveniles present in the soil from 0 to 3 wk after application were estimated in 2 field trials by repeated baiting with greater wax moth larvae. Numbers of infective juveniles per gram of soil were positively related to percentage of cone maggots infected in 1 of 2 yr, but were not significantly affected by mulching. Mulching with hay, bark, or wood-bark resulted in significantly lower soil moisture potentials compared with nonmulched treatments. The results suggest that the mulches tested in this study would not maintain adequate efficacy or persistence of S. feltiae strain 27 for suppression of cone maggot over the 2- to 4-wk period of larval drop. 3aSteinernema feltiae 3aSteinernema carpocapsae 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3amulching 3apeat 3abark 3awood chips 3ahay 3apopulation density 3aorchard soils 3asoil water potential 3aPicea glauca 3aPicea mariana 3apathogenicity 3aNew Brunswick 0apersistence 0astrobilomyia anthracina1 aGesner, G.1 aBennett, R.1 aVrain, T.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1998 Dec., v. 91, no. 6 p.1320-1330x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/91.6.13203Available from publisher's Web site  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02508naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001700141245015100158300001800309520122300327650001901550650001501569650002601584650001801610650001101628650001201639650002701651650001201678650001701690650002201707650001201729700001801741700001801759700002501777700002401802700001601826700002501842773007301867852000901940856008101949939003302030946001102063655001202074IND4460793320221119021211.0110805e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446079332DNAL7 a10.1093/glycob/cwr0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPult, Frauke10aRobust post-translocational N-glycosylation at the extreme C-terminus of membrane and secreted proteins in Xenopus laevis oocytes and HEK293 cells  ap. 1147-1160.  aN-Glycosylation is normally a co-translational process that occurs as soon as a nascent and unfolded polypeptide chain has emerged ~12 residues into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here, we describe the efficient utilization of an N-glycosylation site engineered within the luminal extreme C-terminal residues of distinct integral membrane glycoproteins, a native ER resident protein and an engineered secreted protein. This N-glycan addition required that the acceptor asparagine within an Asn-Trp-Ser sequon be located at least four residues away from the C-terminus of the polypeptide and, in the case of membrane proteins, at least 13 residues away from the lumenal side of the transmembrane segment. Pulse-chase assays revealed that the natural N-glycans of the proteins studied were attached co-translationally, whereas C-terminal N-glycosylation occurred post-translocationally within a time frame of hours in Xenopus laevis oocytes and minutes in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. In oocyte and HEK cell expression systems, affinity tag-driven C-terminal N-glycosylation may facilitate the determination of orientation of the C-terminal tail of membrane proteins relative to the membrane. 3aXenopus laevis 3aasparagine 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aglycosylation 3ahumans 3akidneys 3amembrane glycoproteins 3aoocytes 3apolypeptides 3aprotein secretion 3asequons1 aFallah, Ghada1 aBraam, Ursula1 aDetro-Dassen, Silvia1 aNiculescu, Cristina1 aLaube, Bodo1 aSchmalzing, Günther0 tGlycobiology.g2011 Sept., v. 21, no. 9 p.1147-1160x0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwr0133Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110805  aNon-US 7aarticle03201naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100001800162245007600180300002000256500001500276520162800291650002201919650001401941650002601955650002501981650001802006650002502024650001802049650006002067650002402127650001802151650002302169650003402192650001802226650002802244650002102272653001202293653001902305653003802324653002802362700002002390773009802410852000902508856008402517930003302601945001302634946001302647990002302660655001202683IND2057377420221119021157.0970530e19950714mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205737742DNAL7 a76225122pmid7 a10.1074/jbc.270.28.169392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTipping, A.J.10aCloning and molecular analysis of the pea seedling copper amine oxidase  ap. 16939-16946.  a2019-12-04  aA pea seedling amine oxidase cDNA has been isolated and sequenced. A single long open reading frame has amino acid sequences corresponding to those determined from active site peptide (Janes, S. M., Palcic, M. M., Scaman, C. H., Smith, A. J., Brown, D. E., Dooley, D. M., Mure M., and Klinman, J. P. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 12147-12154) and N-terminal sequencing experiments. The latter reveals the protein to have a 25-amino acid leader sequence with characteristics of a secretion signal peptide as expected for this extracellular enzyme. Comparisons of the amino acid sequence of the mature pea enzyme (649 amino acids) with that of the mature lentil enzyme (569 amino acids; Rossi, A., Petruzzelli, R, and Finazzi-Agro, A. (1992) FEBS Lett. 301, 253-257) reveal important and unexpected differences particularly with regard to protein length. Sequencing of part of the lentil gene identified several frameshift differences within the coding region resulting in a mature lentil protein of exactly the same length, 649 amino acids, as the pea enzyme. Multiple alignments of 10 copper amine oxidase sequences reveal 33 completely conserved residues of which 10 are found within 41 aligned residues at the C-terminal tails, the region missing from the original lentil sequence. One of only four conserved histidines is found in this region and may represent the third ligand to the copper. The pea enzyme contains around 3-4% carbohydrate as judged by deglycosylation experiments. We have also demonstrated by hybridization analysis that copper amine oxidase genes are present in a range of mono- and dicotyledonous plants. 3acomplementary DNA 3aseedlings 3aprimary-amine oxidase 3aamino acid sequences 3abinding sites 3anucleotide sequences 3aPisum sativum 2aAmine Oxidase (Copper-Containing)xchemistryxgenetics. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxchemistry 2aGlycosylation 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeasxenzymology 0acloning 0agenbank/l39931 0aamine oxidase (copper-containing) 0amolecular sequence data1 aMcPherson, M.J.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1995 July 14, v. 270, no. 28 p.16939-16946x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.270.28.169393Available from publisher's Web site  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03683naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100001300144245029300157300002000450500001500470520180500485650002502290650002702315650001802342650002202360650002102382650004702403650002502450650002002475650001202495650001002507650002102517650001202538650002102550650002302571650002102594653001902615653001402634653001102648653002802659653002302687653001902710653002502729653003002754700001702784700001302801700001802814773009802832852000902930856008402939930003303023945001303056946001303069990002303082655001203105IND2057429620221119020709.0970602e19950811mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205742962DNAL7 a10.1074/jbc.270.32.190932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbel, S.10aACS4, a primary indoleacetic acid-responsive gene encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase in Arabidopsis thaliana.

The enzyme is encoded by a divergent multigene family in Arabidopsis thaliana, comprising at least five genes, ACS1-5 (Liang, X., Abel, S., Keller, J. A., Shen, N. F., and Theologis, A. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 11046-11050). In etiolated seedlings, ACS4 is specifically induced by indoleacetic acid (IAA). The response to IAA is rapid (within 25 min) and insensitive to protein synthesis inhibition, suggesting that the ACS4 gene expression is a primary response to IAA. The ACS4 mRNA accumulation displays a biphasic dose-response curve which is optimal at 10 micromolar of IAA. However, LAA concentrations as low as 100 nM are sufficient to enhance the basal level of ACS4 mRNA. The expression of ACS4 is defective in the Arabidopsis auxin-resistant mutant lines axr1-12, axr2-1, and aux1-7. ACS4 mRNA levels are severely reduced in axr1-12 and axr2-1 but are only 1.5-fold lower in aux1-7. IAA inducibility is abolished in axr2-1. The ACS4 gene was isolated and structurally characterized. The promoter contains four sequence motifs reminiscent of functionally defined auxin-responsive cis-elements in the early auxin-inducible genes PSIAA4/5 from pea and GH3 from soybean. Conceptual translation of the coding region predicts a protein with a molecular mass of 53,795 Da and a theoretical isoelectric point of 8.2. The ACS4 polypeptide contains the 11 invariant amino acid residues conserved between aminotransferases and ACC syntheses from various plant species. An ACS4 cDNA was generated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and the authenticity was confirmed by expression of ACC synthase activity in Escherichia coli. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3agenetic transformation 3amessenger RNA 3acomplementary DNA 3astructural genes 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3amutants 3aexons 3amultigene family 3aintrons 3apromoter regions 3aindole acetic acid 3aEscherichia coli 0agenbank/u23481 0aacs4 gene 0alyases 0amolecular sequence data 0agenetic regulation 0agenbank/u23482 0anucleotide sequences 0aauxin responsive elements1 aNguyen, M.D.1 aChow, W.1 aTheologis, A.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1995 Aug. 11, v. 270, no. 32 p.19093-19099x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.270.32.190933Available from publisher's Web site  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02424naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001300141245010100154300001800255500001500273520121500288650001701503650001601520650001401536650001601550650001401566650002301580650002601603650002101629650002401650650002101674650002001695653002001715700001201735700001601747773009001763852000901853856008101862930003301943945001301976946001301989655001202002IND2198648420221119021115.0990511e199812  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219864842DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/91.6.13602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Q.10aReproductive potential and daily reproductive rhythms of Oemona hirta (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae)  ap. 1360-1365.  a2019-12-04  aReproductive potential and daily reproductive rhythms of the tree borer Oemona hirta (F.) were studied in the laboratory. Mean premating periods between emergence from hosts and mating were 3.3 +/- 1.9 d (mean +/- SD). Preoviposition period averaged 6.1 +/- 3.4 d. On average, each female laid 51.3 +/- 44.8 eggs and 31.0 +/- 20.6 eggs remained in her body upon death. The mean oviposition period was 17.7 +/- 9.3 d. Egg hatch rate was 59.5 +/- 19.4%. Mean incubation period of eggs was 8.9 +/- 1.9 d. Fecundity and longevity were significantly greater in larger females than in smaller ones. Adults were active mainly during scotophase with 66.7% of pair bonds, 72.9% of matings, 97.5% of ovipositions, and 82.2% of feedings taking place during this period. Immediately after scotophase began, feeding activity started and then quickly reached the peak between 2 and 3 h into scotophase. Reproductive activities, including pair bonding, mating, and oviposition occurred later than feeding and reached peaks between 4 and 8 h into scotophase when feeding activity decreased to minimum. Reproductive activities were significantly correlated with 1 another but not significantly correlated with feeding activity. 3aCerambycidae 3aoviposition 3alongevity 3abody weight 3afecundity 3abiological rhythms 3areproductive behavior 3adiurnal activity 3asexual reproduction 3afeeding behavior 3amating behavior 0asexual behavior1 aShi, G.1 aDavis, L.K.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1998 Dec., v. 91, no. 6 p.1360-1365x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/91.6.13603Available from publisher's Web site  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03490naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100001200162245010200174300002000276500001500296520139700311650001601708650002201724650001301746650002701759650002101786650002501807650002501832650002801857650003901885650002401924650001201948650001801960650002601978650002302004650002302027650002402050650005302074650002502127650002802152650004402180650001902224650002002243650002002263650003402283650003802317653001902355653002902374653002802403653001902431653001402450700001602464700001502480700001802495700001902513773009702532852000902629856008402638930003302722945001302755946001302768990002302781655001202804IND2057360120221119021036.0970529e19961004mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205736012DNAL7 a87987872pmid7 a10.1074/jbc.271.40.250412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIto, T.10aATP-facilitated chromatin assembly with a nucleoplasmin-like protein from Drosophila melanogaster  ap. 25041-25048.  a2019-12-04  aTo gain a better understanding of the factors that can mediate chromatin assembly, we have purified and cloned a core histone-binding protein from Drosophila melanogaster embryos. This protein resembles Xenopus laevis nucleoplasmin, and it has therefore been termed dNLP, for Drosophila nucleoplasmin-like protein. dNLP is a nuclear protein that is present throughout development. Both purified native and recombinant dNLP bind to core histones and can function in the assembly of approximately regularly spaced nucleosomal arrays in a reaction that additionally requires DNA, purified core histones, ATP, and a partially purified fraction (containing at least one other assembly activity). We also analyzed the properties of an N-terminally truncated version of dNLP, termed dNLP-S, and found that the deletion of the N-terminal 31 residues of dNLP results in a loss of the specificity of the interaction of dNLP with core histones. We then compared the abilities of dNLP and Drosophila nucleosome assembly protein-1 (dNAP-1) to promote the decondensation of Xenopus sperm chromatin, a process that can be mediated by nucleoplasmin. We observed that dNAP-1, but not dNLP, was able to promote the decondensation of sperm chromatin. These and other data collectively suggest that dNLP may participate in parallel with other histone-binding proteins such as dNAP-1 in the assembly of chromatin. 3anucleosomes 3acomplementary DNA 3ahistones 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abinding proteins 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotide sequences 3aDrosophila melanogaster 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aChromatinxmetabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementary 2aDrosophila Proteins 2aDrosophila melanogasterxembryologyxmetabolism. 2aHistonesxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNuclear Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aNucleoplasmins 2aPhosphoproteins 2aProtein Binding 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSubcellular Fractionsxmetabolism 0agenbank/u59497 0ahistone binding proteins 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u59498 0achromatin1 aTyler, J.K.1 aBulger, M.1 aKobayashi, R.1 aKadonaga, J.T.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1996 Oct. 4, v. 271, no. 40 p.25041-25048x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.271.40.250413Available from publisher's Web site  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03729naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100001300162245011700175300002000292520141000312650001601722650001601738650002901754650002901783650002501812650002601837650001401863650002201877650002401899650001301923650003101936650002501967650001501992650001202007650001102019650002902030650003402059650001402093650001202107650002502119650001402144650003102158650003802189650005202227650005002279650001102329650001302340650000902353650003602362650003602398650004802434650003102482650004102513650001702554650002602571653001202597653001502609653003002624700001602654700001202670700001602682773009802698852000902796856008402805930003302889945001302922946001302935990002302948655001202971IND2057361920221119021147.0970529e19950825mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205736192DNAL7 a76500172pmid7 a10.1074/jbc.270.34.199982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong, C.10aAndrogen receptor antagonist versus agonist activities of the fungicide vinclozolin relative to hydroxyflutamide  ap. 19998-20003.  aThe mechanism of antiandrogenic activity of vinclozolin (3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-5-methyl-5-vinyloxazolidine-2,4-dion e), a dicarboximide fungicide under investigation for its potential adverse effects on human male reproduction, was investigated using recombinant human androgen receptor (AR). The two primary metabolites of vinclozolin in plants and mammals are M1 (2-[[3,5-dichlorophenyl)-carbamoyl]oxy]-2-methyl-3-butenoic acid) and M2 (3',5'-dichloro-2-hydroxy-2-methylbut-3-enanilide). Both metabolites, in a dose-dependent manner, target AR to the nucleus and inhibit androgen-induced transactivation mediated by the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter. M2 is a 50-fold more potent inhibitor than M1 and only 2-fold less than hydroxyflutamide. In the presence of dihydrotestosterone (50 nM), M2 (0.2-10 micromolar) inhibits androgen-induced AR binding to androgen response element DNA. In the absence of dihydrotestosterone, concentrations of 10 micromolar M2 or hydroxyflutamide promote AR binding to androgen response element DNA and activation of transcription. Agonist activities of M2 and hydroxyflutamide occur at 10-fold lower concentrations with the mutant AR (Thr877 to Ala) endogenous to LNCaP human prostate cancer cells. The results indicate that androgen antagonists can act as agonists, depending on ligand binding affinity, concentration, and the presence of competing natural ligands. 3avinclozolin 3ametabolites 3aorganofluorine compounds 3aorganochlorine compounds 3aDNA-binding proteins 3atranscription factors 3aandrogens 3ahormone receptors 3ahormone antagonists 3aagonists 3atranscriptional activation 3aregulatory sequences 3acell lines 3amonkeys 3ahumans 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAndrogen Receptor Antagonists 2aAndrogens 2aAnimals 2aBinding, Competitive 2aCell Line 2aDNAxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDihydrotestosteronexpharmacology 2aFlutamidexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aFungicides, Industrialxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aHumans 2aKinetics 2aMale 2aOxazolesxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aReceptors, Androgenxmetabolism 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReproductionxdrug effects 2aTranscription, Geneticxdrug effects 2aTransfection 2aTumor Cells, Cultured 0abinding 0ainhibition 0aandrogen response element1 aKelce, W.R.1 aSar, M.1 aWilson, Em.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1995 Aug. 25, v. 270, no. 34 p.19998-20003x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.270.34.199983Available from publisher's Web site  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03042naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100001600162245013800178300002000316520151400336650001601850650001501866650003201881650001801913650003801931650001201969650002601981650001402007650003002021650002802051650003202079650002502111650002702136653002102163653002602184700001702210700001902227700001602246700001302262773009802275852000902373856008402382930003302466945001302499946001302512990002302525655001202548IND2057361220221119021114.0970529e19950721mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205736122DNAL7 a76155372pmid7 a10.1074/jbc.270.29.173442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAltmann, F.10aInsect cells contain an unusual, membrane-bound beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase probably involved in the processing of protein N-glycans  ap. 17344-17349.  aThe beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity in the lepidopteran insect cell line Sf21 has been studied using pyridylaminated oligosaccharides and chromogenic synthetic glycosides as substrates. Ultracentrifugation experiments indicated that the insect cell beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase exists in a soluble and a membrane-bound form. This latter form accounted for two-thirds of the total activity and was associated with vesicles of the same density as those containing GlcNAc-transferase I. Partial membrane association of the enzyme was observed with all substrates tested, i.e. 4-nitrophenyl beta-N-acetylglucosaminide, tri-N-acetylchitotriose, and an N-linked biantennary agalactooligosaccharide. Inhibition studies indicated a single enzyme to be responsible for the hydrolysis of all these substrates. With the biantennary substrate, the beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase exclusively removed beta-N-acetylglucosamine from the alpha 1,3-antenna. GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc2, the primary product of GlcNAc-transferase I, was not perceptibly hydrolyzed. beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidases with the same branch specificity were also found in the lepidopteran cell lines Bm-N and Mb-0503. In contrast, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase activities from rat or frog (Xenopus laevis) liver and from mung bean seedlings were not membrane-bound, and they did not exhibit a strict branch specificity. An involvement of this unusual beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase in the processing of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides in insects is suggested. 3aLepidoptera 3acell lines 3abeta-N-acetylhexosaminidase 3aglycoproteins 2aAcetylglucosaminidasexphysiology 2aAnimals 2aCarbohydrate Sequence 2aCell Line 2aCell Membranexenzymology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolysaccharidesxmetabolism 2aProteinsxmetabolism 2aSpodopteraxenzymology 0acharacterization 0aprotein glycosylation1 aSchwihla, H.1 aStaudacher, E.1 aGlossal, J.1 aMarz, L.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1995 July 21, v. 270, no. 29 p.17344-17349x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.270.29.173443Available from publisher's Web site  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03624naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100001800162245016700180300002000347500001500367520135500382650002601737650002001763650002101783650000901804650001301813650002901826650002301855650002001878650002001898650002901918650002501947650001901972650001101991650002102002650001802023650001802041650004102059650001602100650003702116650003202153650004402185650003902229650002102268650002802289650003102317650002302348650003002371650003502401650003902436650003802475653002502513653002302538653001502561653003102576700001602607700001902623773009702642852000902739856008402748930003302832945001302865946001302878990002302891655001202914IND2057357320221119021040.0970529e19961004mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205735732DNAL7 a87987002pmid7 a10.1074/jbc.271.40.244252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmillet, J.M.10aCharacterization of an upstream activation sequence and two Rox1p-responsive sites controlling the induction of the yeast HEM13 gene by oxygen and heme deficiency  ap. 24425-24432.  a2019-12-04  aThe Saccharomyces cerevisiae HEM13 gene codes for coproporphyrinogen oxidase, an oxygen-requiring enzyme catalyzing the sixth step of heme biosynthesis. Its transcription has been shown to be induced 40-50-fold in response to oxygen or heme deficiency, in part through relief of repression exerted by Rox1p and in part by activation mediated by an upstream activation sequence (UAS). This report describes an analysis of HEM13 UAS and of the Rox1p-responsive sites by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, DNase I footprinting, and mutational mapping. HEM13 UAS is composed of two subelements: a 16-base pair sequence binding a constitutive factor acting as a transcriptional activator, and a 5'-flanking 20-base pair GC-rich region. Both subelements were required additively for transcription, but each element alone was sufficient for almost normal control by oxygen/heme deficiency. Mutations in both elements decreased the induction ratio 3-4-fold. HEM13 UAS conferred a 2-4-fold oxygen/heme control on a heterologous reporter gene. Two Rox1p-responsive sites, R1 and R3, were identified, which accounted for the 6-7-fold repression by Rox1p. A factor bound to a sequence close to site R3. This DNA-binding activity was only detected in protein extracts of aerobic heme-sufficient ROX1 TUP1 cells, suggesting a possible role in site R3 function. 3atranscription factors 3arecombinant DNA 3astructural genes 3aheme 3amutation 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abeta-galactosidase 3agene expression 3aoxidoreductases 3atranscription (genetics) 3aDNA-binding proteins 3areporter genes 3aoxygen 3apromoter regions 2aBase Sequence 2aBinding Sites 2aCoproporphyrinogen Oxidasexgenetics 2aDNA, Fungal 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxmetabolism 2aFungal Proteinsxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aHemexmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRepressor Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 0aregulatory sequences 0agenetic regulation 0adeficiency 0acoproporphyrinogen oxidase1 aBuisson, N.1 aLabbe-Bois, R.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1996 Oct. 4, v. 271, no. 40 p.24425-24432x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.271.40.244253Available from publisher's Web site  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02890naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100001900162245008500181300002000266520148500286650002901771650003101800650002001831650002001851650003201871650003301903650004001936650001501976650001101991650003202002650006002034650003402094650004102128700001502169773009702184852000902281856008402290930003302374945001302407946001302420990002302433655001202456IND2057357820221119021227.0970529e19961004mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205735782DNAL7 a87987102pmid7 a10.1074/jbc.271.40.244982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChambers, R.S.10aPurification and characterization of an RNA polymerase II phosphatase from yeast  ap. 24498-24504.  aRNA polymerase (RNAP) II is subject to extensive phosphorylation on the heptapeptide repeats of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit. An activity that is required for the dephosphorylation of yeast RNAP II in vitro has been purified from a yeast whole cell extract by > 30,000-fold. The yeast CTD phosphatase activity copurified with two bands with apparent molecular masses of 100 and 103 kDa. The properties of the yeast CTD phosphatase are similar to those of a previously characterized CTD phosphatase from HeLa cells. These properties include stimulation by the general transcription factor IIF (TFIIF), competitive inhibition by RNAP II, magnesium dependence, and resistance to okadaic acid. Both the HeLa and yeast CTD phosphatases are highly specific for their cognate polymerases. Neither phosphatase functions upon the polymerase molecule from the other species, even though the heptapeptide repeats of the CTDs in yeast RNAP II and mammalian RNAP II are essentially identical. The activity of the highly purified CTD phosphatase is stimulated > 300-fold by a partially purified fraction of TFIIF. Recombinant TFIIF did not substitute for the TFIIF fraction, indicating that an additional factor present in the TFIIF fraction is required for CTD phosphatase activity. These results show that yeast contains a CTD phosphatase activity similar to that of mammalian cells that is likely composed of at least two components, one of which is 100 and/or 103 kDa. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aphosphoprotein phosphatase 3aenzyme activity 3aphosphorylation 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 2aChromatography, Ion Exchange 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aHeLa Cells 2aHumans 2aPhosphoprotein Phosphatases 2aPhosphoric Monoester Hydrolasesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aRNA Polymerase IIxmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymology1 aKane, C.M.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1996 Oct. 4, v. 271, no. 40 p.24498-24504x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.271.40.244983Available from publisher's Web site  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03641naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001300184245012100197300001800318506007600336520161100412506003702023650000802060650002202068650002302090650001102113650001302124650001702137650001002154650001302164650001102177650001902188650000902207650001202216650002702228650001102255650001602266650001402282650001702296650001402313650001202327650002102339650001402360700003102374700001402405700002002419700001702439700001902456700001302475700001402488700001502502700001702517700002102534700001802555700002002573700002102593700001802614773017302632852000902805856008302814939003302897946001302930655001202943IND4460776220221207063918.0110805e20110802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446077622DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11022611082doi7 aPMC31509482pmcid7 a216903822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jian10aLinkage maps from multiple genetic crosses and loci linked to growth-related virulent phenotype in Plasmodium yoelii  ap. E374-E382.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPlasmodium yoelii is an excellent model for studying malaria pathogenesis that is often intractable to investigate using human parasites; however, genetic studies of the parasite have been hindered by lack of genome-wide linkage resources. Here, we performed 14 genetic crosses between three pairs of P. yoelii clones/subspecies, isolated 75 independent recombinant progeny from the crosses, and constructed a high-resolution linkage map for this parasite. Microsatellite genotypes from the progeny formed 14 linkage groups belonging to the 14 parasite chromosomes, allowing assignment of sequence contigs to chromosomes. Growth-related virulent phenotypes from 25 progeny of one of the crosses were significantly associated with a major locus on chromosome 13 and with two secondary loci on chromosomes 7 and 10. The chromosome 10 and 13 loci are both linked to day 5 parasitemia, and their effects on parasite growth rate are independent but additive. The locus on chromosome 7 is associated with day 10 parasitemia. The chromosome 13 locus spans ~220 kb of DNA containing 51 predicted genes, including the P. yoelii erythrocyte binding ligand, in which a C741Y substitution in the R6 domain is implicated in the change of growth rate. Similarly, the chromosome 10 locus spans ~234 kb with 71 candidate genes, containing a member of the 235-kDa rhoptry proteins (Py235) that can bind to the erythrocyte surface membrane. Atypical virulent phenotypes among the progeny were also observed. This study provides critical tools and information for genetic investigations of virulence and biology of P. yoelii.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aPlasmodium yoelii 3achromosome mapping 3aclones 3acrossing 3aerythrocytes 3agenes 3agenotype 3ahumans 3alinkage groups 3aloci 3amalaria 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amodels 3aparasitemia 3aparasites 3apathogenesis 3aphenotype 3aprogeny 3arhoptry proteins 3avirulence1 aPattaradilokrat, Sittiporn1 aZhu, Feng1 aJiang, Hongying1 aLiu, Shengfa1 aHong, Lingxian1 aFu, Yong1 aKoo, Lily1 aXu, Wenyue1 aPan, Weiqing1 aCarlton, Jane M.1 aKaneko, Osamu1 aCarter, Richard1 aWootton, John C.1 aSu, Xin-zhuan0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Aug. 2, v. 108, no. 31 p.E374-E382dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11022611083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110805  aOther US 7aarticle02927naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100002000140245013100160300001600291520160200307650000901909650002401918650003001942650002601972650002301998650001102021650001402032650002702046650001902073650001802092650002102110650002602131653002002157653001302177653002002190700001902210700001602229773008802245852000902333856008002342930003302422945001302455946001302468655001202481IND2180453120221119020812.0981014e199802  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218045312DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/91.1.2802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSubramanyam, B.10aEffectiveness of Insecto applied to shelled maize against stored-product insect larvae.

Mortality and adult emergence of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst); sawtoothed grain beetle, Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.); and Indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hubner), exposed as 1st instars to shelled maize. Zea mays L., treated with different rates of Insecto were evaluated in the laboratory. For each species, mortality of 1st instars increased with Insecto rate. All 1st instars of T. castaneum were killed at 0.5 and 1 g/kg rates of Insecto; at these rates, mortality of O. surinamensis and P. interpunctella 1st instars was 96-97 and 86-97%, respectively. The percentage of adults of the 3 species emerging from 1st instars exposed to treated maize was related inversely to Insecto rate. Complete suppression in emergence of T. castaneum and P. interpunctella adults was achieved at 1 g/kg; at this rate, suppression in emergence of O. surinamensis adults was 98%. Emergence of P. interpunctella adults from 1st, 3rd, and 5th instars exposed to Insecto-treated maize indicated that 1st and 3rd instars of P. interpunctella were more susceptible than 5th instars to Insecto. At 0.5 and 1 g/kg of Insecto, suppression in emergence of P. interpunctella adults from exposed 1st, 3rd, and 5th instars was 99-100, 73-92, and 6-37%, respectively. A 2-parameter negative exponential regression model best described the relationship between mean adult emergence and Insecto rate for the species and instars tested. 3acorn 3aTribolium castaneum 3aOryzaephilus surinamensis 3aPlodia interpunctella 3adiatomaceous earth 3alarvae 3amortality 3abiological development 3ainsect control 3astorage pests 3aapplication rate 3abiological resistance 0aage differences 0aefficacy 0aadult emergence1 aMadamanchi, N.1 aNorwood, S.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1998 Feb., v. 91, no. 1 p.280-286x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/91.1.2803Available from publisher's Web site  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02242naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001900140245009300159300001600252520103300268650002301301650002301324650001001347650001401357650002701371650001401398650001901412650001601431650001601447653001001463653001101473653001601484653002001500700001501520700002001535700001701555773008801572852000901660856008001669930003301749945001301782946001301795655001201808IND2180461420221119020933.0981014e199802  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218046142DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/91.1.2932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYokoyama, V.Y.10aLaboratory infestation of cotton bolls by Mediterranean fruit fly (Diptera: Tephritidae)  ap. 293-296.  aAdults of laboratory-reared Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann), laid eggs, and mature larvae developed in green intact bolls of cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., in laboratory cage tests.

One reason for this incompatibility is the lack of a common exchange market for forages and their on-farm production as a nutrient source for livestock or dairy production. Least-cost rationing (based on linear programming techniques), however, provides a method of estimating the utility of forages within a multi-feed ration to provide a representative monetary value for use in calculating feed-value economic-injury levels. Because animals differ in their ability to physiologically utilize forages as feed, specific economic-injury levels can be determined for specialized dairy or livestock production circumstances. Least-cost rations were calculated using data for feed nutrition and animal requirements based on representative production goals for dairy cows (3 types), beef cows and steers, sheep, and horses. The objective was to determine the relative value of alfalfa to the total feed ration for each animal class and thereby design a production-specific forage pest management system. Least-cost rations selected from 6 possible feed choices determined the feed-value of alfalfa grown on-farm, and these data were used to calculate economic-injury levels for potato leafhopper, Empoasca fabae (Harris), for each animal production system. Results demonstrate that horse and sheep production have the lowest economic-injury levels, whereas beef steers have the highest. The magnitude of difference was 129%, with dairy- and beef-producing cows having intermediate levels. The magnitude of difference in the economic-injury levels among animal types clearly demonstrates the need to refine forage economic-injury levels based on the utility of the crop to the final feed-value to the animal consumer. Least-cost rationing provides one way of accomplishing this refinement. 3aMedicago sativa 3aEmpoasca fabae 3acrop quality 3anutritive value 3aanimal production 3adairy cows 3abeef cattle 3ahorses 3asheep 3afeed rations 3acost analysis 3aeconomic threshold 0aleast cost rations1 aPedigo, L.P.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1998 Apr., v. 91, no. 2 p.347-351x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/91.2.3473Available from publisher's Web site  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03323naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002000144245008800164300001400252500001500266520178800281650002702069650001702096650000902113650001502122650002402137650002002161650000902181650001802190650001102208650001702219650002402236650001702260650001402277650001602291650001702307650000902324651001002333653002202343653002402365653002002389653002502409700002202434700001902456773010002475852000902575856009302584930003302677945002502710946001102735990002302746655001202769IND4424471320221119020726.0090814e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442447132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aNgure, Joyce W.10aInteractive effects of packaging and storage temperatures on the shelf-life of okra  ap. 44-49.  a2019-12-04  aA study aimed at evaluating the potential benefits of pre-packaging and storage temperature in extending the shelf life of okra was conducted at Egerton University Horticulture Field and Biotechnology Laboratory. Okra pods were subjected to different combination of packaging and storage temperature. Three levels of packaging were used consisting of perforated (punched) polyfilm bags, non-perforated polyfilm bags (0.03mm thickness) and unpackaged to modifying the storage atmosphere. Pods weighing 100g were put in the various packages and the unpackaged pods were placed on flat cartons. Four levels of storage temperature, 4oC, 8.5oC, 13oC and room temperature storage were used for storing okra pods. The temperatures of 4oC, 8.5oC and 13oC were attained in refrigerators while room temperature was obtained by placing the pods on tables in the open. Pods stored at 4oC were unmarketable 21 days after storage as they were frozen and had the highest electrolyte leakage due to high chilling injury. All unpackaged okra pods stored at all temperatures were also not marketable by day 21 of storage as they were dry and shriveled. These pods had the greatest weight loss (79%) at 13oC compared to weight loss of less than 30% observed in the pods stored at the same temperature (13oC) but kept in perforated packages. The best marketable pods that were not frozen and had the least off odour were those kept at 13oC storage temperature treatment in non perforated and perforated packaging. Blackening was inhibited under these storage conditions resulting in the best visual appearance of okra pods. It is possible that pod discoloration was controlled by atmosphere modification provided by packaging thus resulting in enhanced quality and marketability of the pods for 21 days. 3aAbelmoschus esculentus 3aplastic film 3aokra 3ashelf life 3apackaging materials 3achilling injury 3abags 3adiscoloration 3aweight 3agas exchange 3astorage temperature 3afood quality 3aoff odors 3adegradation 3acold storage 3apods 3aKenya 0aventilation holes 0aelectrolyte leakage 0astorage quality 0aperforated packaging1 aAguyoh, Joseph N.1 aLiu, Gaoquiong0 tJournal of agricultural and biological science.g2009 May, v. 4, no. 3 p.44-49x1990-61457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.arpnjournals.com/jabs/volume_05_2009.htm3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090826b00000000c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/08/26  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03124naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178100002300187245013600210300001800346500002400364520114000388650002501528650002501553650001401578650001901592650001801611650001201629650002901641650002001670650002301690650002601713650001401739650001901753650002101772650002101793650003101814650001201845650002701857650002901884650002301913650003301936650001501969650002601984650002202010650003502032650004502067650001602112650004102128650003202169700001602201773009902217852000902316856009002325930003302415945002502448946001302473655001202486IND4425290420221119020727.0090828e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442529042DNAL7 a196046872pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2009.06.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aP1201 aChampagne, Pascale10aEnzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic municipal wastewater treatment process residuals as feedstocks for the recovery of simple sugars  ap. 5700-5706.  aIncludes references  aThis study examined the hydrolysis of lignocellulose extracted from municipal wastewater treatment process residuals for the purpose of investigating low-cost feedstocks for ethanol production, while providing an alternative solid waste management strategy. Primary and thickened waste activated sludges and anaerobically digested biosolids underwent various pre-treatments to enhance subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. Half of the pre-treated samples were dried and grinded, while the other half were used as is (wet). The wet primary sludge yielded the highest reducing sugar conversions. When wet primary sludge without pre-treatment was hydrolyzed at 40°C and an enzyme loading of 800U/g substrate, 31.1±2.7% was converted to reducing sugars in 24h. This increased to 54.2±4.0% when HCl and KOH pre-treatments were applied. FTIR analyses were used to examine differences in the sludge compositions. These indicated that the cellulose content in the primary sludge was higher than that of the thickened waste activated sludge and biosolids, which was consistent with the higher reducing sugar yields observed in the primary sludge. 3awastewater treatment 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3acellulose 3alignocellulose 3araw materials 3abiomass 3arenewable energy sources 3areducing sugars 3aethanol production 3amunicipal solid waste 3abiosolids 3aacid treatment 3aalkali treatment 3aactivated sludge 2aBioelectric Energy Sources 2aBiomass 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aCarbohydratesxchemistry 2aEthanolxchemistry 2aHydrochloric Acidxchemistry 2aHydrolysis 2aHydroxidesxchemistry 2aLigninxchemistry 2aPotassium Compoundsxchemistry 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 2aTemperature 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Purificationxmethods1 aLi, Caijian0 tBioresource technology.g2009 Dec., v. 100, no. 23 p.5700-5706dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.06.0513Available from publisher's Web site  a20091119b20091204c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/11/18  aOther US 7aarticle03225naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001700140245011100157300001600268520189900284650003002183650001902213650001702232650002202249650001902271650002302290650001602313650001602329650001502345650001902360650002602379651001302405653002402418653001702442653001602459700001802475700001902493700001902512773008802531852000902619856008002628930003302708945001302741946001302754655001202767IND2181219720221119020808.0981120e199804  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218121972DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/91.2.3762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDively, G.P.10aUse of imidacloprid-treated row mixtures for Colorado potato beetle (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) management  ap. 376-387.  aThe "high dose" strategy of applying imidacloprid as an "at-planting" soil treatment uniformly throughout a potato field may result in rapid pest adaptation, as it has for other systemic insecticides. Alternatively, treated and untreated plants in a field provide a refuge to pests so that some portion of the population is not subjected to selection. In 1993- and 1994-field experiments involving potato cultivars with contrasting maturity periods, plots of mixtures of imidacloprid-treated and untreated rows were compared with plots of untreated and 100% treated rows to determine their effects on the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say). First-generation populations and feeding injury were significantly reduced by mixtures of imidacloprid treated rows, when post-diapause adults were released along the edge of plots to simulate a typical colonization pattern. Densities of life stages and percentage defoliation decreased as the proportion of imidacloprid-treated rows increased. The effectiveness of imidacloprid was greater than the additive effect based on the proportional contribution of the treated rows. Beetle populations decreased as the distance increased inward from the outer rows, because invading beetles were increasingly suppressed as they encountered rows of imidacloprid-treated plants. This suggests that the treated rows at the edge of the field in a row mixture acted as a toxic barrier to colonizing beetles. Even when colonizing adults were introduced uniformly in row mixture plots, the treated rows trapped many dispersing adults and suppressed feeding injury on adjacent untreated rows. Mixtures of treated and untreated rows deployed alone or in combination with a perimeter treatment are discussed as ways to reduce the amount and cost of insecticide used, create refuges to minimize resistance development, and reduce environmental risks. 3aLeptinotarsa decemlineata 3aEmpoasca fabae 3aimidacloprid 3aSolanum tuberosum 3asoil treatment 3apopulation density 3acrop damage 3adefoliation 3acrop yield 3ainsect control 3aresistance management 3aMaryland 0amixed row treatment 0apest refuges 0atuber yield1 aFollett, P.A.1 aLinduska, J.J.1 aRoderick, G.K.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1998 Apr., v. 91, no. 2 p.376-387x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/91.2.3763Available from publisher's Web site  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03175naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178100001700187245008100204300001800285500002400303500001500327520122400342650001901566650002301585650001101608650001801619650002501637650002601662650002101688650002401709650001201733650002701745650001201772650001601784650002701800650003001827650003001857650001401887650001001901650003101911650002301942650001901965650001101984650001701995650002602012650003202038653002902070653001402099653001802113653002402131700002102155700001702176700001302193700001402206773009902220852000902319856009002328930003302418945002502451946001302476655001202489IND4425291420221119020814.0090828e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442529142DNAL7 a195596032pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2009.05.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP120 0aW0001 aConverti, A.10aBiogas production and valorization by means of a two-step biological process  ap. 5771-5776.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe scope of this research work was to investigate biogas production and purification by a two-step bench-scale biological system, consisting of fed-batch pulse-feeding anaerobic digestion of mixed sludge, followed by methane enrichment of biogas by the use of the cyanobacterium Arthrospira platensis. The composition of biogas was nearly constant, and methane and carbon dioxide percentages ranged between 70.5-76.0% and 13.2-19.5%, respectively. Biogas yield reached a maximum value (about 0.4m³ biogas/kgCODi) at 50days-retention time and then gradually decreased with a decrease in the retention time. Biogas CO₂ was then used as a carbon source for A. platensis cultivation either under batch or fed-batch conditions. The mean cell productivity of fed-batch cultivation was about 15% higher than that observed during the last batch phase (0.035±0.006gDM/L/d), likely due to the occurrence of some shading effect under batch growth conditions. The data of carbon dioxide removal from biogas revealed the existence of a linear relationship between the rates of A. platensis growth and carbon dioxide removal from biogas and allowed calculating carbon utilization efficiency for biomass production of almost 95%. 3acarbon dioxide 3amethane production 3abiogas 3asewage sludge 3awastewater treatment 3aArthrospira platensis 3amicrobial growth 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiomass 3achemical oxygen demand 2aBiomass 2aBioreactors 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aCarbon Dioxidexchemistry 2aCyanobacteriaxmetabolism 2aEukaryota 2aGases 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMethanexchemistry 2aPhotosynthesis 2aSewage 2aTime Factors 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid 2aWater Purificationxmethods 0arenewable energy sources 0abioenergy 0aCyanobacteria 0aSpirulina platensis1 aOliveira, R.P.S.1 aTorres, B.R.1 aLodi, A.1 aZilli, M.0 tBioresource technology.g2009 Dec., v. 100, no. 23 p.5771-5776dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.05.0723Available from publisher's Web site  a20091119b20091204c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/11/19  aOther US 7aarticle03015naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003000110040001800140100001800158245009900176300001600275520120000291650002201491650001301513650001301526650002701539650001401566650001501580650001001595650002201605650001901627650002301646650001501669650001101684650001001695650002001705650001201725650001101737650004201748650001301790650001101803650005001814650001901864650001701883650001401900650000901914650003501923650001901958650001301977650001401990650001002004651001102014653001202025700002402037700001602061700001502077700001302092773008802105852000902193856008002202930003302282945001302315946001302328655001202341IND2181223420221119020641.0981120e199804  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218122342DNAL7 a95896292pmid7 a10.1093/jee/91.2.4862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraverman, Y.10aControl experiments with yellow jacket wasps (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) injuring cattle in Israel  ap. 486-491.  aInjuries caused by the German yellowjacket Vespula germanica F. to dry and lactating dairy cows (Bos tourus) in 5 herds in Israel were monitored and adversely affected less than or equal to 65% of the cows. Elimination of large alternative protein sources (placentas, sewage containing milk from the milking parlor), and prebaiting with high-quality minced meat (or fish) in adequate numbers of baiting cages around the dairy farm for several days, are necessary for successful control. Significant control was achieved after a shorter period of time when the dairy farm was surrounded by a smaller area of uncultivated land than by a larger area. At some dairy farms there were significant differences among numbers of wasps visiting the various cage sites and significant variability between baiting days. Efficient and significant control was achieved by minced meat bait containing 1.5% acephate (orthene) and 2% microencapsulated diazinon (Antikan). Wasps were totally repelled by minced meat bait containing 2.25% of a plant-derived bioinsecticide derived from Meliaceae (Ag1000). The potential of using Ag 1000 for repelling yellowjackets from teats and udders of dairy cows is discussed. 3aVespula germanica 3aacephate 3adiazinon 3abotanical insecticides 3aMeliaceae 3acyromazine 3abaits 3ainsect repellents 3ainsect control 3apopulation density 3adairy cows 3audders 3ateats 3aanimal injuries 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxprevention & control 2aDiazinon 2aFemale 2aInsect Bites and Stingsxprevention & control 2aInsect Control 2aInsecticides 2aLactation 2aMeat 2aOrganothiophosphorus Compounds 2aPhosphoramides 2aTerpenes 2aTriazines 2aWasps 3aIsrael 0aag 10001 aChizov-Ginzburg, A.1 aYeruham, I.1 aKolsky, O.1 aSaran-a.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1998 Apr., v. 91, no. 2 p.486-491x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/91.2.4863Available from publisher's Web site  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02191naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001800140245014200158300001600300520108600316650001601402650001101418650002501429650002301454650001601477650001701493650001101510650001301521651001701534700001601551700001401567773008801581852000901669856008001678930003301758945001301791946001301804655001201817IND2181222620221119021241.0981120e199804  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218122262DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/91.2.4572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlogoza, P.A.10aSpatial distribution of Phyllophaga implicita (Horn) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) larvae in relation to distance from the adult food source  ap. 457-463.  aThe spatial distribution of the Phyllophaga implicita (Horn) larval population in relation to the distance from the adult food source was investigated. Commercial soybean fields with 1 of 4 different shelterbelt arrangements were sampled in the fall of 1993, 1994, and 1995 to assess P. implicita distribution and density. Larvae were found only in fields with bordering shelterbelts. Ninety percent or more of the specimens were collected within 55 m of the shelterbelts. Exponential models indicated a significant relationship between larval density and distance from the shelterbelts, with densities declining as distance increased. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess models for predicting the probability of finding larval infestations. A positive association between the probability of finding larvae and the distance from the shelterbelt was found. With P. implicita having a 3-yr life cycle, the 1993 season was the flight year for the largest of the 3 broods. Sampling guidelines based on higher densities of larvae nearer the shelterbelts are discussed. 3aPhyllophaga 3alarvae 3aspatial distribution 3apopulation density 3aGlycine max 3ashelterbelts 3amodels 3asampling 3aNorth Dakota1 aWeiss, M.J.1 aRao, M.B.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1998 Apr., v. 91, no. 2 p.457-463x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/91.2.4573Available from publisher's Web site  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02398naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002300141245018500164300001800349520107400367650000801441650002101449650002701470650001501497650002401512650003201536650001501568650002101583650002501604650001401629700002401643700002301667700002101690700002201711700001601733700002001749773007301769852000901842856008101851939003301932946001101965655001201976IND4460793120221119021118.0110805e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446079312DNAL7 a10.1093/glycob/cwr0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKenyon, Johanna J.14aThe genetics and structure of the O-specific polysaccharide of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis serotype O:10 and its relationship with Escherichia coli O111 and Salmonella enterica O35  ap. 1131-1139.  aThe O-specific polysaccharide (OPS) is a variable constituent of the lipopolysaccharide of Gram-negative bacteria. The polymorphic nature of OPSs within a species is usually first defined serologically, and the current serotyping scheme for Yersinia pseudotuberculosis consists of 21 O serotypes of which 15 have been characterized genetically and structurally. Here, we present the structure and DNA sequence of Y. pseudotuberculosis O:10 OPS. The O unit consists of one residue each of D-galactopyranose, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (2-amino-2-deoxy-D-galactopyranose) and D-glucopyranose in the backbone, with two colitose (3,6-dideoxy-L-xylo-hexopyranose) side-branch residues. This structure is very similar to that shared by Escherichia coli O111 and Salmonella enterica O35. The gene cluster sequences of these serotypes, however, have only low levels of similarity to that of Y. pseudotuberculosis O:10, although there is significant conservation of gene order. Within Y. pseudotuberculosis, the O10 structure is most closely related to the O:6 and O:7 structures. 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aO-antigens 3aSalmonella enterica 3aYersinia pseudotuberculosis 3agene order 3amultigene family 3anucleotide sequences 3aserotypes1 aDe Castro, Cristina1 aCunneen, Monica M.1 aReeves, Peter R.1 aMolinaro, Antonio1 aHolst, Otto1 aSkurnik, Mikael0 tGlycobiology.g2011 Sept., v. 21, no. 9 p.1131-1139x0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwr0063Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110805  aNon-US 7aarticle02998naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187072000900196072000900205100002300214245006100237300001800298500002400316500001500340520130000355650002501655650001101680650002501691650001901716650002901735650002401764650003201788650002401820650001401844650001701858650001201875650003901887650005501926650001601981650002201997650001102019653002902030653002302059653001402082700001702096700002602113773009902139852000902238856009002247930003302337945002502370946001302395655001202408IND4425298920221119020941.0090828e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442529892DNAL7 a192177722pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2008.12.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aL100 0aP120 0aJ500 0aD5001 aHolm-Nielsen, J.B.14aThe future of anaerobic digestion and biogas utilization  ap. 5478-5484.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aOne of the common tendencies of animal production activities in Europe and in developed countries in general is to intensify the animal production and to increase the size of the animal production units. High livestock density is always accompanied by production of a surplus of animal manure, representing a considerable pollution threat for the environment in these areas. Avoiding over-fertilization is not only important for environmental protection reasons but also for economical reasons. Intensive animal production areas need therefore suitable manure management, aiming to export and to redistribute the excess of nutrients from manure and to optimize their recycling. Anaerobic digestion of animal manure and slurries offers several benefits by improving their fertilizer qualities, reducing odors and pathogens and producing a renewable fuel - the biogas. The EU policies concerning renewable energy systems (RES) have set forward a fixed goal of supplying 20% of the European energy demands from RES by year 2020. A major part of the renewable energy will originate from European farming and forestry. At least 25% of all bioenergy in the future can originate from biogas, produced from wet organic materials such as: animal manure, whole crop silages, wet food and feed wastes, etc. 3alaws and regulations 3abiogas 3alivestock production 3aanimal manures 3aanimal manure management 3aanaerobic digestion 3aintensive livestock farming 3aorganic fertilizers 3arecycling 2aAnaerobiosis 2aAnimals 2aBioelectric Energy Sourcesxtrends 2aConservation of Energy Resourcesxmethodsxtrends. 2aFertilizers 2aGasesxmetabolism 2aManure 0arenewable energy sources 0aliterature reviews 0abioenergy1 aAl Seadi, T.1 aOleskowicz-Popiel, P.0 tBioresource technology.g2009 Nov., v. 100, no. 22 p.5478-5484dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2008.12.0463Available from publisher's Web site  a20091104b20091204c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/10/29  aOther US 7aarticle02303naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178100001300187245006200200300001800262500002400280500001500304520095700319650002501276650001801301650001901319650001501338650001201353650004701365650002101412650002901433650001501462651001101477651001101488653002901499700001401528700002201542773009901564852000901663856009001672930003301762945002501795946001301820655001201833IND4425299020221119021038.0090828e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442529902DNAL7 a191289632pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2008.10.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aL1001 aKunz, A.10aAdvanced swine manure treatment and utilization in Brazil  ap. 5485-5489.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAnimal production has changed from subsistence to an industrial model, lowering production costs but giving rise to higher potential environmental impact. When the effluents are not correctly managed, serious pollution events can occur. In Brazil liquid manure is commonly stored in reception pits or covered lagoons (biodigestors), followed by land application as a biofertilizer. In some regions there is an excess of manure due to low soil support capacities, and in these cases new technologies have to be adopted to export or treat the excess effluent. Manure storage time in pits/covered lagoons and new polymers to separate the solid fraction have been studied in Brazil. Treatment technologies, like swine manure treatment systems (SMTS), have been developed from a technical and economical point of view to optimize the processes and give a technological alternative to pork producers increasing production while reducing environmental impact. 3alivestock production 3aliquid manure 3amanure storage 3apig manure 2aAnimals 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aManurexanalysis 2aRefuse Disposalxmethods 2aSus scrofa 3aBrazil 0aBrazil 0aanimal manure management1 aMiele, M.1 aSteinmetz, R.L.R.0 tBioresource technology.g2009 Nov., v. 100, no. 22 p.5485-5489dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2008.10.0393Available from publisher's Web site  a20091104b20091204c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/10/29  aOther US 7aarticle02639naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001600139245019500155300001400350500001500364520127600379650002201655650001801677650001601695650001801711650001701729650002401746650001901770650001801789650002401807650002601831653002701857653001001884700001501894700001701909700001501926700001901941773008601960852000902046856007902055930003302134945001302167946001302180655001202193IND2180443120221119020739.0981014e199802  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218044312DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/91.1.412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVennard, C.10aEffects of the juvenile hormone mimic pyriproxyfen on egg development, embryogenesis, larval development, and metamorphosis in the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria (Orthoptera: Acrididae)  ap. 41-49.  a2019-12-04  aThe juvenile hormone mimic pyriproxyfen disrupted embryogenesis when applied topically to eggs of the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria Forskal. Eggs treated on days 3-6 were inhibited at various stages of development, depending on dose and age. In particular, 0.001-0.01 microgram blocked development of 3- and 4-d-old eggs at blastokinesis. Treatment of 7- to 11-d-old eggs was ineffective up to 10 micrograms. Insects that hatched successfully failed to display any postembryonic defects. Topical application of the mimic to females had a small ovicidal effect. The metamorphic molt was disrupted when the mimic was applied topically to 5th-instar S. gregaria. Insects retained characteristics of the 5th instar and in extreme cases supernumerary 5th instars were formed. Additional defects included essentially normal adults that were malformed and could not fly. Oral doses were considerably less effective. Application to 4th-instar nymphs did not produce supernumerary characteristics in postecdysial insects, though a large proportion of insects showed abnormalities when they reached adult, which in some cases prevented flight. Topical application of the mimic to 5th instar affected the length of the instar. The effects depended on dose and day of treatment 3asublethal effects 3adose response 3aoviposition 3ametamorphosis 3apyriproxyfen 3aoral administration 3ainsect control 3aembryogenesis 3atopical application 3aSchistocerca gregaria 0abiological development 0ahatch1 aNguama, B.1 aDillon, R.J.1 aOouchi, H.1 aCharnley, A.K.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1998 Feb., v. 91, no. 1 p.41-49x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/91.1.413Available from publisher's Web site  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle01649naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001900139245010300158300001400261520055800275650004300833650001100876650001600887650001600903650001100919650001000930650001600940653000900956653001100965653001500976700001900991700002001010773008601030852000901116856007901125930003301204945001301237946001301250655001201263IND2180444420221119020722.0981014e199802  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218044442DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/91.1.712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDogterom, M.H.10aPollination of greenhouse tomatoes by the North American Bombus vosnesenskii (Hymenoptera: Apidae)  ap. 71-75.  aThe effectiveness of pollination of tomatoes by the bumble bee Bombus vosnesenskii Radoszkowski in greenhouses was determined between May and August 1991 by measuring fruit size and seed content.

Pupal weight of females was not significantly affected after 10 generations of in vitro-reared wasps. Fecundity of C. grandis was not significantly reduced after 5 generations of in vitro-rearing. However, the in vitro F10 showed a significant reduction in fecundity. Females reared on boll weevils had a higher pupal weight and fecundity than females reared in vitro, but in vitro-reared females exhibited significantly higher survival during the period of most intensive reproductive activity. The movement, searching capacity, and survival under field conditions of in vitro and in vivo-reared C. grandis were compared in Ricardo and Lyford, TX. Dispersal ability and searching capacity was not significantly different within a 30-m radius for parasitoid females reared by either method. However, a significantly higher proportion of stations with parasitism was recorded from in vivo-reared C. grandis at a 60-m radius from the release point. Nevertheless, no significant difference in boll weevil mortality induced by parasitism was recorded between the 2 methods. This shows that the use of artificial diets is a promising method for mass propagating C. grandis. 3aweight 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3apupae 3aartificial diets 3aAnthonomus grandis grandis 3afecundity 3amass rearing 3ahost seeking 3aCatolaccus 3amortality 3abiological control 3aTexas 0aparasites 0areproduction 0aparasites of insect pests 0adispersal1 aRojas, M.G.1 aColeman, R.J.1 aKing, E.G.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1998 Feb., v. 91, no. 1 p.101-109x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/91.1.1013Available from publisher's Web site  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03368naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001900140245017000159300001600329520201800345650002602363650001702389650002702406650002302433650001902456650001402475650001102489650001402500650001402514650002302528650001502551650001202566650001102578650001902589653001702608653001302625653002002638700001602658773008802674852000902762856008002771930003302851945001302884946001302897655001202910IND2180446920221119020650.0981014e199802  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218044692DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/91.1.1102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuintela, E.D.10aSynergistic effect of imidacloprid and two entomopathogenic fungi on the behavior and survival of larvae of Diaprepes abbreviatus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in soil  ap. 110-122.  aThe impact of sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid and the entomopathogenic fungi Metarhizium anisopliae (Metschnikoff) Sorokin and Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin alone or in combination on mobility, mortality, and mycosis of 1st instars of the citrus root weevil, Diaprepes abbreviatus (L.), was evaluated in a series of laboratory bioassays. Initial studies were conducted to determine the effect of soil moisture and depth on the rate of larval movement. Movement of 2-d-old larvae in sandy soil was not affected by soil moisture ranging from 2 to 12%, but they did not penetrate soil with <1% moisture. Movement of 2-d-old larvae was retarded as moisture and soil depth increased. Newly hatched larvae exhibited poor vertical movement, suggesting that larval age is an important factor to consider in experimentation. In all bioassays, soil application of either M. anisopliae or B. bassiana at 5 X 10(3), 5 X 10(4), and 5 X 10(5) conidia per gram of soil as an oil or wettable powder formulation had no effect on the movement of larvae of D. abbreviatus in soil at different moistures. The addition of imidacloprid to the soil at doses of 5 micrograms/g soil or greater significantly impaired larval movement. When the chemical was applied with a fungus, however, larval movement was more severely impaired. Soil treatment with unformulated conidia of M. anisopliae and B. bassiana as wettable powder at 5 X 10(3), 5 X 10(4), and 5 X 10(5) caused minimal larval mortality of D. abbreviatus. In fact, larval mycosis (10.2%) was found only for the B. bassiana oil formulation at 5 X 10(5) conidia per gram soil. When sublethal doses of imidacloprid were combined with conidia of either fungus and applied to the soil, both larval mortality and mycosis increased synergistically. When M. anisopliae at 5 X 10(5) conidia per gram soil were applied alone or in combination with imidacloprid at 25 micrograms/g of soil, larval mortality, and mycosis decreased as soil moisture increased from <1 to 14%. 3aDiaprepes abbreviatus 3aimidacloprid 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3aBeauveria bassiana 3asoil treatment 3asynergism 3alarvae 3ainfection 3amortality 3asoil water content 3asoil depth 3aconidia 3adosage 3ainsect control 0aformulations 0amovement 0alarval mobility1 aMcCoy, C.W.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1998 Feb., v. 91, no. 1 p.110-122x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/91.1.1103Available from publisher's Web site  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02957naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001400141245012800155300001800283500001500301520169700316650001502013650002602028650002502054650001602079650001402095650001302109650001202122650001202134650001602146650001902162650001402181653001402195653000802209653001802217700001902235700001802254773009002272852000902362856008102371930003302452945001302485946001302498655001202511IND2163915220221119020948.0980909e199712  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216391522DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/90.6.16652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Y.C.10aFactors influencing quantity of cantharidin transferred to alfalfa from Epicauta occidentalis Werner (Coleoptera: Meloidae)  ap. 1665-1671.  a2019-12-04  aBlister beetles, including Epicauta occidentalis Werner, contain cantharidin, which is a toxin that may cause severe irritation of the digestive tract and even death of livestock that ingest contaminated alfalfa. During harvest, alfalfa is easily contaminated by fluids and bodies of blister beetles, either by the crushing action of mechanical conditioning or by running over beetles with tractor tires when using sicklebar mowers for cutting. We developed a thin-layer chromatographic cleanup procedure followed by gas chromatographic analysis to quantify how cantharidin transfer to alfalfa is influenced by the condition and location of beetles in the crop. During the harvest process, living E. occidentalis located on top of cut alfalfa transferred 6.51% (93 micrograms per beetle) of their total cantharidin content to the hay. After all body parts were removed, 34 ppm of cantharidin was present in a 500-g sample of alfalfa contaminated by crushing 50 beetles onto the hay. Living beetles located below the cut alfalfa transferred less (4.44% or 63 micrograms per beetle) of their cantharidin to the hay. Recently killed and living beetles transferred significantly greater percentages of cantharidin to hay than beetles that were dead and dried. Male E. occidentalis contained greater amounts of cantharidin (1.28 mg per beetle or 6% body dry weight) than did female beetles (0.87 mg per beetle or 3% body dry weight). Dead beetles, stored for 9 mo at room temperature (25 +/- 5 degrees C), contained 34% less cantharidin on a body dry weight basis than did dead beetles kept at -10 degrees C, underscoring the stability of cantharidin and the attendant long-term risk to livestock. 3aharvesting 3aquantitative analysis 3aspatial distribution 3acantharidin 3alivestock 3aEpicauta 3aalfalfa 3astorage 3aalfalfa hay 3abody condition 3apoisoning 0astability 0ahay 0acontamination1 aCharlton, R.E.1 aHiggins, R.A.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1997 Dec., v. 90, no. 6 p.1665-1671x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/90.6.16653Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03023naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169100002000178245007400198300001800272500002400290520109300314650002101407650002401428650001801452650002401470650002401494650002301518650002001541650001201561650001301573650001901586650001101605650002501616650001801641650001701659650003401676650001601710650000901726650002301735650003301758650002401791650004601815650001701861650003501878653002301913653001601936653003001952700002201982700001402004700001402018700002102032700002002053700001902073773009902092852000902191856009002200930003302290945002502323946001302348655001202361IND4425298320221119020731.0090828e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442529832DNAL7 a192007202pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2008.11.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aFurukawa, Kenji10aInnovative treatment system for digester liquor using anammox process  ap. 5437-5443.  aIncludes references  aThis study demonstrated that partial nitritation using nitrifying activated sludge entrapped in a polyethylene glycol (PEG) gel carrier, as a pretreatment to anammox process, could be successfully applied to digester liquor of biogas plant at a nitrogen loading rate of 3.0kg-N/m³/d.

The combination of partial nitritation and anammox reactors using PEG entrapped nitrifying and anammox bacteria was shown to be effective for the removal of high concentration ammonium in the digester liquor of a biogas plant. 3aactivated sludge 3apolyethylene glycol 3awaste liquors 3aanaerobic digestion 3aanaerobic digesters 3aliquid fertilizers 3asewage effluent 3aammonia 3anitrites 3aanimal manures 3abiogas 3awastewater treatment 3asewage sludge 2aAnaerobiosis 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBioreactors 2aGels 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aNitrogen Compoundsxanalysis 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aQuaternary Ammonium Compoundsxmetabolism 2aTime Factors 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 0aammonium oxidation 0anitritation 0agel entrapment techniques1 aInatomi, Yasuhiko1 aQiao, Sen1 aQuan, Lai1 aYamamoto, Taichi1 aIsaka, Kazuichi1 aSumino, Tatsuo0 tBioresource technology.g2009 Nov., v. 100, no. 22 p.5437-5443dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2008.11.0553Available from publisher's Web site  a20091104b20091204c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/10/29  aOther US 7aarticle01397naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001500140245013100155300001600286520038900302650002400691650002700715650001700742650001000759650002100769650001900790650002600809773008800835852000900923856008000932930003301012945001301045946001301058655001201071IND2180448420221119020742.0981014e199802  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218044842DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/91.1.1502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoss, M.H.10aResponse of behaviorally resistant German cockroaches (Dictyoptera: Blatellidae) to the active ingredient in a commercial bait  ap. 150-152.  aPrevious study showed that German cockroaches, Blattella germanica (L.), evolved behavioral resistance to a chlorpyrifos-based commercial bait.

  1 aMohammadzamani, Davood10aGenerating a digital management map for variable rate herbicide application using the global positioning system  ap. 1-6.  aThis study was conducted to generate a Digital Management Map (DMM) for Variable Rate Application (VRA) of Cyanazine pre-emergence herbicide using the Global Positioning System (GPS). The main objective of this study was to develop a precision method of herbicide application which eventuates to save herbicide and reduce its adverse effects on the environment and agricultural products. Around 6500 m2 uncultivated field was selected and local and Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates of the field were determined using Total Station surveying equipments and four static GPS receivers. Data processing was performed using a Personal Computer (PC) equipped with COMPASS software. By means of LAND software a 42-cell grid was created and laid out on the selected field. Then, soil samples were taken at the center of each cell, and texture and organic matter content (OMC) of each soil sample was determined. Using Kriging interpolation method, soil texture and soil OMC values were determined at other grid points. By considering manufacture recommendations for herbicide application based on soil OMC and soil texture, four management zones with four different herbicide application rates as 1.4, 1.7, 2.9 and 3.5 L ha-1 were determined and eventually a DMM was generated. Using the generated DMM and VRA, total required herbicide for the selected field was determined to be 1.61 L and it was concluded that herbicide application can be decreased up to 13% in compared with a uniform herbicide application rate for the entire selected field. 3aherbicides 3apesticide application 3aapplication rate 3adata analysis 3aglobal positioning systems 3aprecision agriculture 3apreemergent weed control 3asoil texture 3asoil organic matter1 aRashidi, Majid0 tJournal of agricultural and biological science.g2009 May, v. 4, no. 3 p.1-6x1990-61457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.arpnjournals.com/jabs/volume_05_2009.htm3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090903b00000000c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/08/25  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02362naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245010500203300001600308506007600324520081700400506003701217650001101254650001601265650001001281650001401291650000901305650001401314700002001328700001901348700002201367700002101389700002001410700001501430700002301445700002001468700001601488700002201504700002901526700002001555700001901575773012401594852000901718856008301727939003301810946001301843655001201856IND4460785820221207051055.0110805e20110805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446078582DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12041442doi7 aPMC32446952pmcid7 a218170552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSato, Yasufumi10aCartilage Acidic Protein-1B (LOTUS), an Endogenous Nogo Receptor Antagonist for Axon Tract Formation  ap. 769-773.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNeural circuitry formation depends on the molecular control of axonal projection during development. By screening with fluorophore-assisted light inactivation in the developing mouse brain, we identified cartilage acidic protein-1B as a key molecule for lateral olfactory tract (LOT) formation and named it LOT usher substance (LOTUS). We further identified Nogo receptor-1 (NgR1) as a LOTUS-binding protein. NgR1 is a receptor of myelin-derived axon growth inhibitors, such as Nogo, which prevent neural regeneration in the adult. LOTUS suppressed Nogo-NgR1 binding and Nogo-induced growth cone collapse. A defasciculated LOT was present in lotus-deficient mice but not in mice lacking both lotus- and ngr1. These findings suggest that endogenous antagonism of NgR1 by LOTUS is crucial for normal LOT formation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aantagonists 3abrain 3acartilage 3amice 3ascreening1 aIketani, Masumi1 aKurihara, Yuji1 aYamaguchi, Megumi1 aYamashita, Naoya1 aNakamura, Fumio1 aArie, Yuko1 aKawasaki, Takahiko1 aHirata, Tatsumi1 aAbe, Takaya1 aKiyonari, Hiroshi1 aStrittmatter, Stephen M.1 aGoshima, Yoshio1 aTakei, Kohtaro0 tScience.g2011 Aug. 5, v. 333, no. 6043 p.769-773dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12041443Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110805  aOther US 7aarticle03425naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245011400206300002000320506007600340520180500416506003702221650001502258650001702273650002202290650001802312650001302330650001602343650002402359650002102383650002702404650001602431650000902447650001402456650002602470650001202496700001802508700001902526700002202545700001902567700002002586773017502606852000902781856008302790939003302873946001302906655001202919IND4460774420221207045918.0110805e20110802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446077442DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11009571082doi7 aPMC31509552pmcid7 a217530792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLavialle, Monique10aStructural plasticity of perisynaptic astrocyte processes involves ezrin and metabotropic glutamate receptors  ap. 12915-12919.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe peripheral astrocyte process (PAP) preferentially associates with the synapse. The PAP, which is not found around every synapse, extends to or withdraws from it in an activity-dependent manner. Although the pre- and postsynaptic elements have been described in great molecular detail, relatively little is known about the PAP because of its difficult access for electrophysiology or light microscopy, as they are smaller than microscopic resolution. We investigated possible stimuli and mechanisms of PAP plasticity. Immunocytochemistry on rat brain sections demonstrates that the actin-binding protein ezrin and the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) 3 and 5 are compartmentalized to the PAP but not to the GFAP-containing stem process. Further experiments applying ezrin siRNA or dominant-negative ezrin in primary astrocytes indicate that filopodia formation and motility require ezrin in the membrane/cytoskeleton bound (i.e., T567-phosphorylated) form. Glial processes around synapses in situ consistently display this ezrin form. Possible motility stimuli of perisynaptic glial processes were studied in culture, based on their similarity with filopodia. Glutamate and glutamate analogues reveal that rapid (5 min), glutamate-induced filopodia motility is mediated by mGluRs 3 and 5. Ultrastructurally, these mGluR subtypes were also localized in astrocytes in the rat hippocampus, preferentially in their fine PAPs. In vivo, changes in glutamatergic circadian activity in the hamster suprachiasmatic nucleus are accompanied by changes of ezrin immunoreactivity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, in line with transmitter-induced perisynaptic glial motility. The data suggest that (i) ezrin is required for the structural plasticity of PAPs and (ii) mGluRs can stimulate PAP plasticity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aastrocytes 3acytoskeleton 3aelectrophysiology 3aglutamic acid 3ahamsters 3ahippocampus 3aimmunocytochemistry 3alight microscopy 3amicrofilament proteins 3apseudopodia 3arats 3areceptors 3asmall interfering RNA 3asynapse1 aAumann, Georg1 aAnlauf, Enrico1 aPröls, Felicitas1 aArpin, Monique1 aDerouiche, Amin0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Aug. 2, v. 108, no. 31 p.12915-12919dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11009571083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110805  aOther US 7aarticle03528naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169100001200178245012600190300001800316500002400334520179000358650001902148650001202167650001702179650002302196650001702219650001002236650002602246650002202272650001502294650005102309650003202360650001502392650002502407650002002432650003302452650002202485650002102507650004302528650002902571650002402600650002302624650002102647700001102668700001402679773009902693852000902792856009002801930003302891945002502924946001302949655001202962IND4425296120221119021218.0090828e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442529612DNAL7 a195740412pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2009.05.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aLiu, H.10aPreparation and properties of banana fiber-reinforced composites based on high density polyethylene (HDPE)/Nylon-6 blends  ap. 6088-6097.  aIncludes references  aBanana fiber (BaF)-filled composites based on high density polyethylene (HDPE)/Nylon-6 blends were prepared via a two-step extrusion method. Maleic anhydride grafted styrene/ethylene-butylene/styrene triblock polymer (SEBS-g-MA) and maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene (PE-g-MA) were used to enhance impact performance and interfacial bonding between BaF and the resins. Mechanical, crystallization/melting, thermal stability, water absorption, and morphological properties of the composites were investigated. In the presence of SEBS-g-MA, better strengths and moduli were found for HDPE/Nylon-6 based composites compared with corresponding HDPE based composites. At a fixed weight ratio of PE-g-MA to BaF, an increase of BaF loading up to 48.2wt.% led to a continuous improvement in moduli and flexural strength of final composites, while impact toughness was lowered gradually. Predicted tensile modulus by the Hones-Paul model for three-dimensional random fiber orientation agreed well with experimental data at the BaF loading of 29.3wt.%. However, the randomly-oriented fiber models underestimated experimental data at higher fiber levels. It was found that the presence of SEBS-g-MA had a positive influence on reinforcing effect of the Nylon-6 component in the composites. Thermal analysis results showed that fractionated crystallization of the Nylon-6 component in the composites was induced by the addition of both SEBS-g-MA and PE-g-MA. Thermal stability of both composite systems differed slightly, except an additional decomposition peak related to the minor Nylon-6 for the composites from the HDPE/Nylon-6 blends. In the presence of SEBS-g-MA, the addition of Nylon-6 and increased BaF loading level led to an increase in the water absorption value of the composites. 3aMusa acuminata 3abananas 3aplant fibers 3acomposite polymers 3apolyethylene 3anylon 3amechanical properties 3athermal stability 2aAbsorption 2aCaprolactamxanalogs & derivativesxchemistry. 2aComposite Resinsxchemistry 2aElasticity 2aEthylenesxchemistry 2aHot Temperature 2aMaleic Anhydridesxchemistry 2aMaterials Testing 2aMusaxmetabolism 2aPolyethylenexchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPolyethylenesxchemistry 2aPolymersxchemistry 2aSurface Properties 2aTensile Strength1 aWu, Q.1 aZhang, Q.0 tBioresource technology.g2009 Dec., v. 100, no. 23 p.6088-6097dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.05.0763Available from publisher's Web site  a20091129b20091204c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/11/29  aOther US 7aarticle03020naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002200161245012700183300001400310520140100324650001601725650001301741650001101754650001001765650001801775650001601793650001601809650001001825650001701835650002801852650002201880650001901902650000901921650001801930650002701948650001301975650001501988650001402003650001902017650002102036653001702057700002402074700002002098700001402118700001502132773010102147852000902248856009302257930003302350945002502383946001102408990002302419655001202442IND4424467420221119021156.0090814e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442446742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLone, Bilal Ahmad10aEffects of seed rate, row spacing and fertility levels on yield attributes and yield of soybean under temperate conditions  ap. 19-25.  aA field experiment was conducted at Shalimar Campus during Kharif seasons of 2004 and 2005 on a silty clay loam soil, medium in available N and K, low in available P to study the production performance of soybean as influenced by seed rate, row spacing and fertility levels under temperate conditions. The experiment comprising 27 treatment combinations viz., 3 levels each of seed rate (40, 60 and 80 kg ha-1), row spacing (30, 45 and 60 cm) and fertility (40:60:40, 60:90:60 and 80:120:80 of N : P2O5 : K2O kg ha-1) was laid out in split plot design replicated thrice. Lower seed rate i.e. 40 kg ha-1 produced significantly higher number of branches plant-1, test weight, number of pods plant-1 and seeds pod-1. Contrary to this, seed and straw yield were found significantly superior under seed rate of 80 kg ha-1 over 40 kg ha-1. The extent of increase was 21.75% for grain yield and 20.68% for straw yield. Whereas row spacing of 45 cm proved significantly superior over 30 cm and remained at par with 60 cm for grain and straw yield. The extent of increase in grain yield at 45 cm row to row spacing was 13.14% when compared to 30 cm row to row spacing. Application of N80 P120 K80 kg ha-1 significantly improved the growth parameters viz., number of pods plant-1, grain and straw yield over N40 P60 K40 kg ha-1. The extents of increase were 12.5% for grain yield and 7.36% for straw yield. 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3asowing 3aseeds 3aplant density 3arow spacing 3agrain yield 3astraw 3aplant growth 3adry matter partitioning 3aseed productivity 3asoil fertility 3apods 3aharvest index 3afertilizer application 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aplant response 3aclimatic factors 0aseeding rate1 aHāsāna, Badarula.1 aSingh, Amarjeet1 aHaq, S.A.1 aSofi, N.R.0 tJournal of agricultural and biological science.g2009 Mar., v. 4, no. 2 p.19-25x1990-61457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.arpnjournals.com/jabs/volume_03_2009.htm3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090903b00000000c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/08/25  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02160naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001500127245014200142300002100284500001500305520105700320650001601377650001601393650001301409650002401422650000901446650001101455650002201466651001601488653002501504700001501529700001501544700001701559773011801576852000901694930003301703945002501736946001301761655001201774IND4424463220221119021129.0090813e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442446322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

W06427 (18 p.  a2019-12-04  aWe evaluate the utility of three interrelated means of using data to calibrate the fully distributed rainfall-runoff model TOPKAPI as applied to the Maggia Valley drainage area in Switzerland. The use of error-based weighting of observation and prior information data, local sensitivity analysis, and single-objective function nonlinear regression provides quantitative evaluation of sensitivity of the 35 model parameters to the data, identification of data types most important to the calibration, and identification of correlations among parameters that contribute to nonuniqueness. Sensitivity analysis required only 71 model runs, and regression required about 50 model runs. The approach presented appears to be ideal for evaluation of models with long run times or as a preliminary step to more computationally demanding methods. The statistics used include composite scaled sensitivities, parameter correlation coefficients, leverage, Cook's D, and DFBETAS. Tests suggest predictive ability of the calibrated model typical of hydrologic models. 3astream flow 3acalibration 3adrainage 3aregression analysis 3arain 3arunoff 3ahydrologic models 3aSwitzerland 0astatistical analysis1 aHill, M.C.1 aMehl, S.W.1 aBurlando, P.0 tWater resources research.g2009 June, v. 45, no. 6 p.W06427 (18 p-W06427 (18 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20090831b00000000c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/08/31  aOther US 7aarticle03237naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100001500189245008700204300001600291500017300307500002400480500001500504520118700519650003001706650002201736650002701758650001301785650001501798650001501813650002201828650002801850650001001878650001201888650002001900650002001920650001201940650002801952650003001980650002202010650001102032650003602043650006802079650001802147650003202165650002402197653002602221653002302247653002802270700002202298773012102320852000902441856009202450930003302542945002502575946001102600655001202611IND4407983820221119021242.0080718e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440798382DNAL7 a186669662pmid7 a10.1111/j.1865-1682.2008.01025.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL823 0aX3801 aArez, A.P.14aThe Relevance of Molecular Markers in the Analysis of Malaria Parasite Populations  ap. 226-232.  aPaper presented at International Conference on Harmonization and Distribution of Pathogen Detection and Differentiation Tools held May 15-17, 2007, in Lisbon, Portugal.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMalaria is one of the main human public health problems in the tropical world and is possibly becoming an emerging disease too in regions where it has been controlled. It has been an excellent model in the area of molecular studies, with scientific validation of techniques, application of data mainly in studies of parasite diversity and information on a number of different aspects associated with infection and disease. The transfer of the gathered knowledge and experience in malaria to other infections is of great use and we briefly review a number of molecular markers, methodologies and techniques mostly used for Plasmodium detection, as well as identification or characterization of parasite populations. Selection of appropriate techniques depends on the questions raised and the studies' objectives - the antigen-coding genes, microsatellite loci and drug-resistance associated markers being the three most analysed classes of markers. The need of validation and standardization of laboratory protocols is addressed and discussed as it may determine the comparison of data between different studies and laboratories, with relevance in field-collected samples or studies. 3ageographical distribution 3adisease detection 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aantigens 3aPlasmodium 3abiomarkers 3aemerging diseases 3apathogen identification 3agenes 3amalaria 3agenetic markers 3adrug resistance 2aAnimals 2aDiagnosis, Differential 2aGenetic Markersxgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aHumans 2aMalariaxdiagnosisxveterinary. 2aPlasmodiumxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aPublic Health 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSpecies Specificity 0alaboratory techniques 0aliterature reviews 0amolecular sequence data1 ado Rosário, V.E.0 tTransboundary and emerging diseases.g2008 Aug., v. 55, no. 5-6 p.226-232dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1865-16827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1865-1682.2008.01025.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080911b20081011c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/08/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02818naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001900144245013400163300001400297500001500311520136200326650001701688650002501705650002401730650001101754650002501765650002201790650001301812650001801825650001701843650001701860650002001877650001801897650001701915650001201932650001701944653002301961653001901984700002602003773010102029852000902130856009302139930003302232945002502265946001102290990002302301655001202324IND4424467520221119021043.0090814e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442446752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Two RH (85% and 90%), four CM [Carboxy Methyl Cellulose + Cellophane Film (CMC + CF), Carboxy Methyl Cellulose (CMC), Cellophane Film (CF) and No-Coating (NC)] and nine SP (0, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 100, 110 and 120-days) were investigated for some qualitative characteristics including water content, total soluble solids (TSS), reducing sugar and firmness. A factorial experiment design was laid out in completely randomized design with 3 replications for each one of factors and Duncan's multiple range tests were performed to compare the means of different treatments. The statistical results of the study indicated that RH, CM and SP significantly (P <or= 0.01) affected all traits. Interactions of RH x SP, CM x SP for all traits, and RH x CM for water content and TSS were also significant. The statistical results of the study also indicated that at 90% RH, carrots were firmer, and had higher water content and reducing sugar than 85% RH. Moreover, CMC + CF for water content and reducing sugar, and CF for firmness were the best CM. In addition, water content, reducing sugar and firmness decreased by increasing the SP, whereas TSS increased by an increase in SP. 3aplastic film 3acellulosic materials 3apackaging materials 3asugars 3atotal soluble solids 3arelative humidity 3acoatings 3aDaucus carota 3astorage time 3afood quality 3astorage quality 3awater content 3aedible films 3acarrots 3acold storage 0astorage conditions 0asoluble solids1 aHosseini Bahri, Mahdi0 tJournal of agricultural and biological science.g2009 Mar., v. 4, no. 2 p.26-34x1990-61457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.arpnjournals.com/jabs/volume_03_2009.htm3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090825b00000000c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/08/25  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02173naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001400141245013600155300001800291500001500309520094400324650002601268650001101294650002501305650002401330650001701354650001101371650001101382650001501393650001401408650001701422650001901439653001601458653002001474700001801494773009001512852000901602856008101611930003301692945001301725946001301738655001201751IND2123453820221119020802.0980618e199710  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212345382DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/90.5.13772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoy, L.E.10aLow-temperature storage as a postharvest treatment to control Pseudococcus affinis (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae) on Royal Gala apples  ap. 1377-1381.  a2019-12-04  aRoyal Gala apples infested by the obscure mealybug, Pseudococcus affinis (Maskell), were stored at 0, 4, and 7 +/- 0.5 degrees C for various durations from 0 (control) to 126 d. As storage temperature decreased, the estimated times for 50 and 99% P. affinis mortality (LT50 and LT99, respectively) decreased. Mean LT50 values for the different life stages tested increased in the following order: 1st instar < 2nd-3rd instar less than or equal to female adult. This LT50 pattern became more evident with increasing temperature. At both 4 and 7 degrees C, mean 1st-instar LT99 values were less than those for 2nd-3rd instars and female adults. Storage at 0 degrees C resulted in the lowest mean LT99s for 1st instars, 2nd-3rd instars, and female adults (16.1, 19.0, and 18.9 d, respectively). A large-scale test storing 6,403 1st instars, 3,050 2nd-3rd instars, and 3,028 female adults at 0 degree C for 42 d resulted in complete mortality. 3apostharvest treatment 3aapples 3aPseudococcus viburni 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3aadults 3alarvae 3aquarantine 3amortality 3acold storage 3ainsect control 0atemperature 0aage differences1 aWhiting, D.C.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1997 Oct., v. 90, no. 5 p.1377-1381x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/90.5.13773Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02641naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178100001400187245008900201300001800290500002400308500001500332520105100347650002101398650001601419650003101435650001501466650000801481650003401489650002701523650003301550650001301583650003101596650002101627650002401648650001801672650002301690650002001713650000901733650001701742653001301759700001501772700001501787700001601802773009901818852000901917856009001926930003302016945002502049946001302074655001202087IND4425292820140725000000.0090828e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442529282DNAL7 a196046902pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2009.06.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aW0001 aBueno, P.10aModelling of parameters for optimization of maturity in composting trimming residues  ap. 5859-5864.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn this paper, changes in physico-chemical parameters during trimmings residue composting (cation exchange capacity, germination index, self-heated, NH₄/NO₃ ratio and CFA/CHA ratio) in relation to environmental composting parameters (time, aeration, moisture and particle size) of the composting process were studied. A central composite experimental design was used to obtain the polynomial model for each dependent variable. Results of the modelling showed that among the studied range, moisture was the highest influenced parameter in maturity evaluation, with respect to aeration and particle size. An exception was found for CEC evolution. In this parameter, the highest influence was found for particle size. Moreover, a product with acceptable chemical properties entails operating at medium moisture content (55%) and medium-to-high particle size (3-5cm). Moderate to low aeration (0.2m³ airkg⁻¹ d⁻¹) would be the best compromise to composting this residue, due to the scarce statistical influence of this independent variable. 3acompost maturity 3ayard wastes 3aphysicochemical properties 3acomposting 2aAir 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aChemistry, Physicalxmethods 2aFabaceae 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aModels, Chemical 2aModels, Statistical 2aParticle Size 2aPlantsxmetabolism 2aRefuse Disposal 2aSoil 2aTime Factors 0acomposts1 aYañez, R.1 aRivera, A.1 aDíaz, M.J.0 tBioresource technology.g2009 Dec., v. 100, no. 23 p.5859-5864dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.06.0423Available from publisher's Web site  a20091119b20091204c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/11/19  aOther US 7aarticle03206naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187100002500196245010200221300001800323500002400341520140500365650001801770650002101788650002601809650001501835650003101850650001501881650002101896650001701917650002101934650003201955650001201987650003401999650001602033650002702049650002202076650001102098650003102109650001102140650001702151650002402168650002702192650000902219650001602228700001502244700001102259700001902270700002202289773009902311852000902410856009002419930003302509945002502542946001302567655001202580IND4425293420221119020850.0090828e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442529342DNAL7 a196407022pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2009.06.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aW000 0aL8321 aErickson, Marilyn C.10aInactivation of Salmonella spp. in cow manure composts formulated to different initial C:N ratios  ap. 5898-5903.  aIncludes references  aAerobic composting is a common management practice to inactivate pathogens in manure; however, additional research on the role of compost composition in pathogen inactivation is needed. The objective of this study was therefore to determine the effect of the carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio and the presence of ammonium sulfate on inactivation of Salmonella spp. in cow manure-based mixtures composted in a bioreactor under controlled conditions. Compost preparations with an initial C:N ratio of 20:1 required a maximum of 4days of storage before Salmonellae were inactivated by 7log₁₀, whereas preparations with C:N ratios of 30:1 and 40:1 C:N required more than 5 and 7days of storage, respectively. The pH values of both the 20:1 and 30:1 C:N preparations decreased during the onset of composting before increasing to >8. In contrast, pH values of 40:1 C:N preparations increased immediately to >8, generally within the first day of storage. Maximum temperatures observed in 20:1 C:N preparations for inactivation of pathogens were less than 50°C, and the cumulative heat exposure required for pathogen inactivation in 20:1 C:N preparations was 15-fold less than in 40:1 C:N preparations. Supplementation of compost mixtures with 0.08% ammonium sulfate resulted in slightly higher temperatures; however, these higher temperatures did not translate into more rapid rates of pathogen inactivation. 3acattle manure 3acomposted manure 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aSalmonella 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3acomposting 3aammonium sulfate 3adisinfection 2aAcidsxchemistry 2aAmmonium Sulfatexchemistry 2aAnimals 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBioreactors 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aCarbonxchemistry 2aCattle 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aManure 2aMicrobiology 2aNitrogenxchemistry 2aSalmonellaxmetabolism 2aSoil 2aTemperature1 aLiao, Jean1 aMa, Li1 aJiang, Xiuping1 aDoyle, Michael P.0 tBioresource technology.g2009 Dec., v. 100, no. 23 p.5898-5903dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.06.0833Available from publisher's Web site  a20091125b20091204c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/11/25  aOther US 7aarticle02714naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153072000900162100001400171245009100185300001800276500002400294500002300318520129000341650002101631650001301652650001101665650001001676650001401686650001701700650001601717650002401733650001401757650002301771650001801794650002201812650001501834650001401849651001101863700001801874700001701892773013401909852000902043856007502052930003302127945002502160946001102185655001202196IND4408100520221119020752.0080721e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440810052DNAL7 a10.1139/X07-2332doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aK250 0aF400 0aX1001 aKroon, J.10aGenetic variation in the diameter-height relationship in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris)  ap. 1493-1503.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aGenetic parameters were estimated for the diameter-height (d-h) relationship and three other tree stem-form characteristics (total height, breast height diameter, and total tree volume) for data from 10 diallel progeny trials of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), at about 30 years of age in Sweden. Linear mixed models were fit to the data, where adjustments for intertree competition and microsite heterogeneity were made by means of covariates in a nearest-neighbour analysis. The d-h relationship was analyzed with a covariate (tree height) adjusted model of diameter. Average estimates of the additive coefficient of variation and narrow-sense heritability for the d-h relationship were 7.4% and 0.22, respectively. Estimates of dominance were comparatively small (average dominance: phenotypic variance ratio of 0.04). The results indicate that there is scope to modify the d-h relationship by selection and breeding. Additive genetic correlations between the d-h relationship and height were negative, with a mean of -0.62. Selection for height would thus result in stems that are more slender than average, suggesting that tall trees allocate relatively more resources to height growth than to diameter growth. Selection based on height alone will negatively affect volume gain. 3aPinus sylvestris 3adiameter 3aheight 3astems 3astem form 3aheritability 3atree growth 3agenetic correlation 3aallometry 3aplant architecture 3atree breeding 3agenetic variation 3aprovenance 3aequations 3aSweden1 aAndersson, B.1 aMullin, T.J.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2008 June, v. 38, no. 6 p.1493-1503dNational Research Council of Canadax0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X07-2333Available from publisher's Web site  a20080819b20080905c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/08/18  aNon-US 7aarticle02970naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178100001600187245010000203300001800303500002400321500001500345520115200360650001101512650002401523650001801547650002601565650001601591650002301607650001301630650002201643650002401665650001701689650003401706650001601740650002201756650003001778650002301808650001701831650002301848650002401871650001501895650001301910650002901923650004101952650003201993653002902025700001602054700001702070773009902087852000902186856009002195930003302285945002502318946001302343655001202356IND4425293920221119020745.0090828e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442529392DNAL7 a195774642pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2009.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aP1201 aNtaikou, I.10aValorisation of wastepaper using the fibrolytic/hydrogen producing bacterium Ruminococcus albus  ap. 5928-5933.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe present study aimed to investigate the biotransformation of different kinds of wastepaper to hydrogen by the fibrotylic bacterium Ruminococcus albus. Five different types i.e. paper tissue, office paper, illustrated magazine paper, paperboard and newspaper, were selected as representatives of the most common types of wastepaper found in municipal solid wastes. The percentage of total carbohydrates measured as glucose equivalents, ranged from 50% to 100% (w/w), whereas the bioconversion by R. albus ranged from 18% to 100% of their initial weigh. The only metabolic products detected in all cases were acetate, ethanol, formate, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The hydrogen yields ranged from 46 to 280L H₂/kg paper, indicating that wastepaper could be a promising candidate for second generation biohydrogen production. Subsequently, hydrolysis was investigated for paper tissue and paperboard. It was shown that in both cases the degradation process could be satisfactory described by zero order kinetics and it was identified to be the rate limiting step for the whole process, controlling biomass growth and metabolites generation rate. 3abiogas 3ahydrogen production 3acarbohydrates 3amunicipal solid waste 3awaste paper 3aRuminococcus albus 3ahydrogen 3abiotransformation 2aAcetatesxchemistry 2aAnaerobiosis 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBioreactors 2aBiotransformation 2aCarbon Dioxidexchemistry 2aEthanolxchemistry 2aFermentation 2aGlucosexchemistry 2aHydrogenxchemistry 2aHydrolysis 2aKinetics 2aRuminococcusxmetabolism 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Purificationxmethods 0arenewable energy sources1 aKoutros, E.1 aKornaros, M.0 tBioresource technology.g2009 Dec., v. 100, no. 23 p.5928-5933dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.06.0193Available from publisher's Web site  a20091126b20091204c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/11/26  aOther US 7aarticle02599naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153072000900162072000900171100001700180245007200197300001800269500002400287500002300311500001500334520118400349650002201533650001801555650001501573650002601588650003001614650002501644650001601669650002901685650002001714651001101734653001801745653001301763653001401776700001601790773013401806852000901940856007501949930003302024945002502057946001102082655001202093IND4408099320221119021116.0080721e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440809932DNAL7 a10.1139/X08-0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK200 0aD500 0aE720 0aK500 0aE7101 aTikina, A.V.12aA framework for assessing the effectiveness of forest certification  ap. 1357-1365.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-06  aWith increasing concerns about the costs of forest management, there is a need to rigorously evaluate any management activities that add to costs. Certification has been widely adopted at considerable financial cost to those managing forests. Although there have been many studies of the impacts of certification, there is no comprehensive framework for assessing whether or not certification has been effective in achieving its goals. To do this, certification needs to be viewed as a part of an international environmental regime. Using established methodologies, this paper applies an evaluation framework and examines forest certification effectiveness in a number of categories: problem solving, goal attainment, behavioural effectiveness, process effectiveness, constitutive effectiveness, and evaluative effectiveness. It is too early to assess its effectiveness in problem solving and goal attainment. However, forest certification has been quite successful at process and constitutive effectiveness and is now widely recognized by a range of institutions. Its effectiveness in changing behaviours is less clear, and its evaluative effectiveness remains to be determined. 3aconsumer behavior 3aforest policy 3aobjectives 3aproduct certification 3aproduct quality standards 3asustainable forestry 3aecolabeling 3aenvironmental protection 3aproblem solving 3aCanada 0aeffectiveness 0alabeling 0aawareness1 aInnes, J.L.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2008 June, v. 38, no. 6 p.1357-1365dNational Research Council of Canadax0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X08-0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20080818b20080905c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/08/18  aNon-US 7aarticle02972naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245008700191300001600278500002400294520134800318650001701666650001801683650001501701650002201716650001401738650001001752650001501762650001201777650003201789650001801821650002101839650002601860650003301886650001501919650002201934650001401956650002501970650002501995650002002020650002802040650001402068650002702082650002402109650002502133651001302158651001302171700001502184700001802199700001402217773009902231852000902330856005502339655001202394IND4460075020221119021004.0110715e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446007502DNAL7 a217494292pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2052.2011.02175.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCharoensook, R.10aFurther resolution of porcine phylogeny in Southeast Asia by Thai mtDNA haplotypes  ap. 445-450.  aIncludes references  aThe mtDNA control region of 72 Thai native pigs and 11 Thai wild boars indigenous to Northern Thailand was comparatively sequenced. In total, 36 nucleotide variations that accounted for 24 haplotypes have been described (TNH01 to TNH20 and TWH01 to TWH04). These haplotypes and further publicly available mtDNA haplotypes were used to assess phylogenetic relationships. Twenty-three of the 24 haplotypes became integrated into the Asian clade of the phylogenetic tree and eight of them recapitulated another major cluster of haplotypes within this clade (Thai haplogroup, THG). Only haplotype TNH01 fit in with the European clade of the phylogenetic tree. An additional analysis using 510 bp of the mtDNA incorporated the THG haplotypes in to clade MTSEA (mountainous and Southeast Asian distribution) to form haplogroup MTSEA-THG. Recently, MTSEA was renamed in MC3. MC3 contains only signatures of pigs scattered across the Indo-Burma Biodiversity Hotspot (IBBH), a region including Thailand to the Kra Isthmus. Here we propose a putative independent porcine domestication event in South-east Asia (SEA). All haplotypes of haplogroup MTSEA-THG have revealed unique and previously unknown nucleotide signatures at positions 24 (nucleotide A) and at positions 183 (nucleotide C) that differentiate them from all other porcine mtDNA haplotypes. 3abiodiversity 3adomestication 3ahaplotypes 3amitochondrial DNA 3aphylogeny 3aswine 3awild boars 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domesticxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCluster Analysis 2aComputational Biology 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aDemography 2aGenetic Variation 2aGeography 2aHaplotypesxgenetics 2aLikelihood Functions 2aModels, Genetic 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSus scrofaxgenetics 3aThailand 0aThailand1 aBrenig, B.1 aGatphayak, K.1 aKnorr, C.0 tAnimal genetics.g2011 Aug., v. 42, no. 4 p.445-450dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0268-91467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2052.2011.02175.x 7aarticle02426naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195100002200204245007500226300001600301500002400317500001500341520081500356650001901171650002701190650002201217650001401239650003101253650001501284650001801299650001901317650001801336650001801354650001701372650001401389650006201403650003701465651001101502653001501513653002301528700002301551700002701574773010401601852000901705856008901714930003301803945002501836946001101861655001201872IND4425299820221119014924.0090828e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442529982DNAL7 a196164662pmid7 a10.1016/j.tplants.2009.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF700 0aF600 0aF200 0aF3001 aLoreto, Francesco10aOne species, many terpenes: matching chemical and biological diversity  ap. 416-420.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aVolatile terpenes have been proposed as chemotaxonomic markers, despite the strong environmental control on their synthesis. To clarify whether chemical profiles match biological diversity, cork oak, a monoterpene-emitting species that has been bred by humans and frequently hybridizes with other oaks, is a useful case-study. Analysis of the available genetic information in cork oak provenances suggests that volatile terpenes might indeed suitably track geographical diversity even at the intraspecific level. Phylogeographical diversity does not reflect chemical diversity in other evergreen oaks that have not been intensively bred. Breeding for productive traits might therefore drive selection for terpene diversity, in turn modulating important adaptive mechanisms against biotic and abiotic stressors. 3amonoterpenoids 3ageographical variation 3agenetic variation 3aphylogeny 3avolatile organic compounds 3aprovenance 3aQuercus suber 3aplant taxonomy 3achemotaxonomy 3aintrogression 2aBiodiversity 2aPhylogeny 2aQuercusxchemistryxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTerpenesxchemistryxmetabolism. 0aEurope 0aterpenoids 0aliterature reviews1 aBagnoli, Francesca1 aFineschi, S.q(Silvia)0 tTrends in plant science.g2009 Aug., v. 14, no. 8 p.416-420dElsevier Science Ltd.x1360-13857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2009.06.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20090915b20091106c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/09/15  aNon-US 7aarticle03256naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001700141245016600158300001800324500001500342520193500357650002902292650002102321650001002342650002202352650002602374650002502400650002302425651001102448651001602459651001102475653002202486653002002508653002002528653001902548700001602567773009002583852000902673856008102682930003302763945001302796946001302809655001202822IND2123446920221119014901.0980618e199710  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212344692DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/90.5.10662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnkerlin, W.10aEconomic evaluation of three alternative methods for control of the Mediterranean fruit fly (Diptera: Tephritidae) in Israel, Palestinian Territories, and Jordan  ap. 1066-1072.  a2019-12-04  aThe Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann), is a major pest of fruit crops in the Mediterranean Basin countries. If no control measures are applied in Israel, Palestinian Territories, and Jordan against this pest, the annual fruit losses are estimated to be about U.S. $365 million, which is more than half the total revenue produced by fruits considered to be Mediterranean fruit fly hosts in these countries. Under the current control programs, the direct damage (yield loss and control costs) and indirect damage (environmental impact and market loss) amount to U.S. $192 million per year. This amount could increase each year if the current control programs are kept. The aim of this study was to evaluate, on a regional basis, the economic returns of 3 improved alternative Mediterranean fruit fly control methods using a 9-yr time frame. The control alternatives include population suppression using bait sprays, population suppression using massive release of sterile male flies, and population eradication also using massive releases of sterile male flies. For each option, an action plan was prepared which includes intensity, frequency and timing of sampling (trapping and fruit gathering), control (bait sprays and sterile male releases), and postcontrol (quarantine and emergency capacity) techniques. For the economic evaluation costs and benefits at net present value are computed for each control option to estimate the economic indices. Results indicate that the 3 area-wide control options are technically and economically feasible and all are better than the current control programs. For each option, the economic returns on a medium and long term are discussed, along with the environmental impact. Over the 9-yr time frame, the greatest economic return is from the sterile male suppression option. Over a much longer time frame, the greatest return is for the sterile male eradication option. 3asterile insect technique 3achemical control 3abaits 3acosts and returns 3acost benefit analysis 3aenvironmental impact 3aCeratitis capitata 3aIsrael 3aMiddle East 3aJordan 0aeconomic analysis 0agenetic control 0acontrol methods 0ainsect control1 aMumford, J.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1997 Oct., v. 90, no. 5 p.1066-1072x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/90.5.10663Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03267naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245009100166300001600257520171800273650001501991650001602006650001102022650001502033650001402048650001402062650001302076650001102089650001102100650001502111650001502126650001502141650001302156650001402169650001802183650001902201650001602220650002202236653002302258653002102281653001102302653001402313653001102327653001802338653001702356653001602373653002102389653003302410700002202443773010202465852000902567856006902576930003302645946001102678655001202689IND4388214320221119014648.0070225e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438821432DNAL7 a10.1007/s11284-006-0045-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHåkanson, Lars.12aA dynamic mass balance model for phosphorus fluxes and concentrations in coastal areas  ap. 296-320.  aThis paper presents a general, process-based mass balance model (CoastMab) for total phosphorus (TP) in defined coastal areas (at the ecosystem scale). The model is based on ordinary differential equations and calculates inflow, outflow and internal fluxes on a monthly basis. It consists of four compartments: surface water, deep water, erosion/transportation areas for fine sediments and accumulation areas for fine sediments. The separation between surface water and deep water is not done based on water temperature, but on sedimentological criteria instead (from the theoretical wave base). There are algorithms for all major internal TP fluxes (sedimentation, resuspension, diffusion, mixing and burial). Validations were performed using data from 21 different Baltic coastal areas. The results show that the model predicts monthly TP in water and chlorophyll a very well (generally within the uncertainty bands of the empirical data). The model has also been put through sensitivity tests, which show that the most important factor regulating the predictions of the model is generally the TP concentration in the sea beyond the coast. The model is simple to apply, since all driving variables may be accessed from maps or monitoring programs. The driving variables include coastal area, section area (between the defined coastal area and the adjacent sea), mean and maximum depths, latitude (used to predict water temperatures, stratification and mixing), salinity and TP concentration in the sea. Many of the model structures are general and could be used for areas other than those included in this study, e.g., for open coasts, estuaries or tidal coasts, as well as for other substances than phosphorus. 3aalgorithms 3achlorophyll 3acoasts 3aecosystems 3aequations 3aestuaries 3alatitude 3amixing 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aphosphorus 3aprediction 3asalinity 3asediments 3asurface water 3atransportation 3auncertainty 3awater temperature 0aMass balance model 0aDynamic modeling 0aBaltic 0aProcesses 0aFluxes 0aSedimentation 0aResuspension 0aRegressions 0aTotal phosphorus 0aSuspended particulate matter1 aEklund, Jenny M. 0 tEcological research.g2007 Mar., v. 22, no. 2 p.296-320dTokyo : Springer-Verlagx0912-38147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-006-0045-53electronic resource  a20070225b20070303c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02916naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001600140245013400156300001600290520177500306650002302081650002002104650002502124650001102149650002202160650001302182650001902195651001302214653001302227653001402240700002002254700002002274773008802294852000902382856008002391930003302471945001302504946001302517655001202530IND2062775620221119014636.0980327e199706  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206277562DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/90.3.7952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMason, C.E.10aPlacement of pheromone traps within the vegetation canopy to enhance capture of male European corn borer (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae)  ap. 795-800.  aEuropean corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), pheromone traps are typically placed in the open or above vegetation to monitor adult presence and abundance in areas where moths are likely to aggregate. After noting in another study that more moths were captured in traps overgrown with vegetation than in traps above it, replicated field experiments were conducted at 2 locations in Delaware to determine if placement of traps within the vegetation was more effective than traps placed above the canopy. At Newark, 3.83 times more males were captured in traps baited with Z-pheromone lure when traps were placed just below the canopy top in mixed weedy vegetation compared with traps 3 m away with the pheromone source 50 cm above the plant canopy. At Laurel in a monoculture of developing wheat, 2.72 times more males were captured in traps baited with E pheromone lure which were placed below the top of the canopy versus traps above the canopy. Greater variation in male moth captures was associated with greater diversity of the weedy sample location relative to samples in wheat monoculture. Also, traps placed within vegetation resulted in less variation in mean moth captures versus traps placed above the canopy. This indicates that a better estimate of the population may be obtained by placing traps within vegetation. Results suggest that males are more likely to respond to calling females within the vegetation as opposed to above the canopy. Placement of pheromone traps with the pheromone source below the top of the canopy appears to be critical for maximizing their effective capture of European corn borer male moths. We suggest that enhancement of pheromone lures within vegetation may be caused by water vapor and volatiles associated with plants. 3aOstrinia nubilalis 3apheromone traps 3aspatial distribution 3acanopy 3aTriticum aestivum 3asampling 3ainsect control 3aDelaware 0aefficacy 0aplacement1 aStromdahl, E.Y.1 aPesek, J.D.

  1 aHurkmans, R.T.W.L.10aEffects of land use changes on streamflow generation in the Rhine basin  ap. W06405 (15 p.  aThe hydrological regime of the Rhine basin is expected to shift from a combined snowmelt-rainfall regime to a more rainfall-dominated regime because of climate change, leading to more extreme flood peaks and low flows. Land use changes may reinforce the effects of this shift through urbanization or may counteract them through, for example, afforestation. In this study, we investigate the effect of projected land use change scenarios on river discharge. Sensitivity of mean and extreme discharge in the Rhine basin to land use changes is investigated at various spatial scales. The variable infiltration capacity (VIC) (version 4.0.5) model is used for hydrological modeling forced by a high-resolution atmospheric data set spanning the period 1993-2003. The model is modified to allow for bare soil evaporation and canopy evapotranspiration simultaneously in sparsely vegetated areas, as this is more appropriate for simulating seasonal effects. All projected land use change scenarios lead to an increase in streamflow. The magnitude of the increase, however, varies among subbasins of different scales from about 2% in the upstream part of the Rhine (about 60,000 km2) to about 30% in the Lahn basin (about 7000 km2). Streamflow at the basin outlet proved rather insensitive to land use changes because over the entire basin affected areas are relatively small. Moreover, projected land use changes (urbanization and conversion of cropland into (semi)natural land or forest) have opposite effects. At smaller scales, however, the effects can be considerable. 3aland use change 3astream flow 3arivers 3abasins 3asnowmelt 3arain 3aclimate change 3aurbanization 3aafforestation 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3ahydrologic models 3aevaporation 3acanopy 3aevapotranspiration 3aagricultural land 3aspatial data 3arunoff 3asimulation models 3aNetherlands 3aGermany1 aTerink, W.1 aMoors, E.J.1 aTroch, P.A.1 aVerburg, P.H.0 tWater resources research.g2009 June, v. 45, no. 6 p.W06405 (15 p-W06405 (15 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20090831b00000000c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/08/31  aOther US 7aarticle03182naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245011600176300001400292500002400306520169400330650001102024650001502035650001202050650001602062650002502078650001802103650001402121650002702135650001002162650001602172650001402188650002002202650001802222650002402240650001402264650001502278650001402293650001302307650002602320650001402346650004402360700002602404700003002430700002702460773012502487852000902612856005502621655001202676IND4448620720221119014924.0110128e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444862072DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4549.2009.00452.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgunronbi, Olanike.10aChemical composition, storage stability and effect of cold-pressed flaxseed oil cake inclusion on bread quality  ap. 64-79.  aIncludes references  aFlaxseed oil cake from a South African factory was screened for proximate composition, mineral content, fatty acid profile and storage stability. The oil cake was included at 10 and 15% levels (w/w) in brown bread and evaluated using a 96-member consumer panel. The oil cake contained between 38.0 and 47.3% protein, 12.8 and 26.1% crude fat and 3.7 and 5.1% ash. The total carbohydrates were mostly dietary fiber. Calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and potassium were in the range of 3.3 to 3.8, 4.8 to 5.9, 6.4 to 8.2 and 9.0 to 10.1 (mg/g), respectively. The oil from the flaxseed oil cake contained 58.5 to 59.7% of C18 omega-3 fatty acids. Peroxide levels of the flaxseed oil cake were below the threshold limits after 6 months storage. Thiobarbituric acid threshold values were exceeded after 5 months aerobic storage at 20C. Bread samples with inclusion levels of 10 and 15% flaxseed oil cake were acceptable to the consumer sensory panel. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This research would have practical applications in the brown bread and flaxseed oil industries in terms of providing added value for an otherwise overlooked by-product of flaxseed oil extraction. The results indicate that flaxseed oil cake is rich in nutrients such as protein, crude fiber and crude fat, containing 58.5 to 59.7% of omega-3 fatty acids. In addition, flaxseed oil cake is stable during storage under various conditions. Acceptable brown bread could be made with up to 15% (w/w) inclusion of flaxseed oil cake. Because of the tendency for the consumer panel to prefer lower levels of inclusion, it is pragmatic therefore to recommend inclusion of 10-15% flaxseed oil cake in commercial standard brown bread. 3abreads 3abyproducts 3acalcium 3acrude fiber 3adietary carbohydrate 3adietary fiber 3afactories 3afatty acid composition 3afeeds 3alinseed oil 3amagnesium 3amineral content 3aoilseed cakes 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aperoxides 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aproteins 3aproximate composition 3ascreening 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances1 aJOOSTE, PIET JOHANNES1 aAbu, J.

Our studies have focused on a common, genetically influenced metabolic profile, characterized by a predominance of small, dense LDL particles (subclass pattern B), that is associated with a two- to threefold increase in risk for coronary artery disease. We have found that healthy normolipidemic individuals with this trait show a greater reduction in LDL cholesterol and particle number in response to low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets than do unaffected individuals (subclass pattern A). Moreover, such diets result in reduced LDL particle size, with induction of pattern B in a substantial proportion of pattern A men. Recent studies have indicated that this response is under genetic influence. Future identification of the specific genes involved may lead to improved targeting of dietary therapies aimed at reducing cardiovascular disease risk. 3anutrient intake 3arisk 3ablood lipids 3adietary fat 3aphenotype 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3aheart diseases 3adietary carbohydrate 3acholesterol 3alow density lipoprotein 3alipid metabolism 0aldl subclasses 0adiet 0aheterogeneity 0aliterature reviews0 tAnnual review of nutrition.g2001, v. 21 p.283-295x0199-98857nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03687naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245009200124300001600216500001500232520251000247650001702757650001602774650003202790650001602822650002202838650002502860650002402885650002002909650001902929650002102948653001602969653001502985653001603000653002303016653001403039653001203053653004803065773007203113852000903185930003303194945001303227946001303240655001203253IND2207655220221119014921.0001107s2000    cau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220765522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHwang, D.10aFatty acids and immune responses--a new perpesctive in searching for clues to mechanism  ap. 431-456.  a2019-12-05  aDietary essential fatty acids are the precursors for eicosanoids. Among the eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid, prostaglandin (PG) E(2) is known to possess immunosuppressive actions. Thus, it has been a prevailing hypothesis that the immuno-modulatory roles of dietary fatty acids are mediated at least in part through the alteration of PG biosynthesis. PGs exert their biological effects through their cognate receptors. There are four subtypes of PGE receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4) so far identified. Although the association of EP receptors with G proteins coupled to adenylate cyclase and the mobilization of intracellular calcium are well documented, downstream signaling pathways for these receptors are virtually unknown. Identification of downstream signaling pathways for each subtype of EP receptors and target genes regulated by the activation of the receptor will help with our understanding of the mechanism by which dietary fatty acids affect immune responses through the modulation of PGE(2) biosynthesis. Emerging evidence suggests that fatty acids can additionally act as second messengers, regulators of signal transducing molecules or transcription factors. Acylation with long-chain fatty acids can occur on a variety of signaling molecules and can affect their membrane translocation and functions. Dietary fatty acids can alter functional properties of lipid mediators by changing the composition of acyl moieties of these molecules. Evidence accumulated recently indicates that long-chain unsaturated fatty acids and their metabolites bind and activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). PPARs are nuclear hormone receptors and transcription factors that regulate the expression of broad arrays of genes involved not only in lipid and glucose metabolism, but also in immune and inflammatory responses. PPARs may therefore be important cellular targets that mediate modulation of immune responses by dietary fatty acids. Together, it becomes clear now that multiple steps in various receptor-mediated signaling pathways can be modulated by dietary fatty acids. It will be a challenging task to quantitatively determine how different fatty acids alter functional properties of multitude of signaling components and final cellular responses. Elucidating the mechanism of actions of fatty acids on receptor-mediated signaling pathways in immuno-competent cells will provide a new insight for understanding the immuno-modulatory roles of dietary fatty acids. 3abiosynthesis 3adietary fat 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3alymphocytes 3ahormone receptors 3abiochemical pathways 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aimmune response 3aprostaglandins 3alipid metabolism 0aeicosanoids 0amodulation 0afatty acids 0aliterature reviews 0areceptors 0asignals 0aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptors0 tAnnual review of nutrition.g2000, v. 20 p.431-456x0199-98857nnas  aDNAL  a20001231b20010109c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02081naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245008900174300001400263500002400277520105000301650002201351650001201373650001201385650001501397650001601412650001201428650001101440650001101451650000901462650002401471650001701495651001701512651001001529773010401539852000901643856005501652655001201707IND4451114820221119014857.0110322e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445111482DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-0862.2010.00465.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMainardi, Stefano10aCropland use, yields, and droughts: spatial data modeling for Burkina Faso and Niger  ap. 17-33.  aIncludes references  aFor countries with recurrent droughts, the design of drought impact mitigation measures could benefit from analyses of determinants of yields and prices of local crops at regional and district level. This study applies dynamic spatial panel data regression models to yields and prices of four major food crops across regions of Burkina Faso and Niger, over sample periods between 1984 and 2006. Results lend support to mainly simultaneous spatial spillovers, particularly for millet and cowpea prices and sorghum yields in Niger, and maize yields in Burkina Faso. After accounting for these effects, most crop yields are found to be weakly price‐responsive, as envisaged by a supply‐side geographical diffusion hypothesis. Seasonal rainfall elasticity estimates suggest that dominant food crops have slight advantage margins in terms of relative resilience to rainfall shortages. However, this result is to be weighed against low millet yields in Niger, and marked drops in sorghum yields during officially declared droughts in Burkina Faso. 3aagricultural land 3acowpeas 3adrought 3afood crops 3agrain yield 3amillets 3amodels 3aprices 3arain 3aregression analysis 3aspatial data 3aBurkina Faso 3aNiger0 tAgricultural economics.g2011 Jan., v. 42, no. 1 p.17-33dBlackwell Publishing Incx0169-51507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-0862.2010.00465.x 7aarticle02577naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009300127300001600220500001500236520104100251650001701292650002301309650002001332650001501352650002001367650001601387650001401403650002601417650002201443650002301465650002501488650002401513650002001537650002201557650002401579653001501603653002301618653001301641653001501654653002501669653001901694653002301713653002201736653001501758653001301773653002601786653000901812653002101821700001701842773007201859852000901931930003301940945001301973946001301986655001201999IND2207657320221119014727.0001107s2000    cau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220765732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRennie, M.J.10aProtein and amino acid metabolism during and after exercise and the effects of nutrition  ap. 457-483.  a2019-12-05  aSustained dynamic exercise stimulates amino acid oxidation, chiefly of the branched-chain amino acids, and ammonia production in proportion to exercise intensity; if the exercise is intense enough, there is a net loss of muscle protein (as a result of decreased protein synthesis, increased breakdown, or both); some of the amino acids are oxidized as fuel, whereas the rest provide substrates for gluconeogenesis and possibly for acid-based regulation. Protein balance is restored after exercise, but no hypertrophy occurs with habitual dynamic exercise. Resistance exercise causes little change in amino acid oxidation but probably depresses protein synthesis and elevates breakdown acutely. After exercise, protein synthesis rebounds for less than or equal to 48 h, but breakdown remains elevated, and net positive balance is achieved only if amino acid availability is increased. There is no evidence that habitual exercise increases protein requirements; indeed protein metabolism may become more efficient as a result of training. 3abody protein 3amuscle contraction 3aanimal proteins 3aguidelines 3askeletal muscle 3aamino acids 3aoxidation 3aamino acid metabolism 3astrength training 3anutrient transport 3aamino acid sequences 3aprotein requirement 3adietary protein 3aprotein synthesis 3aprotein degradation 0amodulation 0aliterature reviews 0atraining 0asubstrates 0anutrition physiology 0amuscle tissues 0aprotein metabolism 0aconnective tissue 0ametabolism 0aexercise 0anutrient requirements 0adiet 0aprotein turnover1 aTipton, K.D.0 tAnnual review of nutrition.g2000, v. 20 p.457-483x0199-98857nnas  aDNAL  a20001231b20010109c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02594naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002200141245015000163300001800313500001500331520136800346650001701714650002101731650002701752650002301779650001401802650001301816650001901829650002701848650002601875653002601901653001201927700001801939773009001957852000902047856008102056930003302137945001302170946001302183655001202196IND2123447720221119014718.0980618e199710  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212344772DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/90.5.11172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMascarenhas, R.N.10aResponse of field-collected strains of soybean looper (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) to selected insecticides using an artificial diet overlay bioassay  ap. 1117-1124.  a2019-12-04  aThird-instar F1 progeny of several field-collected strains of soybean looper, Pseudoplusia includens (Walker), were exposed to artificial diet that was surface-treated with several concentrations of selected insecticides (permethrin [Ambush], Bacillus thuringiensis variety kurstaki [Condor OF], thiodicarb [Larvin], chlorfenapyr [Pirate], emamectin benzoate [Proclaim], or spinosad [Tracer]). LC50 s (72 h) for field strains were compared with a susceptible USDA reference strain to evaluate possible tolerance to these insecticides. Significant differences were found among LC50 s of all field strains and the susceptible USDA reference strain in the permethrin bioassays and among several field strains and the USDA strain in the B. thuringiensis, thiodicarb, and emamectin benzoate bioassays. In the chlorfenapyr bioassays, only 1 field strain from Winnsboro, LA, had a significantly greater LC50 than that of the USDA strain. In the spinosad bioassays, the only field strain with a significantly different LC50 than that of the USDA strain was the strain collected from Hamburg, LA, and this strain had a lower LC50 than that of the USDA strain. These data will serve as a historical database for monitoring soybean looper resistance to these compounds and should prove useful in the development of an insecticide resistance management program for this pest. 3ainsecticides 3aartificial diets 3aPseudoplusia includens 3astrain differences 3abioassays 3atoxicity 3ainsect control 3ainsecticide resistance 3aresistance management 0aresistance monitoring 0astrains1 aBoethel, D.J.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1997 Oct., v. 90, no. 5 p.1117-1124x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/90.5.11173Available from publisher's Web site  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03812naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100001700182245010600199300001600305500002400321500001500345520130500360650002801665650002301693650001901716650001401735650002601749650002501775650002301800650002901823650002301852650001401875650001601889650002001905650001901925650002701944650002601971650001501997650002102012650002702033650002002060650001202080650003602092650004002128650003302168650004102201650007302242650007802315650005302393650001002446650004202456650004602498650001502544650001002559650002402569651001002593651002502603653002902628653001502657700001502672700001902687700001902706700001602725773011402741852000902855856008502864930003302949945002502982946001103007655001203018IND4408051720221119015047.0080718e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440805172DNAL7 a184811922pmid7 a10.1007/s11259-008-9048-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX380 0aL8321 aWang, Haoju 10aEpidemiological survey on Escherichia coli O157 in Chongqing and Three-Gorge Reservoir Areas of China  ap. 449-461.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPrevalence, presence of virulence and adherence associated genes, genetic diversity, biochemical characteristics, and antibiotic susceptibility were determined for Escherichia coli O157 isolated over 4 months in Chongqing city and Three-Gorge Reservoir Areas. 11 isolates of E. coli O157 were isolated from 1504 samples and 7 of them are O157:H7 and 4 are O157:H? All O157:H7 isolates had eaeA, ehxA, EspA and Tccp genes, but did not have stx1 and stx2. All O157:H? isolates did not have stx1, stx2, eaeA, ehxA, EspA and Tccp genes except for the isolate obtained from Yunyang county which had stx1. When eaeA and ehxA presented in isolates were digested by restriction enzymes, the numbers and the sizes of the segments were the same as the control E. coli O157 strains. This suggests that eaeA and ehxA exhibit poor polymorphism. Most E. coli O157 isolates showed identical biochemical activities to the standard strains for sorbitol and rhamnose, and all E. coli O157:H7 obtained from feces at the same dairy cattle farm had similar biochemical characteristics. Antibiotic susceptibility demonstrated resistance of the isolates to penicillin, ampicillin, bacitracin, cefuroxime, erythromycin, gentamycin and tetracycline, indicating the isolates obtained in this study had a multi-drug resistance. 3aepidemiological studies 3adisease reservoirs 3ahuman diseases 3aphenotype 3aantibiotic resistance 3agenetic polymorphism 3adisease prevalence 3amultiple drug resistance 3abacterial adhesion 3avirulence 3aurban areas 3arisk assessment 3afood pathogens 3amolecular epidemiology 3aEscherichia coli O157 3apathotypes 3adomestic animals 3aEscherichia infections 3aanimal diseases 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domesticxmicrobiology 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aBacterial Adhesionxgenetics 2aDrug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial 2aEscherichia coli Infectionsxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aEscherichia coli O157xgeneticsxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aEscherichia coli Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGoats 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aPrevalence 2aSwine 2aVirulencexgenetics 3aChina 0aChinaxepidemiology. 0aEscherichia coli O157:H7 0areservoirs1 aMao, Xuhu 1 aDing, Honglei 1 aZou, Quanming 1 aPeng, Xiao 0 tVeterinary research communications.g2008 Aug., v. 32, no. 6 p.449-461dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-73807nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11259-008-9048-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20080911b20081011c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/09/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02739naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178100001800187245008300205300001800288500002400306500001500330520101300345650001901358650002201377650002301399650001101422650001701433650001501450650001501465650002001480650001301500650001401513650001201527650001701539650001201556650002701568650001001595650002001605650002801625650002101653650001301674650002401687650002201711650001601733650001901749650000901768653002401777653002901801700001401830773009901844852000901943856009001952930003302042945002502075946001302100655001202113IND4425295520221119014943.0090828e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442529552DNAL7 a196315262pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2009.06.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aP1201 aJaojaruek, K.10aNumerical simulation of the pyrolysis zone in a downdraft gasification process  ap. 6052-6058.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aModels of the gasification process are mostly based on lumped analysis with distinct zones of the process treated as one entity. The study presented here was conducted to develop a more useful model specifically for the pyrolysis zone of the reactor of a downdraft gasifier based on finite computation method. Applying principles of energy and mass conservation, governing equations formed were solved by implicit finite difference method on the node of 100 throughout the length of the considered pyrolysis range (20cm). Heat transfer considered convection, conduction, and the influence of solid radiation components. Chemical kinetics concept was also adopted to simultaneously solve the temperature profile and feedstock consumption rate on the pyrolysis zone. The convergence criteria were set at 10⁻⁶ and simulation used Fortran Power Station 4.0. Validation experiments were also conducted resulting in maximum deviation of 24°C and 0.37kg/h for temperature and feedstock feed rate, respectively. 3acarbon dioxide 3asimulation models 3amethane production 3abiogas 3ahydrocarbons 3awood chips 3acombustion 3acarbon monoxide 3ahydrogen 3apyrolysis 3abiomass 3agasification 2aBiomass 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aGases 2aHot Temperature 2aHydrocarbonsxchemistry 2aIndustrial Waste 2aKinetics 2aModels, Theoretical 2aOxygenxchemistry 2aTemperature 2aThermodynamics 2aWood 0amathematical models 0arenewable energy sources1 aKumar, S.0 tBioresource technology.g2009 Dec., v. 100, no. 23 p.6052-6058dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.06.0523Available from publisher's Web site  a20091129b20091204c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/11/29  aOther US 7aarticle02143naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245010100160300001600261500002400277520116300301650002901464650001401493650001001507650004501517650001301562650001601575700002301591700001401614700002401628773010801652852000901760856004801769655001201817IND4417386720221119014932.0090306e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441738672DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-008-0950-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Feinan12aA detailed synteny map of the eggplant genome based on conserved ortholog set II (COSII) markers  ap. 927-935.  aIncludes references  aWe report herein the mapping of 115 PCR-based orthologous markers, including 110 conserved ortholog set or COSII markers, on the reference RFLP map of eggplant. The result permitted inference of a detailed syntenic relationship between the eggplant and tomato genomes. Further, the position of additional 522 COSII markers was inferred in the eggplant map via eggplant-tomato synteny, bringing the total number of markers in the eggplant genome to 869. Since divergence from their last common ancestor approximately 12 million years ago, the eggplant and tomato genomes have become differentiated by a minimum number of 24 inversions and 5 chromosomal translocations, as well as a number of single gene transpositions possibly triggered by transposable elements. Nevertheless, the two genomes share 37 conserved syntenic segments (CSSs) within which gene/marker order is well preserved. The high-resolution COSII synteny map described herein provides a platform for cross-reference of genetic and genomic information (including the tomato genome sequence) between eggplant and tomato and therefore will facilitate both applied and basic research in eggplant. 3achromosome translocation 3aeggplants 3agenes 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3atomatoes 3atransposons1 aEannetta, Nancy T.1 aXu, Yimin1 aTanksley, Steven D.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2009 Mar., v. 118, no. 5 p.927-935dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-008-0950-9 7aarticle02418naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245005400168300001600222520127900238650001301517650002101530650001401551650002001565650002001585650002301605650002501628650004301653650001401696650001701710650002201727700001901749700002001768773009901788852000901887856009201896939003301988946001102021655001202032IND4458485720221119014853.0110527e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445848572DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-789X.2010.00845.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Kort, S.10aLeaky gut and diabetes mellitus: what is the link  ap. 449-458.  aDiabetes mellitus is a chronic disease requiring lifelong medical attention. With hundreds of millions suffering worldwide, and a rapidly rising incidence, diabetes mellitus poses a great burden on healthcare systems. Recent studies investigating the underlying mechanisms involved in disease development in diabetes point to the role of the dys-regulation of the intestinal barrier. Via alterations in the intestinal permeability, intestinal barrier function becomes compromised whereby access of infectious agents and dietary antigens to mucosal immune elements is facilitated, which may eventually lead to immune reactions with damage to pancreatic beta cells and can lead to increased cytokine production with consequent insulin resistance. Understanding the factors regulating the intestinal barrier function will provide important insight into the interactions between luminal antigens and immune response elements. This review analyses recent advances in the mechanistic understanding of the role of the intestinal epithelial barrier function in the development of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Given our current knowledge, we may assume that reinforcing the intestinal barrier can offer and open new therapeutic horizons in the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. 3aantigens 3achronic diseases 3acytokines 3ahealth services 3aimmune response 3ainsulin resistance 3aislets of Langerhans 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apathogens 3apermeability 3aresponse elements1 aKeszthelyi, D.1 aMasclee, A.A.M.0 tObesity reviews.g2011 June, v. 12, no. 6 p.449-458dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-78817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-789X.2010.00845.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110527  aNon-US 7aarticle03528naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100002300160245014200183300001600325500002400341500001500365520149100380650000801871650001401879650001401893650000901907650001501916650002401931650002501955650001701980650001301997650001402010650001002024650003002034650003502064650003702099650002002136650003302156650002102189650002402210650001102234650002102245650005102266650003002317650002002347650006402367650000902431650002702440650005902467650004002526650002202566650001602588653001302604700001502617700002602632700002002658773011002678852000902788856008102797655001202878IND4457081020221119014910.0110423e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445708102DNAL7 a214302502pmid7 a10.3945/jn.110.1364402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeifert, Stephanie10aProbiotic Lactobacillus casei Shirota Supplementation Does Not Modulate Immunity in Healthy Men with Reduced Natural Killer Cell Activity  ap. 978-984.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aOral intake of probiotic bacteria may beneficially modulate functions of NK cells. In healthy individuals, contradictory results exist as to whether NK cell functions can be modulated by probiotic bacteria. Therefore, the primary objective of our randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was to determine the effects of the probiotic strain Lactobacillus casei Shirota (LcS) on the activity of NK cells in healthy men who had been preselected for a reduced lytic function of their NK cells. Study participants (n = 68) were supplemented for 4 wk with a probiotic drink providing 1.95 x 10¹⁰ CFU LcS/d or with a similar milk drink without probiotic additive. A run-in period of 2 wk preceded the probiotic supplementation followed by a 2-wk follow-up phase without the probiotic or control drink. Changes in the relative proportions of NK cells and other leukocytes as well as multiple functional measurements were determined longitudinally at baseline, after the 4-wk supplementation, and at the end of the follow-up. The probiotic supplementation had no significant effect on NK cell numbers and function or on phagocytosis, respiratory burst, or cytokine secretion of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In conclusion, 4 wk of supplementation with LcS does not increase NK cell activity in healthy men with a reduced NK cell lytic activity. However, other doses of LcS, time of intervention, or differences, e.g. in the background diet, may result in a different outcome. 3amen 3asecretion 3abeverages 3amilk 3aprobiotics 3aLactobacillus casei 3anatural killer cells 3aphagocytosis 3abacteria 3aadditives 2aAdult 2aCD56 Antigenxmetabolism. 2aBiomarkersxbloodxmetabolism. 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aCells, Cultured 2aCytokinesxbloodxsecretion. 2aCytophagocytosis 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aHumans 2aImmunomodulation 2aKiller Cells, Naturalximmunologyxphysiology. 2aLacticaseibacillus casei. 2aLeukocyte Count 2aLeukocytes, Mononuclearximmunologyxphysiologyxsecretion. 2aMale 2aMitogensxpharmacology 2aNatural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 1xmetabolism 2aProbioticsxadministration & dosage 2aRespiratory Burst 2aYoung Adult 0aimmunity1 aBub, Achim1 aFranz, Charles M.A.P.1 aWatzl, Bernhard0 tJournal of nutrition.g2011 May, v. 141, no. 5 p.978-984dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/jn.110.1364403Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03561naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001700141245014000158300001800298520206400316650002302380650003502403650001102438650001302449650001702462650001902479650001002498650001602508650001902524650002102543650002302564651002902587653001302616653001802629700001702647700002102664700001902685700001502704700001602719700001802735700001702753700001702770700001702787773009002804852000902894856008102903930003302984945001303017946001303030655001203043IND2123451920221119015028.0980618e199710  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212345192DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/90.5.13322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuller, B.W.10aOptimization of soil insecticide rates for managing corn rootworm (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) larvae in the north central United States  ap. 1332-1340.  aOptimization of soil-applied granular insecticides for control of northern and western corn rootworms, Diabrotica barberi Smith & Lawrence and D. virgifera virgifera LeConte, respectively, was investigated in 8 states in the north central United States. Differences in success ratios (Yes:No, whether root ratings were maintained below the economic injury level) of corn rootworm insecticide rates were analyzed at state and regional levels. The following insecticide rate comparisons were carried out: 0.5 versus 1X rate and 0.75 versus 1X for chlorpyrifos, fonofos, phorate, tefluthrin, terbufos; and 0.6 versus 1X and 0.8 versus 1X for chlorethoxyfos. Regional data also were analyzed using 3.0 and 3.5 (based on 1 to 6 root rating scale) economic injury levels under low, medium, and high rootworm feeding damage. Individual state data were analyzed under combined feeding pressures (low to high) at both 3.0 and 3.5 economic injury levels. Under high rootworm pressure and using an economic injury level of 3.0, there were no significant success ratio (lowest versus 1X rate) differences at the regional level, regardless of insecticide. Findings within individual states may be more important than regional analyses when interpreting optimum insecticide rate performances. Significant within-state differences between success ratios of low and 1X rates (chlorethoxyfos in South Dakota, chlorpyrifos in Minnesota, fonofos in Iowa, phorate in Iowa and Wisconsin, and terbufos in Iowa), although infrequent, were observed using the more conservative 3.0 economic injury level. No failures were seen using tefluthrin (0.5 versus 1X that was evaluated in only half of the participating states). With the exception of the 0.5 versus 1X fonofos rate comparison in Iowa, all incidences of significant failure were eliminated at the 3.5 economic injury level (lowest versus 1X comparisons). Thus, less-than-labeled rates of these insecticides applied in an 18-cm band can be used to manage rootworm larvae effectively with as much consistency as full (1X) rates. 3aDiabrotica barberi 3aDiabrotica virgifera virgifera 3alarvae 3aZea mays 3ainsecticides 3asoil treatment 3aroots 3acrop damage 3ainsect control 3aapplication rate 3aeconomic threshold 3aMidwestern United States 0aefficacy 0areduced rates1 aBoetel, M.A.1 aWalgenbach, D.D.1 aGrundler, J.A.1 aHein, G.L.1 aJarvi, K.J.1 aKeaster, A.J.1 aLandis, D.A.1 aMeinke, L.J.1 aOleson, J.D.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1997 Oct., v. 90, no. 5 p.1332-1340x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/90.5.13323Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle01726naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002100127245009400148300002100242520085400263650002501117650002201142653002301164700002701187700002401214773011801238852000901356930003301365945002501398946001301423655001201436IND4424462720221119014631.0090813e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442446272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aVercauteren, Nikki10aEstimation of wet surface evaporation from sensible heat flux measurements  ap. W06424 (7 p.  aA new method is proposed to estimate wet surface evaporation by means of measurements of sensible heat flux and of air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed at one level only. This formulation is made possible by the linearization of the Bowen ratio, a common assumption in other methods, such as Penman's model and its derivatives. The method will be useful in those cases where the sensible heat flux is more reliably acquired at field scales than the net radiation and the ground heat flux, which are needed in many operational methods because of energy budget considerations. Indeed, the ground heat flux is a notoriously difficult variable to measure on wet surfaces, such as lakes or wetlands, especially at the appropriate length scales, whereas sensible heat flux can be obtained from standard temperature variance methods or other instruments such as scintillometers. The proposed method was tested with field experimental data taken over Lake Geneva in Switzerland, where it showed excellent agreement with evaporation rates measured using eddy covariance techniques. 3aestimation 3aevaporation 3asurfaces 3aheat 3aair temperature 3arelative humidity 3awind speed 3asimulation models 3afield experimentation 3ahydrologic models 3acovariance 3aSwitzerland1 aBou-Zeid, Elie1 aHuwald, Hendrik1 aParlange, Marc B.1 aBrutsaert, Wilfried0 tWater resources research.g2009 June, v. 45, no. 6 p.W06424 (7 p-W06424 (7 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20090831b00000000c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/08/31  aOther US 7aarticle02011naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001600141245007900157300001800236500001500254520084300269650001601112650002601128650001401154650001601168650001901184650004301203651001501246653001501261653001101276653001601287653002301303700002001326700001601346773009001362852000901452856008101461930003301542945001301575946001301588655001201601IND2123451220221119014605.0980618e199710  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212345122DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/90.5.13002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZalom, F.G.10aFruit damage by stink bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) in bush-type tomatoes  ap. 1300-1306.  a2019-12-04  aAdult stink bugs were introduced onto caged, bush-type tomatoes to establish the amount of fruit damage resulting from different durations of infestation (up to 20 d), densities (1, 3, 5, and 10 bugs per 2 m of row), species (Euschistus conspersus Uhler and Chlorochroa uhleri (Stal)) and reduced fruit abundance (75, 50, and 0% reduction).

The present research determined the oil content and fatty acid profiles of seeds from eight caatinga species. Seed oils were extracted in a Soxhlet system, and their fatty acid content identified by GC-MS. Oil content varied between 20.2% in Tabebuia impetiginosa (Mart.) Standl. (Bignoniaceae) and 46.4% in Barnebya harleyi (W.R. Anderson '' B. Gates) Malpighiaceae. Anemopaegma laeve DC. (Bignoniaceae) had the highest oleic acid content (63.4%), while high levels of linoleic acid were found in Banisteriopsis pubipetala (Juss.) Cuatrec. (42.8%) and B. harleyi (31.9%) (both Malpighiaceae). Palmitic acid was the major fatty acid (50%) in Hippocratea volubilis (L.) (Celastraceae). High levels of linoleic and linolenic acids were found in Croton adamantinus Mull. Arg. (Euphorbiaceae), averaging 44.2% and 45.2% respectively. Gadoleic acid in was the most abundant fatty acid in the oil produced by Serjania lethalis A. St. Hill. (Sapindaceae), averaging 69.6%. B. pubipetala, B. harleyi, C. adamantinus, and H. volubilis were identified as promising species for cultivation. 3aMalpighiaceae 3aBignoniaceae 3aCelastraceae 3aEuphorbiaceae 3aSapindaceae 3aoil crops 3aoilseed crops 3afatty acid composition 3alipid content 3asemiarid zones 3avegetation 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aBioelectric Energy Sources 2aFatty Acidsxchemistry 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aHydrolysis 2aLinoleic Acidxchemistry 2aOils 2aOleic Acidxchemistry 2aPalmitic Acidxchemistry 2aPlant Extracts 2aPlant Oilsxchemistry 2aSeedsxmetabolism 3aBrazil 0aBrazil 0acaatinga1 aOliveira, A.F.M.1 aSilva, S.I.0 tBioresource technology.g2009 Dec., v. 100, no. 23 p.6114-6117dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.06.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20091129b20091204c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/11/29  aOther US 7aarticle03100naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245010500147300001800252500002400270520158000294650001501874650002001889650002501909650001601934650001801950650002001968650002301988650001002011650001502021650002202036650001802058650001202076650000902088650001402097650001202111650002802123650001302151650003502164650004002199650002602239650002702265650000902292650000902301650002502310700002102335700001602356700001502372700001702387700001802404773011502422852000902537655001202546IND4366822720221119015058.0050128e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436682272DNAL7 a155700292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWegmuller, R.10aParticle size reduction and encapsulation affect the bioavailability of ferric pyrophosphate in rats  ap. 3301-3304.  aIncludes references  aParticle size is an important determinant of Fe absorption from poorly soluble Fe compounds in foods. Decreasing the particle size of elemental iron powders increases their absorption. The effect of a reduction in particle size on the bioavailability of ferric pyrophosphate (FePP) is unclear. Encapsulation of iron compounds for food fortification may protect against adverse sensory changes, but at the same time may reduce bioavailability. The hemoglobin (Hb) repletion method in weanling Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 100) was used to compare the relative bioavailability (RBV) of 4 forms of FePP: 1) regular FePP [mean particle size (MPS) approximately equal to 21 micrometer]; 2) MPS approximately equal to 2.5 micrometer; 3) MPS approximately equal to 2.5 micrometer encapsulated in hydrogenated palm oil; and 4) MPS approximately equal to 0.5 micrometer with emulsifiers. The RBV compared with ferrous sulfate was calculated by the slope-ratio technique. The RBV was 43% for encapsulated MPS approximately equal to 2.5 micrometer, significantly lower than the other FePP compounds (P < 0.05), 59% for the regular FePP, and 69% for MPS approximately equal to 2.5 micrometer, not different from each other but significantly lower than ferrous sulfate (P < 0.05), and 95% for emulsified MPS approximately equal to 0.5 micrometer, comparable to ferrous sulfate. Encapsulation of FePP with hydrogenated palm oil at a capsule:substrate ratio of 60:40 decreased RBV. Particle size reduction increases the RBV of FePP and may make this compound more useful for food fortification. 3aabsorption 3abioavailability 3aelementary particles 3aemulsifiers 3aencapsulation 3aferrous sulfate 3afood fortification 3afoods 3ahemoglobin 3ahydrogenated oils 3aparticle size 3apowders 3arats 3arepletion 2aAnimals 2aBiological Availability 2aCapsules 2aDiphosphatesxpharmacokinetics 2aFerrous Compoundsxpharmacokinetics 2aIntestinal Absorption 2aIronxpharmacokinetics 2aMale 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley1 aZimmermann, M.B.1 aMoretti, D.1 aArnold, M.1 aLanghans, W.1 aHurrell, R.F.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2004 Dec., v. 134, no. 12 p.3301-3304dAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007000126300001600196500001500212520141300227650001901640650001401659650002101673650002001694650001001714650002101724650001401745650001201759650002601771650001301797650001901810650002801829650002201857650002001879650001101899653001501910653002201925653001901947653001401966653002201980653001302002653002202015700002902037773007902066852000902145939003302154946001302187655001202200IND9205277720221119014912.0920821s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920527772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelda, R.M.10aMineral nutrition of wheat. I. Organ and crop stage relationships  ap. 359-369.  a2019-12-04  aWinter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Astral) was grown under seven fertilizer treatments on five experimental sites. Regression analysis was performed to model the relationships between different organ weights in the same or consecutive stages. The frequency of highly significant relationships between weights was higher during flowering and shooting than during the other stages studied: i.e. tillering, post-anthesis, and harvesting. The relationship between the plant weight and the weights of the flag leaf or the 2nd youngest leaf was closer than that between the plant weight and that of the third youngest leaf and plant weight. The coefficient of correlation was higher than when ear weight was related to the plant weight in post-anthesis, where there was no 2nd or 3rd youngest leaves. This relationship was closer than in flowering. Plant growth before anthesis was more regular than after anthesis. It appeared that the development of the leaf and of the ear affected the relationships between themselves and the rest of the plant. In terms of weight, the relationships were closest at the stage of maximum development. The weight of the youngest leaves at anthesis, when it attained a maximum, was a suitable indicator of plant biomass. It can, therefore, be used as a reference in the relationship between plant biomass and mineral content that expresses the nutritional status of the plant. 3afilling period 3aflowering 3anitrogen content 3aplant nutrition 3aseeds 3anutrient content 3atillering 3acalcium 3anutrient availability 3anitrogen 3ainflorescences 3adry matter accumulation 3aTriticum aestivum 3amineral content 3aleaves 0amaturation 0amineral nutrition 0aplant analysis 0aflag leaf 0acrop growth stage 0aleaf age 0aplant development1 aSanchez de la Puente, L.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1992, v. 15, no. 3 p.359-369x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02495naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002400127245010200151300002100253500001500274520138700289650002301676650001801699650001701717650002101734650001501755650002701770650001501797650002501812650001301837650002001850653001701870700002401887773011801911852000902029930003302038945002502071946001302096655001202109IND4424456120221119014920.0090813e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442445612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRandhir, Timothy O.10aMultiattribute optimization of restoration options: Designing incentives for watershed management  ap. W03405 (13 p.  a2019-12-04  aWatershed restoration requires careful assessment of impairment in ecosystem attributes to design appropriate conservation policies. This study applies a multiattribute optimization framework for evaluating relative gains in restoration based on potential improvements in economic and environmental attributes related to water quality, habitat, and urbanization. Policy mechanisms through direct compensation of restoration activities are evaluated based on single-attribute and multiattribute optimization and watershed response to varying levels of restoration incentives. Results indicate that tradeoffs in economic and environmental objectives are critical to identifying optimal restoration strategies at a watershed scale. The multiattribute optimization method developed in this study balances levels of multiple attributes and reflects tradeoffs in preferences for each attribute. Through an evaluation of a variety of attributes for relative gains and costs, opportunities exist for strategic selection of restoration activities in subwatersheds. The multiattribute method is found to be superior to the single-objective method in incorporation of tradeoffs, balancing economic and environmental impacts, and development of participatory solutions. Multiattribute assessment and policies are important for cost-effective and consensus-based watershed restoration practices. 3acost effectiveness 3awater quality 3aurbanization 3awater management 3awatersheds 3aecological restoration 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3ahabitats 3aeconomic impact 0aoptimization1 aShriver, Deborah M.0 tWater resources research.g2009 Mar., v. 45, no. 3 p.W03405 (13 p-W03405 (13 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20090901b00000000c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/09/01  aOther US 7aarticle02705naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001900140245013700159300001600296520136900312650002501681650001801706650001901724650001401743650002701757650001401784650002001798650001901818650002001837650001701857650000901874650001401883650002001897653001101917653002701928653002401955700001601979700001601995773008802011852000902099856008002108930003302188945001302221946001302234655001202247IND2062777020221119014923.0980327e199706  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206277702DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/90.3.8372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShanower, T.G.10aSurvival, growth, fecundity, and behavior of Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) on pigeonpea and two wild Cajanus species  ap. 837-841.  aSurvival, growth, fecundity, and behavior of Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) were compared on pods of cultivated pigeonpea, Cajanus cajan (L.) Millspaugh, and 2 wild species, C. scarabaeoides. (L.) Thouars, and C. platycarpus (Bentham) van der Maeson. Larval survival was 21% on C. scarabaeoides, 56% on C. platycarpus, and 78% on C. cajan. Pupal survival was high on all 3 Cajanus species. Seven-day-old larvae reared on C. scarabaeoides pods weighed significantly less at 18 d, took longer to pupate and produced significantly smaller pupae than those fed on C. cajan pods. Larval period and weight, and pupal weight when reared on C. platycarpus were intermediate and significantly different from the other 2 species. Differences in pupal duration were not significant between larvae reared on the 3 Cajanus species. Larvae on C. scarabaeoides spent significantly less time feeding and significantly more time off the pod than larvae on the other 2 species. Acetone extracts of C. cajan and C. platycarpus pods had a significant feeding stimulant effect on H. armigera larvae, whereas extracts from C. scarabaeoides pods had no effect. Water extract of C. scarabaeoides pods had a significant antifeedant effect though similar extracts from C. cajan and C. platycarpus pods had no effect. Application of these results to resistance breeding programs is discussed. 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3aCajanus cajan 3awild relatives 3amortality 3abiological development 3afecundity 3aanimal behavior 3aplant extracts 3aphagostimulants 3aantifeedants 3apods 3atrichomes 3apest resistance 0agrowth 0acajanus scarabaecoides 0acajanus platycarpus1 aYoshida, M.1 aPeter, A.J.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1997 June, v. 90, no. 3 p.837-841x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/90.3.8373Available from publisher's Web site  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02671naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245015800128300001600286520159200302650001901894650001401913650001501927650001601942650002201958650003201980650002502012650001702037650001102054650001302065650001302078650001602091651001702107700001802124700001702142773007302159852000902232939003302241946001102274655001202285IND9205279820221119014640.0920821e199204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920527982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamhamedi, M.10aHydrulic conductance and soil water potential at the soil-root interface of Pinus pinaster seedlings inoculated with different dikaryons of Pisolithus sp  ap. 231-244.  aSeedlings of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) were inoculated with different dikaryons of Pisolithus sp. from South Africa to determine the influence of extension of the extramatrical phase and diameter of the mycelial strands on water relations parameters including xylem water potential, soil water potential at the soil root interface and hydraulic conductance (Lp) during and after a period of water stress. Seedlings inoculated with dikaryons having an extensive extramatrical phase and large diameter mycelial strands showed higher soil water potential (-2 MPa) during severe water stress than seedlings inoculated with dikaryons producing fine hyphae and sparse extramatrical phases (-3.8 MPa). Seedlings inoculated with strand-forming dikaryons recovered faster from water stress than did non-inoculated seedlings or seedlings inoculated with non-strand-forming dikaryons. Architectural aspects of the extramatrical phase, including the presence of large diameter mycelial strands or fine hyphae, influenced the soil-root contact and the water relations of an inoculated host plant. When water stress was not limiting, the architecture of the extramatrical phase did not have a large effect on soil water potential. It is suggested that the architecture of the extramatrical phase influences the resistance to water flow through the soil-root interface and that large mycelial strands increase the water flow by bridging the gap between the soil and the root. These changes in physiology indicate that dikaryons can improve the survival of Pinus pinaster under dry conditions. 3aPinus pinaster 3aseedlings 3aPisolithus 3akaryotyping 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aroot hydraulic conductivity 3asoil water potential 3awater stress 3ahyphae 3adiameter 3amycelium 3amycorrhizae 3aSouth Africa1 aBernier, P.Y.1 aFortin, J.A.0 tTree physiology.g1992 Apr., v. 10, no. 3 p.231-244x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03321naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245015400166300001800320520153700338650002901875650001101904650001201915650002001927650002701947650002101974650002701995650002602022650001602048650001802064650003102082650004202113650004702155650002102202650004802223650001302271650002702284650001302311650005902324650004102383650002902424653004002453700001602493700001602509700001702525700001502542700002002557700002102577700002002598773007202618852000902690939003302699946001102732655001202743IND9205278920221119014651.0920821e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920527892DNAL7 a16286122pmid7 aPMC5567132pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMistou, M.Y.10aMutations of Ha-ras p21 that define important regions for the molecular mechanism of the SDC25 C-domain, a guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator  ap. 2391-2397.  aThe SDC25 C-domain is a very active guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator (GDS) isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae which acts equally well on Haras p21 and yeast RAS2. These properties make the SDC25 C-domain a suitable tool to study the basic mechanism of a GDS. The action of the SDC25 C-domain was analysed by mutation of structurally important regions of p21. Substitutions that influence the coordination of Mg2+. GDP or the interaction of the guanine ring were found to stimulate the intrinsic dissociation of GDP and suppress the action of the SDC25 C-domain. No relevant effects were observed with mutations in the phosphate binding loop L1 or by deleting the last 23 C-terminal residues of p21. Substitutions in the switch region 1 (loop L2) and 2 (loop LA) of p21 strongly impaired the action of this GDS; however, we show that this effect is not related to a decreased affinity of the SDC25 C-domain for the mutated p21. No functional competition could be found between this GDS and the catalytic domain of the human GTPase activating protein (GAP). This indicates that GDS and GAP bind to different sites of the p21 . nucleotide complex, even though the same mutations in loops L2 and L4 regions affect the activity of both effectors. Since these two regions appear not to be involved directly in the interaction with GDS, we conclude that the negative effect induced by their mutation is related to their function as switches of selective conformations during the GDP to GTP exchange reaction catalysed by GDS. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3ahumans 3aenzymes 3aenzyme activity 3amolecular conformation 3abinding proteins 3aguanosine triphosphate 3aguanosine diphosphate 3amutagenesis 3abinding sites 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aFungal Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGTP-Binding Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGuanine Nucleotidesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aKinetics 2aMolecular Conformation 2aMutation 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)xchemistryxgenetics. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexmetabolism 2arap GTP-Binding Proteins 0aguanine nucleotide binding proteins1 aJacquet, E.1 aPoullet, P.1 aRensland, H.1 aGideon, P.1 aSchlichting, I.1 aWittinghofer, A.1 aParmeggiani, A.0 tEMBO journal.g1992 July, v. 11, no. 7 p.2391-2397x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03058naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001600140245010400156300001600260520197800276650001402254650001902268650002002287650002002307650001402327650001202341650001402353650001602367650001102383650001402394653001102408700001702419773008802436852000902524856008002533930003302613945001302646946001302659655001202672IND2062777220221119014703.0980327e199706  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206277722DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/90.3.8422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElden, T.C.10aPotato leafhopper (Homoptera: Cicadellidae) resistance in perennial glandular-haired alfalfa clones  ap. 842-847.  aPerennial glandular-haired alfalfa (Medicago) species and hybrids have been implicated with resistance to the potato leafhopper, Empoasca fabae (Harris). However, the development of potato leafhopper resistant alfalfa germplasm using the glandular hair trait has met with limited success. The objectives of this study were to quantitate and determine the association of glandular hairs with potato leafhopper resistance in 19 selected clones from an alfalfa population developed for improved vigor and disease and potato leafhopper resistance. The density of glandular hairs on the leaf midveins, petioles, and stems were measured. Selected clones were screened in a laboratory no-choice test for resistance to adult potato leafhopper feeding damage, survival, and oviposition. Differences in glandular hair densities among clones were highly significant for all plant parts measured. As the plants aged, glandular hair density among plants within clones increased and density variation decreased. Significant variation was observed among clones for all the potato leafhopper resistance variables measured. Percentage of adult mortality ranged from 13 to 96 and nymphal populations ranged from 0 to 33. Associations between glandular hair densities on petioles and stems with all the potato leafhopper resistance variables were significantly correlated but the correlations were not strong. Stem glandular hair density had the highest associations with the potato leafhopper resistant variables. The presence of a glandular hair exudate and physical entrapment of potato leafhopper nymphs or adults were not observed in the clones used in this study. Results of this study suggest that the glandular hairs present on the selected clones used in this study are associated with a compound that is toxic or repellent to the potato leafhopper. This study also demonstrates that the glandular hair trait is potentially useful in developing potato leafhopper resistant cultivars. 3anutrition 3aEmpoasca fabae 3aMedicago sativa 3apest resistance 3atrichomes 3adensity 3amortality 3aoviposition 3aclones 3agermplasm 0adamage1 aMcCaslin, M.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1997 June, v. 90, no. 3 p.842-847x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/90.3.8423Available from publisher's Web site  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03010naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002400149245011800173300001800291520095600309650002201265650001601287650001601303650002601319650001201345650001501357650001101372650001101383650002501394650001801419650002001437650005001457650002401507650001201531650002201543650001101565650002001576650001701596650002701613650000801640650000901648650001001657650004901667650003801716650001101754650003101765650004701796650003401843650002801877650002801905650002901933650004001962653002502002653003202027700001202059700001702071700001302088700001502101700001602116700001602132700001502148773007202163852000902235939003302244946001102277655001202288IND9205279020221119014657.0920821e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920527902DNAL7 a16286142pmid7 aPMC5567152pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStieneke-Grober, A.10aInfluenza virus hemagglutinin with multibasic cleavage site is activated by furin, a subtilisin-like endoprotease  ap. 2407-2414.  aMany viruses have membrane glycoproteins that are activated at cleavage sites containing multiple arginine and lysine residues by cellular proteases so far not identified. The proteases responsible for cleavage of the hemagglutinin of fowl plague virus, a prototype of these glycoproteins, has now been isolated from Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells. The enzyme has a mol. wt of 85 000, a pH optimum ranging from 6.5 to 7.5, is calcium dependent and recognizes the consensus sequence R-X-K/R-R at the cleavage site of the hemagglutinin. Using a specific antiserum it has been identified as furin, a subtilisin-like eukaryotic protease. The fowl plague virus hemagglutinin was also cleaved after coexpression with human furin from cDNA by vaccinia virus vectors. Peptidyl chloroalkylketones containing the R-X-K/R-R motif specifically bind to the catalytic site of furin and are therefore potent inhibitors of hemagglutinin cleavage and fusion activity. 3aInfluenza A virus 3aproteolysis 3aproteinases 3aproteinase inhibitors 3akidneys 3acell lines 3acattle 3ahumans 3aamino acid sequences 3abinding sites 2aAffinity Labels 2aAmino Acid Chloromethyl Ketonesxpharmacology 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Western 2aCattle 2aCells, Cultured 2aChick Embryo 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aDNA 2aDogs 2aFurin 2aHemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus 2aHemagglutinins, Viralxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aInfluenza A virusxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aMembrane Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSubtilisinsxmetabolism 2aVaccinia virusxgenetics 2aViral Envelope Proteinsxmetabolism 0aviral hemagglutinins 0apeptidyl chloroalkylketones1 aVey, M.1 aAngliker, H.1 aShaw, E.1 aThomas, G.1 aRoberts, C.1 aKlenk, H.D.1 aGarten, W.0 tEMBO journal.g1992 July, v. 11, no. 7 p.2407-2414x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01278naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007600125300001600201500001500217520029400232650002200526650002200548650002700570650002100597650002500618650002500643650002100668653000800689653001900697653002800716653001600744700001500760700001800775773005800793852000900851939003300860946001100893655001200904IND9205278720221119014631.0920821s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920527872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFawell, E.12aA homologue of the ras-related CDC42 gene from Schizosaccharomyce pombe  ap. 153-154.  a2019-12-04  aA cDNA was isolated from the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, using mixed oligodeoxyribonucleotides encoding part of the GTP-binding site of the ras superfamily.

As a genetic source, we assembled 8 colonies that we thought had potential for resistance to varroa. Queens and drones were propagated from this group to produce 43 instrumentally inseminated queens, each queen mated to only 1 drone. Colonies from 27 of these queens were tested in Louisiana and 16 were tested in Michigan. Each colony in the Louisiana test began with 988 +/- 13 g (mean +/- SD) of bees and approximately 290 mites; Michigan colonies began with 3,212 +/- 171 bees and approximately 51 mites. The populations of mites and bees were measured 10 wk later. Three of the 43 colonies had fewer mites at the end of the test than at the beginning. During the experiment, we evaluated each colony for grooming behavior, hygienic behavior, the duration of the postcapping period, and the frequency of nonreproducing mites in brood cells. Of these 4 characteristics, only nonreproduction of mites was highly related to a change in the mite population. The duration of the postcapping period was marginally related, and the other 2 characteristics were apparently unrelated to the growth of the mite population. This study showed that resistance to varroa mites is present in the honey bee population in the United States, nonreproduction of mites was highly correlated with the growth of a mite population, and nonreproduction of mites may be a valuable characteristic for selecting bees for resistance to varroa mites. 3aApis mellifera 3aVarroa jacobsoni 3apopulation density 3apest resistance 3aartificial selection 3aMichigan 3aLouisiana 0areproduction 0abreeding 0amite nonreproduction1 aHoopingarner, R.A.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1997 Aug., v. 90, no. 4 p.893-898x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/90.4.8933Available from publisher's Web site  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03689naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001900157245008000176300001800256500002400274520184200298650001502140650001302155650002402168650001302192650001102205650001002216650001802226650001502244650001202259650001402271650002202285650001302307650002602320650002802346650005502374650005202429650005902481650002302540650004202563650005302605650005602658650005602714650004202770650002702812700002202839700001902861700001702880700002302897773011602920852000903036856007803045655001203123IND4385846520221119015215.0061210e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438584652DNAL7 a170771832pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erl1782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayama, Hiroko10aEthylene-regulation of fruit softening and softening-related genes in peach  ap. 4071-4077.  aIncludes references  aTo investigate the role of ethylene in peach fruit softening during ripening, stony hard peach fruit, in which ethylene production is suppressed during ripening, were treated with various concentrations of ethylene. There was no noticeable decrease in flesh firmness without ethylene treatment, while applied ethylene, in the range 0.1-100 μl l⁻¹, resulted in fruit softening. Furthermore, the fruit softened more rapidly when the applied ethylene concentration was higher. When ethylene treatment was interrupted, the degree of softening was greatly reduced. These results indicated that continuous ethylene treatment was required for the initiation and progression of fruit softening and that ethylene concentration is also an important factor in regulating the rate of softening. Eight genes, which putatively encode cell wall metabolism-related proteins, were investigated for mRNA accumulation patterns in the two different softening phenotypes of melting and stony hard peaches. All of the mRNAs investigated accumulated in fruit of the melting-flesh 'Akatsuki' during ripening. By contrast, in the stony hard-flesh 'Manami', the mRNAs for a putative endopolygalacturonase (PpPG), an α-L-arabinofuranosidase/β-xylosidase (PpARF/XYL), and an expansin (PpExp3) showed either much lower levels or did not accumulate, and were identified as softening-related genes. Interruption of ethylene treatment indicated that these genes were regulated at the transcriptional level, and quickly responded to the presence or absence of ethylene before the softening response occurred, suggesting that ethylene directly regulates the transcription of these softening-related genes. These results suggested that cell wall metabolism, causing a rapid loss of firmness in peach fruit, may be controlled by ethylene at the transcriptional level. 3acell walls 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3afirmness 3afruits 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3apeaches 3aphenotype 3apolygalacturonase 3aproteins 2aCell Wallxmetabolism 2aEthylenesxpharmacology 2aFruitxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aNucleotide Mapping 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxpharmacology 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPolygalacturonasexchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPrunusxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA1 aShimada, Takehiko1 aFujii, Hiroshi1 aItō, Akiko.1 aKashimura, Yoshiki0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2006 Dec., v. 57, no. 15 p.4071-4077dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erl1783Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02709naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001600140245020100156300001600357520144200373650001901815650002101834650002001855650001701875650001501892650001101907650002301918650002301941650001401964650002101978651000901999653002302008653001402031700001802045773008802063852000902151856008002160930003302240945001302273946001302286655001202299IND2090724720221119014934.0980527e199708  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND209072472DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/90.4.9332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiles, K.L.10aReduced insecticide rates and strip-harvesting effects on alfalfa weevil (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) larval populations and prevalence of Zoophthora phytonomi (Entomophthorales: Entomophthoraceae)  ap. 933-944.  aIn 1994 and 1995, the effects of reduced insecticide rates and harvesting on Hypera postica (Gyllenhal) larval populations and prevalence of the fungal entomopathogen Zoophthora phytonomi Arthur were evaluated in alfalfa steps. Insecticide and harvest treatments were timed with predicted 1st occurrence of Z. phytonomi to maximize combined mortality. In Chariton, IA (1995), Lorsban 4 E (chlorpyrofos) applied at 0.140, 0.280, 0.560, and 1.120 kg (AI)/ha and Pounce 3.2 EC (permethrin) applied at 0.112 and 0.224 kg (AI)/ha reduced peak H. postica densities by >41% compared with control plots during an epizootic (>50% infection) of Z. phytonomi. Combined H. postica mortality was additive (insecticide and Z. phytonomi) in plots treated with Lorsban and Pounce and was 7.5-25.3 degrees C higher than in control plots. In Ames, IA (1994 and 1995), Lorsban, Pounce, and harvesting (1994) reduced H. postica densities during an enzootic (<50% infection) of Z. phytonomi; however, because of low levels of Z. phytonomi, combined mortality with treatments was negligible. This study demonstrated effective integrated management of H. postica by combining predictable mortality from Z. phytonomi and reduced rates of insecticides. The critical components of this integration were predictable levels of H. postica mortality by Z. phytonomi, and predictable mortality of weevil populations from reduced insecticide rates and strip-harvesting. 3aHypera postica 3aErynia phytonomi 3aMedicago sativa 3achlorpyrifos 3apermethrin 3alarvae 3apopulation density 3adisease prevalence 3amortality 3aapplication rate 3aIowa 0aintegrated control 0astripping1 aObrycki, J.J.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1997 Aug., v. 90, no. 4 p.933-944x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/90.4.9333Available from publisher's Web site  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02321naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002400127245011500151300002100266500001500287520131200302650002301614650001101637650001801648650002101666650001701687650002201704650001501726653001201741700002001753773011801773852000901891930003301900945002501933946001301958655001201971IND4424458220221119014918.0090813e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442445822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

W03424 (14 p.  a2019-12-04  aThe number of bars that form in an alluvial channel cross section can be determined from a physics-based linear model for alluvial bed topography. The classical approach defines separators between ranges in which river planform styles with certain numbers of bars are linearly stable and linearly unstable. We propose an alternative method that is easier to apply. Instead of defining separators between stable and unstable conditions for certain river planform styles, the method directly estimates the most likely number of bars. It is based on a demonstration that conditions of zero spatial damping in a linear model for steady bars are representative for the bar mode that develops inside a river channel. We argue that a method based on steady bars is more appropriate for real rivers than a method based on free migrating bars. We verified the method by applying it to several existing rivers at bankfull conditions. The results are good for width-to-depth ratios up to 100 but deteriorate for higher width-to-depth ratios. We explain the deficiencies for large width-to-depth ratios from the linearity of the model. The results show that our method can be used as a reliable predictor for whether reducing or enlarging the width of a river will lead to a meandering, transition, or braided planform. 3atemporal variation 3arivers 3alinear models 3amodel validation 3aspatial data 3ahydrologic models 3aprediction 0aphysics1 aMosselman, Erik0 tWater resources research.g2009 Mar., v. 45, no. 3 p.W03424 (14 p-W03424 (14 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20090901b00000000c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/09/01  aOther US 7aarticle02776naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001900140245013700159300001600296500001500312520145600327650002101783650001001804650001401814650002101828650001901849650001701868650002601885650001101911650002701922650001201949650001401961653004201975653002102017653001302038653002702051700001602078773008802094852000902182856008002191930003302271945001302304946001302317655001202330IND2107436820221119014724.0980528e199708  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND210743682DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/90.4.9882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuintela, E.D.10aEffects of imidacloprid on development, mobility, and survival of first instars of Diaprepes abbreviatus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae)  ap. 988-995.  a2019-12-04  aThe effect of imidacloprid on mortality and ecdysis of 1st instars of Diaprepes abbreviatus L. was determined using contact and oral exposure bioassays. The effect of contact exposure to imidacloprid on 1st-instar mobility was determined with and without a soil substrate. Greenhouse studies were conducted to determine possible systemic effects of different rates of imidacloprid applied as a soil drench on larval mortality and on root protection of container-grown citrus seedlings. When larvae were fed treated carrot or artificial diet at doses of 212.5 ppm, imidacloprid reduced feeding, which contributed to slower larval development and reduced ecdysis. Imidacloprid also affected larval mobility and development by contact exposure at doses >100 ppm. Larval mobility was impaired significantly in soil treated with imidacloprid at doses >6 micrograms/g of soil. In moistened soil, larval movement was significantly impaired at 6 micrograms/g of soil. Mortality caused by imidacloprid was slow for either mode of entry but was 6 times faster by oral than by contact exposure. When exposure to doses of imidacloprid was followed by periods without exposure to the chemical, larvae were able to recover. When imidacloprid was applied as a soil drench to container-grown citrus trees at 200 ppm, no larvae survived in the soil, suggesting death from starvation before reaching plant roots or death after feeding, on roots containing imidacloprid. 3aapplication rate 3aroots 3anutrition 3adietary exposure 3asoil treatment 3aimidacloprid 3aDiaprepes abbreviatus 3alarvae 3abiological development 3aecdysis 3amortality 0acitrus paradisi x poncirus trifoliata 0acontact exposure 0amovement 0aenvironmental exposure1 aMcCoy, C.W.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1997 Aug., v. 90, no. 4 p.988-995x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/90.4.9883Available from publisher's Web site  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03042naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001700141245010500158300001800263500001500281520163500296650001401931650001901945650001501964650002401979650001602003650001602019650002402035650001302059650002202072650002002094650002202114653002302136653002302159653001502182653002102197653002302218700001502241700001802256700001802274700001702292773009002309852000902399856008102408930003302489945001302522946001302535655001202548IND2123446820221119014615.0980618e199710  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212344682DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/90.5.10552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPorter, D.H.10aGreenbug (Homoptera:Aphididae) biotypes: selected by resistant cultivars or preadapted opportunists?  ap. 1055-1065.  a2019-12-04  aFuture advances in wheat, Triticum aestivum L., and sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench, resistance to greenbug, Schizaphis graminum (Rondani), will likely come from introduction of resistance transgenes into high-performance cultivars. First-generation resistance transgenes will be single genes that impart antibiosis traits (similar to Bacillus thuringiensis endotoxins in transgenic corn, Zea mays L.). This approach to pest management is incompatible with interpretations of simulation models that predict that deployment of antibiosis resistance controlled by single genes drives the development of new, virulent pest biotypes. This dichotomy must be addressed if full advantage is to be taken of the new, powerful tools of molecular biology for plant protection against insects. In this study, the specific insect-plant interactions of greenbugs on wheat and sorghum were examined to understand the relationship between the deployment of plant resistance and the development of new greenbug biotypes. From this analysis, there was no relationship between the use of resistant wheat and the development of new greenbug biotypes. For sorghum, with only 3 of the 11 biotypes could there be any correlation between the use of resistant hybrids and the development of new biotypes. Even with these 3 biotypes, no clear cause-and-effect relationship was established. Based on analysis of these specific insect-plant interactions, we propose that future plant resistance efforts focus on the use of the most effective resistance genes, despite past predictions of what effect these genes may have on greenbug population genetics. 3acultivars 3aplant breeding 3ahost range 3aSchizaphis graminum 3ahost plants 3aplant pests 3avarietal resistance 3abiotypes 3aTriticum aestivum 3aSorghum bicolor 3agenetic variation 0agenetic resistance 0aliterature reviews 0aadaptation 0aresistance genes 0aselection pressure1 aBurd, J.D.1 aShufran, K.A.1 aWebster, J.A.1 aTeetes, G.L.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1997 Oct., v. 90, no. 5 p.1055-1065x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/90.5.10553Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle01969naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100003700152245012000189300001600309500002400325520088600349650001201235650001901247653001201266653001701278700002001295700001801315700004001333773012501373852000901498856009201507930003301599946001101632655001201643IND4407910120221119014930.0080718e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440791012DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.2008.00837.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFERNÁNDEZ PRIETO, JOSÉ ANTONIO10aOn the identity of Festuca jubata Lowe (Poaceae) and the description of a new Festuca species in the Azores Islands  ap. 493-499.  aIncludes references  aThe majority of authors consider Festuca jubata Lowe as an endemic species common to Madeira and the Azores.

Azorean plants usually identified as F. jubata had a character combination distinct from that of those with a Madeiran provenance. Saint-Yves' proposal of two independent taxa was correct, but he erroneously considered F. jubata as an Azorean endemic because the name F. jubata was based on Madeiran plants.

Economic performance (monetary losses associated with color deterioration) for US beef from vitamin E supplemented cattle vs beef from non-vitamin E supplemented cattle was contrasted. An additional, controlled study was performed to compare muscle alpha-tocopherol concentrations, color changes and microbiological growth for fresh beef derived from vitamin E supplemented US cattle and fresh beef from cattle with an unknown history, but from other countries. Australian strip loin steaks had the highest muscle alpha-tocopherol concentrations (4.6 microgram/g tissue), followed by US strip loin steaks derived from vitamin E supplemented cattle (3.4 microgram/g tissue) and Japanese strip loin steaks (2.8 or 2.5 microgram/g tissue). US strip loin steaks from non-vitamin E supplemented cattle had the lowest (p < 0.05) alpha-tocopherol levels (1.7 microgram/g tissue). Aerobic plate counts and total coliform counts were generally low at 0 days of retail display, and they changed similarly among treatments over 6 days of display, regardless of the country of origin of the beef. Vitamin E supplementation of US cattle reduced total Japanese retail store losses due to discoloration of US beef, in yen, by 5.2 percentage points (p < 0.05), saving Japanese retailers US $0.24/kg. Data suggest that US beef-normally perceived, in Japan, to discolor more quickly in the retail display case than beef from Australia-would compete more favorably, in shelf-life, with beef from other countries if it was derived from cattle that had been fed supplemental vitamin E. 3acattle feeding 3avitamin content 3abeef cattle 3aalpha-tocopherol 3asteaks 3aaerobes 3acoliform bacteria 3adiscoloration 3astorage quality 3asurfaces 3arefrigeration 3avitamin supplements 3afood contamination 3amicrobial contamination 3ameat quality 3abeef 3acolor 3aUnited States 3aAustralia 3aJapan 0aperformance 0astrip loin steaks 0avitamin e acetate 0amonetary losses 0arefrigerated display cases 0aeconomic performance 0achange 0alosses 0abacteria1 aBelk, K.E.1 aAhola, J.K.1 aSofos, J.N.1 aSchaefer, D.M.1 aMorgan, J.B.1 aSmith, G.C.0 tMeat science.g1999 May, v. 52, no. 1 p.111-118x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02618naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002800152245012900180300001600309500002400325520136200349650001401711650001401725650001701739650001301756653002001769653001501789653002301804653003301827653002601860700002701886700003001913700001901943773012501962852000902087856009202096930003302188946001102221655001202232IND4407910320221119014534.0080718e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440791032DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.2008.00801.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVALTUEÑA, FRANCISCO J.10aReproductive biology in Anagyris foetida L.

In this study, we investigate the breeding system of Anagyris foetida, one of the few shrubs that blooms at this time. The floral, phenological, and reproductive aspects of two populations of this Mediterranean legume from south-west Spain were studied via field and laboratory experiments. The variability of fruit and seeds was studied in another 12 Iberian populations with respect to certain meteorological parameters (temperature and rainfall). Anagyris foetida shows cauliflory, marked floral longevity, and adichogamy. The peak of flowering is in January-February. It is self-compatible, with no clear advantage of cross- over self-pollination, and with virtually no autonomous self-pollination. This is because the stigma, like some other legumes, prevents the germination of pollen if its surface is not ruptured by pollinators. The number of seeds per fruit under natural pollination was positively correlated with the total rainfall during the fruiting period (from January to May), and significantly influenced the percentage of fruit weight represented by the pericarp, in the sense that the smaller the number of viable seeds in the fruit, the greater the percentage of pericarp weight. 3afruit set 3aphenology 3apollen tubes 3aseed set 0abreeding system 0acauliflory 0aself-compatibility 0aspontaneous self-pollination 0astigmatic receptivity1 aOrtega Olivencia, Ana.1 aRODRÍGUEZ-RIAÑO, TOMÁS1 aLÓPEZ, JOSEFA0 tBotanical journal of the Linnean Society.g2008 July, v. 157, no. 3 p.519-532dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.2008.00801.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080718b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03611naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245012300175300001800298520206200316650002902378650001202407650002302419650001802442650001502460650001802475650002602493650001902519650001502538650002202553653001902575653002302594653001702617653002602634653002802660700002002688700002602708700003602734700002602770700002402796700001602820700001802836773011802854852000902972856009202981930003303073946001103106655001203117IND4424497620221119014614.0090814e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442449762DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01535.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanelslander, Bart10aComplementarity effects drive positive diversity effects on biomass production in experimental benthic diatom biofilms  ap. 1075-1082.  a1. Positive effects of species diversity on ecosystem functioning have often been demonstrated in 'macrobial' communities. This relation and the responsible mechanisms are far less clear for microbial communities. Most experimental studies on microorganisms have used randomly assembled communities that do not resemble natural communities. It is therefore difficult to predict the consequences of realistic, non-random diversity loss. 2. In this study, we used naturally co-occurring diatom species from intertidal mudflats to assemble communities with realistically decreasing diversity and analysed the effect of non-random species loss on biomass production. 3. Our results demonstrate a highly positive biodiversity effect on production, with mixtures outperforming the most productive component species in more than half of the combinations. These strong positive diversity effects could largely be attributed to positive complementarity effects (including both niche complementarity and facilitation), despite the occurrence of negative selection effects which partly counteracted the positive complementarity effects at higher diversities. 4. Facilitative interactions were, at least in part, responsible for the higher biomass production. For one of the species, Cylindrotheca closterium, we show its ability to significantly increase its biomass production in response to substances leaked into the culture medium by other diatom species. In these conditions, the species drastically reduced its pigment concentration, which is typical for mixotrophic growth. 5. Synthesis. We show that both species richness and identity have strong effects on the biomass production of benthic diatom biofilms and that transgressive overyielding is common in these communities. In addition, we show mechanistic evidence for facilitation which is partly responsible for enhanced production. Understanding the mechanisms by which diversity enhances the performance of ecosystems is crucial for predicting the consequences of species loss for ecosystem functioning. 3aCylindrotheca closterium 3abiofilm 3abiomass production 3aculture media 3aecosystems 3alittoral zone 3amicrobial communities 3amicroorganisms 3aprediction 3aspecies diversity 0abenthic diatom 0aecosystem function 0afacilitation 0aniche complementarity 0anon-random species loss1 aDe Wever, Aaike1 aVan Oostende, Nicolas1 aKaewnuratchadasorn, Pattaratjit1 aVanormelingen, Pieter1 aHendrickx, Frederik1 aSabbe, Koen1 aVyverman, Wim0 tJournal of ecology.g2009 Sept., v. 97, no. 5 p.1075-1082dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01535.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090814b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03806naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245012500177300001600302520209000318650001402408650002302422650002102445650002602466650001102492650001902503650002302522650001502545650001002560650001202570650001502582650001302597650001202610650002202622650001302644650002202657650002502679650000902704650001902713650002402732653002602756653002202782653001902804653002502823653001602848700001702864700001202881700001802893700001902911700002502930773011602955852000903071856009203080930003303172946001103205655001203216IND4424498320221119014930.0090814e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442449832DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01536.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Deyn, Gerlinde B.10aVegetation composition promotes carbon and nitrogen storage in model grassland communities of contrasting soil fertility  ap. 864-875.  a1. The benefits of plant functional group and plant species diversity for sustaining primary productivity have been extensively studied. However, few studies have simultaneously explored potential benefits of plant species and functional group richness and composition for the delivery of other ecosystem services and their dependency on resource availability. 2. Here, we investigated in soils of different fertility the effects of plant species and functional group richness and composition on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks in vegetation, soil and soil microbes and on CO₂ exchange and the loss of C and N from soil through leaching. We established plant communities from a pool of six mesotrophic grassland species belonging to one of three functional groups (C3 grasses, forbs and legumes) in two soils of contrasting fertility. We varied species richness using one, two, three or six species and one, two or three functional groups. 3. After 2 years, vegetation C and N and soil microbial biomass were greater in the more fertile soil and increased significantly with greater numbers of plant species and functional group richness. The positive effect of plant diversity on vegetation C and N coincided with reduced loss of water and N through leaching, which was especially governed by forbs, and increased rates of net ecosystem CO₂ exchange. 4. Soil C and N pools were not affected by the number of plant species or functional group richness per se after 2 years, but were enhanced by the presence and biomass of the legumes Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium repens. 5. Synthesis. Collectively, our findings indicate that changes in plant species and functional group richness influence the storage and loss of both C and N in model grassland communities but that these responses are related to the presence and biomass of certain plant species, notably N fixers and forbs. Our results therefore suggest that the co-occurrence of species from specific functional groups is crucial for the maintenance of multifunctionality with respect to C and N storage in grasslands. 3aC3 plants 3aLotus corniculatus 3aTrifolium repens 3abotanical composition 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aforbs 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3aleaching 3alegumes 3amicrobial biomass 3anitrogen 3aplant communities 3aprimary productivity 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3asoil microorganisms 0aecosystem functioning 0afunctional groups 0anitrogen fixer 0asoil C sequestration 0asoil N loss1 aQuirk, Helen1 aYi, Zou1 aOakley, Simon1 aOstle, Nick J.1 aBardgett, Richard D.0 tJournal of ecology.g2009 Sept., v. 97, no. 5 p.864-875dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01536.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090814b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02101naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002300129245006500152300001600217520108400233650000901317650001101326650001401337650001701351650001901368650000901387650002001396650001401416650001301430653001201443653001501455653003001470653002301500700001701523700001601540773006901556852000901625930003301634945001301667946001101680655001201691IND2202000420221119014916.0991216e199905  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220200042DNAL7 a220621492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGopalakrishnan, J.10aAntioxidant activity of mechanically separated pork extracts  ap. 101-110.  aUtilization of synthetic carnosine as a food additive is limited by both regulatory and economic hurdles. Therefore, the potential of producing carnosine-containing antioxidant extracts from an underutilized skeletal muscle source, mechanically separated pork (MSP), was investigated. Carnosine-containing MSP extracts were capable of inhibiting lipid oxidation both in vitro and in salted ground pork. Heating (60-80 degrees C) the MSP extract removed iron and increased in vitro antioxidant activity. Isolation of a low molecular weight fraction of the MSP extract by ultrafiltration was effective at decreasing iron but did not substantially increase in vitro antioxidant activity. Freeze dried extracts (untreated, 80 degrees C, ultrafiltration permeate) were capable of inhibiting both TBARS and lipid peroxide formation in ground, salted pork stored at -15 degrees C. While MSP extracts were capable of inhibiting lipid oxidation both in vitro and in salted, ground pork, their antioxidant activity was low suggesting that their use as a food additive would be impractical. 3apork 3alipids 3aoxidation 3aantioxidants 3aheat treatment 3airon 3aultrafiltration 3acarnosine 3aextracts 0aremoval 0ainhibition 0amechanically deboned meat 0aground salted pork1 aDecker, E.A.1 aMeans, W.J.0 tMeat science.g1999 May, v. 52, no. 1 p.101-110x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL  a20000302b20000309c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02279naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245010500176300001800281520125800299650001801557650002201575653001701597653002101614653000901635700002501644700002301669773012601692852000901818856009201827930003301919946001301952655001201965IND4424500620221119014713.0090814e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442450062DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06250.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClough, Richard Lee10aFunctional dissection of the α-synuclein promoter: transcriptional regulation by ZSCAN21 and ZNF219  ap. 1479-1490.  aAlpha-Synuclein (SNCA) is an abundant neuronal protein involved in synaptic neurotransmission. SNCA expression levels have been strongly implicated in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. We have previously demonstrated that in the PC12 cell line elements in intron 1 may mediate SNCA transcriptional regulation in response to neurotrophins. We have now identified transcription factor (TF) binding sites in intron 1 and the 5'-promoter of SNCA. A binding site for the TF zinc finger and SCAN domain containing (ZSCAN)21 in the 5'-region of intron 1 is required for intron 1 transcriptional activity. Small interfering RNA against ZSCAN21 inhibits activation in the luciferase assay and diminishes SNCA protein levels in naïve and neurotrophin-treated PC12 cells and in primary cultured cortical neurons, demonstrating that ZSCAN21 is a novel transcriptional regulator of SNCA in neuronal cells. The 5'-promoter of SNCA has a complex architecture, including multiple binding sites for the TF zinc finger protein (ZNF)219, which functions as both an activator and a repressor. Targeting ZSCAN21 or other TFs controlling SNCA transcriptional activity may provide novel therapeutic avenues not only for Parkinson's disease but also for other synucleopathies. 3aneurotrophins 3aParkinson disease 0aα-synuclein 0acortical neurons 0aPC121 aDermentzaki, Georgia1 aStefanis, Leonidas0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2009 Sept., v. 110, no. 5 p.1479-1490dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06250.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090814b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01501naa a2200421 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245015300148300001600301520016700317650002700484650001800511650002000529650001200549650003300561650000900594650002500603650003000628650004500658650002000703650003400723650002000757650003400777650003200811650002700843653003900870700001400909773008100923852000901004939003301013945000801046946001301054655001201067991584397780742620221119014656.0830316e198206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830023182DNAL7 a70974412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujino, T.10aUltrastructural studies on spermatogenesis in a parthenogenetic type of Paragonimus westermani (Kerbert 1878) proposed as P. pulmonalis (Baelz 1880)  ap. 433-441.  aParagonimus pulmonalis (parthenogenetic type of P. westermani), aberrations during spermatogenesis, light, scanning electron, and transmission electron microscopy 3aParagonimus westermani 3agametogenesis 3aparthenogenesis 2aAnimals 2aCell Nucleusxultrastructure 2aMale 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aOrganoidsxultrastructure 2aParagonimusxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aParthenogenesis 2aSpermatocytesxultrastructure 2aSpermatogenesis 2aSpermatogoniaxultrastructure 2aSpermatozoaxultrastructure 2aTestisxultrastructure 0aParagonimus pulmonalis (Trematoda)1 aIshii, Y.0 tJournal of parasitology.g1982 June, v. 68, no. 3 p.433-441x0022-33957nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830316c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle01874naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245007600147300001600223520086000239650000901099650002001108650001601128650001201144650001901156650001201175650001701187650001101204653001001215653001401225653001901239653001201258653002501270700001701295700001601312773007001328852000901398930003301407945001301440946001101453655001201464IND2201483320221119014442.0991105e199904  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220148332DNAL7 a220620322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwain, M.V.L.10aTextural effect of chilling hot Longissimus dorsi muscle with solid CO2  ap. 363-370.  aThis paper covers the work carried out on the textural effects of chilling hot boned meat using solid carbon dioxide (CO(2)). The purpose was to measure the texture of beef Longissimus dorsi (LD) chilled in boxes with solid CO(2) and to compare this with conventionally chilled meat. The results showed that CO(2) chilled meat were tougher than the controls. Shear force (SF) and work done (WD) results indicated that 63% of the CO(2) chilled meat were above 50N compared to 32% of the controls, taste panel would judge this as slightly tough. 22% of the CO(2) chilled meat was SF > 100N which overall would be judged as extremely tough as compared to 2% of the controls. The work also showed that the laser diffraction technique was unable to distinguish between active and passive shortening giving only an average or overall length for the area viewed. 3abeef 3askeletal muscle 3atemperature 3acooling 3acarbon dioxide 3atexture 3ameat quality 3aforces 0ashear 0atoughness 0ahot boned beef 0adry ice 0asolid carbon dioxide1 aGigiel, A.J.1 aLimpens, G.0 tMeat science.g1999 Apr., v. 51, no. 4 p.363-370x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL  a20000202b20000208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02743naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245006900188300001600257500002400273520130800297650001301605650001501618650002201633650001301655650003501668650007701703650002501780650002001805650003601825650002001861650001801881651001201899651001201911653001801923653002801941653002601969653001801995653002402013653002902037700002102066700001902087773009802106852000902204856004802213655001202261IND4437479120221120202831.0100522e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443747912DNAL7 a202290662pmid7 a10.1007/s00267-010-9463-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheikheldin, Gussai10aScience-Seeking Behaviour of Conservation Authorities in Ontario  ap. 912-921.  aIncludes references  aThe communication of science to science users is evolving to an approach that translates knowledge to targeted audiences. Under this evolution, knowledge brokers play an increasingly important role and users help ‘pull' the required science to meet a policy or management imperative. To do this effectively, more insight is required into the knowledge seeking behaviour of science users and practitioners. The findings from a series of interviews that identify the science needs of Ontario's Conservation Authorities (CAs) are presented. Results indicate that emerging functions, such as source water protection and integrated water resource planning, require more science input than mature functions. Senior CA officials view personal communication with their knowledgeable staff as the most used, accessible, trustworthy, relevant, shared, and preferable source of science information. While the internet and media were considered highly accessible, they were not viewed as trustworthy. We found no relationship between CA size and science use. Further research is needed to identify where junior and intermediate CA staff obtain their science knowledge from and whether this varies as a function of CA size. Our findings will be of interest to both policy/program communities and science providers. 3aInternet 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3aplanning 2aBiological Science Disciplines 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxlegislation & jurisprudencexmethods. 2aCooperative Behavior 2aDecision Making 2aInterdisciplinary Communication 2aKnowledge Bases 2aPolicy Making 3aOntario 0aOntario 0aCommunication 0aScience-policy linkages 0aKnowledge translation 0aScience needs 0aKnowledge brokering 0aConservation authorities1 aKrantzberg, Gail1 aSchaefer, Karl0 tEnvironmental management.g2010 May, v. 45, no. 5 p.912-921dSpringer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-010-9463-9 7aarticle01683naa a2200493 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245004500148300001600193500002300209500001500232520030600247650002200553650002300575650001600598650001300614650002600627650002500653650002700678650001400705650001200719650003200731650002200763650006700785650001000852650002400862650001100886650001100897650002900908653002300937653002300960653002500983773009301008852001301101939003301114945000801147946001301155852000901168655001201177991607569560742620221120202707.0930921e19930715xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930026382DNAL7 a85157912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOski, F.A.10aIron deficiency in infancy and childhood  ap. 190-193.  aLiterature review.  a2019-12-05  aThis review articles examines the prevalence on iron deficiency anemia among infants and children in the United States.

By introducing a male and a female R. marginata into ventilated transparent plastic boxes, we were able to observe mating behaviour, and it involved mounting and short or long conjugation of the wasps. Dissection of female wasps after the observation indicated that long conjugation is a good behavioural predictor of sperm transfer. This finding makes it possible to obtain mated females without dissecting them every time. We tested the effect of age, season, relatedness, body size and female's ovarian status on mating. Under laboratory conditions, mating success declined rapidly below and above the ages 5-20 days. Within this age range mating success was significantly low in December compared to other months tested. There was no nestmate discrimination, and there was no influence of male and female body size or of the ovarian state of the female on the probability of sperm transfer. 3aRopalidia marginata 3abody size 3afemales 3amating behavior 3aovarian development 3aplastics 3aprobability 3aspermatozoa1 aSamudre, S.1 aShilpa, M.

Yet, the amount and distribution of potentially mineralizable C present in soils of various types and the method by which this soil C fraction can best be quantified, are not well established. The distribution of total organic C (TOC), extractable C pools (hot-water-extractable and acid-hydrolyzable), and in vitro mineralizable C in 138 surface soils across a north Florida watershed was found to be quite heterogeneous. Thus, these C quality parameters could not statistically distinguish the eight landuses or four major soil orders represented. Only wetland and upland forest soils, with the largest and smallest C pool size, respectively, were consistently different from the soils of other landuse types. Variations in potential C mineralization were best explained by TOC (62%) and hot-water-extractable C (59%), whereas acid-hydrolyzable C (32%) and clay content (35%) were generally not adequate indicators of C bioavailability. Within certain landuse and soil orders (Alfisol, Wetland and Rangeland, all with >3% clay content), however, C mineralization and clay content were directly linearly correlated, indicating a possible stimulatory effect of clay on microbial processing of C. Generally, the sandy nature of these surface soils imparted a lack of protection against C mineralization and likely resulted in the lack of landuse/soil order differences in the soil C pools. If a single parameter is to be chosen to quantify the potential for soil C mineralization in southeastern U.S. coastal plain soils, we recommend TOC as the most efficient soil variable to measure. 3aAlfisols 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aclay 3acoastal plain soils 3aforest soils 3aland use 3amineralization 3arangelands 3asandy soils 3awatersheds 3aFlorida1 aZimmerman, Andrew R.1 aComerford, Nick B.1 aSickman, James O.1 aGrunwald, Sabine0 tEcosystems.g2009 June, v. 12, no. 4 p.672-685dSpringer-Verlagx1432-98407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-009-9250-8 7aarticle01514naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001900154245011400173300001600287500001500303520050000318650002200818650001100840650002200851650000700873650002500880650002000905650001000925650001100935653001700946773009100963852000901054856005701063939003301120946001101153655001201164IND9003019520221120190227.0900622e199005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900301952DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0879642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWignarajah, K.10aCharacterization of the 'in vitro' nitrate reductase activity in the roots and leaves of Eichhornia crassipes  ap. 525-528.  a2019-12-04  aStudies of in vivo nitrate reductase activity (NRA) in Eichhornia crassipes showed that adding 5% isopropanol gave highest NRA in all parts of the plant, but it was also necessary to flush the assay media containing leaves with N1 to obtain the maximal activity.

The data were analyzed in two blocks for each shape; ≤3000 mm2 and > 3000 mm2, using non-parametric statistical methods. Comparison of the results obtained with the true template areas suggested that all the methods were reasonably accurate (mean slope = 0·97; mean r2 = 97·7%). The errors were relatively smaller (mean = 1.28%) when measuring the larger leaf templates compared with the smaller templates (mean = 10·46%). The microprocessor-based systems provided quicker and more accurate estimates than the analogue methods. Increasing magnification of the images measured was a satisfactory way of significantly reducing the variability and mean error of the image analyzer and the planimeter methods (P ≤ 0·05). 3aReynoutria japonica 3aestimation 3alaboratory techniques 3aImpatiens glandulifera 3amicroprocessors 3aleaf area 3acomputer analysis 3astatistical analysis 3aplant morphology 0aarea meter 0aleaf shape 0aimage analyzer 0aplanimeter 0aanalogs 0aFallopia japonica1 aFry, J.C.0 tAnnals of botany.g1990 May, v. 65, no. 5 p.483-488wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a087959  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03389naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245008500178300001600263500002400279520174300303650001502046650002902061650002102090650002002111650002602131650001202157650001502169650001502184650001502199650001202214650001302226650001702239650001502256650002102271650003802292650001302330650002302343650002602366650004902392651002102441651002102462653002002483653003002503653003402533653003402567653002502601700002102626700002002647773009902667852000902766856004802775655001202823IND4440697820221120180344.0100730e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444069782DNAL7 a205267752pmid7 a10.1007/s00267-010-9510-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLong, Jed10aRegionalization of Landscape Pattern Indices Using Multivariate Cluster Analysis  ap. 134-142.  aIncludes references  aRegionalization, or the grouping of objects in space, is a useful tool for organizing, visualizing, and synthesizing the information contained in multivariate spatial data. Landscape pattern indices can be used to quantify the spatial pattern (composition and configuration) of land cover features. Observable patterns can be linked to underlying processes affecting the generation of landscape patterns (e.g., forest harvesting). The objective of this research is to develop an approach for investigating the spatial distribution of forest pattern across a study area where forest harvesting, other anthropogenic activities, and topography, are all influencing forest pattern. We generate spatial pattern regions (SPR) that describe forest pattern with a regionalization approach. Analysis is performed using a 2006 land cover dataset covering the Prince George and Quesnel Forest Districts, 5.5 million ha of primarily forested land base situated within the interior plateau of British Columbia, Canada. Multivariate cluster analysis (with the CLARA algorithm) is used to group landscape objects containing forest pattern information into SPR. Of the six generated SPR, the second cluster (SPR2) is the most prevalent covering 22% of the study area. On average, landscapes in SPR2 are comprised of 55.5% forest cover, and contain the highest number of patches, and forest/non-forest joins, indicating highly fragmented landscapes. Regionalization of landscape pattern metrics provides a useful approach for examining the spatial distribution of forest pattern. Where forest patterns are associated with positive or negative environmental conditions, SPR can be used to identify similar regions for conservation or management activities. 3aalgorithms 3aanthropogenic activities 3acluster analysis 3adata collection 3aenvironmental factors 3aforests 3aharvesting 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3alogging 3aplateaus 3aspatial data 3atopography 2aCluster Analysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aForestry 2aGeographyxmethods 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aTreesxclassificationxgrowth & development. 3aBritish Columbia 0aBritish Columbia 0aRegionalization 0aLandscape pattern indices 0aMultivariate cluster analysis 0aSpatial pattern regions (SPR) 0aForest fragmentation1 aNelson, Trisalyn1 aWulder, Michael0 tEnvironmental management.g2010 July, v. 46, no. 1 p.134-142dSpringer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-010-9510-6 7aarticle01994naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001800139245010900157300001600266500001500282520089400297650000801191650003101199650001101230650000701241650002001248650001301268653001501281653001601296653001701312700001501329700001701344773010001361852000901461856007901470930003301549945001301582946001301595655001201608IND2049705120221120141724.0960201e199501  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204970512DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00049a0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahanta, P.K.10aComparison of lipoxygenase activity and lipid composition in various harvests of northeastern Indian tea  ap. 208-214.  a2019-12-04  aStudy on the specific activity of tea shoot lipoxygenase in eight different genotypes at different pH levels from 6.5 to 9.5 revealed the presence of three lipoxygenase isoenzymes.

By means of on-line liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, this metabolite was identified as a carbamoylated derivative of glutathione, viz. S-(n-butylcarbamoyl)glutathione (SBuG), whose excretion in bile over 4.5 h accounted for ca. 1% of the dose. In vitro experiments demonstrated that SBuG and the corresponding cysteine adduct exhibited carbamoylating activity toward the thiol groups of free cysteine and glutathione when the elements of n-butyl isocyanate were transferred to the acceptor nucleophiles. SBuG also proved to be highly cytotoxic to isolated rat hepatocytes at a concentration of 1 mM. The results of this study raise the possibility that SBuG may serve as a latent form of n-butyl isocyanate in vivo and thereby mediate some of the adverse effects of benomyl. 3abenomyl 3ametabolites 3ametabolism 3atoxicity 3aglutathione 3acyanates 3aliver 3arats 0abutyl isocyanates1 aDavis, M.R.1 aJin, L.1 aBaillie, T.A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1994 Dec., v. 42, no. 12 p.2953-2957x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00048a0583Available from publisher's Web site  a19960304b19960308c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02022naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001500139245010200154300001800256520092500274650001701199650002101216650001401237650000701251650001301258650001501271650002201286653001401308653001401322653001601336653001401352700002001366773010301386852000901489856007901498930003301577945001301610946001301623655001201636IND2050981520221120130131.0960425e199410  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205098152DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00046a0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHunt, J.A.10aEffect of pH on the stability and surface composition of emulsions made with whey protein isolate  ap. 2131-2135.  aEmulsions (20 wt % soy oil) made with various concentrations (0.5-2.5 wt %) of whey protein isolate (WPI) were most stable at pH 7 and least stable at pH 5.5.

At pH 7 beta-lactoglobulin and alpha-lactalbumin adsorbed in proportion to their concentration, but at lower pH values alpha-lactalbumin was found to adsorb preferentially, depending on the protein concentration, pH, and buffer. When emulsions (2 wt % WPI) were acidified from pH 7 to 3 more alpha-lactalbumin became adsorbed and the emulsion was stable, but reducing the pH from 7 to 6 did not alter the interfacial composition of protein and the emulsion became unstable.

These results suggest that MH application may alter precursors-TSNA relationship which results in decreases of TSNA in air-cured burley tobacco. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3atobacco 3amaleic hydrazide 3aapplication methods 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anitrosamines 3aapplication rate1 aBruton, H.R.1 aBush, L.P.1 aSutton, T.G.1 aCrafts-Brandner, S.J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1994 Dec., v. 42, no. 12 p.2912-2916x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00048a0503Available from publisher's Web site  a19960304b19960308c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01705naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001600139245007400155300001800229520072000247650001200967650001500979650001900994650001301013650001201026650001201038700001801050700001701068700002001085773010301105852000901208856007901217930003301296945001301329946001301342655001201355IND2049829620221120120141.0960212e199412  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204982962DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00048a0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreve, I.C.10aImpact of heating on carrot firmness: changes in cell wall components  ap. 2900-2906.  aThe impact of heating in boiling water on tissue firmness retention of the carrot genotypes Danvers and B9304 was measured.

Cell wall carbohydrate compositions of the two varieties were similar, but wall component dissolution (solubilization and depolymerization) was more extensive in Danvers. The breakdown of soluble and wall-bound pectins involved beta-elimination reactions.

Justification of such an assumption is based on temporal damping effects of several geological units within the unsaturated tuff formation. In particular, the nonwelded tuff of the Painbrush Group (PTn unit) at Yucca Mountain, because of its highly porous physical properties, has been conceptualized to have a significant capacity for temporally damping transient percolation fluxes. The objective of this study is to investigate these damping effects, using a three-dimensional (3-D) mountain-scale model as well as several one-dimensional (1-D) models. The 3-D model incorporates a wide variety of the updated field data for the highly heterogeneous unsaturated formation at Yucca Mountain. The model is first run to steady state and calibrated using field-measured data and then transient pulse infiltrations are applied to the model top boundary. Subsequent changes in percolation fluxes at the bottom of and within the PTn unit are examined under episodic infiltration boundary conditions. The 1-D model is used to examine the long-term response of the flow system to higher infiltration pulses, while the damping effect is also investigated through modeling tracer transport in the UZ under episodic infiltration condition. Simulation results show the existence of damping effects within the PTn unit and also indicate that the assumption of steady-state flow conditions below the PTn unit is reasonable. However, the study also finds that some fast flow paths along faults exist, causing vertical-flux quick responses at the PTn bottom to the episodic infiltration at the top boundary. 3atemporal variation 3asimulation models 3aunsaturated conditions 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3avadose zone 3atuff 3aNevada 0amathematical models 0adamping effect 0aepisodic infiltration 0aone-dimensional models 0athree-dimensional models1 aWu, Y.S.1 aPan, L.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2006 July 30, v. 327, no. 1-2 p.235-248dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2005.11.0233Available from publisher's Web site  a20080327b20080404c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/03/27  aNon-US 7aarticle01860naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005300126300001600179500001500195520097100210650001401181650001601195650001101211650001001222650001101232650001901243653001301262653001701275700001901292700001801311700001601329700001601345773008401361852000901445939003301454946001101487655001201498IND9301992820221120104649.0930406e199209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930199282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBékés, F.10aLipid mediated aggregates in flour and in gluten  ap. 129-140.  a2019-12-04  aThe relationships between breadmaking properties and the amount of 70% ethanol-extractable lipid mediated aggregates (LMA) were investigated in 14 wheat varieties grown in Australia.

Strong correlation (r = 0.94) was found between the LMA content of gluten and loaf volume (LV). LMA isolated from gluten was highly correlated with both hexane-extractable lipid content and 70% ethanol-extractable glutenin-like protein content of flours.

Changes in ureide content and in enzymatic activities involved in their metabolism were identified in the cotyledons and embryonic axes during germination and early seedling development. Accumulation of ureides (ca. 1300 nmol per pair of cotyledons) was observed in the cotyledons of dry seeds. Throughout germination, the total amount of ureides slightly decreased to about 1200 nmol, but increased both in cotyledons and in embryonic axes after radicle emergence. In the axes, the ureides were almost equally distributed in roots, hypocotyls and epicotyls. The pattern of ureide distribution was not affected by the presence of nitrate or sucrose in the media up to 6 days after imbibition. Ureides are synthesized from purines because allopurinol (a xanthine dehydrogenase inhibitor) blocks the increase of ureides. Allantoin and allantoate-degrading activities were detected in French bean dried seeds, whereas no ureidoglycolate-degrading activity was detected. During germination, the levels of the three activities remain unchanged in cotyledons. After radicle emergence, the levels of activities in cotyledons changed. Allantoin-degrading activity increased, allantoate-degrading activity decreased and ureidoglycolate-degrading activity remained undetectable in cotyledons. In developing embryonic axes, the three activities were detected throughout germination and early seedling development. The embryonic axes are able to synthesize ureides, because those compounds accumulated in axes without cotyledons. 3aseedlings 3apurines 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aepicotyls 3aroots 3anitrogen fixation 3aureides 3ahypocotyls 3aearly development 3aimbibition 3ametabolism 3agermination 3asucrose 3aaerial parts 3aenzyme activity 3aallopurinol 3axanthine dehydrogenase 3acotyledons 3agreen beans 3aallantoin 3anitrates 2aAllantoinxmetabolism 2aCotyledonxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aGermination 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPhaseolusxembryologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSeedlingsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aUreaxanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 0aseeds1 aRaso, María José1 aPineda, Manuel1 aPiedras, Pedro0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2009 Jan., v. 135, no. 1 p.19-28dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3054.2008.01173.x 7aarticle03042naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125072000900143100001300152245010300165300001600268500002400284520191100308650002302219650002502242650002602267650003102293651001402324653002902338700001502367700001202382700001502394773011402409852000902523856006702532930003302599945002502632946001102657655001202668IND4382960020221120104803.0060821e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438296002DNAL7 a1016/j.agsy.2005.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ7001 aWood, R.12aA comparative study of some environmental impacts of conventional and organic farming in Australia  ap. 324-348.  aIncludes references  aThe provision of food causes environmental impacts that range from local through to global in scale. Organic farming, used in general here to mean farming practices with a greater emphasis on long-term sustainability, is one general approach to reduce these impacts. Whilst organic farming may be argued to be superior to conventional farming on the basis of local impacts, it is not often clear how organic farming performs relative to conventional farming in terms of wider, global impacts. In this paper we present a comparative assessment of on-farm and indirect energy consumption, land disturbance, water use, employment, and emissions of greenhouse gases, NOx, and SO2 of organic and conventional farming in Australia. A hybrid input-output-based life-cycle technique is employed in order to ensure a complete coverage of indirect requirements originating from all upstream production stages. Using data from a detailed survey of organic farms, the results show that direct energy use, energy related emissions, and greenhouse gas emissions are higher for the organic farming sample than for a comparable conventional farm sample. Direct water use and employment are significantly lower for the organic farms than for the conventional farms. However, the indirect contributions for all factors are much higher for the conventional farms, leading to their total impacts being substantially higher. This shows that indirect effects must be taken into account in the consideration of the environmental consequences of farming, in particular for energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, where the majority of impacts usually occur off-farm. Subject to yield uncertainties for organic versus conventional farming, from the sample here we can conclude that in addition to their local benefits, organic farming approaches can reduce the total water, energy and greenhouse gases involved in food production. 3aorganic production 3aenvironmental impact 3ainput output analysis 3aenergy use and consumption 3aAustralia 0astructural path analysis1 aLenzen, M.1 aDey, C.1 aLundie, S.0 tAgricultural systems.g2006 Sept., v. 89, no. 2-3 p.324-348dElsevier Applied Science [etc.]x0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/1016/j.agsy.2005.09.0073electronic resource  a20070307b20070402c00000000  aINDdRLGe2007/03/07  aNon-US 7aarticle01516naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001700139245008400156300001600240500001500256520043500271650001600706650001200722650001000734650002000744650002100764650002100785650001500806650001100821651000900832653002500841700001700866773010000883852000900983856007900992930003301071945001301104946001301117655001201130IND2049700820221120094705.0960201e199501  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204970082DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00049a0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrosso, N.R.10aChemical composition of aboriginal peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) seeds from Peru  ap. 102-105.  a2019-12-04  aOil, protein, and ash contents, iodine value, and fatty acid and sterol compositions were studied in the seed of 29 aboriginal Arachis hypogaea cultivars, originating from Peru.

Examples include earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, asteroid impacts, landslides, and forest fires. A major question is whether this is also true for floods. A number of authors have argued in favor of the applicability of power-law statistics to floods. We discuss these arguments and consider a number of examples, using both instrumental records and paleoflood studies. In our analyses we consider both annual and partial-duration flood series. We argue that use of annual floods for statistical considerations strongly biases the flood-frequency estimates, as in some years, the annual flood will be much smaller than a number of 'statistically independent' floods (partial-duration floods) in other years. We examine six USGS hydrologic stations with drainage areas from 41 to 95,300 km2, representing very different climatic regions and hydrologic conditions, and with periods of records ranging from 74 to 110 water years. Excellent power-law fits to each partial-duration series are found taking Q approximately Tα, with Q the discharge associated with the recurrence interval T, and the power-law exponent α ranging from 0.27 to 0.90. We also consider paleoflood estimates for Axehandle Alcove on the Colorado River and Bonza Alcove on the Paria River, and find that that power-law extrapolations based on instrumental partial-duration series for stations in each of these two areas is within a half order of magnitude when compared to their respective paleoflood estimates. Finally, we consider an alternative approach to extreme streamflows that has been proposed, examining the cumulative probability distribution of instrumental daily mean streamflows. We show that this distribution is in good agreement with the power-law correlation found using the partial-duration series. 3afloods 3arisk assessment 3atime series analysis 3awatershed hydrology 3astatistical analysis 3ahydrologic models 0amathematics and statistics 0apower-law flood frequency distribution1 aTurcotte, D.L.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2006 May 15, v. 322, no. 1-4 p.168-180dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2005.02.0323electronic resource  a20060829b20060906c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/08/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02562naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001900139245011500158300001400273520148100287650002401768650000901792650001401801650001101815650001301826650001201839650002601851700001101877700001901888700001901907700001701926773009801943852000902041856007902050930003302129945001302162946001302175655001202188IND2049693820221120094715.0960201e199501  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204969382DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00049a0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZarkadas, C.G.10aComparison between the protein quality of northern adapted cultivars of common maize and quality protein maize  ap. 84-93.  aThe present study was designed to quantitatively measure and compare the levels and variation of total protein as well as the individual amino acids in three northern adapted (latitude >45 degrees N) cultivars of common maize, namely a typical Dent CO251, a Flint CO255 inbred line, and commercial hybrid maize Pioneer 3953 with the new quality protein maize inbred (QPM-C13), and to assess their nutritive value from their FAO/WHO amino acid scoring pattern. The total protein content was variable among these cultivars ranging from 7.95% in QPM to 8.2% (Pioneer), 10.5% (Dent), and 11.79% (Flint). The QPM maize protein, however, proved to be of higher quality than common maize protein because it contained double the amount of lysine and arginine, higher levels of tryptophan and cysteine, and no change in other amino acids except lower levels of leucine. As a result, the QPM amino acid profile gives a good balance of total essential amino acids, limited only in lysine, and has an amino acid score, adjusted for digestibility, of 67%, compared to 28.5, 31.0, and 33.0% values found for Pioneer, Dent, and Flint, respectively. In common maize the primary essential amino acid deficiencies include lysine, threonine, and tryptophan. These results indicate that breeding maize for high protein quality can be very effective and that a very useful method for evaluating the protein quality of cereals is calculating their protein quality from their amino acid composition. 3aprotein composition 3acorn 3acultivars 3alysine 3aarginine 3aleucine 3aessential amino acids1 aYu, Z.1 aHamilton, R.I.1 aPattison, P.L.1 aRose, N.G.W.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1995 Jan., v. 43, no. 1 p.84-93x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00049a0163Available from publisher's Web site  a19960304b19960308c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01995naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001900139245011900158300001400277520098700291650002401278650000901302650001801311650001001329650002101339700001101360700001901371700002201390773009801412852000901510856007901519930003301598945001301631946001301644655001201657IND2049693720221120094649.0960201e199501  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204969372DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00049a0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZarkadas, C.G.10aAssessment of the protein quality of beefstock bone isolates for use as an ingredient in meat and poultry products  ap. 77-83.  aThe total protein, amino acids including 4-hydroxyproline, and estimated connective tissue proteins of three processed beefstock bone isolates were determined as potentially useful indices for evaluating their protein quality. Variations in amino acid composition were found among all three batches of beefstock bone isolates investigated. The total protein of demineralized beefstock bone powders, as determined by amino acid analysis, varied (P < 0.05) and ranged from 78 to 80% on a dry weight basis. Compared to the FAO/WHO essential amino acid (EAA9) reference value of 33.9%, mean values for total EAA ranged from 22.2 to 22.9%, and the calculated mean protein efficiency ratio values (PER) ranged from 1.35 to 1.54. Total connective tissue proteins (72.3-81.1%) were determined from the amounts of 4-hydroxyproline present. It is concluded that this demineralized bone product may be used in limited amounts in meat mixtures without significant effect on the nutritive value. 3aprotein composition 3abeef 3ameat extracts 3abones 3aprotein isolates1 aYu, Z.1 aZarkadas, G.C.1 aMinero-Amador, A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1995 Jan., v. 43, no. 1 p.77-83x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00049a0153Available from publisher's Web site  a19960304b19960308c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01879naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002500139245013800164300001400302520074700316650002501063650002901088650001501117650001901132650001201151650003601163653002401199700001501223700001801238700001601256773009801272852000901370856007901379930003301458945001301491946001301504655001201517IND2049693520221120094655.0960201e199501  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204969352DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00049a0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastaneda-Acosta, J.10aExtraction of bioactive sesquiterpene lactones from Magnolia grandiflora using supercritical carbon dioxide and near-critical propane  ap. 63-68.  aThe bioactive sesquiterpene lactones parthenolide and costunolide, as well as the tricyclic sesquiterpene cyclocolorenone, were extracted from the leaves of Magnolia grandiflora by supercritical extraction with carbon dioxide and by near-critical extraction with propane.

In a field attraction test using traps with synthetic pheromone components, P. hybneri was attracted to (E)-2-hexenyl (E)-2-hexenoate, a component of the R. clavatus pheromone. Other components had neither an additive nor a synergistic effect on the attraction of P. hybneri. Neither (E)-2-hexenyl (E)-2-hexenoate nor other components of the R. clavatus pheromone were detected in volatiles or whole-body extracts of P. hybneri adults by gas chromatographic analysis. In addition, (E)-2-hexenyl (E)-2-hexenoate could not be found in volatiles of soybean plants. Therefore, it appears that P. hybneri responds to a component of the R. clavatus pheromone that is not emitted by P. hybneri itself. We discuss this interspecific pheromone cross-attraction of the soybean bug and hypothesize that P. hybneri utilizes the pheromone of its competitor as a kairomone for host location. 3ainsect pests 3apheromones 3akairomones 3ainsect attractants 2aAnimals 2aCaproatesxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aEcology 2aHeteropteraxphysiology 2aPheromonesxchemistryxphysiology. 2aSoybeansxparasitology 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTissue Extractsxchemistry 0across attraction 0ainterspecific attraction1 aWada, T.1 aNishiba, Y.1 aSasaki, R.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2006 July, v. 32, no. 7 p.1605-1612dKluwer Academic/Plenum Publishersx0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-006-9093-03electronic resource  a20060927b20061003c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/09/27  aOther US 7aarticle02975naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001800167245010700185300001600292500023000308500002400538520163700562650001502199650002402214650002202238650002502260650002502285653002502310700002202335773009302357852000902450856007302459930003302532945002502565946001102590655001202601IND4382958620221120094643.0060821e20060515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438295862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2005.02.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aX1001 aLangousis, A.12aA stochastic methodology for generation of seasonal time series reproducing overyear scaling behaviour  ap. 138-154.  aIn the special issue: Hydrofractals '03 / edited by P.

Paper presented at the International Conference on Fractals in the Hydrosciences, held August 2003, Ascona, Switzerland.  aIncludes references  aIn generating synthetic time series of hydrological processes at sub-annual scales, it is important to preserve seasonal characteristics and short-term persistence. At the same time, it is equally important to preserve annual characteristics and overyear scaling behaviour. This scaling behaviour, which is equivalent to the Hurst phenomenon and has been interpreted by many as nonstationarity of processes, has been detected in a large number of hydroclimatic series and has important effects on the planning and design of hydrosystems. However, when seasonal models are used the preservation of annual characteristics and overyear scaling is a difficult task and is often ignored unless disaggregation techniques are applied, which, however, involve several difficulties (e.g. in parameter estimation) and inaccuracies. As an alternative, a new methodology is proposed that directly operates on seasonal time scale, avoiding disaggregation, and that simultaneously preserves annual statistics and the scaling properties on overyear time scales. Two specific stochastic models are proposed, a simple widely used seasonal model with short memory to which long-term persistence is imposed using a linear filter, and a combination of two sub-models, a stationary one with long memory and a cyclostationary one with short memory. Both models are capable of generating spatially correlated synthetic time series for more than one location simultaneously. The models are tested in a real world case and found to be accurate in reproducing all the desired statistical properties and virtually equivalent from an operational point of view. 3awatersheds 3awatershed hydrology 3ahydrologic models 3astochastic processes 3atime series analysis 0astochastic hydrology1 aKoutsoyiannis, D.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2006 May 15, v. 322, no. 1-4 p.138-154dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2005.02.0373electronic resource  a20060829b20060906c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/08/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02130naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001800146245008800164300001600252500002400268520083000292650002701122650001301149650001201162650002501174650002301199650002701222650002001249650002001269650002001289650001601309650001801325650001201343700001701355700002201372773014701394852000901541856007701550930003301627945002501660946001101685655001201696IND4382902720221120094640.0060818e20060415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438290272DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.24042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aYashoda, H.M.10aMango ripening: changes in cell wall constituents in relation to textural softening  ap. 713-721.  aIncludes references  aRipening of mango (Mangifera indica L., cv.

From unripe to ripe stage, the starch content came down from 18% to 0.1%; pectin from 1.9% to 0.5%; cellulose from 2% to 0.9% and hemicelluloses from 0.8% to 0.2%. Concomitantly, the total soluble solids increased from 7% to 20%, total soluble sugars from 1% to 15% and pH increased from 2.8 to 5.1. The increase in activity of several of the carbohydrate-degrading enzymes, which resulted in solubilization of the various polysaccharide fractions, correlated with fruit-softening phenomenon. Efficient distribution of 14C-starch into glucose, fructose and sucrose revealed considerable sugar interconversions indicating active gluconeogenesis during mango fruit ripening. 3apostharvest physiology 3aripening 3amangoes 3acell wall components 3atemporal variation 3abiochemical mechanisms 3agluconeogenesis 3aenzyme activity 3apolysaccharides 3adegradation 3afruit quality 3atexture1 aPrabha, T.N.1 aTharanathan, R.N.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2006 Apr. 15, v. 86, no. 5 p.713-721dPublished for SCI by John Wiley & Sonsx0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.24043Available from publisher's Web site  a20080402b20080502c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/11/30  aNon-US 7aarticle01910naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245005300124300001800177500001500195520106000210650002401270650001301294650001301307650002001320650001301340653000901353653002001362700001701382700001901399700001901418773008001437852000901517939003301526946001301559655001201572IND9301984220221120090643.0930405e199209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930198422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFox, R.D.10aAir jet velocities from a cross-flow fan sprayer  ap. 1381-1384.  a2019-12-04  aTransverse profiles of air velocity were measured along the jet centerlines at 0.05 to 6 m (0.16 to 20 ft) from the outlet of a two-unit, cross-flow fan orchard sprayer. Velocity profiles were obtained for fan speeds of 1080 and 1476 rpm and with the upper fan both vertical and inclined downward 20 degrees from vertical. Observed maximum velocities along the lower jet centerline agreed with those predicted by a plane jet model. Outlet air velocity at 1476 rpm was about 1.6 times the velocity at 1080 rpm. For an inclined upper fan, air velocities at the lower elevation increased 10% at 3 m (9.8 ft) from the outlet. When the upper fan was inclined 20 degrees, the interaction of the two jets appeared to form a persistent flow field in which velocities alternately increased and decreased over the range from 0.15 to 1 m (0.49 to 3.3 ft) from the outlet. The inclined upper jet apparently deflected the top of the lower jet toward the ground, which may tend to keep spray-droplets near the ground and thereby reduce drift loss from spray operations. 3amathematical models 3aorchards 3asprayers 3aMalus domestica 3avelocity 0ajets 0across flow fans1 aBrazee, R.D.1 aSvensson, S.A.1 aReichard, D.L.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1992 , v. 35, no. 5 p.1381-1384x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02650naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100001700154245011000171300001600281500002400297500001500321520130300336650002101639650001801660650001301678650001901691650001501710650001301725650002501738650001401763650001501777650001801792650002601810650001801836653001501854700001401869700001301883700001501896773012201911852000902033856006902042930003302111945002502144946001102169655001202180IND4382899220221120090617.0060818e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438289922DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-006-9076-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aNakagawa, R.10aEffect of polyamines and L -ornithine on the development of proembryogenic masses of Cryptomeria japonica  ap. 229-234.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe examined the effects of polyamines, namely, putrescine, spermidine and spermine, and of amino acids, such as L-arginine and L-ornithine, as part of our efforts to identify factors that stimulate the development of proembryogenic masses (PEMs) of Cryptomeria japonica. We maintained two distinct types of PEM designated PEMs A, which consisted of normal embryogenic cells as single embryos with elongated suspensor cells, and PEMs B, which consisted of abnormal embryogenic cells with coalesced embryos on modified Campbell and Durzan medium (mCD) supplemented with individual polyamines at 0-100 μM or amino acids at 0-16.4 mM. All additives had a stimulatory/suppressive effect. Microscopy and image-processing techniques revealed that the regions of authentic embryos of PEMs that were treated with L-ornithine were remarkably enlarged and that the suspensor cells had elongated in the same direction. When all PEMs A were transferred to maturation medium (mCD that contained abscisic acid and maltose at various concentrations), only PEMs that had been treated with L-ornithine matured into somatic embryos and were able to germinate on hormone-free mCD. Our results indicate that L-ornithine is an important stimulator of the development of PEMs to the pre-filamentous stage in C. japonica. 3ain vitro culture 3adose response 3aarginine 3aembryo (plant) 3aspermidine 3aspermine 3aCryptomeria japonica 3aornithine 3aputrescine 3aembryogenesis 3ain vitro regeneration 3aculture media 0apolyamines1 aOgita, S.1 aKubo, T.1 aFunada, R.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2006 May, v. 85, no. 2 p.229-234dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-006-9076-43electronic resource  a20060825b20060906c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/08/25  aNon-US 7aarticle01803naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245006400129300001800193520106200211650001301273650001501286653002401301653001001325700001201335700001401347700001701361773008001378852000901458939003301467946001301500655001201513IND9301984520221120090553.0930406e199209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930198452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReichard, D.L.10aComputer simulation of variables that influence spray drift  ap. 1401-1407.  aA computer program was used to determine the effects of several variables on drift distances of spray droplets.

For relative humidity and wind velocity ranges of 20-80% and 0.5-4.0 m/s, all water droplets 50 micromoles diameter and smaller that were directed downward with initial velocity of 20 m/s either completely evaporated or drifted farther than 6 m before depositing 0.5 m below point of discharge. With 20 m/s initial droplet velocity, 2.0 m/s wind velocity (20% turbulence intensity) and 60% relative humidity, 100 and 200 micromoles diameter droplets deposited at mean distances from point of discharge of 2.6 and 0.13 m respectively. Drift distances of water droplets as large as 200 micromoles diameter were influenced by initial droplet velocity and height of discharge.

We used phyllode (leaf) explants excised from 60-day-old in vitro seedlings for green compact nodule induction and, tested Murashige and Skoog (MS) media supplemented with various concentrations of 1-phenyl-3-(thiadiazol-5-yl) urea (thidiazuron) (TDZ) and αa-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). Under the optimized condition, green compact nodules and adventitious shoots were induced in 10 and 40 days, respectively, on the medium containing a combination of 0.5 mg l-1 TDZ and 0.5 mg l-1 NAA. This medium also yielded the highest rate (56%) of adventitious shoots forming from the nodules. Efficient shoot elongation was achieved by transferring the clusters of adventitious shoots to medium containing 0.1 mg l-1 TDZ within 2 months. The elongated adventitious shoots were rooted at a rate of 96.5% on half-strength MS medium with 0.5 mg l-1 3-indolebutyric acid (IBA) in 1 month. Rooted plantlets were hardened and successfully established in soil with an 80% survival rate. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing a detailed protocol for regeneration through organogenesis using phyllodes as explants for A. crassicarpa. 3adose response 3aAcacia crassicarpa 3aadventitious shoots 3aseedlings 3agibberellic acid 3aexplants 3aindole butyric acid 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3amicropropagation 3ain vitro regeneration 3aculture media 3aleaves 3aorganogenesis 0athidiazuron 0ain vitro culture 0amethodology1 aXie, X.1 aHe, X.1 aZhang, F.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2006 May, v. 85, no. 2 p.241-245dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-006-9082-63electronic resource  a20060825b20060906c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/08/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03481naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125072000900143072000900152100001500161245015200176300001600328500002400344500001500368520211100383650001702494650001502511650001602526650002202542650003902564650002102603650001302624650001502637650002102652651001802673653001302691653001602704653001702720653002202737700001602759773009102775852000902866856006702875930003302942945002502975946001103000655001203011IND4382900120221120090554.0060818e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438290012DNAL7 a10.1093/forestry/cpi0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aK2501 aBroome, A.10aValidation of Forest Condition Monitoring Programme (ICP-Forests, level 1) cone index scores by measuring cone density using a field-of-view method  ap. 159-166.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA measure of annual cone production is needed for evaluating potential seed crops and for the study of population changes of seed-eating species, but is rarely available in long time series or over extensive areas. The Forest Condition Monitoring (FCM) programme, which contributes to the International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests (ICP-Forests), has been collecting coning data for Scots pine, Norway spruce and Sitka spruce since 1989, from plots located throughout Britain. A visual assessment system is used to measure a coning index at four levels of abundance as part of the overall crown health assessment. This study tested whether the FCM abundance assessment was related to coning density, and therefore its potential for wider use in future research. Data from the survey have been compared with a field-of-view method that assesses cone density, and the cone production represented by the FCM index has thus been determined. A direct relationship between increased cone index and increased cone density was found; the use of a four-level scoring system allows different cone densities to be distinguished with some reliability. Allocation of cone scores by surveyors from year to year was shown to be consistent except in the case of abundantly coning Sitka spruce. These findings indicate that the FCM programme scoring method does reflect cone production levels and that the data can be used to assess variation in coning between sites and between years. The resolution of the coning data is adequate for assessing the potential for natural regeneration of woodlands but not for selecting stands for seed collections. It is also appropriate for use as a measure of food resource to relate to population changes in seed-eating birds and mammals, and the long-term and Britain-wide nature of these data are of particular value. There is potential for the field-of-view method to be used more widely to evaluate the quality of cone data collected at ICP-Forest sites throughout Europe where the same cone index method has been employed. 3aforest trees 3amonitoring 3aPicea abies 3aseed productivity 3agovernmental programs and projects 3aPinus sylvestris 3aconifers 3aseed cones 3aPicea sitchensis 3aGreat Britain 0acounting 0amethodology 0acone scoring 0acone index system1 aPoulsom, E.0 tForestry.g2006 Apr., v. 79, no. 2 p.159-166dOxford University Pressx0015-752X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/forestry/cpi0653electronic resource  a20061124b20061202c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/11/24  aNon-US 7aarticle03914naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125072000900143072000900152072000900161100001700170245011500187300001600302500002400318500001500342520206400357650001302421650002002434650001502454650001202469650001502481650001302496650001402509650001102523650001302534650002302547650002302570650001102593650002602604650002302630650001802653650002202671650002002693650001902713650002002732650001802752650001102770650001002781651001302791653001902804700001802823700001602841700001602857700001602873700001702889700002102906700001802927700001702945700001802962773009102980852000903071856006703080930003303147945002503180946001103205655001203216IND4382900520221120090439.0060818e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438290052DNAL7 a10.1093/forestry/cpi0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aK001 0aX1001 aKrivtsov, V.10aEcological interactions between fungi, other biota and forest litter composition in a unique Scottish woodland  ap. 201-216.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe composition of forest litter and understorey layer, and fungal biomass (in terms of ergosterol) were measured in eight subplots over a winter-spring period (January to April). The sampling site was positioned in a range of woodland habitats (variously dominated by beech, Fagus sylvatica; birch, Betula pendula x pubescens, and oak Quercus petraea) and a clear area covered with grass (dominated by Holcus lanatus). The results were analysed together with data on bacteria and microinvertebrates available from parallel research. Levels of ergosterol in individual subplots ranged between 50 and 160 micrograms g-1 DW. Fungal biomass decreased in March, and then increased significantly in April. Stepwise regression models for ergosterol indicated positive relationships with moisture content (February), bacteria (all but February and March), flagellates (February) and plant-feeding nematodes and flies (January, overall). The relationships with roots, seeds, the collective variable 'other microinvertebrates' (all March), amoebae (February) and fragments (March, overall) were negative, while the relationship between fungi- and microbial-feeding nematodes changed sign between February (-) and March (+). Results of analysis of covariance for fungal ergosterol were significant only for January and the combined dataset. In January, fungi were shown to be significantly related to amoebae, bacteria and a collembolan Folsomia candida, while the only significant predictor returned by the overall model was bacteria. Correlation analysis confirmed some effects already noted, and revealed a number of further interactions. The results highlighted the complexity of factors influencing temporal dynamics and spatial variability of fungal biomass in forest litter. Most of the registered interactions appeared to be transient, and this should be taken into account while interpreting environmental observations. Interpretation of the specific relationships is given and implications for further research and overall ecosystem functioning are discussed. 3aProtozoa 3aforest habitats 3agrasslands 3aforests 3aergosterol 3abacteria 3awoodlands 3aBetula 3amycelium 3astatistical models 3atemporal variation 3awinter 3abotanical composition 3asoil invertebrates 3awater content 3aspatial variation 3aFagus sylvatica 3aHolcus lanatus 3aQuercus petraea 3aforest litter 3aspring 3afungi 3aScotland 0aforest ecology1 aBezginova, T.1 aSalmond, R.1 aLiddell, K.1 aGarside, A.1 aThompson, J.1 aPalfreyman, J.W.1 aStaines, H.J.1 aBrendler, A.1 aGriffiths, B.0 tForestry.g2006 Apr., v. 79, no. 2 p.201-216dOxford University Pressx0015-752X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/forestry/cpi0663electronic resource  a20061124b20061202c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/11/24  aNon-US 7aarticle02600naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125072000900143072000900152072000900161072000900170072000900179100002400188245010500212300001600317500002400333500001500357520125000372650001401622650001901636650000901655650002001664650002101684650002301705650001101728650002801739651001001767653001101777653001901788653001901807700002001826700002401846773009101870852000901961856006701970930003302037945002502070946001102095655001202106IND4382900020140723000000.0060818e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438290002DNAL7 a10.1093/forestry/cpl0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF400 0aK001 0aX100 0aF200 0aF7001 aAlvarez-Alvarez, P.10aDifferentiation of sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) cultivars by leaf, nut and burr dimensions  ap. 149-158.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMorphological traits including leaf, nut and burr dimensions were measured in chestnut stands in Fonsagrada (Galicia, north-west Spain). A total of 5760 data (720 measurements of eight variables) from 72 chestnuts belonging to the three main cultivars growing in the area (Lemos, Parede and Portuguesa) were available for analysis. Two discriminant linear rules/models for classifying chestnut specimens as one of the three cultivars were developed. The models differed in terms of the sampling effort involved - the 'full' model included all the analysed variables (leaf-, nut- and burr-related variables) and the 'leaf and nut' model included only variables related to leaves and nuts. The full model performed best and correctly classified 79 per cent of the Lemos, 96 per cent of the Parede and 100 per cent of the Portuguesa cultivars, according to the results of the cross-validation method used to assess the misclassified cultivars. High accuracy was also achieved with the leaf and nut model, with only a slight increase in misclassification compared with the full model. Therefore, when time consumption is an important concern for users, the leaf and nut model is recommended as a good compromise between accuracy and sampling effort. 3acultivars 3aclassification 3anuts 3aCastanea sativa 3aplant morphology 3astatistical models 3aleaves 3acultivar identification 3aSpain 0atraits 0achestnut burrs 0aGalicia, Spain1 aBarrio-Anta, M.1 aDiéguez-Aranda, U.0 tForestry.g2006 Apr., v. 79, no. 2 p.149-158dOxford University Pressx0015-752X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/forestry/cpl0063electronic resource  a20061124b20061202c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/11/24  aNon-US 7aarticle03414naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001200167245008700179300001600266500002400282500001500306520187000321650002202191650003002213650002102243650001202264650001302276650001302289650001102302650002402313650001402337650002202351650001602373651001302389653002002402653003602422653002202458653001002480653001002490653001702500700001302517700001602530700001102546700001502557700001502572773009402587852000902681856008902690930003302779945002502812946001102837655001202848IND4382955520221120090449.0060821e20060730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438295552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2005.11.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aX1001 aMao, X.10aTidal influence on behaviour of a coastal aquifer adjacent to a low-relief estuary  ap. 110-127.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe tidal influence on groundwater hydrodynamics, salt-water intrusion and submarine groundwater discharge from coastal/estuarine aquifers is poorly quantified for systems with a mildly sloping beach, in contrast to the case where a vertical beach face is assumed. We investigated the effect of beach slope for a coastal aquifer adjacent to a low-relief estuary, where industrial waste was emplaced over the aquifer. The waste was suspected to discharge leachate towards the estuary. Field observations at various locations showed that tidally induced groundwater head fluctuations were skewed temporally. Frequency analysis suggested that the fluctuation amplitudes decreased exponentially and the phase-lags increased linearly for the primary tidal signals as they propagated inland. Salinisation zones were observed in the bottom part of the estuary and near the beach surface. Flow and transport processes in a cross-section perpendicular to the estuary were simulated using SEAWAT-2000, which is capable of depicting density-dependent flow and multi-species transport. The simulations showed that the modelled water table fluctuations were in good agreement with the monitored data. Further simulations were conducted to gain insight into the effects of beach slope. In particular the limiting case of a vertical beach face was considered. The simulations showed that density difference and tidal forcing drive a more complex hydrodynamic pattern for the mildly sloping beach than the vertical beach, as well as a profound asymmetry in tidally induced water table fluctuations and enhanced salt-water intrusion. The simulation results also indicated that contaminant transport from the aquifer to the estuary was affected by the tide, where for the mildly sloping beach, the tide tended to intensify the vertical mass exchange in the vicinity of the shoreline. 3asimulation models 3agroundwater contamination 3agroundwater flow 3abeaches 3aaquifers 3aseawater 3acoasts 3asaltwater intrusion 3aestuaries 3ahydrologic models 3awater table 3aScotland 0awater pollution 0asubmarine groundwater discharge 0aSEAWAT-2000 model 0aslope 0atides 0ahydrogeology1 aEnot, P.1 aBarry, D.A.1 aLi, L.1 aBinley, A.1 aJeng, D.S.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2006 July 30, v. 327, no. 1-2 p.110-127dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2005.11.0303Available from publisher's Web site  a20080327b20080404c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/03/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02884naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100002000170245009600190300001600286500002400302500001500326520134600341650001401687650002501701650001101726650002301737650003001760650002301790650001001813650001801823650002701841650002201868650002301890650002201913650003101935651001401966653002001980653001202000653001202012700001802024700002202042700002002064773011602084852000902200856007602209930003302285945002502318946001102343655001202354IND4382908420221120073015.0060820e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438290842DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0434.2006.01137.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF2001 aAkinsanmi, O.A.10aPathogenic Variation of Fusarium Isolates Associated with Head Blight of Wheat in Australia  ap. 513-521.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis paper examines the level of pathogenic diversity in Australian Fusarium pseudograminearum and Fusarium graminearum isolates for head blight from the assessment of 51 wheat germplasm lines, barley, triticale, rye, maize and sorghum plants. A set of nine putative wheat differentials were selected and assessed with 10 F. graminearum and 12 F. pseudograminearum isolates. Isolates of both species were pathogenic on all the wheat germplasm lines, barley triticale and rye. The isolates differed largely in a quantitative way with only small differential effects and were statistically demarcated into three pathogenicity groups: low, intermediate and high. Such distribution patterns suggest that wheat germplasm lines employ different resistance mechanisms to each group of isolates and the three pathogenicity groups may have different mechanisms controlling pathogenicity. The aggressiveness of F. graminearum and F. pseudograminearum isolates on the wheat germplasm lines were marginally correlated (r = 0.40). Durum wheats were ranked as the most susceptible while Sumai 3, Ituo Komugi, Sotome A, Sotome and Nobeokabouzu komugi were consistently grouped as resistant by both species. These findings reiterate the need to consider pathogen variability in the screening, selection and improvement of resistance to head blight in wheat. 3agermplasm 3aFusarium graminearum 3ablight 3agenetic resistance 3afungal diseases of plants 3astrain differences 3awheat 3apathogenicity 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aTriticum aestivum 3adisease resistance 3agenetic variation 3aFusarium pseudograminearum 3aAustralia 0aGibberella zeae 0aPoaceae 0astrains1 aBackhouse, D.1 aSimpfendorfer, S.1 aChakraborty, S.0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2006 Sept., v. 154, no. 9 p.513-521dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-17857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0434.2006.01137.x3electronic resource  a20070125b20070202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/11/29  aNon-US 7aarticle04033naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179100002300188245008400211300001600295500002400311520211600335650000902451650001702460650001302477650001802490650001902508650002802527650001502555650001002570650001602580650000902596650002202605650001202627650003302639650002802672650003102700650000902731650001102740650004202751650001102793650002002804650000902824650001602833650001402849650001802863650003202881650003802913650001702951650001602968650001302984651001002997653002103007700002403028700002403052773010203076852000903178856009103187930003303278945002503311946001103336655001203347IND4431350520221120063556.0100115e20100201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443135052DNAL7 a198462252pmid7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2009.09.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL830 0aX3801 aBingham, Glenda M.10aKnowledge and perceptions of dog-associated zoonoses: Brazos County, Texas, USA  ap. 211-221.  aIncludes references  aIn order to assess the knowledge and perceptions of dog-associated zoonoses in Brazos County, Texas, random digit dialing was used to select 922 households for participation in a cross-sectional telephone survey. The interviews were completed during June 2008 and yielded a response rate of 55% (922/1691). Fifty-six percent of the respondents who completed the questionnaire owned dogs. Eighty-six percent of the respondents indicated they would report being bitten by a dog that they did not own. Five factors were shown to be significantly associated with such reporting. Those respondents who believed that rabies could be transmitted by bats were 5.5 times more likely (95% CI: 1.6, 18.6) to report a dog bite compared to people who did not hold this belief. Respondents who would seek emergency treatment if they believed they had been exposed to rabies were 3.1 times more likely to report a bite (95% CI: 1.8, 5.4). Those who were over 60 years of age were 2.3 times more likely (95% CI: 1.2, 4.4) to report being bitten when compared to respondents who were under the age of 60. Living inside the city limits also increased the chance that the respondent would report being bitten by a dog (OR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.4, 3.9). Females were 2.3 times more likely (95% CI: 1.3, 3.7) to report being bitten than their male counterparts. Dog ownership did not have a significant impact on reporting. Only 85% of respondents stated that they would seek emergency treatment if they believed that they may have been exposed to rabies. In addition, only 59% of respondents were aware that exposure to rabies without treatment could lead to death. While 98% of respondents had heard of rabies and knew that it was possible to get it from a dog, only 54% of respondents knew that worms could be transmitted from dogs to people. This study demonstrated that many people surveyed lacked knowledge about dog-associated zoonotic diseases, which could seriously impact their health and the health of their families. It is important to find a method of getting information out to the public in order to correct this deficiency. 3adogs 3adog diseases 3azoonoses 3apublic health 3aquestionnaires 3across-sectional studies 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAnimals 2aBites and Stingsxveterinary 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDog Diseasesxtransmission 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHumans 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aOwnership 2aPublic Health 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRabiesxtransmissionxveterinary. 2aRisk Factors 2aYoung Adult 2aZoonoses 3aTexas 0ahealth knowledge1 aBudke, Christine M.1 aSlater, Margaret R.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2010 Feb. 1, v. 93, no. 2-3 p.211-221dElsevierx0167-58777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2009.09.0193Available from publisher's Web site  a20100330b20100403c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/03/08  aNon-US 7aarticle04397naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188100001400197245013500211300001600346500002400362500001500386520244400401650001302845650002302858650001102881650002302892650002902915650002002944650002202964650003702986650002503023650001203048650001103060650002803071650008903099650001503188650005603203650001103259650000903270650002003279650002903299650002503328651001803353653002003371653002903391700001603420700001703436700001803453700001703471773010203488852000903590856009103599930003303690945002503723946001103748655001203759IND4431350120221120063432.0100115e20100201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443135012DNAL7 a198368472pmid7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2009.09.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL840 0aX100 0aX3801 aAdkin, A.10aEstimating the impact on the food chain of changing bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) control measures: The BSE Control Model  ap. 170-182.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe decline in the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) epidemic in Great Britain (GB) demands a review of control strategies to ensure that they remain proportionate. Amongst controls that are subject to review are those intended to minimise the risk of BSE exposure of consumers through food. Such risk mitigation steps are costly, and the relative impact of each in terms of human exposure to BSE infectivity is not known. This risk assessment, termed the BSE Control Model, aims to estimate by use of stochastic simulation the impact of testing of cattle at slaughter and the removal of Specified Risk Materials (SRM) on potential BSE infectivity consumed. This paper describes the use of the model to investigate the effect of different risk management methods that have been or could be implemented between 2005 and 2010. Our results suggest that the amount of infectivity consumed in 2005 with the Over Thirty Month (OTM) rule in place was a mean of 0.03 bovine oral ID₅₀ (BO ID₅₀). This is an extremely low amount, particularly considering that it would be spread over, on average, 236 infected carcases that would be further sub-divided into portions for human consumption. The highest contributor to the total amount of infectivity consumed per year is spinal contamination at carcase splitting (35%). In 2006 the OTM scheme was discontinued and head meat was again permitted into the food chain. These changes resulted in an increase in the amount of infectivity consumed, rising to an estimated 28 BO ID₅₀ in 2006, and 19 BO ID₅₀ in 2007. In 2008 the age at removal of vertebral column was raised from 24 to 30 months, and an estimated 24 BO ID₅₀ of infectivity was consumed. At the beginning of 2009 the age at testing of cattle was raised to 48 months for healthy slaughter, emergency slaughter and fallen stock. Under these conditions, an estimated mean of 24 BO ID₅₀ will be consumed in 2009, decreasing to 20 BO ID₅₀ in 2010. Even though presented in terms of bovine rather than human oral ID₅₀, such estimates represent an extremely low exposure of the British population. Considerable uncertainty would surround any attempt to try to convert such exposure into estimates of new cases of vCJD, but the most recent estimates of the size of the species barrier between cattle and humans (4000, ) suggest that there would be few, if any, new cases of vCJD arising from such exposure levels. 3azoonoses 3adisease prevention 3acattle 3afood contamination 3adisease control programs 3arisk assessment 3afoodborne illness 3abovine spongiform encephalopathy 3astochastic processes 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aEncephalopathy, Bovine Spongiformxepidemiologyxprevention & controlxtransmission. 2aFood Chain 2aFood Contaminationxanalysisxprevention & control. 2aHumans 2aMeat 2aRisk Assessment 2aRisk Managementxmethods 2aStochastic Processes 3aGreat Britain 0acattle diseases 0aSpecified Risk Materials1 aWebster, V.1 aArnold, M.E.1 aWells, G.A.H.1 aMatthews, D.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2010 Feb. 1, v. 93, no. 2-3 p.170-182dElsevierx0167-58777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2009.09.0183Available from publisher's Web site  a20100330b20100403c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/03/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02563naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179100001900188245008300207300001800290500002400308520113500332650001601467650001201483650002101495650001801516650001301534650002001547650002001567650003401587650001101621650002401632650005301656650003201709651001001741651001001751700002201761700001601783773011301799852000901912856009101921930003302012945002502045946001102070655001202081IND4431347320221120054417.0100115e20100201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443134732DNAL7 a198544692pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ200 0aP2101 aTyagi, Larisha10aWater management — A tool for methane mitigation from irrigated paddy fields  ap. 1085-1090.  aIncludes references  aWater drainage is considered to be one of the important practices that reduce the CH₄ efflux from paddy fields. In this study, four different drainage systems (continuous flooding, tillering stage drainage, mid-season drainage and multiple drainage) were compared to find out the best one, for attenuation of CH₄ emission from rice fields. Except for continuous flooding, from all the other three drainage systems, irrigation water from the paddy fields was drained out at the different stages of the crop cycle. Highest efflux of the methane was recorded from continuously flooded plots (346.6mg/m²/day), followed by 9% less CH₄ efflux from tillering stage drainage (315.1mg/m²/day), 36.7% less efflux from mid-season drainage (219.3mg/m²/day) and the least 41% CH₄ efflux from multiple drainage plots (204.7mg/m²/day). Among all the four different drainage systems applied, mid-season drainage and multiple drainage were found to be highly effective in mitigating methane efflux. Redox potential of the soil of the drainage system was found to be inversely proportional to the methane efflux from all the treatments. 3apaddy soils 3amethane 3agreenhouse gases 3agas emissions 3adrainage 3aredox potential 3asoil properties 2aMethanexanalysisxchemistry. 2aOryza. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxchemistry. 2aWater Purificationxmethods 3aIndia 0aIndia1 aBabitā Kumārī.1 aSingh, S.N.0 tScience of the total environment.g2010 Feb. 1, v. 408, no. 5 p.1085-1090dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.09.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20100603b20100703c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/06/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03217naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188100001700197245013500214300001800349500002400367520154200391650002301933650002101956650002201977650001301999650002202012650005902034650001602093650003602109650004002145650002402185650003802209650004102247700001302288700001402301700001502315700001302330700002102343700002202364700001902386773011302405852000902518856009102527930003302618945002502651946001102676655001202687IND4431346820221120054433.0100115e20100201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443134682DNAL7 a200063742pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.11.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aX350 0aM0011 aChen, Huilun10aToxicity of three phenolic compounds and their mixtures on the gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis in the aquatic environment  ap. 1043-1049.  aIncludes references  aAlthough phenolic compounds are intensively studied for their toxic effects on the environment, the toxicity of catechol, resorcinol and hydroquinone mixtures are still not well understood because most previous bioassays are conducted solely using single compound based on acute tests. In this work, the adverse effect of individual phenolic compounds (catechol, resorcinol and hydroquinone) and the interactive effect of the binary and tertiary mixtures on Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) using microcalorimetric method were examined. The toxicity of individual phenolic compounds follows the order catechol>resorcinol>hydroquinone with their respective half inhibitory concentration as 437, 728 and 934µgmL⁻ ¹. The power-time curve of B. subtilis growth obtained by microcalorimetry is in complete agreement with the change in turbidity of B. subtilis against time, demonstrating that microcalorimetric method agrees well with the routine microbiological method. The toxicity data obtained from phenolic compound mixtures show that catechol and hydroquinone mixture possess synergistic effect while the other mixtures display additive joint actions. Furthermore, the concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) models were employed to predict the toxicities of the phenolic compounds. The experimental results of microcalorimetry show no significant difference on the toxicity of the phenolic compound mixtures from that predicted by CA. However, IA prediction underestimated the mixture effects in all the experiments. 3aphenolic compounds 3atoxicity testing 3aBacillus subtilis 3abacteria 3aaquatic organisms 2aBacillus subtilisxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aCalorimetry 2aCatecholsxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aHydroquinonesxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aModels, Theoretical 2aResorcinolsxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity1 aYao, Jun1 aWang, Fei1 aZhou, Yong1 aChen, Ke1 aZhuang, Rensheng1 aChoi, Martin M.F.1 aZáray, Gyula.0 tScience of the total environment.g2010 Feb. 1, v. 408, no. 5 p.1043-1049dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.11.0513Available from publisher's Web site  a20100603b20100703c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/06/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03531naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188100002000197245012600217300001800343500002400361520183800385650001402223650002702237650001202264650002302276650002502299650002202324650002102346650002902367650003402396650003102430650001902461650003402480650002102514650005302535650002302588650001302611651001502624651002702639653002202666700001902688773011302707852000902820856009102829930003302920945002502953946001102978655001202989IND4431348120221120054544.0100115e20100201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443134812DNAL7 a199229782pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.10.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aJ800 0aM0011 aMiles, A.

Little is known of baseline levels of contaminants in these ponds, particularly mercury (Hg), which has a well established legacy in the Bay. In this study we described spatial and short-term temporal variations in sediment Hg species concentrations within and among the Alviso and Eden Landing salt ponds in the southern region of San Francisco Bay. We determined total Hg (Hgt) and methylmercury (MeHg) in the top 5cm of sediment of most ponds in order to establish baseline conditions prior to restoration, sediment Hgt concentrations in a subset of these ponds after commencement of restoration, and variation in MeHg concentrations relative to sediment Hgt, pH, and total Fe concentrations and water depth and salinity in the subset of Alviso ponds. Inter-pond differences were greatest within the Alviso pond complex, where sediment Hgt concentrations averaged (arithmetic mean) 0.74μg/g pre and 1.03μg/g post-restoration activity compared to 0.11μg/g pre and post at Eden Landing ponds. Sediment Hgt levels at Alviso were fairly stable temporally and spatially, whereas MeHg levels were variable relative to restoration activities across time and space. Mean (arithmetic) sediment MeHg concentrations increased (2.58 to 3.03ng/g) in Alviso and decreased (2.20 to 1.03ng/g) in Eden Landing restoration ponds during the study. Differences in MeHg levels were related to water depth and pH, but these relationships were not consistent between years or among ponds and were viewed with caution. Factors affecting MeHg levels in these ponds (and in general) are highly complex and require in-depth study to understand. 3aestuaries 3asediment contamination 3amercury 3atemporal variation 3aspatial distribution 3aagricultural land 3aland restoration 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aIronxanalysis 2aMercuryxanalysisxchemistry. 2aWaterxchemistry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxchemistry. 2aWater Purification 2aWetlands 3aCalifornia 0aSan Francisco (Calif.) 0aevaporation ponds1 aRicca, Mark A.0 tScience of the total environment.g2010 Feb. 1, v. 408, no. 5 p.1154-1165dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.10.0423Available from publisher's Web site  a20100604b20100703c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/06/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03261naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245011800186300001800304500002400322520160900346650004301955650001301998650000902011650003002020650001402050650001602064650001502080650001202095650001702107650001502124650002802139650003102167650001302198650001302211650003402224650002002258650001502278650002702293650002602320650003002346650002802376650002302404700002302427700002802450700002302478700001902501700002102520773010902541852000902650856004802659655001202707IND4391917120221120030428.0070529e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439191712DNAL7 a173230402pmid7 a10.1007/s00122-007-0521-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchrag, Tobias A.10aPrediction of single-cross hybrid performance in maize using haplotype blocks associated with QTL for grain yield  ap. 1345-1355.  aIncludes references  aMarker-based prediction of hybrid performance facilitates the identification of untested single-cross hybrids with superior yield performance. Our objectives were to (1) determine the haplotype block structure of experimental germplasm from a hybrid maize breeding program, (2) develop models for hybrid performance prediction based on haplotype blocks, and (3) compare hybrid performance prediction based on haplotype blocks with other approaches, based on single AFLP markers or general combining ability (GCA), under a validation scenario relevant for practical breeding. In total, 270 hybrids were evaluated for grain yield in four Dent x Flint factorial mating experiments. Their parental inbred lines were genotyped with 20 AFLP primer-enzyme combinations. Adjacent marker loci were combined into haplotype blocks. Hybrid performance was predicted on basis of single marker loci and haplotype blocks. Prediction based on variable haplotype block length resulted in an improved prediction of hybrid performance compared with the use of single AFLP markers. Estimates of prediction efficiency (R ² ) ranged from 0.305 to 0.889 for marker-based prediction and from 0.465 to 0.898 for GCA-based prediction. For inter-group hybrids with predominance of general over specific combining ability, the hybrid prediction from GCA effects was efficient in identifying promising hybrids. Considering the advantage of haplotype block approaches over single marker approaches for the prediction of inter-group hybrids, we see a high potential to substantially improve the efficiency of hybrid breeding programs. 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3abreeding 3acorn 3ageneral combining ability 3agermplasm 3agrain yield 3ahaplotypes 3ahybrids 3ainbred lines 3aprediction 3aquantitative trait loci 3aspecific combining ability 2aBiometry 2aBreeding 2aCrops, Agriculturalxgenetics 2aGenetic Markers 2aHaplotypes 2aHybridization, Genetic 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 2aZea maysxgenetics1 aMaurer, Hans Peter1 aMelchinger, Albrecht E.1 aPiepho, Hans-Peter1 aPeleman, Johan1 aFrisch, Matthias0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2007 May, v. 114, no. 8 p.1345-1355dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-007-0521-5 7aarticle02540naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245008300161300001600244500002400260520127200284650001101556650001801567650002201585650001501607650001001622650001401632650002301646650001601669650001101685650002101696650001401717650001101731650001001742650002201752650002001774650002201794650001701816700001801833700001501851700001601866700001501882700001201897773009201909852000902001856004802010655001202058IND4456881320221120030334.0110417e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445688132DNAL7 a10.1007/s00271-010-0237-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen-Gal, A.14aThe influence of bearing cycles on olive oil production response to irrigation  ap. 253-263.  aIncludes references  aWater requirements for olive oil production and the effects of deficit irrigation were determined while considering the relative fruit loads on trees occurring as a result of biennial bearing cycles. Two Israeli olive (Olea europaea) varieties (Barnea and Souri) were evaluated for growth and yield parameters in a 4-year field study where five relative irrigation rates were applied. Increasing irrigation increased stem water potential, vegetative growth, and olive fruit yield with the increases tapering off at application rates reaching 75-100% of potential crop evapotranspiration. Tree water status, growth, and fruit characteristic parameters were highly affected by both fruit load and by irrigation level. Oil yield increases as a function of increased irrigation were initiated for each cultivar only following an ‘off' season when the treatments lead to higher vegetative growth. The increased oil yields as a function of increased irrigation were primarily explained by higher tree-scale capacity for carrying fruit, especially as irrigation alleviated measureable water stress. For the Barnea cultivar in ‘on' years, a secondary effect due to increased oil per fruit as irrigation increased was evident, particularly at the higher application rates. 3aBarnea 3aOlea europaea 3acarrying capacity 3acrop yield 3acrops 3acultivars 3adeficit irrigation 3afruit trees 3afruits 3airrigation rates 3aolive oil 3aolives 3astems 3avegetative growth 3awater potential 3awater requirement 3awater stress1 aYermiyahu, U.1 aZipori, I.1 aPresnov, E.1 aHanoch, E.1 aDag, A.0 tIrrigation science.g2011 May, v. 29, no. 3 p.253-263dSpringer-Verlagx0342-71887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00271-010-0237-1 7aarticle02293naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245014300182300001400325520113300339650001101472650001401483650001501497650001601512650002301528650002301551650001901574650002001593653001301613653001201626700001601638700001901654773007101673852000901744856008501753930003301838945001301871946001101884655001201895IND2180444720221117160702.0981014e199802  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218044472DNAL7 a184839682pmid7 a10.1080/030794598084192782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGanapathy, K.10aPathogenicity of in vivo-passaged Mycoplasma imitans in turkey poults in single infection and in dual infection with rhinotracheitis virus  ap. 80-89.  aMycoplasma imitans (Mim) is a close relative of Mycoplasma gallisepticum (Mg), but has been isolated from ducks, geese and partridge. In order to investigate its potential pathogenicity for turkeys a UK isolate of Mim from a partridge with sinusitis was first passaged through turkey poults and then assessed for pathogenicity in turkey embryo tracheal organ cultures (TOCs) and in one-day-old turkey poults with or without turkey rhinotracheitis virus (TRTV). Mim appeared to gain virulence on passage through poults and this was confirmed by an increased ciliostatic effect in TOCs. In single infection in poults the organism caused mild upper respiratory disease but in dual infection with TRTV there was a significant increase in clinical signs and lesions. The mycoplasma was only isolated from upper respiratory tract in single infection but was recovered also from lung and airsacs in the presence of the virus. There was also a higher humoral immune response in the dual infection than the single Mim infection and there were some cross-reactions with commercial Mg stained antigen in the rapid serum agglutination test. 3apoults 3avirulence 3aMycoplasma 3aPneumovirus 3arespiratory system 3aantibody formation 3across reaction 3amixed infection 0asymptoms 0alesions1 aJones, R.C.1 aBradbury, J.M.0 tAvian pathology.g1998 Feb., v. 27, no. 1 p.80-89x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794598084192783Available from publisher's Web site  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02450naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245017400182300001400356500001500370520118200385650001301567650001401580650002801594650002501622650002401647653002701671653002201698653002801720700001701748700001501765700001801780700002001798773007101818852000901889856008501898930003301983945001302016946001102029655001202040IND2180444820221117160715.0981014e199802  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218044482DNAL7 a184839692pmid7 a10.1080/030794598084192792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollins, M.S.10aAntigenic and phylogenetic studies on a variant Newcastle disease virus using anti-fusion protein monoclonal antibodies and partial sequencing of the fusion protein gene  ap. 90-96.  a2019-12-04  aA virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolate, 34/90, reported to show considerable antigenic diversity from more classical strains of NDV, including vaccine strains, was evaluated phylogenetically and for the presence of neutralizing epitopes on the fusion protein. Comparison of a 309 nucleotide sequence of the fusion protein gene of 34/90 with other viruses confirmed the diversity of this virus, placing it in a discrete fifth genetic lineage with an avirulent virus isolated from waterfowl and genetically quite distant from other strains and isolates. The virus-neutralizing mAbs used in the present study were directed against at least seven distinct epitopes on the fusion protein. Of these seven, five are shared by 34/90 and the live vaccine virus Hitchner B1 and these plus an additional epitope are shared by 34/90 and strain Ulster 2C, which is used in inactivated vaccines. Two potential distinct epitopes were also shared by these three viruses. The results suggest that despite the detected antigenic and genetic variation of 34/90, it is unlikely that mutants which fail to be neutralized by antibodies induced by conventional vaccines would arise readily. 3aepitopes 3aphylogeny 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3anucleotide sequences 3aantigenic variation 0aenvelope glycoproteins 0agenetic variation 0aNewcastle disease virus1 aFranklin, S.1 aStrong, I.1 aMeulemans, G.1 aAlexander, D.J.0 tAvian pathology.g1998 Feb., v. 27, no. 1 p.90-96x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794598084192793Available from publisher's Web site  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02585naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245012000182300001600302500004500318520111200363650001301475650001701488650003601505650003001541650002101571650001701592650001501609650002601624650001401650650002301664650001001687650001601697650001701713650003501730653002801765700001701793700001901810700001801829700002001847773007301867852000901940856008501949930003302034945001302067946001102080655001202091IND2181309720221123040823.0981124e199804  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218130972DNAL7 a184839842pmid7 a10.1080/030794598084193212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNielsen, O.L.10aInflammatory response of different chicken lines and B haplotypes to infection with infectious bursal disease virus  ap. 181-189.  aSummaries in French, German, and Spanish  aChickens representing two different inbred lines (layer and meat-type) and three different B haplotypes (BW1, B19 and B131) were infected with infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) at 21 days of age. Mortality was recorded, and surviving chickens were killed and examined either 3 or 17 days post-infection. Non-infected control chickens were run in parallel. The variables recorded were all significantly changed by the virus infection, including the serum concentration of mannan-binding lectin that was increased 2-fold 3 days post-infection. A significantly increased mortality, liver to body weight ratio and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was seen among chickens from the layer type line compared with the meat-type line. In addition, the haplotype of the chickens influenced the atrophy and hypertrophy of the thymus. It was concluded that the meat-type chicken line was more resistant to IBDV infection than the layer-type line, and that mortality rate, liver to body weight ratio and ESR were valuable variables for evaluation of the level of IBDV infection-induced inflammation and disease. 3achickens 3ainbred lines 3aInfectious bursal disease virus 3ainfectious bursal disease 3aline differences 3ainflammation 3ahaplotypes 3alaboratory techniques 3amortality 3adisease resistance 3aliver 3abody weight 3aerythrocytes 3aerythrocyte sedimentation rate 0aexperimental infections1 aSorensen, P.1 aHedemand, J.E.1 aLaursen, S.B.1 aJorgensen, P.H.0 tAvian pathology.g1998 Apr., v. 27, no. 2 p.181-189x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794598084193213Available from publisher's Web site  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02235naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245006500167300001400232500002400246520142100270650001701691650001601708650001901724650001001743700001601753700001701769773009501786852000901881856005501890655001201945IND4433791720221123014858.0100313e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443379172DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2338.2009.02349.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClover, G.10aInternational diagnostic protocols for regulated plant pests  ap. 24-29.  aIncludes references  aThe development and use of international standards for phytosanitary measures provides a framework for establishing actions to protect plant health that are harmonized and science-based. Standards for diagnostic processes are being developed to harmonize detection and identification procedures to enable safe movement and trade of plants and plant products. The aim is to increase the transparency of diagnostic processes and to foster trust and mutual recognition of test results. Diagnostic protocols may also assist in dispute resolution between trading partners and contribute to technical assistance programmes. The Interim Commission on Phytosanitary Measures in 2003 identified the development of international standards for diagnostic procedures for regulated pests as a priority. An ongoing 'Technical Panel on Diagnostic Protocols' was established in 2004 to manage the development of protocols for such pests. The panel was involved in the development of a standard that clarifies the purpose and use of international diagnostic protocols and describes the requirements for them and their development. After consultation the 'Diagnostic Protocols for Regulated Pests' standard (ISPM No. 27) was adopted in 2006 by the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures. Draft diagnostic protocols are in development for over 30 pests, and a draft protocol for Thrips palmi has been sent for international consultation. 3aThrips palmi 3aplant pests 3aplant products 3atrade1 aHammons, S.1 aUnger, J.-G.0 tBulletin OEPP.g2010 Apr., v. 40, no. 1 p.24-29dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0250-80527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2338.2009.02349.x 7aarticle04190naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111024002200147040001800169100002000187245013700207300001600344500002400360500001500384506007600399520172800475506003702203650001902240650001602259650001202275650001402287650001202301650001102313650001302324650001902337650001602356650001202372650001302384650002302397650001402420650001402434650002002448650001002468650000902478650002102487650003402508650002402542650001902566650004602585650001102631650003802642650001102680650002002691650000902711650001602720650003702736650004802773650006302821650004002884650002602924650001802950650002202968650002802990650001603018653002603034700003203060700002003092700002003112700002503132700001603157700001903173773013403192852000903326856004903335655001203384IND4437715820221207132550.0100528e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443771582DNAL7 a204977822pmid7 a10.1016/j.jada.2010.03.0172doi7 aPMC44289322pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaraulet, Marta10aPERIOD2 Variants Are Associated with Abdominal Obesity, Psycho-Behavioral Factors, and Attrition in the Dietary Treatment of Obesity  ap. 917-921.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe purpose of this research was to test for association between polymorphisms in the circadian clock-related gene PERIOD2 (PER2) and attrition in patients prone to withdrawal from a behavioral weight-reduction program based on the Mediterranean diet. A total of 454 overweight/obese participants (women=380, men=74), aged 20 to 65 years, who attended outpatient clinics specializing in obesity between January and December 2008, were studied. Anthropometric, biochemical, and dietary-intake variables were analyzed. Effectiveness of the program was assessed, and a questionnaire of barriers to weight loss was considered. Multivariate analysis and logistic regression models were performed. Results indicate that PER2 polymorphisms rs2304672C>G and rs4663302C>T were associated with abdominal obesity (P<0.05). Participants who withdrew from treatment were significantly more obese and had more barriers to lose weight (P<0.05). They also displayed a lower likelihood of planning eating in advance and experiencing stress with dieting than those who completed treatment. Frequency of rs4663307 minor allele was significantly greater in withdrawers than in those who successfully completed treatment (P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that rs2304672 C>G minor allele carriers had a greater probability of dropping out, displaying extreme snacking, experiencing stress with dieting, eating when bored, and skipping breakfast than noncarriers. PER2 is implicated in attrition in weight-loss treatment and may modulate eating-behavior-related phenotypes. These findings could represent a step toward personalized health care and nutrition based on a combination of genotyping and psycho-behavioral characterization.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aquestionnaires 3aprobability 3aalleles 3aphenotype 3adieting 3asnacks 3adropouts 3alogit analysis 3aweight loss 3aobesity 3apatients 3aMediterranean diet 3abreakfast 3aingestion 3ahealth services 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBehavior Therapy 2aCognitive Behavioral Therapy. 2aDiet, Mediterranean 2aDiet, Reducing 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiologyxpsychology. 2aFemale 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aHumans 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxdiet therapyxgenetics. 2aObesity, Abdominalxdiet therapyxgenetics. 2aPatient Dropoutsxpsychologyxstatistics & numerical data. 2aPeriod Circadian Proteinsxgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aSelf Efficacy 2aTreatment Outcome 2aWeight Lossxphysiology 2aYoung Adult 0amultivariate analysis1 aCorbalán-Tutau, M.

CLINICAL FINDINGS On the basis of the rabbit's radiographic findings, a diagnosis of diaphragmatic retroperitoneal perirenal fat and kidney herniation was made. Nine months later, physical examination revealed increased respiratory rate and effort and slightly decreased body weight. Thoracic radiography revealed decreased lung aeration and further craniomedial displacement of the right kidney, compared with the initial evaluation findings, suggesting progressive herniation of the retroperitoneal perirenal fat. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME During exploratory celiotomy, a tear in the right dorsal tendinous portion of the diaphragm was noted. The right kidney and perirenal fat were found to be displaced into the thorax. Diaphragmatic herniorrhaphy was performed after replacement of the right kidney and the perirenal fat in the retroperitoneal space. The rabbit recovered uneventfully from anesthesia and surgery. Clinical signs did not recur during the following 16 months. CLINICAL RELEVANCE For rabbits with increased respiratory effort, diaphragmatic retroperitoneal perirenal fat and kidney herniation should be included as a differential diagnosis. As illustrated by the case described in this report, appropriate surgical management can provide a successful outcome for affected pet rabbits. 3aOryctolagus cuniculus 3aaeration 3aanesthesia 3abody weight 3aclinical examination 3adiaphragm 3akidneys 3amales 3arabbits 3aradiography 3arespiratory rate 3asurgery 3athorax1 aChu, Che-Chu1 aWang, Hsien-Chi1 aChen, Kuan-Sheng0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g2016 June 15, v. 248, no. 12 p.1399-1403dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1913x0003-14887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/javma.248.12.1399  aDNAL 7aarticle01879naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002300149245011900172300001400291500002400305520100600329650002101335650001201356650001601368700001801384700001801402773012001420852000901540856005201549655001201601IND4463300120221122235302.0120524e200204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446330012DNAL7 a10.1016/S1466-8564(02)00002-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRademacher, Britta10aEffect of the pressurizing ramp on the inactivation of Listeria innocua considering thermofluiddynamical processes  ap. 19-24.  aIncludes references  aThe effect of the pressurization ramp on the inactivation kinetics of Listeria innocua suspended in Tris buffer has been studied experimentally in an optical pressure cell. Additionally, the thermofluiddynamical processes occurring at the different pressure ramps have been considered. The results obtained at room temperature show that the inactivation effect of high pressure remains the same in case of a fast pressurization ramp (500 MPa/min) and a slow depressurization ramp (100 MPa/min) in comparison to a slow pressurization ramp (100 MPa/min) and a fast depressurization ramp (500 MPa/min). At the chosen test conditions, the fluiddynamical and thermal processes of the two variations differ only slightly from each other. This has been ascertained by measuring the velocity and temperature distributions occurring at the pressure processes. The conclusion is that the pressurization and depressurization rate, respectively, do not effect per se the inactivation kinetics of Listeria innocua. 3aListeria innocua 3abuffers 3atemperature1 aWerner, Franz1 aPehl, Michael0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2002 Apr., v. 3, no. 1 p.19-24dElsevier Sciencex1466-85647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1466-8564(02)00002-4 7aarticle03265naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100001800170245013500188300001400323500002400337520180000361650001402161650002302175650002502198650001502223650001802238650002202256650002002278650001902298653002602317653001502343653002402358653001902382653001802401653001402419700001502433700001602448700001602464773013302480852000902613856009202622930003302714945002502747946001102772655001202783IND4431304220221122225549.0100115e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443130422DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2885.2009.01084.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL810 0aL6001 aCHOUDHURY, S.10aCellular coupling of potassium channels with β₂ adrenoceptors in mediating myometrial relaxation in buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis)  ap. 22-27.  aIncludes references  aChoudhury, S., Garg, S. K., Singh, T. U., Mishra, S. K. Cellular coupling of potassium channels with β₂ adrenoceptors in mediating myometrial relaxation in buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis). J. vet. Pharmacol. Therap. 33, 22-27. Present study unravels the functional presence of potassium channels and their involvement in mediating β₂ adrenoceptors-induced myometrial relaxation in buffalo myometrium. Isolated myometrial preparations exhibited rhythmic spontaneity with regular pattern of amplitude and frequency. Levcromakalim produced concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on myometrial spontaneity and relaxant effect and the dose-response curve (DRC) was shifted towards right in the presence of glybenclamaide. In the tissues pretreated with glybenclamide, relaxant effect of albuterol was significantly (P < 0.05-0.001) lower (pD₂ = 6.94, Rmax = 96.8 ± 3.3%; n = 5) compared with albuterol alone (pD₂ = 8.55, Rmax = 101.1 ± 6.3%; n = 6) and the DRC was shifted to right. In the presence of tetraethyl ammonium (TEA) also, significant (P < 0.001) rightward shift of DRC of albuterol with decrease in maximal effect (pD₂ = 8.05, Rmax = 71.2 ± 7.4%; n = 7 vs. control pD₂ = 8.55, Rmax = 101.1 ± 6.3%; n = 6) was observed. On the other hand, 4-aminopyridine (1 m m) sensitized the myometrial strips and increased the amplitude and frequency/min of myometrial spontaneity but failed to significantly alter the DRC of albuterol. Results of present study suggest the functional presence of KATP, BKCa and KV channels in buffalo myometrium, but β₂-adrenoreceptor agonist-induced myometrial relaxation seems to be KATP and BKCa channel-dependent only. Further, our studies also suggest promising therapeutic potential of potassium channel modulators as tocolytics in buffaloes. 3abuffaloes 3apotassium channels 3aadrenergic receptors 3amyometrium 3adose response 3amuscle physiology 3a4-aminopyridine 3atissue culture 0amyometrial relaxation 0atocolytics 0abeta2 adrenoceptors 0aglybenclamaide 0alevcromakalim 0aalbuterol1 aGARG, S.K.1 aSINGH, T.U.1 aMishra, SK.0 tJournal of veterinary pharmacology and therapeutics.g2010 Feb., v. 33, no. 1 p.22-27dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2885.2009.01084.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110625b20110701c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/03/09  aNon-US 7aarticle03841naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180072000900189072000900198100002800207245008400235300001500319500002400334520164700358650001602005650001902021650001602040650002302056650001102079650001302090650001802103650002102121650002102142650001702163650001202180650002802192650002902220650001402249650003202263650002602295650004002321650004802361650001102409650002802420650002702448650001102475650003802486650006002524650002702584650001302611650002902624650006002653650002802713650000902741650001102750700002502761700002702786700003202813773010202845852000902947856009202956930003303048945002503081946001303106655001203119IND4431292920140725000000.0100115e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443129292DNAL7 a204922112pmid7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2009.01403.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX380 0aQ205 0aQ5051 aReyes, Mariana Ramírez10aMutagenicity and Safety Evaluation of Water Extract of Coriander sativum Leaves  ap.

Several studies have described its biological properties and some reports have indicated its pharmacological actions in some human pathology. However, data on its toxicity and metabolism are limited or null, and no research has been conducted with mammalian cells. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the mutagenicity and safety of Coriandrum sativum extract. The mutagenic effects of C. sativum extract were evaluated by Ames test. Mutagenicity was present when the C. sativum extract was used in high concentrations in both tested strains (Salmonella typhimurium TA97 and TA102). Our research showed that C. sativum extract reduced the cell survival of human cell lines (WRL-68 and 293Q cells) by inducing apoptosis and necrosis in the cases where extract concentration was the highest. The C. sativum extract altered the cell cycle; it increased the G1 phase of hepatic cells and reduced the G2+M phase in both cell lines in a dose-response manner. These results showed correlation with a reduction in the mitotic index. The extract also induced severe malformations during embryonic development. Exposure of chicken embryos to the C. sativum extract resulted in a dose-dependent increase of anomalies. Present results show that C. sativum extract reduced the axial skeleton and affected the neural tube, the somites, the cardiovascular structures, and the eye. According to the present results, the C. sativum aqueous extract cannot be considered safe. These results indicate that some significant adverse effects of C. sativum extract could be observed in vivo. 3amutagenesis 3asafety testing 3afood safety 3aCoriandrum sativum 3aleaves 3acilantro 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3ahuman cell lines 3acytotoxicity 2aAnimals 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCell Cyclexdrug effects 2aCell Line 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aCoriandrumxchemistry 2aEmbryonic Developmentxdrug effects 2aEpithelial Cellsxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aFertilityxdrug effects 2aG1 Phasexdrug effects 2aHumans 2aKidneyxdrug effectsxembryology. 2aLiverxdrug effectsxembryologyxpathologyxphysiology. 2aMutagensxpharmacology 2aNecrosis 2aOils, Volatilexanalysis 2aPlant Extractsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aRats 2aSafety1 aReyes-Esparza, Jorge1 aÁngeles, Oscar Torres1 aRodríguez-Fragoso, Lourdes0 tJournal of food science.g2010 , v. 75, no. 1 p.T6-T12dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2009.01403.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100824b20100903c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/03/08  aOther US 7aarticle02674naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100001600180245011100196300001600307500002400323520100100347650001901348650001801367650002201385650001601407650001901423650001801442650001901460650002601479650001301505650003101518650004101549650001101590650001901601650001401620650001301634650006101647650004101708650000901749651001001758653003001768700001201798700002001810700001501830773010301845852000901948856009201957930003302049945002502082946001302107655001202120IND4431292520221122225612.0100115e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443129252DNAL7 a204922072pmid7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2009.01436.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aFan, Wenlai10aIdentification and Quantification of Impact Aroma Compounds in 4 Nonfloral Vitis vinifera Varieties Grapes  ap.

The GC-O study revealed the presence of 58 aroma compounds in which 53 odorants were identified. The most significant odor active volatiles in 4 grape berries were β-damascenone, hexanal, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal, β-ionone, and unknown (RI = 1612). The quantification of volatile aroma compounds in grapes was developed using headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The influences of SPME fiber, extracting temperature, and time on the extraction of volatile compounds in grape were investigated. The aroma compounds in 4 grapes were quantified. According to the odor activity values (OAVs), (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal (OAV from 334 to 777), β-damascenone (OAV 245-790), β-ionone (OAV 97-193), and acetic acid (OAV 7-165) had comparatively high OVA values. 3aodor compounds 3afood analysis 3afruit composition 3awine grapes 3awine cultivars 3afruit quality 3aVitis vinifera 3aquantitative analysis 2aAlcohols 2aCarboxylic Acidsxanalysis 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aHumans 2aNorisoprenoids 2aOdorants. 2aTerpenes 2aVitisxclassificationxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxanalysis 2aWine 0aChina 0anonfloral grape varietals1 aXu, Yan1 aJiang, Wenguang1 aLi, Jiming0 tJournal of food science.g2010 , v. 75, no. 1 p.S81-S88dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2009.01436.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100824b20100903c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/03/08  aOther US 7aarticle03850naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170100001900179245011700198300001400315500002400329520190100353650001102254650002202265650002102287650001302308650001702321650001302338650002402351650001902375650001502394650002102409650001102430650002102441650001402462650001502476650002502491650002102516650001202537650007702549650002102626650003102647650007302678650003702751650001402788650000902802700001802811700001602829700001602845700001702861700001602878700001602894773013302910852000903043856009103052930003303143945002503176946001103201655001203212IND4431305020221122225553.0100115e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443130502DNAL7 a204440292pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2885.2009.1116.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8101 aREINBOLD, J.B.10aPlasma pharmacokinetics of oral chlortetracycline in group fed, ruminating, Holstein steers in a feedlot setting  ap. 76-83.  aIncludes references  aReinbold, J.

Plasma pharmacokinetics of oral chlortetracycline in group fed, ruminating, Holstein steers in a feedlot setting. J. vet. Pharmacol. Therap. 33, 76-83. Chlortetracycline HCl (CTC) has impacted profitable livestock production since 1945. However, pharmacokinetic parameters for CTC in ruminating cattle are unavailable in peer-reviewed literature. A total of 18 steers were randomized to 4.4, 11, or 22 mg/kg/day p.o. CTC treatment groups (n = 6). Chlortetracycline treatment was offered as one-half of the daily dose b.i.d. (160 total doses/group) for 80 days. Blood samples were collected at selected time points throughout an 83-day study and analyzed with a solid phase extraction technique and novel ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy/mass spectroscopy analytical method. Noncompartmental analysis (NCA) determined individual pharmacokinetic parameters by treatment group with coefficient of variation (CV %) estimates. A one-compartment open model with first order absorption and elimination, where absorption rate constant was equal to elimination rate constant, was fitted using nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NLMEM). NLMEM determined the primary pharmacokinetic parameters: volume of distribution (V/F, 40.9 L/kg) and rate constant (k, 0.0478 h⁻¹), and the secondary parameters: dose-normalized area under the curve (AUC/D, 0.29 h·μg/L), clearance (Cl/F, 1.8 L/kg/h), elimination half-life (t₁/₂, 16.2 h), Cmax/Dose (4.5 ng/mL), and time of Cmax (Tmax, 23.3 h) with improved CV estimates over NCA. Dose linearity was confirmed by anova of parameters derived from NCA by treatment group. Further studies are necessary for determining absolute bioavailability and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships of CTC in group fed, ruminating cattle. 3asteers 3achlortetracycline 3apharmacokinetics 3afeedlots 3ablood plasma 3aHolstein 3aoral administration 3ablood sampling 3arumination 3aveterinary drugs 3adosage 3anonlinear models 3ahalf life 3aabsorption 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aArea Under Curve 2aCattlexbloodxmetabolism. 2aChlortetracyclinexadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aHalf-Life 2aMale1 aCOETZEE, J.F.1 aGEHRING, R.1 aHAVEL, J.A.1 aHOLLIS, L.C.1 aOLSON, K.C.1 aAPLEY, M.D.0 tJournal of veterinary pharmacology and therapeutics.g2010 Feb., v. 33, no. 1 p.76-83dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2885.2009.1116.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110623b20110701c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/03/09  aNon-US 7aarticle03618naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100002100189245016100210300001400371500002400385520174700409650001202156650002602168650002602194650002802220650002102248650001102269650003702280650001402317650002002331650001702351650002502368650001202393650002102405650001102426650008202437650001402519650003002533650002802563650000902591650006602600650002602666650001202692653001802704700001502722773013302737852000902870856009202879930003302971945002503004946001103029655001203040IND4431304820221122225426.0100115e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443130482DNAL7 a204440272pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2885.2009.01110.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL8101 aABO-EL-SOOUD, K.10aInfluence of Pasteurella multocida infection on the pharmacokinetic behavior of marbofloxacin after intravenous and intramuscular administrations in rabbits  ap. 63-68.  aIncludes references  aAbo-El-Sooud, K., Goudah, A. Influence of Pasteurella multocida infection on the pharmacokinetic behavior of marbofloxacin after intravenous and intramuscular administrations in rabbits. J. vet. Pharmacol. Therap.33, 63-68. The pharmacokinetic behavior of marbofloxacin was studied in healthy (n = 12) and Pasteurella multocida infected rabbits (n = 12) after single intravenous (i.v.) and intramuscular (i.m.) administrations. Six rabbits in each group (control and diseased) were given a single dose of 2 mg/kg body weight (bw) of marbofloxacin intravenously. The other six rabbits in each group were given the same dose of the drug intramuscularly. The concentration of marbofloxacin in plasma was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. The plasma concentrations were higher in diseased rabbits than in healthy rabbits following both routes of injections. Following i.v. administration, the values of the elimination half-life (t₁/₂β), and area under the curve were significantly higher, whereas total body clearance was significantly lower in diseased rabbits. After i.m. administration, the elimination half-life (t₁/₂el), mean residence time, and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) were higher in diseased rabbits (5.33 h, 7.35 h and 2.24 μg/mL) than in healthy rabbits (4.33 h, 6.81 h and 1.81 μg/mL, respectively). Marbofloxacin was bound to the extent of 26 ± 1.3% and 23 ± 1.6% to plasma protein of healthy and diseased rabbits, respectively. The Cmax/MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) and AUC/MIC ratios were significantly higher in diseased rabbits (28 and 189 h) than in healthy rabbits (23 and 157 h), indicating the favorable pharmacodynamic characteristics of the drug in diseased rabbits. 3arabbits 3aPasteurella multocida 3aintravenous injection 3aintramuscular injection 3apharmacokinetics 3adosage 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3ahalf life 3ablood chemistry 3ablood plasma 3abacterial infections 2aAnimals 2aArea Under Curve 2aFemale 2aFluoroquinolonesxadministration & dosagexpharmacokineticsxtherapeutic use. 2aHalf-Life 2aInjections, Intramuscular 2aInjections, Intravenous 2aMale 2aPasteurella Infectionsxdrug therapyxmetabolismxveterinary. 2aPasteurella multocida 2aRabbits 0amarbofloxacin1 aGOUDAH, A.0 tJournal of veterinary pharmacology and therapeutics.g2010 Feb., v. 33, no. 1 p.63-68dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2885.2009.01110.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110623b20110701c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/03/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02191naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002200139245012200161300001800283520120300301650002601504650001801530653002901548653002301577700001401600700001301614773010301627852000901730856007901739930003301818945001301851946001301864655001201877IND2049810320221122225545.0960209e199412  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204981032DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00048a0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilvestre, M.P.C.10aAnalysis of protein hydrolysates. 2. Characterization of casein hydrolysates by a rapid peptide quantification method  ap. 2783-2789.  aCasein hydrolysates prepared in the laboratory or purchased from a manufacturer were characterized for the proportion of amino acids in free form, in short-chain (di- and tripeptides) or larger peptides. The hydrolysates were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography on a poly(2-hydroxyethylaspartamide)-silica column (PHEA), and the fractions were analyzed by amino acid analysis. This led to an accurate characterization of hydrolysates which allowed a classification of the hydrolysates according to the extent of hydrolysis and their nutritional quality. A rapid method for quantifying peptides in SE-HPLC fractions was also proposed. It was based on UV absorbance measurement at 230 nm, with a correction for the absorbance of aromatic amino acid measured at three wavelengths (230, 280, and 300 nm). A good correlation was obtained between corrected areas and the amino acid analysis. Because of nonideal size exclusion behavior on the PHEA column, further analysis of free amino acids would be required to correct the data obtained from the chromatographic patterns. The quantitative technique described here proved to be a valuable tool for characterizing unknown protein hydrolysates. 3aquantitative analysis 3arapid methods 0aultraviolet spectroscopy 0acasein hydrolysate1 aHamon, M.1 aYvon, M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1994 Dec., v. 42, no. 12 p.2783-2789x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00048a0253Available from publisher's Web site  a19960304b19960308c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01265naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006500127300001800192500002300210520042300233650001800656650001200674650001500686650001200701653002300713653001900736653001000755653002000765700001900785773008000804852000900884939003300893946001300926655001200939IND9301987320221122221504.0930406e199209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930198732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFasina, O.O.10aHygroscopic moisture absorption by alfalfa cubes and pellets  ap. 1615-1619.  aLiterature review.  aAlfalfa cubes and pellets were exposed to environmental conditions ranging from 70 to 90% relative humidity and 10 degrees to 40 degrees C.

Reflectance and transmittance spectra were collected from grated samples, and reflectance spectra were also collected from intact samples with a fiber optic probe. Calibrations were developed using partial least-squares (PLS) and multiple linear regression (MLR) techniques. For grated samples, PLS regression of first-derivative reflectance data yielded a calibration that gave the lowest standard error of prediction (SEP) for moisture (0.335%), while a PLS regression of log 1/R spectral data performed best for determining fat (SEP = 0.330%). Acceptable results for moisture were also obtained from a calibration based on MLR of first-derivative transmittance spectra (SEP = 0.356%), but determining fat by transmittance yielded high SEP values. Use of a fiber optic probe with intact cheese blocks gave less reliable results than were obtained from grated samples. 3awater content 3aCheddar cheese 3afood composition 3asampling 3adata analysis 3ainfrared spectroscopy 0asample processing 0afat1 aWehling, R.L.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1994 Dec., v. 42, no. 12 p.2830-2835x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00048a0333Available from publisher's Web site  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02175naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008500128300001800213500001500231520129100246650001701537650002201554650002501576650002601601651001201627653002401639653001501663700001801678700001801696773008001714852000901794939003301803946001301836655001201849IND9301988320221122004834.0930405e199209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930198832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetrell, R.J.10aMathematical simulation of a water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) towing system  ap. 1691-1698.  a2019-12-04  aA mathematical model representing a water hyacinth towing system of moderate size was formulated as a network of mechanical components. The system consisted of a rectangular device enclosing water hyacinth mats of various shapes and sizes and towing them by an applied input velocity. Three physical properties of a mat were found to be significant: viscous drag of plant rhizomes in water, viscous friction of leaves sliding over each other during compaction, and masses of the mat and accelerated water. Mass of the enclosure and a spring in the enclosure for measuring towing force also was incorporated in the model. Descriptions of the components and their interconnections were based on experimental observations and physical and hydromechanical fundamentals. Analyses of model behaviour were performed for towing velocity less than 0.4 m/s, the experimentally observed velocity at the onset of mat instability. Effects of different acceleration patterns, mat physical characteristics, and towing velocity on system behaviour were investigated in physical experiments and simulations with the model. The model and new information upon which it was based permit engineering design of different types of systems for harvesting water hyacinths in sewage treatment, canals, and lakes. 3aweed control 3asimulation models 3aEichhornia crassipes 3amechanical harvesting 3aFlorida 0amathematical models 0acompaction1 aSmerage, G.H.1 aBagnall, L.O.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1992 , v. 35, no. 5 p.1691-1698x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02407naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001500139245004600154300001800200520144800218650001101666650001401677650001901691650001901710650001901729650001501748650001201763653001701775700001501792773010301807852000901910856007901919930003301998945001302031946001302044655001202057IND2049804420221122004729.0960209e199412  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204980442DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00048a0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan, J.K.10aThermal aggregation of mixed fish myosins  ap. 2649-2655.  aCod and herring myosin solutions were mixed in five different ratios and heated to between 30 and 55 degrees C for 30 min. Extent of aggregation of the myosin solutions increased significantly (p < 0.05) with higher cod/herring myosin ratios at temperatures less than or equal to 40 degrees C. However, there was no significant difference (p < 0.05) in the extent of aggregation among the mixed and herring myosin samples above 45 degrees C. Two transition temperatures (Tm) were observed at 34 and 43 degrees C in cod myosin when the protein solution was heated from 25 to 56 degrees C at 1 degrees C/min, whereas herring myosin exhibited one Tm at 49 degrees C and the mixed myosin samples displayed an extra Tm at 39 degrees C which was absent in the pure cod or herring myosin samples. When a preheated herring myosin solution was mixed with unheated cod myosin in a ratio of one to one and the mixture was reheated at the same temperature, the extent of aggregation was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than the control heated at temperatures between 40 and 50 degrees C. Electrophoretic analysis revealed that more large myosin polymers were formed in the cod/preheated herring myosin samples than in the controls or in herring myosin alone, suggesting that preheated herring myosin and/or myosin aggregates interact with cod myosin, leading to the formation of larger mixed protein aggregates at temperatures between 40 and 50 degrees C. 3amyosin 3asolutions 3aheat treatment 3ahydrophobicity 3amuscle tissues 3acod (fish) 3aherring 0ainteractions1 aGill, T.A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1994 Dec., v. 42, no. 12 p.2649-2655x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00048a0013Available from publisher's Web site  a19960304b19960308c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02046naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001800139245006900157300001600226500001500242520098800257650002501245650001801270650002601288650002601314650001301340650001901353650003501372653001501407700001501422773010001437852000901537856007901546930003301625945001301658946001301671655001201684IND2049705820221122004756.0960201e199501  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204970582DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00049a0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomson, C.A.10aFluorescence polarization immunoassays for potato glycoalkaloids  ap. 254-260.  a2019-12-04  aFluorescence polarization immunoassays (FPIAs) were developed for potato glycoalkaloids (GAB) using a polyclonal antiserum and a monoclonal antibody (MAb). Fluorescently labeled solanidine (AMF-SOL) was synthesized by coupling 4'-(aminomethyl)fluorescein (4'-AMF) to the hemisuccinate derivative of solanidine using an active ester method. Both polyclonal antibody (PAL) and MAb could quantify the major potato GAs in the 20 - 100 nM range; however, the affinities of PAb and MAb differed slightly among the individual GAs. PAb displayed the greatest affinity for alpha-chaconine, while MAb was more sensitive to changes in alpha-solanine levels. Affinity constants (Kaff) of PAb and MAb for AMF-SOL were estimated at 4.2 X 10(8) and 4.7 10(7) M-1, respectively. Potato samples containing low, medium, and high levels of GAs were successfully analyzed by the PAb FPIA. Equilibrium in the FPIA reaction was reached within 1-2 min, and standard curves were stable for at least 14 days. 3achemical composition 3afood analysis 3apolyclonal antibodies 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apotatoes 3aglycoalkaloids 3afluorescent antibody technique 0aantibodies1 aSporns, P.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1995 Jan., v. 43, no. 1 p.254-260x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00049a0453Available from publisher's Web site  a19960304b19960308c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03796naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164100001600181245013800197300001600335500001500351520163300366650001601999650001602015650002002031650001902051650003102070650003102101650001802132650001802150650002102168650002202189650002102211650001802232650001202250650002102262650001802283650005202301650001702353650001502370650001902385650000902404650001202413650003902425650005102464650001102515650006602526650005302592650005702645650004702702653001902749653001402768653001702782700001502799700001502814700001502829700001802844773007302862852000902935856008502944930003303029945002503062946001103087655001203098IND4399736520221122004735.0080107e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439973652DNAL7 a179943232pmid7 a10.1080/030794507016393272doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMayne, R.K.10aFoot pad dermatitis in growing turkeys is associated with cytokine and cellular changes indicative of an inflammatory immune response  ap. 453-459.  a2019-12-04  aCell and cytokine responses during the development of foot pad dermatitis (FPD) in growing turkeys were studied in a model system. The objective was to evaluate the hypothesis that FPD is an allergic response to the environmental materials. Hybrid female turkeys at 28 days of age were exposed to wet litter for 48 h in a randomized block experiment. Expression levels of pro-inflammatory (interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and CXCLi2) and signature Th1 (interferon-gamma), Th2 (IL-13) and Treg (IL-10) cytokines were measured in the foot pad tissues using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Sections of foot pad tissue were stained for CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and macrophages using antibodies that specifically recognize the relevant cell types in the turkey. In the footpads of birds suffering from FPD, there were large fold increases in mRNA expression levels for the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta (+635), IL-6 (+65), and CXCLi2 (+1924), and interferon-gamma (+32), whereas there was only a small increase in IL-13 mRNA (+2) and no change in IL-10 mRNA expression levels. CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes were present in the footpads of more than 90% of birds housed on wet litter compared with 25% or less on dry litter. Macrophages were observed in the footpads of approximately 85% of birds housed on wet litter compared with none in birds housed on dry litter. B lymphocytes were not detected in tissue from any of the birds. The data suggest that FPD is associated with a rapidly occurring inflammatory response, rather than a Th2-mediated allergic reaction. 3ainterferons 3amacrophages 3agene expression 3ainterleukin-10 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aB-lymphocytes 3ainterleukin-1 3alitter (bedding) 3aprotein synthesis 3ahypersensitivity 3afoot diseases 3aturkeys 3apoultry diseases 3ainterleukin-6 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3ainflammation 3adermatitis 3adisease course 3afeet 2aAnimals 2aCytokinesximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aDermatitisxmetabolismxpathologyxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aFoot Diseasesximmunologyxmetabolismxpathologyxveterinary. 2aInflammationximmunologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aPoultry Diseasesximmunologyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aTurkeysxgrowth & developmentximmunology. 0ainterleukin-13 0acytokines 0ainterleukins1 aPowell, F.1 aElse, R.W.1 aKaiser, P.1 aHocking, P.M.0 tAvian pathology.g2007 Dec., v. 36, no. 6 p.453-459x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794507016393273Available from publisher's Web site  a20080415b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/03/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02372naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164100001500181245008500196300001600281520090700297650001601204650002101220650001401241650001801255650000901273650001601282650001901298650002501317650002101342650001901363650002101382650001201403650002001415650002901435650004401464650000901508650001801517653002001535700002001555700001801575700002501593773007301618852000901691856008501700930003301785945002501818946001101843655001201854IND4399738020221122004726.0080107e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439973802DNAL7 a179943302pmid7 a10.1080/030794507016972752doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aOwen, H.C.10aKeratoacanthoma causing beak deformity in a budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus)  ap. 499-502.  aThis report describes a keratoacanthoma causing abnormal maxillary beak growth in a 6-year-old male budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulates). Although the bird was still capable of eating, it had recently been demonstrating signs of respiratory distress and euthanasia was recommended. On histological examination, the neoplasm was dramatically effacing the normal structure of the maxilla and infiltrating into the rostral nasal sinuses. The tumour consisted of many cyst-like proliferations of well-differentiated squamous epithelial cells with central keratinization. Contiguity of the tumour cells with the stratum germinativum of the beak was noted in one microscopic field. This tumour type has not previously been reported in the avian beak; however, this case shows some similarities to subungual keratoacanthomas occurring in human patients and nailbed keratoacanthomas occurring in dogs and cats. 3abudgerigars 3aornamental birds 3aneoplasms 3abird diseases 3abeak 3ahypertrophy 3ahistopathology 3acell differentiation 3aepithelial cells 3akeratinization 3anew host records 2aAnimals 2aBeakxpathology 2aBird Diseasesxpathology 2aKeratoacanthomaxpathologyxveterinary. 2aMale 2aMelopsittacus 0akeratoacanthoma1 aDoneley, R.J.T.1 aSchmidt, R.E.1 aPatterson-Kane, J.C.0 tAvian pathology.g2007 Dec., v. 36, no. 6 p.499-502x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794507016972753Available from publisher's Web site  a20080415b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/03/31  aNon-US 7aarticle01614naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245008500133300001600218520075300234650001500987650001001002650001101012650001101023650001701034650002001051650001901071650001401090700001601104700001601120773007701136852000901213939003301222945000801255946001301263655001201276991607543060742620221122004812.0800528e197905  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800008542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStinson, E.E.10aWater-soluble products from patulin during alcoholic fermentation of apple juice  ap. 788-796.  aThe persistence of patulin following alcoholic fermentation of apple juice and the nature of other products that may arise from patulin were investigated. Uniformly labeled 14C-patulin added to the apple juice was converted largely to nonvolatile and water soluble materials during the course of fermentation. Little patulin was metabolized to CO2. Comparison of the thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) migration of the patulin products from fermentation with the products of the reaction of patulin with cysteine indicated that at least 58% of the added patulin was converted to substances other than adducts of cysteine, peptides and proteins. At least 6 TLC-mobile patulin products were observed in addition to a major TLC-immobile component (21%). 3amycotoxins 3afungi 3aapples 3ajuices 3afermentation 3afermented foods 3achromatography 3abioassays1 aOsman, S.F.1 aBills, D.D.0 tJournal of food science.g1979 , v. 44, no. 3 p.788-796x0021-11477nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19800528c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03455naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164100001700181245009900198300001600297500001500313520150400328650001301832650001901845650001701864650001801881650002201899650002501921650001001946650002101956650001501977650002901992650001902021650002102040650002002061650001602081650001902097650001202116650002102128650003202149650002502181650005702206650004502263650002402308650002602332650006702358650007802425650004202503653001702545700001702562700001402579773007302593852000902666856008502675930003302760945002502793946001102818655001202829IND4399736820221122004705.0080107e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439973682DNAL7 a179943262pmid7 a10.1080/030794507016420162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDhondt, K.V.10aEffects of route of inoculation on Mycoplasma gallisepticum infection in captive house finches  ap. 475-479.  a2019-12-04  aThe routes by which Mycoplasma gallisepticum initiates infection during outbreaks of conjunctivitis in house finches remain uncertain. As M. gallisepticum recovered from the cloaca of chickens remains viable for up to 3 days in chicken faeces, the possibility of spread via faecal contamination has been suggested. To test the hypothesis that food or water contaminated with M. gallisepticum may initiate infection, 20 house finches were experimentally inoculated by the oral or the conjunctival route. Clinical and immunological responses were compared. All inoculated birds seroconverted, thus demonstrating infection. Only two of the birds inoculated via the oral route developed very mild unilateral conjunctivitis while all 10 of those infected by eye-drop inoculation developed severe bilateral conjunctivitis. The orally inoculated birds had reduced levels of activity for only a few days, while those infected by conjunctival inoculation had reduced activity for several weeks. M. gallisepticum DNA was detected in conjunctival swabs by polymerase chain reaction in only three orally inoculated birds but in all birds in the conjunctivally inoculated group. Antibodies developed more slowly after oral inoculation than after conjunctival inoculation. We showed that oral exposure to M. gallisepticum can initiate infection, disease, and a serological response, which suggests that food or water contaminated with secretions or excretions may be a route of transmission between house finches. 3achickens 3aconjunctivitis 3aFringillidae 3amycoplasmosis 3adisease outbreaks 3adisease transmission 3afeces 3adietary exposure 3awild birds 3aMycoplasma gallisepticum 3aseroconversion 3adisease severity 3aimmune response 3aconjunctiva 3adisease course 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aBird Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aCloacaxmicrobiology 2aConjunctivitis, Bacterialxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aDNA, Bacterialxisolation & purification 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFinchesxmicrobiology 2aMycoplasma Infectionsxmicrobiologyxtransmissionxveterinary. 2aMycoplasma gallisepticumxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 0aeye diseases1 aDhondt, A.A.1 aLey, D.H.0 tAvian pathology.g2007 Dec., v. 36, no. 6 p.475-479x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794507016420163Available from publisher's Web site  a20080415b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/03/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02588naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001500198245009200213300001600305500001500321520093400336650002601270650001601296650002301312650001801335650003101353650002601384650001601410650001701426650001401443650001901457650001201476650001301488650001101501650001601512650007001528650006901598650003601667653002001703653005901723700001301782700001501795773007301810852000901883856008501892930003301977945002502010946001102035655001202046IND4399737720221122004918.0080107e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439973772DNAL7 a179943292pmid7 a10.1080/030794507016912782doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Gallinarum) is the causative agent of fowl typhoid, a severe systemic disease of chickens that results in high mortality. In this study we re-evaluated the ability of live S. Gallinarum 9R vaccine to protect from wild-type S. Gallinarum challenge. In laboratory trials, there was a significant difference between the vaccinated and unvaccinated control groups in mortality and the reisolation rate of the challenge strain from the tissues (P<0.05). In field trials, efficacy of the 9R vaccine by one inoculation at the age of 18 weeks and two inoculations at the age of 6 weeks and 18 weeks was persistent throughout the duration of the study from 21 weeks old to 61 weeks old. The results from this study indicate that the protection against mortality and organ invasion in highly susceptible chickens exposed to virulent strains of S. Gallinarum may be severely limited by 9R vaccine. 3aSalmonella Gallinarum 3alaying hens 3adisease prevention 3alive vaccines 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3afield experimentation 3avaccination 3afowl typhoid 3amortality 3adisease course 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aFemale 2aOviposition 2aPoultry Diseasesximmunologyxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 2aSalmonella Infections, Animalximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aSalmonella Vaccinesximmunology 0adisease control 0aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Gallinarum1 aMo, I.P.1 aKang, M.S.0 tAvian pathology.g2007 Dec., v. 36, no. 6 p.495-498x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794507016912783Available from publisher's Web site  a20080415b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/03/31  aNon-US 7aarticle03019naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001600180245004800196300001800244520165800262650001301920650002501933650002701958650003001985650002702015650002502042650002602067650001802093650002302111650001202134650003802146650002402184650002302208650001102231650006102242650006702303650001302370773008602383852000902469930003302478945002502511946001302536655001202549IND4372672220221121223750.0050725e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437267222DNAL7 a160134012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSmith, J.L.10aColonic spirochetosis in animals and humans  ap. 1525-1534.  aColonic spirochetosis is a disease caused by the gram-negative bacteria Brachyspira aalborgi and Brachyspira pilosicoli. B. pilosicoli induces disease in both humans and animals, whereas B. aalborgi affects only humans and higher primates. Symptoms in humans include diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and abdominal cramps. Colonic spirochetosis is common in third world countries; however, in developed countries, the disease is observed mainly in homosexual males. Terminally ill patients infected with Brachyspira are particularly at risk for developing spirochetemia. Diarrhea, poor growth performance, and decreased feed-to-gain efficiency is seen in pigs with colonic spirochetosis. The disease in chickens is characterized by delayed and/or reduced egg production, diarrhea, poor feed conversion, and retarded growth. Thus, colonic spirochetosis can represent a serious economic loss in the swine and poultry industries. The organisms are transmitted by the fecal-oral route, and several studies have demonstrated that human, primate, pig, dog, or bird strains of B. pilosicoli can be transmitted to pigs, chickens, and mice. B. pilosicoli may be a zoonotic pathogen, and although it has not been demonstrated, there is a possibility that both B. pilosicoli and B. aalborgi can be transferred to humans via contact with the feces of infected animals, meat from infected animals, or food contaminated by food handlers. Neither B. pilosicoli nor B. aalborgi has been well characterized in terms of basic cellular functions, pathogenicity, or genetics. Studies are needed to more thoroughly understand these Brachyspira species and their disease mechanisms. 3azoonoses 3aBrachyspira aalborgi 3aBrachyspira pilosicoli 3adigestive system diseases 3ahuman-animal relations 3adisease transmission 3amolecular systematics 3apathogenicity 3amicrobial genetics 2aAnimals 2aBrachyspiraxgrowth & development 2aColonxmicrobiology 2aFood Contamination 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Diseasesxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 2aSpirochaetales Infectionsxprevention & controlxtransmission. 2aZoonoses0 tJournal of food protection.g2005 July, v. 68, no. 7 p.1525-1534x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20060802b20060906c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/08/08  aOther US 7aarticle03578naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001800180245013100198300001800329500001500347520166200362650002602024650001902050650001202069650002202081650001902103650002502122650002302147650002302170650002302193650000902216650001502225650002602240650001902266650001902285650002102304650002302325650001102348650002302359650002102382650004002403650005802443650002102501650002702522650003102549650001602580650001602596650001702612650007102629653002502700700001802725700001902743773008602762852000902848930003302857945002502890946001302915655001202928IND4372672020221121223741.0050725e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437267202DNAL7 a160134002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHawkins, L.K.10aEffect of different postharvest drying temperatures on Aspergillus flavus survival and aflatoxin content in five maize hybrids  ap. 1521-1524.  a2019-12-05  aAfter harvest, maize is dried artificially to halt fungal growth and mycotoxin production while in postharvest storage. The process often limits harvest capacity and has been a frequent cause of seed injury. Higher drying temperatures could lead to shorter drying periods and faster turnover; however, there is often a deterioration of the physical grain quality, including increased breakage susceptibility and loss of viability. The goals of this study were to determine the effect of different postharvest drying temperatures on Aspergillus flavus and Fusarium verticillioides survival and aflatoxin content in maize and to determine the viability of the seed. Five corn hybrids varying in resistance to A. flavus were side needle-inoculated with A. flavus, harvested at physiological maturity, and dried at temperatures ranging from 40 to 70 degrees C. Kernels were evaluated for aflatoxin, stress cracks, germination, and kernel infection by A. flavus and a natural infestation of F. verticillioides. Drying temperature had no effects on aflatoxin concentration given the heat stability of the toxin. With increased temperatures from 40 to 70 degrees C, germination decreased significantly, from 96 to 27%, and stress cracks increased significantly (1.4 up to 18.7). At temperatures above 60 degrees C, F. verticillioides kernel infection was significantly reduced to less than 18%. At 70 degrees C, there was a significant reduction in A. flavus kernel infection, from 11 to 3%. This information is useful in determining a range of temperatures that can be used for drying seed when fungal infection, stress cracks, and seed viability are of interest. 3apostharvest treatment 3aplant breeding 3ahybrids 3atoxigenic strains 3aheat tolerance 3apostharvest diseases 3afood contamination 3adrying temperature 3aFusarium fujikuroi 3acorn 3aaflatoxins 3asecondary metabolites 3adrying quality 3afood pathogens 3amicrobial growth 3adisease resistance 3adrying 3aAspergillus flavus 3astress tolerance 2aAflatoxinsxanalysisxbiosynthesis. 2aAspergillus flavusxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Preservationxmethods 2aGermination 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 2aZea maysxchemistryxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 0aGibberella fujikuroi1 aWindham, G.L.1 aWilliams, W.P.0 tJournal of food protection.g2005 July, v. 68, no. 7 p.1521-1524x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20060802b20060906c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/08/08  aOther US 7aarticle03793naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100001800186245008900204300001800293500002400311500001500335506007600350520178900426506003702215650002502252650002102277650001202298650001302310650001202323650002402335650001202359650001602371650002002387650001102407650002302418650002102441650001402462650001502476650001202491653001502503700002202518700002802540700001702568700002102585700002302606700002202629700002102651700002102672700002002693700002102713700002302734700001802757700002402775700002102799700001502820700001902835700002102854700001902875700002102894700002402915773008702939852000903026856004803035655001203083IND4412968220221207131332.0081121e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441296822DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-008-9198-02doi7 aPMC29509392pmcid7 a209360992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBahn, Michael10aSoil Respiration in European Grasslands in Relation to Climate and Assimilate Supply  ap. 1352-1367.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSoil respiration constitutes the second largest flux of carbon (C) between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. This study provides a synthesis of soil respiration (R s) in 20 European grasslands across a climatic transect, including ten meadows, eight pastures and two unmanaged grasslands. Maximum rates of R s ( [graphic removed] ), R s at a reference soil temperature (10°C; [graphic removed] ) and annual R s (estimated for 13 sites) ranged from 1.9 to 15.9 μmol CO₂ m⁻² s⁻¹, 0.3 to 5.5 μmol CO₂ m⁻² s⁻¹ and 58 to 1988 g C m⁻² y⁻¹, respectively. Values obtained for Central European mountain meadows are amongst the highest so far reported for any type of ecosystem. Across all sites [graphic removed] was closely related to [graphic removed] . Assimilate supply affected R s at timescales from daily (but not necessarily diurnal) to annual. Reductions of assimilate supply by removal of aboveground biomass through grazing and cutting resulted in a rapid and a significant decrease of R s. Temperature-independent seasonal fluctuations of R s of an intensively managed pasture were closely related to changes in leaf area index (LAI). Across sites [graphic removed] increased with mean annual soil temperature (MAT), LAI and gross primary productivity (GPP), indicating that assimilate supply overrides potential acclimation to prevailing temperatures. Also annual R s was closely related to LAI and GPP. Because the latter two parameters were coupled to MAT, temperature was a suitable surrogate for deriving estimates of annual R s across the grasslands studied. These findings contribute to our understanding of regional patterns of soil C fluxes and highlight the importance of assimilate supply for soil CO₂ emissions at various timescales.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aprimary productivity 3asoil temperature 3ameadows 3apastures 3agrazing 3aaboveground biomass 3acutting 3aacclimation 3aleaf area index 3acarbon 3aseasonal variation 3asoil respiration 3aemissions 3aecosystems 3aclimate 0aatmosphere1 aRodeghiero, Mirco1 aAnderson-Dunn, Margaret1 aDore, Sabina1 aGimeno, Cristina1 aDrösler, Matthias1 aWilliams, Michael1 aAmmann, Christof1 aBerninger, Frank1 aFlechard, Chris1 aJones, Stephanie1 aBalzarolo, Manuela1 aKumar, Suresh1 aNewesely, Christian1 aPriwitzer, Tibor1 aRaschi, A.1 aSiegwolf, Rolf1 aSusiluoto, Sanna1 aTenhunen, John1 aWohlfahrt, Georg1 aCernusca, Alexander0 tEcosystems.g2008 Dec., v. 11, no. 8 p.1352-1367dSpringer-Verlagx1432-98407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-008-9198-0 7aarticle02914naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163072001700180100001800197245012500215300001800340500001500358520131000373650001501683650002301698650002801721650001601749650000901765650002401774650000901798650001401807650001701821650002101838650001201859650000901871650007101880650003701951650003301988650003302021650002302054650003202077650002402109653001602133700002402149700002102173773008602194852000902280930003302289945002502322946001302347655001202360IND4372671620221121223822.0050725e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437267162DNAL7 a160133972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Petrifilm has its problems, however; some microorganisms can liquefy the Petrifilm gel and others do not produce the necessary color change with the indicator dye used. Petrifilm aerobic count plates were compared with the pour plates for determining the incidence and identification of problematic organisms in 329 meat and dairy products. Petrifilm plates produced higher mean counts with better repeatability than did pour plates. There was also close correlation between methods with coefficients of 0.97 to 1.0. Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, and a group D Streptococcus liquefied Petrifilm gels in 17.4% of the samples tested: dairy products accounted for 16.0%, and meats accounted for the remaining 1.4%. Liquefaction hindered enumeration in 3.2% of the Petrifilm plates used. Streptococcus viridans was not detectable on Petrifilm plates after the recommend incubation period, and this organism occurred in 0.3% of the Petrifilm plates used. These results indicate that Petrifilm plates would be unsuitable for samples with large numbers of these organisms. Knowledge of the contaminating flora may be an asset when utilizing Petrifilm aerobic count plates for the enumeration of microbes in food. 3adried milk 3aaerobic conditions 3amicrobial contamination 3aplate count 3abeef 3amicrobial detection 3afish 3aice cream 3apoultry meat 3apasteurized milk 3aaerobes 2aAgar 2aBacteria, Aerobicxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aColony Count, Microbialxmethods 2aDairy Productsxmicrobiology 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aMeatxmicrobiology 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSpecies Specificity 0amethodology1 aHollingsworth, J.B.1 aHamilton, M.A.E.0 tJournal of food protection.g2005 July, v. 68, no. 7 p.1506-1511x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20060802b20060906c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/08/07  aOther US 7aarticle03730naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245018300186300001600369500002400385500001500409520168500424650000902109650001402118650002202132650002102154650001002175650001402185650002002199650001902219650002202238650001802260650001002278650002302288650001102311650001002322650001102332650001802343650002402361650003802385650002802423650003502451650002902486650002902515650004202544650002802586650003902614650003302653650004002686650002002726650002702746650002302773653001002796653001202806700002102818700002502839700002302864700003002887773008202917852000902999856004803008655001203056IND4386091420221122002831.0061217e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438609142DNAL7 a168455272pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-006-0347-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvrard, Alexandre14aThe promoter of the wheat puroindoline-a gene (PinA) exhibits a more complex pattern of activity than that of the PinB gene and is induced by wounding and pathogen attack in rice  ap. 287-300.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPuroindolines form the molecular basis of wheat grain hardness. However, little is known about puroindoline gene regulation. We previously reported that the Triticum aestivum puroindoline-b gene (PinB) promoter directs β-glucuronidase gene (uidA) seed-specific expression in transgenic rice. In this study, we isolated a puroindoline-a gene (PinA), analyzed PinA promoter activity by 5' deletions and compared PinA and PinB promoters in transgenic rice. Seeds of PinA-1214 and PinB-1063 transgenic plants strongly expressed uidA in endosperm, in the aleurone layer and in epidermis cells in a developmentally regulated manner. The GUS activity was also observed in PinA-1214 embryos. Whereas the PinB promoter is seed specific, the PinA promoter also directed, but to a lower level, uidA expression in roots of seedlings and in the vascular tissues of palea and pollen grains of dehiscent anthers during flower development. In addition, the PinA promoter was induced by wounding and by Magnaporthe grisea. By deletion analysis, we showed that the “390-bp” PinA promoter drives the same expression pattern as the “1214-bp” promoter. Moreover, the “214-bp” PinA promoter drives uidA expression solely in pollen grains of dehiscent anthers. The presence of putative cis-regulatory elements that may be related to PinA expression is discussed from an evolutionary point of view. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we showed that putative cis-elements (WUN-box, TCA motifs and as-1-like binding sites) whose presence in the PinA promoter may be related to wounding and/or the pathogen response form complexes with nuclear extracts isolated from wounded wheat leaves. 3arice 3aflowering 3atransgenic plants 3avascular tissues 3awheat 3apathogens 3agene expression 3aaleurone layer 3aTriticum aestivum 3abinding sites 3agenes 3aMagnaporthe grisea 3apollen 3aroots 3aleaves 2aBase Sequence 2aFlowersxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOryzaxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Diseasesxgenetics 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxmetabolism 2aPlant Stemsxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aProtein Binding 2aSeedlingsxmetabolism. 2aTriticumxgenetics 0aseeds 0aanthers1 aMeynard, Donaldo1 aGuiderdoni, Emmanuel1 aJoudrier, Philippe1 aGautier, Marie-Françoise0 tPlanta.g2007 Jan., v. 225, no. 2 p.287-300dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-006-0347-4 7aarticle02716naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100002000155245013900175300001600314500002400330520094900354650001401303650001801317650002301335650001101358650002201369650002501391650002901416650002601445650001101471650002301482650002101505650002501526650004101551650002801592650004301620650004801663650003701711650003501748650005301783650005301836650006101889700002301950700002101973700003401994700002302028773008702051852000902138856003902147655001202186IND4420349920221122002551.0090508e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442034992DNAL7 a193505332pmid7 a10.1002/yea.16682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuz, Juliana S.10aSdo1p, the yeast orthologue of Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome protein, binds RNA and interacts with nuclear rRNA-processing factors  ap. 287-298.  aIncludes references  aThe Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome protein (SBDS) is a member of a highly conserved protein family of not well understood function, with putative orthologues found in different organisms ranging from Archaea, yeast and plants to vertebrate animals. The yeast orthologue of SBDS, Sdo1p, has been previously identified in association with the 60S ribosomal subunit and is proposed to participate in ribosomal recycling. Here we show that Sdo1p interacts with nucleolar rRNA processing factors and ribosomal proteins, indicating that it might bind the pre-60S complex and remain associated with it during processing and transport to the cytoplasm. Corroborating the protein interaction data, Sdo1p localizes to the nucleus and cytoplasm and co-immunoprecipitates precursors of 60S and 40S subunits, as well as the mature rRNAs. Sdo1p binds RNA directly, suggesting that it may associate with the ribosomal subunits also through RNA interaction. 3acytoplasm 3aribosomal RNA 3aribosomal proteins 3ayeasts 2aAmino Acid Motifs 2aBiological Transport 2aCell Nucleusxmetabolism 2aCytoplasmxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aModels, Biological 2aMolecular Weight 2aProteinsxmetabolism 2aRNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional 2aRNA, Fungalxmetabolism 2aRNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aRNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aRibosomal Proteinsxmetabolism 2aRibosome Subunits, Large, Eukaryoticxmetabolism 2aRibosome Subunits, Small, Eukaryoticxmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aGeorg, Raphaela C.1 aGomes, Carlos H.1 aMachado-Santelli, Gláucia M.1 aOliveira, Carla C.0 tYeast.g2009 May, v. 26, no. 5 p.287-298dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0749-503X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/yea.1668 7aarticle03136naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245014600185300001600331500004500347520163800392650002102030650001102051650002202062650003202084650002002116650001702136650001902153650002202172650001002194650001202204650002902216650001802245650002602263650003102289650003102320653002802351653003402379700001602413773007402429852000902503856008502512930003302597945001302630946001102643655001202654IND2054432620221121202405.0961211e199609  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205443262DNAL7 a186458742pmid7 a10.1080/030794596084191572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhinakar Raj, G.10aImmunopathogenesis of infection in SPF chicks and commercial broiler chickens of a variant infectious bronchitis virus of economic importance  ap. 481-501.  aSummaries in French, German, and Spanish  aThe immunopathogenesis of an economically important variant of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has been studied in day-old specific pathogen-free and 6-week-old broiler chickens. Experimental infection caused very mild respiratory disease and no mortalities. Diarrhoea was seen in the broilers. Virus distribution and titre in respiratory, urinary and enteric tissues were assessed. In SPF chicks, maximum virus isolations were from oesophagus, followed by trachea, kidney, lung and rectum. In contrast, in the broilers, maximum isolations were from ileum, followed by caecal tonsils, rectum, bursa of Fabricius and harderian gland, but virus was recovered less frequency from trachea, lung and kidney. In both groups virus replication was demonstrated in the epithelium of the trachea, kidneys and tissues of the lower gut by immunofluorescence. Immunostaining for CD4 and CD8 T-cell subsets in trachea, lung and kidney showed earlier and increased recruitment of CD8 cells over CD4 cells. From the kidneys of SPF chicks, no virus was isolated on days 10 or 14 p.i., but was recovered to high titre on day 21. Immunostaining showed the presence of IgM deposits in the glomeruli on those days when virus could not be recovered. In the broilers, gross muscle changes were produced which were less severe than reported in the field and without histopathological changes or increased creatine kinase levels in serum. There was no evidence of virus-induced immunosuppression. The spread of infection and rate of seroconversion to this IBV were similar to other IBV strains. The possible pathogenesis of the muscle changes is discussed. 3abroiler chickens 3achicks 3agerm-free animals 3aInfectious bronchitis virus 3aimmunopathology 3apathogenesis 3aanimal tissues 3avirus replication 3alungs 3akidneys 3alymphocyte proliferation 3aB-lymphocytes 3atrachea (vertebrates) 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 0aviral immunosuppression 0aspecific pathogen-free chicks1 aJones, R.C.0 tAvian pathology.g1996 Sept., v. 25, no. 3 p.481-501x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794596084191573Available from publisher's Web site  a19970106b19970110c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle03277naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163072001700180100001900197245010400216300001800320500001500338520134800353650001001701650001401711650002201725650001801747650002201765650001901787650002301806650002301829650001901852650003801871650001901909650001601928650001401944650001601958650001401974650005301988650002002041650004402061650004702105650001802152650003302170650002902203650004902232650003202281650005302313653001202366700001702378700001602395700002102411700001502432773010002447852000902547930003302556945002502589946001302614655001202627IND4372066520221121202404.0050707e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437206652DNAL7 a159547232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGarber, E.A.E.10aFeasibility of immunodiagnostic devices for the detection of ricin, amanitin, and T-2 toxin in food  ap. 1294-1301.  a2019-12-05  aQualitative and quantitative comparisons were conducted of commercially available immunodiagnostic devices for the detection of three select agents with oral LD50 values greater than or equal to 0.1 mg/kg of body weight. Ricin (oral LD50 > 1 mg/kg), amanitin (oral LD50 approximately 0.1 mg/kg), and T-2 toxin (oral LD50 > 1 mg/kg) were spiked into beverages, produce, dairy, and baked goods and assayed using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and lateral flow devices. In all cases, the commercial diagnostic kits successfully detected all three select agents at concentrations below what might be a health concern. The considerable difference between the limit of detection of the immunodiagnostic devices employed (typically less than or equal to 0.020 microgram/g) and the amount of the select agent necessary to pose a health threat in a single serving of food facilitated the design of protocols for the high throughput screening of food samples. These protocols entailed simple extraction methods followed by sample dilution. Lateral flow devices and sandwich ELISAs for the detection of ricin had no significant background problems due to the food matrices. Competitive ELISAs, which typically have unacceptably high background reactions with food samples, successfully detected amanitin and T-2 toxin. 3aricin 3aT-2 toxin 3anatural toxicants 3aserodiagnosis 3atoxigenic strains 3adairy products 3afood contamination 3amushroom poisoning 3aalpha-amanitin 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afood pathogens 3abaked goods 3adetection 3aphycotoxins 3abeverages 2aAmanitinsximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aCross Reactions 2aDose-Response Relationship, Immunologic 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxmethods 2aFood Analysis 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aReagent Kits, Diagnostic 2aRicinximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aT-2 Toxinximmunologyxisolation & purification. 0aproduce1 aEppley, R.M.1 aStack, M.E.1 aMcLaughlin, M.A.1 aPark, D.L.0 tJournal of food protection.g2005 June, v. 68, no. 6 p.1294-1301wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20051104b20051202c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/07/15  aOther US 7aarticle02909naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245012500181300001600306500004500322500001500367520155000382650002101932650001301953650002501966650002401991650002902015650001502044650002602059650003102085650001502116650001102131650003102142653001302173653001202186700001502198700001302213773007402226852000902300856008502309930003302394945001302427946001102440655001202451IND2054432920221121202401.0961211e199609  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205443292DNAL7 a186458752pmid7 a10.1080/030794596084191582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukamoto, M.10aChicken thymocyte antigen which participates in cell proliferations of thymocytes and tumour-derived lymphoid cell lines  ap. 503-517.  aSummaries in French, German, and Spanish  a2019-12-04  aA novel antigen on chicken thymocytes was defined by CETHB1 and CETH46 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that were prepared against chick embryonic thymocytes. CETHB1 and CETH46 mAbs recognized different epitopes on the same membrane antigen (molecular weight: 76.2 kDa). These mAbs reacted with > 80% of thymocytes of 14-day-old embryos to 8-week-old chickens. Almost all splenocytes, peripheral blood lymphocytes and bursa cells were negative, and only 7.7% of bone marrow cells were positive for both antibodies. In two-colour analysis with mAbs reacting to T cell markers (CD4 or CD8), most CETHB1 positive cells were CD4-CD8- or CD4+CD8+. However, a proportion of CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+ cells were negative for CETHB1 mAb. The proportion of thymocytes reacting with CETHB1 in chickens immunosuppressed by cyclophosphamide treatment increased gradually in parallel with the restoration of the thymus. An increase of CETHB1-positive cells was observed in thymocytes stimulated with Con A. Hence, it seems that the CETHB1 antigen expression on thymocytes is influenced by the thymic micro-environment and that the antigen may take part in thymic differentiation. Interestingly, CETHB1 antigen was expressed not only on T cell tumour-derived lymphoid cell lines, but also B-lymphoma-derived cell lines. The antigen expressions on these cell lines were observed only in the proliferative phase of the cells. Hence, the molecule which reacted with CETHB1 may be an antigen commonly expressed on lymphoma cells and may be involved in cell proliferation. 3abroiler chickens 3aepitopes 3acell differentiation 3alymphocyte antigens 3alymphocyte proliferation 3athymocytes 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3acell lines 3achicks 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 0achickens 0amarkers1 aKodama, H.1 aBaba, T.0 tAvian pathology.g1996 Sept., v. 25, no. 3 p.503-517x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794596084191583Available from publisher's Web site  a19970106b19970110c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02104naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245014800182300001400330500004500344520089700389650001701286650002301303650001401326650001501340651002501355653001101380653002701391700001701418700001701435700001401452700001801466773007101484852000901555856008501564930003301649945001301682946001101695655001201706IND2051694720221121165149.0960614e199603  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205169472DNAL7 a186458362pmid7 a10.1080/030794596084191192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHowlett, J.C.10aHaemoproteus in the houbara (Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii) and the rufous-crested bustard (Eupodotis ruficrista) in the United Arab Emirates  ap. 49-55.  aSummaries in French, German, and Spanish  aA routine microscopic examination of blood smears from 52 houbara bustards (Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii) recently imported into the United Arab Emirates revealed that 32 (61.5%) birds were infected with Haemoproteus tendeiroi and H. telfordi. Haemoproteus tendeiroi was found alone in most of the infected birds, whereas a combination of H. telfordi and H. tendeiroi was found together in two birds, and only one bird was infected with H. telfordi alone. In eight recently imported rufous-crested bustards (Eupodotis ruficrista), 50% were found to be infected with haemoparasites. Four birds were infected with H. telfordi and one of these was also infected with H. tendeiroi. The schizonts for the two Haemoproteus species described in this study may have had predilection for skeletal muscle as these were not detected in several other tissue samples examined from known infected birds. 3aHaemoproteus 3adisease prevalence 3aincidence 3awild birds 3aUnited Arab Emirates 0aotidae 0ahaemoproteus tendeiroi1 aSamour, J.H.1 aBailey, T.A.1 aNaldo, J.1 aD'Aloia, M.A.0 tAvian pathology.g1996 Mar., v. 25, no. 1 p.49-55x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794596084191193Available from publisher's Web site  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02956naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100002700180245011700207300001800324520112400342650001401466650002801480650001801508650002301526650002801549650002201577650001601599650001901615650002301634650002701657650002601684650002901710650003001739650001201769650002801781650003701809650001901846650003401865650002201899650003101921650003101952650002301983650003002006650006502036700001802101700002502119700001802144700002602162773008602188852000902274930003302283945002502316946001302341655001202354IND4372065320221121165132.0050707e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437206532DNAL7 a159547142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The initial concentration of microorganisms ranged from 10(5) to 10(6) CFU/ml. Addition of acetic acid and propionic acid to skim milk inactivated 0.24 and 0.48 log CFU/ml P. fluorescens, respectively. Sets of 10, 20, and 30 pulses were applied to the skim milk using exponentially decaying pulses with pulse lengths of 2 microsecond and pulse frequencies of 3 Hz. Treatment temperature was maintained between 16 and 20 degrees C. In the absence of organic acids, PEF treatment of skim milk at field intensities of 31 and 38 kV/cm reduced P. fluorescens populations by 1.0 to 1.8 and by 1.2 to 1.9 log CFU/ml, respectively. Additions of acetic and propionic acid to the skim milk in a pH range of 5.0 to 5.3 and PEF treatment at 31, 33, and 34 kV/cm, and 36, 37, and 38 kV/cm reduced the population of P. fluorescens by 1.4 and 1.8 log CFU/ml, respectively.

The importance of developing a rigorous sampling design tailored to specific questions has already been discussed in the ecological and sampling literature and has provided useful tools and recommendations to sample and analyse ecological data. However, sampling issues are often difficult to overcome in ecological studies due to apparent inconsistencies between theory and practice, often leading to the implementation of simplified sampling designs that suffer from unknown biases. Moreover, we believe that classical sampling principles which are based on estimation of means and variances are insufficient to fully address many ecological questions that rely on estimating relationships between a response and a set of predictor variables over time and space. Our objective is thus to highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate sampling space and an appropriate sampling design. We also emphasize the importance of using prior knowledge of the study system to estimate models or complex parameters and thus better understand ecological patterns and processes generating these patterns. Using a semi‐virtual simulation study as an illustration we reveal how the selection of the space (e.g. geographic, climatic), in which the sampling is designed, influences the patterns that can be ultimately detected. We also demonstrate the inefficiency of common sampling designs to reveal response curves between ecological variables and climatic gradients. Further, we show that response‐surface methodology, which has rarely been used in ecology, is much more efficient than more traditional methods. Finally, we discuss the use of prior knowledge, simulation studies and model‐based designs in defining appropriate sampling designs. We conclude by a call for development of methods to unbiasedly estimate nonlinear ecologically relevant parameters, in order to make inferences while fulfilling requirements of both sampling theory and field work logistics. 3aecology 3aevolution 3aexperimental design 3amodels 3avariance1 aYoccoz, Nigel G.1 aEdwards, Thomas C.

The microflora composition of spring mix or mesclun, a mixture of multiple salad ingredients, grown either by organic or conventional means was determined. Unwashed or washed spring mix was obtained from a commercial California fresh-cut produce processor who does not use manure in their cultivation practices. Fifty-four samples of each type of product were supplied over a 4-month period. Analysis included enumeration of total mesophiles, psychrotrophs, coliforms, generic Escherichia coli, lactic acid bacteria, yeasts, and molds. In addition, spring mix was analyzed for the presence of Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes. The mean populations of mesophilic and psychrotrophic bacteria, yeasts, molds, lactic acid bacteria, and coliforms on conventionally grown spring mix were not statistically different (P > 0.05) from respective mean populations on organically grown spring mix. The mean population of each microbial group was significantly higher on unwashed spring mix compared with the washed product. Of the 14 samples found to contain E. coli, eight were from nonwashed conventional spring mix, one was from washed conventional spring mix, and four were from nonwashed organic spring mix. Salmonella and L. monocytogenes were not detected in any of the samples analyzed. 3acoliform bacteria 3asalads 3apsychrotrophic bacteria 3alactic acid bacteria 3avegetable crops 3ayeasts 3afood contamination 3aplate count 3amicrobial ecology 3amolds (fungi) 3afood pathogens 3aplant cultural practices 3amicrobial detection 3amicrobial contamination 3afresh-cut foods 3aorganic production 3aon-farm food safety 3aaerobes 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aBacteriaxisolation & purification 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aEscherichia colixisolation & purification 2aFood Analysis 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Microbiology 2aFungixisolation & purification 2aHealth Foodxmicrobiologyxstandards 2aLettucexmicrobiology 2aYeastsxisolation & purification 3aCalifornia 0amicroorganisms 0aproduce1 aHarrison, M.A.0 tJournal of food protection.g2005 June, v. 68, no. 6 p.1143-1146x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20051104b20051202c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/07/15  aOther US 7aarticle03036naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245008500181300001600266500004500282520196100327650002202288650001802310650001702328650001602345650002002361650001302381650001502394653001302409653001602422773007302438852000902511856008502520930003302605945001302638946001102651655001202662IND2050099120221121070252.0960229e199512  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205009912DNAL7 a186458232pmid7 a10.1080/030794595084191062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWitter, R.L.10aAttenuation of lymphoid leukosis enhancement by serotype 2 Marek's disease virus  ap. 665-678.  aSummaries in French, German, and Spanish  aSerotype 2 Marek's disease virus (MDV), already known to augment the protective efficacy of turkey herpes virus (HVT) vaccine against MD, may also enhance the frequency of lymphoid leukosis (LL) in retrovirus-infected chickens of certain strains. LL enhancement refers to an increase in frequency and decrease in latent period for development of LL, and is measured by comparison of tumour responses in retrovirus-infected, MD-vaccinated chickens to those of retrovirus-infected control chickens. LL enhancement has been documented with both of the serotype 2 MDV strains tested thus far. These experiments were conducted to investigate whether LL enhancement ability varied within a larger collection of serotype 2 strains or was influenced by serial passage in cell culture. Each of seven low-passage serotype 2 MDV strains enhanced LL responses. The HN-1 strain was competent for LL enhancement at passage 19, but LL enhancement ability was absent at passages 26, 27 and 40. Enhancement of LL by strains 471B/1, 281MI/1, 287C/1 and 298B/1 was reduced by 40 to 64 serial passages in chicken embryo fibroblast cultures. Strains SB-1 and 301B/1 continued to demonstrate enhancement of LL through 66 and 40 passages, respectively. Thus, LL enhancement appeared to be a general property of serotype 2 MDV, but was susceptible in five of seven strains to reduction (attenuation) by cell culture passage. Enhancement of LL by serotype 2 MDV was attenuated more rapidly by cell culture passage than was the ability of such viruses to protect against virulent MDV challenge either alone or in combination with HVT. One such LL enhancement-attenuated strain, 471B/1 (passages 33 and 40), when combined with HVT, induced protection against MD challenge (76 and 78%) that was comparable with that induced by SB-1 + HVT (82%) or 301B/1+ HVT (89%). This or similar serotype 2 viruses could provide suitable protection against MD with a reduced risk of LL enhancement. 3agenetic variation 3apathogenicity 3acell culture 3avaccination 3aadverse effects 3achickens 3aMardivirus 0aleukosis 0aattenuation0 tAvian pathology.g1995 Dec., v. 24, no. 4 p.665-678x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794595084191063Available from publisher's Web site  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02119naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245007300181300001600254500004500270520096900315650001301284650001001297650002001307650001301327653001901340653002501359653002001384700001801404700001501422700001501437700001501452700001801467773007301485852000901558856008501567930003301652945001301685946001101698655001201709IND2050099020221121054422.0960229e199512  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205009902DNAL7 a186458222pmid7 a10.1080/030794595084191052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGavora, J.S.10aEndogenous viral genes influence infection with avian leukosis virus  ap. 653-664.  aSummaries in French, German, and Spanish  aThe influence of endogenous viral (ev) genes on avian leukosis virus (ALV) infection was studied in ALV-free white leghorn chickens exposed to chicks from ALV shedding dams. The study included four lines, each segregating for one ev gene, one line free of ev genes, and four commercial stocks segregating for a number of ev genes. Genes ev12 and ev21 that produce the complete endogenous virus were associated with significant reductions in antibody response to ALV. In commercial stocks with ev21 in all birds, both antibody response and ALV in oviducts were significantly influenced by the genomic background (stock). In one commercial stock, 37.6% of 133 birds with ev21 and only 5.8% of 120 birds without the gene were test-positive for virus in their oviducts at 180 days of age. No such differences were associated with ev1, ev3 or ev6 that do not produce complete endogenous virus. Thus, virus-producing ev genes were a predisposing factor for shedding ALV. 3achickens 3agenes 3aimmune response 3aoviducts 0apredisposition 0acongenital infection 0aavian oncovirus1 aSpencer, J.L.1 aBenkel, B.1 aGagnon, C.1 aEmsley, A.1 aKulenkamp, A.0 tAvian pathology.g1995 Dec., v. 24, no. 4 p.653-664x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794595084191053Available from publisher's Web site  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle03926naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100002100160245012800181300001800309500002400327520192300351650002502274650001802299650002502317650002602342650001602368650002102384650001902405650002202424650002002446650002602466650001802492650001702510650006002527650004802587650002502635650003002660650003802690650001602728650001002744650002902754650004402783650002402827650001902851650006102870650006302931650002602994650004903020700002403069700001703093700002103110773011503131852000903246856008103255655001203336IND4413424220221121054425.0081205e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441342422DNAL7 a188299812pmid7 a10.1104/pp.108.1284882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhandelwal, Abha10aArabidopsis Transcriptome Reveals Control Circuits Regulating Redox Homeostasis and the Role of an AP2 Transcription Factor  ap. 2050-2058.  aIncludes references  aSensors and regulatory circuits that maintain redox homeostasis play a central role in adjusting plant metabolism and development to changing environmental conditions. We report here control networks in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) that respond to photosynthetic stress. We independently subjected Arabidopsis leaves to two commonly used photosystem II inhibitors: high light (HL) and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU). Microarray analysis of expression patterns during the period of redox adjustment to these inhibitors reveals that 20% and 8% of the transcriptome are under HL and DCMU regulation, respectively. Approximately 6% comprise a subset of genes common to both perturbations, the redox responsive genes (RRGs). A redox network was generated in an attempt to identify genes whose expression is tightly coordinated during adjustment to homeostasis, using expression of these RRGs under HL conditions. Ten subnetworks were identified from the network. Hierarchal subclustering of subnetworks responding to the DCMU stress identified novel groups of genes that were tightly controlled while adjusting to homeostasis. Upstream analysis of the promoters of the genes in these clusters revealed different motifs for each subnetwork, including motifs that were previously identified with responses to other stresses, such as light, dehydration, or abscisic acid. Functional categorization of RRGs demonstrated involvement of genes in many metabolic pathways, including several families of transcription factors, especially those in the AP2 family. Using a T-DNA insertion in one AP2 transcription factor (redox-responsive transcription factor 1 [RRTF1]) from the RRGs, we showed that the genes predicted to be within the subnetwork containing RRTF1 were changed in this insertion line (Δrrtf1). Furthermore, Δrrtf1 showed greater sensitivity to photosynthetic stress compared to the wild type. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aabscisic acid 3abiochemical pathways 3aenvironmental factors 3ahomeostasis 3amultigene family 3aphotosystem II 3aplant development 3astress response 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome 3atransfer DNA 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aDiuronxpharmacology 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aHomeostasis 2aLight 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPhotosystem II Protein Complexxantagonists & inhibitors 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effectsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aStress, Physiological 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxphysiology.1 aElvitigala, Thanura1 aGhosh, Bijoy1 aQuatrano, Ralph.0 tPlant physiology.g2008 Dec., v. 148, no. 4 p.2050-2058dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.108.1284883Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03207naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164100001700181245015000198300001600348500001500364520097700379650002201356650002101378650001601399650001701415650002101432650005201453650001801505650002501523650002801548650001001576650002501586650001901611650001201630650002301642650001801665650004401683650001201727650002601739650001701765650002301782650001701805650004701822650006501869650001401934650004301948650006401991650001502055650002202070651001102092651001102103653001602114653002002130653002802150700001802178700001302196700001902209700002102228773007302249852000902322856008502331930003302416945002502449946001102474655001202485IND4397548520221121045032.0071106e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439754852DNAL7 a178994622pmid7 a10.1080/030794507015891422doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

RT-PCR results from samples from three affected flocks revealed that the three isolates were subtype B. Partial sequence analysis of the G glycoprotein gene confirmed that the samples belonged to subtype B and were not of the vaccine type. Comparison of nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the G gene of the three Brazilian aMPV samples with subtype B isolates from other countries revealed 95.1% to 96.1% identity. Nucleotide sequences showed 100% identity among the Brazilian subtype B samples and 95.6% identity with the subtype B vaccine strain used in Brazil. This work describes the circulation of subtype B aMPV in Brazil and discusses its importance in terms of disease epidemiology. 3adisease detection 3aOrthorubulavirus 3alaying hens 3aepidemiology 3apoultry diseases 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3alive vaccines 3aamino acid sequences 3apathogen identification 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aegg production 3astrains 3amicrobial genetics 3aglycoproteins 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 2aAnimals 2aChlorocebus aethiops. 2aChick Embryo 2aChickensxvirology 2aGenes, Viral 2aMetapneumovirusxclassificationxgenetics. 2aParamyxoviridae Infectionsxdiagnosisxveterinaryxvirology. 2aPhylogeny 2aPoultry Diseasesxdiagnosisxvirology. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aVero Cells 2aVirus Replication 3aBrazil 0aBrazil 0aRubulavirus 0avaccine strains 0amolecular sequence data1 aBrandao, P.E.1 aBuim, M.1 aVillarreal, L.1 aFerreira, A.J.P.0 tAvian pathology.g2007 Oct., v. 36, no. 5 p.383-387x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794507015891423Available from publisher's Web site  a20080311b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/12/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03513naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198100001700215245011100232300001600343500001500359520140600374650002101780650001701801650002601818650002601844650002901870650002301899650001701922650002501939650001001964650001301974650001101987650002301998650001602021650002002037650001202057650004002069650003302109650002702142650002502169650004102194650004202235650003202277650003202309651001202341653001602353653003202369653002802401653002502429653002802454653001202482700001802494700001902512700002002531700001602551773007302567852000902640856008502649930003302734945002502767946001102792655001202803IND4397548720221121044957.0071106e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439754872DNAL7 a178994642pmid7 a10.1080/030794507015891672doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCauwerts, K.10aHigh prevalence of tetracycline resistance in Enterococcus isolates from broilers carrying the erm(B) gene  ap. 395-399.  a2019-12-04  aA total of 73 isolates of Enterococcus spp. carrying the erm(B) gene were obtained from cloacal swabs of broiler chickens derived from 13 different farms in Belgium. The erm(B) gene encodes resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B antibiotics (MLS(B)). The isolates belonged to eight different species: Enterococcus avium (eight isolates), Enterococcus casseliflavus (11 isolates), Enterococcus cecorum (eight isolates), Enterococcus durans (seven isolates), Enterococcus faecalis (10 isolates), Enterococcus faecium (17 isolates), Enterococcus gallinarum (seven isolates) and Enterococcus hirae (five isolates). Acquired resistance to tetracycline was detected in 68 of the isolates, and in 62 of these it was associated with the presence of the resistance genes tet(L), tet(M), tet(O) or tet(S). In three E. faecium isolates that were phenotypically susceptible to tetracycline, tet(L) or tet(M) was present. The transposon integrase gene (int gene) of the Tn916/Tn1545 transposon family was detected in 18 of the 54 isolates that contained the tet(M) gene. It was concluded that acquired resistance to tetracycline antibiotics is often present in enterococci from poultry carrying the erm(B) gene. The use of tetracyclines in poultry may therefore co-select for resistance to MLS(B) antibiotics, which may be important as alternative therapy for enterococcal infections in humans. 3abroiler chickens 3atetracycline 3amacrolide antibiotics 3aantibiotic resistance 3amultiple drug resistance 3astrain differences 3aEnterococcus 3aartificial selection 3agenes 3agenotype 3acloaca 3amicrobial genetics 3atransposons 3agenetic markers 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aChickensxmicrobiology 2aCloacaxmicrobiology 2aDrug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial 2aEnterococcusxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aTetracyclinesxpharmacology 3aBelgium 0aantibiotics 0astreptogramin B antibiotics 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0alincosamide antibiotics 0astrains1 aDecostere, A.1 aGraef, E.M. de1 aHaesebrouck, F.1 aPasmans, F.0 tAvian pathology.g2007 Oct., v. 36, no. 5 p.395-399x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794507015891673Available from publisher's Web site  a20080311b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/12/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02186naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245007000167300001600237500002400253520117700277650001301454650001101467650001601478650001101494650001501505650002401520650001201544651001801556700003301574700002101607700002101628700002301649773009501672852000901767856004801776655001201824IND4431479120221120230838.0100115e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443147912DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-009-0520-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBocanegra, Emilia10aState of knowledge of coastal aquifer management in South America  ap. 261-267.  aIncludes references  aA comparative analysis of the existing hydrogeological and management information from 15 coastal aquifers in South America was performed in order to obtain insight into common features of the sub-continent coastal zones. Some knowledge from other areas has been incorporated. There is a very variable degree of knowledge and management practice, ranging from almost no data and no action (the most common case), to sound conceptual models about aquifer behaviour and comprehensive management actions such as relocation of abstractions, pumping brackish groundwater, and aquifer vulnerability mapping. Some common features are: intensive groundwater exploitation; lack of characterization studies to support resource planning and management; lack of monitoring networks; and the need for raising awareness within society and its involvement in resource planning and management action programmes. Quality and quantity problems arising in heavily populated areas associated with coastal aquifers in South America point to unsustainable groundwater development. The sustainable use of those aquifers must rely on adequate evaluation of aquifer characteristics and monitoring. 3aaquifers 3acoasts 3agroundwater 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aresource management 3asociety 3aSouth America1 aDa Silva, Gerson Cardoso Jr.1 aCustodio, Emilio1 aManzano, Marisol1 aMontenegro, Suzana0 tHydrogeology journal.g2010 Feb., v. 18, no. 1 p.261-267dSpringer-Verlagx1431-21747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-009-0520-5 7aarticle02376naa a2200433 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003400097040001800131100001800149245010000167300001600267520106500283650002501348650001101373650002501384650000801409650002201417650001201439650001101451650001201462650001001474650001201484650002001496650001601516651001701532653002501549653003801574653003401612653002901646773010801675852000901783856008401792939003301876945000801909946001301917655001201930991607518670742620221120180421.0831004e19830721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830088452DNAL7 a10.1093/jmedent/20.4.3652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShiffer, C.N.10aAggregation behavior of adult Cuterebra fontinella (Diptera: Cuterebridae) in Pennsylvania, USA  ap. 365-370.  aThe first eastern North American aggregation site reported for Cuterebra fontinella was discovered in Bradford Co., Pennsylvania, USA. Male flies established and patrolled territories within 3 different sections of an open Spiraea-grass-sedge meadow at the headwaters of an intermittent stream. During clement weather, daily morning flight activity was initiated at or above a shade temperature of 18.5 °C, but only after 1–2 min of bright sunlight, and continued for 1.5–2.0 h. When 18.5 °C was reached early in the morning, flight began 3.7–4.0 h after sunrise. Males chased conspecific flies and other intruding insects entering their territories; 1 male mated for 3 min with a female seized in the air over 1 territory. Patrol flights lasted 2–7 min between rests of similar duration, mostly on perches within 1.6 m of the ground. This behavior is quite similar to that observed for C. grisea at aggregation sites in western North America, and along with other evidence supports the view that C. grisea and C. fontinella are not distinct species. 3aCuterebra fontinella 3aadults 3aaggregation behavior 3aair 3aephemeral streams 3afemales 3aflight 3ainsects 3amales 3ameadows 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3aPennsylvania 0aBehavior, Arthropoda 0aCuterebra fontinella (Arthropoda) 0aCuterebra grisea (Arthropoda) 0aReproduction, Arthropoda0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1983 July 21, v. 20, no. 4 p.365-370wJournal:jnl45776x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/20.4.3653Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19831004c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle02463naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001500156245010000171300001600271520077000287650004601057650002401103650002101127650002101148650002301169650002101192650001201213650003701225650003301262650001201295650003301307650001001340650002901350650001701379650002401396650003401420650002601454650001701480650002101497650004001518653001501558653001401573653003801587653001401625653001401639700002001653773007801673852000901751856007801760930003301838945001301871946001301884655001201897IND2050731120221120180516.0960410e199510  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205073112DNAL7 a75497692pmid7 a10.1007/BF002983792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCucchi, A.10aSsp genes and spore osmotolerance in Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis and Bacillus sphaericus  ap. 228-233.  aIt was shown previously that spores and vegetative cells of Bacillus sphaericus (Bf) and Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) are very sensitive to osmotic variations. Since spore osmotolerance has been associated with their SASP (small acid soluble spore proteins) content coded by ssp genes, hybridization assays were performed with sspE and sspA genes from B. subtilis as probes and showed that Bti and Bf strains could lack an sspE-like gene. The B. subtilis sspE gene was then introduced into Bti 4Q2 strain; spores were obtained and showed a 65 to 650 times higher level of osmotolerance to NaCl, without affecting other important properties: hypoosmotic resistance in vegetative cells, spore UV resistance, and larvicidal activity against diptera larvae. 3aBacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis 3aBacillus sphaericus 3abacterial spores 3aosmotic pressure 3abacterial proteins 3astructural genes 2aAnimals 2aBacillus thuringiensisxgenetics 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aDiptera 2aGenes, Bacterialxphysiology 2aLarva 2aPest Control, Biological 2aSigma Factor 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSpores, Bacterialxphysiology 2aTranscription Factors 2aTransfection 2aUltraviolet Rays 2aWater-Electrolyte Balancexgenetics 0aproperties 0atolerance 0asmall acid soluble spore proteins 0asspe gene 0asspa gene1 aRivas, C.S. de.0 tCurrent microbiology.g1995 Oct., v. 31, no. 4 p.228-233x0343-86517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002983793Available from publisher's Web site  a19960503b19960510c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01733naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003400097040001800131100001700149245015300166300001600319520052200335650001400857650001500871650002000886650001400906650001900920650001100939650001500950650001100965650000900976653006900985653002101054700001701075773010801092852000901200856008401209939003301293945000801326946001301334655001201347991607517090742620221120165358.0831107e19821130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830098002DNAL7 a10.1093/jmedent/19.6.7482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarnes, A.M.10aObservations on the biting of humans by Euhoplopsyllus glacialis affinis (Siphonaptera: Pulicidae) and a review of its plague-transmission potential  ap. 748-749.  aThree separate instances are reported in which Euhoplopsyllus glacialis affinis, a flea parasitizing cottontails (Sylvilagus spp.), was found invading buildings and biting humans.

H. armigera egg cohorts were introduced inside predator-free and open control cages, and the impact of local predator populations on the cohort was examined. Fourteen days after inoculation, exclusion cages had four times more larvae than controls, indicating a strong impact of predation. Ants and Anthocoridae were the predominant predator groups. Exclusion cages had more damaged fruiting plant parts (squares, flowers and bolls) than the control. In the absence of predators, natural mortality of H. armigera was greater as cotton matured, and is likely to be linked to the host plant condition. 3aGossypium 3ainsect control 3abiological control agents 3anatural enemies 3apredators 0apredators of insect pests1 aCock, M.J.W.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g1993, v. 3, no. 4 p.491-497x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095831593093553043Available from publisher's Web site  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdLJS  aNon-US 7aarticle03427naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001400180245019500194300001600389520152300405650001301928650001601941650001301957650000901970650001001979650001901989650001302008650002102021650002702042650001902069650002302088650002802111650001702139650001802156650001402174650002002188650002902208650001202237650004002249650002802289650001902317650002702336650003102363650003702394650002702431650006402458650003202522650002402554650001702578650001202595700001802607773008402625852000902709930003302718945002502751946001302776655001202789IND4370219120221120130510.0050516e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437021912DNAL7 a158306842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLungu, B.10aFate of Listeria monocytogenes inoculated onto the surface of model turkey frankfurter pieces treated with zein coatings containing nisin, sodium diacetate, and sodium lactate at 4 degrees C  ap. 855-859.  aThe antimicrobial effects of zein coatings containing nisin, sodium lactate, and sodium diacetate against Listeria monocytogenes on turkey frankfurters at 4 degrees C were determined. Our objectives were to determine whether zein, nisin, lactate, and diacetate alone or in combination could control the growth of L. monocytogenes on full-fat turkey frankfurters at 4 degrees C and to determine whether lactate or diacetate had any synergistic effect on the activity of nisin. Turkey frankfurter pieces surface inoculated with L. monocytogenes strain V7 were treated with zein-ethanol-glycerol (ZEG), zein-propylene-glycol (ZPR), ethanol-glycerol (EG), propylene glycol (PR), nisin (N), sodium lactate (L), or sodium diacetate (D) alone or in combination. Over 28 days, treatment with N or D alone reduced L. monocytogenes counts on frankfurters by 6.6 or 6.3 log CFU/g, respectively. N-D treatment reduced L. monocytogenes by 6 log CFU/g. The zein solvents EG and PR reduced L. monocytogenes by about 5.6 and 5.2 log CFU/g, respectively, similar to the results obtained with ZEG and ZPR, which suggests that zein powder per se had no antimicrobial activity. After 28 days, ZEG-N-D, ZEG-N-D-L, ZPR-N-D, and ZPR-N-D-L yielded no detectable CFU. L alone was ineffective. No synergies were observed. N and D when used singly and the combinations of N-D, ZEG-N-D, ZEG-N-D-L, ZPR-N-D, ZPR-N-D-L, EG, and PR were effective as inhibitors of the growth of recontaminating L. monocytogenes cells on full-fat turkey frankfurters. 3ahot dogs 3aturkey meat 3acoatings 3azein 3anisin 3asodium acetate 3alactates 3ainoculum density 3aListeria monocytogenes 3afood pathogens 3afood contamination 3abacterial contamination 3afood storage 3arefrigeration 3asynergism 3aGRAS substances 3aantibacterial properties 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDrug Synergism 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Preservationxmethods 2aFood Preservativesxpharmacology 2aLactatesxpharmacology 2aListeria monocytogenesxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aMeat Productsxmicrobiology 2aNisinxpharmacology 2aTime Factors 2aTurkeys1 aJohnson, M.G.0 tJournal of food protection.g2005 Apr., v. 68, no. 4 p.855-859x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20050825b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/06/13  aOther US 7aarticle03248naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001500146245013400161300001600295500001500311520157700326650003101903650001801934650001901952650002101971650001301992650002002005650002002025650002102045650001902066650001202085650001402097650001202111650001202123650003902135650002802174650002502202650003302227650002902260650002202289650001102311650001002322650001502332650002402347651001102371651001902382653001602401653003002417700001902447700001602466773008402482852000902566930003302575945002502608946001302633655001202646IND4370216920221120120931.0050516e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437021692DNAL7 a158306782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLevsen, A.10aLow detection efficiency of candling as a commonly recommended inspection method for nematode larvae in the flesh of pelagic fish  ap. 828-832.  a2019-12-05  aThe third-stage larvae of the parasitic nematode Anisakis simplex commonly occur in most commercially important fish species from the North Atlantic. In this study, the occurrence and site distribution of Anisakis larvae in various size groups of Norwegian spring spawning herring (Clupea harengus), blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou), and mackerel (Scomber scombrus) from the Northeast Atlantic was investigated. Although most of the larvae were found in the abdominal cavity, the small proportion lodged in the flesh was sufficient to affect food quality and safety. However, the prevalence of Anisakis larvae in fish fillets varied considerably among the size groups of each species: 15 to 60% in herring, 32 to 77% in mackerel, and 89 to 100% in blue whiting. The commonly recommended nematode detection method in the fish processing industry is candling, i.e., a brief visual inspection on a light table. Comparison of successively more accurate detection methods, i.e., candling, enzymatic degradation, and UV illumination, for fillets of each fish species revealed that only 7 to 10% of the nematode larvae present in the fillets were detected by candling. The candling efficiency was apparently independent of fillet thickness. Thus, candling is not sufficient to detect the majority of the nematodes that are actually present in the fillets of pelagic fish from the Northeast Atlantic. These findings emphasize the importance of adequate deep-freezing of any fresh pelagic fish product, especially if it is intended for consumption in a raw or semiraw state. 3aCommon Agricultural Policy 3amuscle larvae 3aMicromesistius 3aAnisakis simplex 3amackerel 3aClupea harengus 3afood inspection 3aScomber scombrus 3afood pathogens 3awhiting 3adetection 3aherring 2aAnimals 2aAnisakisxisolation & purification 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aFishesxparasitology 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Inspectionxmethods 2aFood Parasitology 2aHumans 2aLarva 2aPrevalence 2aSpecies Specificity 3aNorway 3aAtlantic Ocean 0amethodology 0aMicromestistius poutassou1 aLunestad, B.T.1 aBerland, B.0 tJournal of food protection.g2005 Apr., v. 68, no. 4 p.828-832x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20050825b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/06/13  aOther US 7aarticle02529naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245015300165300001600318500001500334520133900349650001401688650001701702650003001719650002701749650001401776650002401790653003001814653003001844653002301874700002201897773008501919852000902004856008502013930003302098945001302131946001102144655001202155IND2061438820221120121101.0980122s1993    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206143882DNAL7 a10.1080/095831593093553002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaubscher, J.M.10aAssessment of aphid lethal paralysis virus as an apparent population growth-limiting factor in grain aphids in the presence of other natural enemies  ap. 455-466.  a2019-12-04  aThe influence of aphid lethal paralysis virus (ALPV), Rhopalosiphum padi virus (RhPV), natural enemies and fungal infection on the population growth of Rhopalosiphum padi and Sitobion avenae in the wheat fields of the Western Cape Province of South Africa was investigated at two sites. Time-specific life tables were compiled for R. padi at one site. During the logarithmic phase of the development of R. padi aphids, natural enemies were not present in high numbers and the apparent large-scale mortality observed appeared to be due to other causes. During the decline phase of this aphid population, the population size was reduced by 49%. This reduction coincided with a calculated high mortality of 70 aphids per plant. A dramatic decline in R. padi numbers and a high incidence of ALPV present in the aphid population was experienced during this period. Virus assays were carried out by double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) and an indirect immunofluorescent technique. Entomophthorales-type fungal infection of aphids also reacted its highest level during the decline phase, but at a later stage than ALPV infection, with a calculated level of 21 aphids per plant. This suggested that the presence of ALPV limited population development in R. padi. Similar results were obtained with S. avenae. 3aparasites 3ainsect pests 3abiological control agents 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3apredators 3apopulation dynamics 0apredators of insect pests 0aparasites of insect pests 0apopulation ecology1 aVon Wechmar, M.B.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g1993, v. 3, no. 4 p.455-466x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095831593093553003Available from publisher's Web site  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdLJS  aNon-US 7aarticle02178naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245014300160300001600303520116400319650001901483650003001502650003001532650003101562700001601593700001901609773008501628852000901713856008501722930003301807945001301840946001101853655001201864IND2061438720221120120929.0980122s1993    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206143872DNAL7 a10.1080/095831593093552992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaya, H.K.10aImpact of Bacillus popilliae, Rickettsiella popilliae and entomopathogenic nematodes on a population of the scarabaeid, Cyclocephala hirta  ap. 443-453.  aLarvae of the scarabaeid, Cyclocephala hirta, are major pests of turfgrass in California. A field test was conducted against third instars that included the following treatments: untreated control; chemical insecticide (bendiocarb): milky disease bacterium (Bacillus popilliae), and entomopathogenic nematodes (Steinernema feltiae and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora). There were no significant differences in population reduction among the treatments, but the larval population in all plots showed a dramatic decline. The C. hirta population had a natural occurrence of milky disease and blue disease caused by Rickettsiella popilliae. The prevalence of blue disease during the course of the study averaged < 10% but that of milky disease averaged about 20%. More significantly, the soil from all treatment plots when bioassayed for B. popilliae showed that 67-90% of the larvae became infected with this bacterium. None of the larvae became infected with the blue disease organism. We conclude that B. popilliae was occurring in epizootic proportions in our field tests and was a significant mortality factor in causing the decline of the C. hirta population. 3ainsect control 3abiological control agents 3aentomopathogenic bacteria 3aentomopathogenic nematodes1 aKlein, M.G.1 aBurlando, T.M.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g1993, v. 3, no. 4 p.443-453x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095831593093552993Available from publisher's Web site  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdLJS  aNon-US 7aarticle02034naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245011000167300001600277500001500293520100800308650001901316650003001335650002001365650001401385653003001399653001501429700001601444773008501460852000901545856008501554930003301639945001301672946001101685655001201696IND2061439220221120105614.0980122s1993    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206143922DNAL7 a10.1080/095831593093553012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Masurier, A.D.12aA comparison of attack rates in a native and an introduced population of the parasitoid Cotesia glomerata  ap. 467-474.  a2019-12-04  aThe attack rate of a population of the braconid parasitoid Cotesia glomerata, introduced into the USA over 100 years ago as a parasitoid of Pieris rapae, was compared with that of a native British population, which normally attacks P. brassicae, and with that of a P. rapae specialist, Cotesia rubecula. British C. glomerata attacked P. brassicae at a much higher rate than it attacked P. rapae. In comparison with British C. glomerata. C. rubecula showed a higher attack rate with P. rapae. American C. glomerata attacked P. rapae at a slightly higher rate than did British C. glomerata, but not at as high a rate as that achieved by C. rubecula. The differences in each comparison were statistically significant. The possible causes of the differences between British and American C. glomerata attacking P. rapae are discussed. They may be due to genetic or environmental effects. Egg load did not appear to be a factor limiting the number of hosts parasitized under the conditions of the experiments. 3ainsect control 3abiological control agents 3anatural enemies 3aparasites 0aparasites of insect pests 0aadaptation1 aWaage, J.K.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g1993, v. 3, no. 4 p.467-474x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095831593093553013Available from publisher's Web site  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdLJS  aNon-US 7aarticle02453naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002300141245011800164300001600282520102900298650002101327650001801348650002501366650001401391650001501405650002401420650001601444650001401460650004301474650003501517650003401552650003601586700002001622700001801642700002301660700002301683700002401706700002001730700001401750700001501764773007001779852000901849856008101858930003301939946001101972655001201983IND4392805520221120083857.0070701e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439280552DNAL7 a10.1093/glycob/cwm0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aImaizumi, Tadaatsu10aDouble-stranded RNA induces galectin-9 in vascular endothelial cells: involvement of TLR3, PI3K, and IRF3 pathway  ap. 12C-15C.  aGalectin-9 is a member of the galectin family, which induces various biological reactions such as chemotaxis of eosinophils and apoptosis of T cells. We previously reported that polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly IC), an authentic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), induces the expression of galectin-9 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In the present study, we addressed the possible involvement of two potential receptors for dsRNA, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 and retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I), in the expression of galectin-9 in HUVECs. Poly IC-induced galectin-9 expression was almost completely suppressed by RNA interference (RNAi) against TLR3, but not against RIG-I. LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), inhibited the induction of galectin-9 by poly IC. RNAi against interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) also inhibited poly IC-induced galectin-9 expression. We conclude that TLR3, PI3K, and IRF3 are involved in the poly IC-induced galectin-9 expression in HUVECs. 3aRNA interference 3aT-lymphocytes 3aToll-like receptor 3 3aapoptosis 3achemotaxis 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aeosinophils 3agalectins 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ainterferon regulatory factor-3 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3apolyinosinic-polycytidylic acid1 aYoshida, Hidemi1 aNishi, Nozomu1 aSashinami, Hiroshi1 aNakamura, Takanori1 aHirashima, Mitsuomi1 aOhyama, Chikara1 aItoh, Ken1 aSatoh, Kei0 tGlycobiology.g2007 July, v. 17, no. 7 p.12C-15Cx0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwm0453Available from publisher's Web site  a20070701b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle
